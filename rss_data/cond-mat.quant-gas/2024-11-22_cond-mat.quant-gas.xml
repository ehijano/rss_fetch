      <title>Variational approach to the dynamics of dissipative quantum impurity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments with quantum simulators using ultracold atoms and superconducting qubits have demonstrated the potential of controlled dissipation as a versatile tool for realizing correlated many-body states. However, determining the dynamics of dissipative quantum many-body systems remains a significant analytical and numerical challenge. In this work, we focus on a dissipative impurity problem as a testbed for new methodological developments. We introduce an efficient non-perturbative framework that combines the superposition of Gaussian states (SGS) variational ansatz with the quantum trajectory approach to simulate open systems featuring a dissipative impurity. Applying this method to a spinful impurity subject to two-body losses and embedded in a bath of noninteracting fermions, we explore the full crossover from weak to strong dissipation regimes. The non-perturbative nature of the SGS ansatz allows us to thoroughly examine this crossover, providing comprehensive insights into the system's behavior. In the strong dissipation regime, our approach reproduces the finding that localized two-body losses can induce the Kondo effect [arXiv:2406.03527], characterized by a slowdown of spin relaxation and an enhancement of charge conductance. Furthermore, we reveal an exotic "reverse conductance" phenomenon at zero potential bias -- a counter-intuitive single-body effect resulting from intermediate dissipation and finite bandwidth. Finally, we investigate the formation of ferromagnetic domains and propose an extension to realize a higher-spin Kondo model using localized dissipation.</description>

      <title>Designing Atomtronic Circuits via Superfluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to design atomtronic circuits with Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in circuit-like traps that are controlled via mobile barriers. Using classical-field simulations, we demonstrate a universal set of logical gates and show how to assemble them into circuits. We first demonstrate an AND gate based on a T-shaped BEC, utilizing a combination of mobile and static barriers. The mobile barriers provide the logical input of the gate, while the static barrier functions as a Josephson junction that generates the AND output of the gate via a density imbalance across the barrier. Next we show how to combine three AND gates into a circuit, with a design composed of two T-shapes and an H-shape. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use Josephson oscillations to create a NOT gate and combine it with an AND gate, thereby showcasing a universal set of gates and their assembly into circuits.</description>

      <title>Ground-state phase transitions in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate phase transitions of the ground state (GS) of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates under the combined action of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and gradient magnetic field. Introducing appropariate raising and lowering operators, we exactly solve the linear system. Analyzing the obtained energy spectrum, we conclude that simultaneous variation of the magnetic-field gradient and SOC strength leads to the transition of excited states into the GS. As a result, any excited state can transition to the GS, at appropriate values of the system's parameters. The nonlinear system is solved numerically, showing that the GS phase transition, similar to the one in the linear system, still exists under the action of the repulsive nonlinearity. In the case of weak attraction, a mixed state appears near the GS transition point, while the GS transitions into an edge state under the action of strong attractive interaction.</description>

      <title>Preparation and observation of anomalous counterpropagating edge states in a periodically driven optical Raman lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of real-space edge modes with ultracold atoms [Braun et al., Nat. Phys. 20, 1306 (2024)], we investigate the preparation and detection of anomalous counterpropagating edge states -- a defining feature of the anomalous Floquet valley-Hall (AFVH) phase -- in a two-dimensional periodically driven optical Raman lattice. Modeling the atomic cloud with a Gaussian wave packet state, we explore, both analytically and numerically, how the population of edge modes depends on the initial-state parameters. In particular, we reveal that, in addition to the internal spin state, the initial momenta parallel and perpendicular to the boundary play essential roles: they independently control the selective population of edge states across distinct momenta and within separate quasienergy gaps. Furthermore, we examine the wave-packet dynamics of counterpropagating edge states and demonstrate that their characteristic motion is robust against long-range disorder. These results establish a theoretical framework for future experimental explorations of the AFVH phase and topological phenomena associated with its unique edge modes.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of Vortices in Quasi-2D Scalar Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, vortex-vortex interactions approximately vary with the logarithm of the inter-vortex distance, making it possible to describe an ensemble of vortices as a Coulomb gas. We introduce a duality between vortices in a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) scalar Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and effective Maxwell's electrodynamics. Specifically, we address the general scenario of inhomogeneous, time-dependent BEC number density with dissipation or rotation. Starting from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which describes the mean-field dynamics of a quasi-2D scalar BEC without dissipation, we show how to map vortices in a quasi-2D scalar BEC to 2D electrodynamics beyond the point-vortex approximation, even when dissipation is present or in a rotating system. The physical meaning of this duality is discussed.</description>

      <title>Emergent disorder and sub-ballistic dynamics in quantum simulations of the Ising model using Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays with Van der Waals interactions provide a controllable path to simulate the locally connected transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), a prototypical model in statistical mechanics. Remotely operating the publicly accessible Aquila Rydberg atom array, we experimentally investigate the physics of TFIM far from equilibrium and uncover significant deviations from the theoretical predictions. Rather than the expected ballistic spread of correlations, the Rydberg simulator exhibits a sub-ballistic spread, along with a logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy in time - all while the system mostly retains its initial magnetization. By modeling the atom motion in tweezer traps, we trace these effects to an emergent natural disorder in Rydberg atom arrays, which we characterize with a minimal random spin model. We further experimentally explore the different dynamical regimes hosted in the system by varying the lattice spacing and the Rabi frequency. Our findings highlight the crucial role of atom motion in the many-body dynamics of Rydberg atom arrays at the TFIM limit, and propose simple benchmark measurements to test for its presence in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch self-energy of dissipative interacting fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect describes the phenomenon of exponential localization of single-particle eigenstates near the boundary of the system. We explore its generalization to the many-body regime by investigating interacting fermions in open quantum systems. Therein, the elementary excitations from the ``vacuum'' (steady state) are given by two types of dissipative quasi-particles composed of single-fermion operators. We perturbatively calculate the self-energy of these quasi-particles in the presence of interactions, and utilize the non-Bloch band theory to develop an exact integral formula, which is further simplified by imposing complex momentum conservation. The formula allows calculating the Liouvillian gap modified by interactions with high precision, as demonstrated by comparison to numerical results. Furthermore, our results show that interactions can even enhance the non-reciprocity of fermion hoppings, contrary to the conventional viewpoint from the Pauli exclusion principle. Our formulation provides a quantitative tool for investigating dissipative interacting fermions with non-Hermitian skin effect, and generalizes the Fermi liquid theory to open quantum systems in the context of diagrammatic perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Formation of nonlinear modes in one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattices with a mobility edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of steady states in one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates of repulsively interacting ultracold atoms loaded into a quasiperiodic potential created by two incommensurate periodic lattices. We study the transformations between linear and nonlinear modes and describe the general patterns that govern the birth of nonlinear modes emerging in spectral gaps near band edges. We show that nonlinear modes in a symmetric potential undergo both symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcations and saddle-node bifurcations, mimicking the prototypical behaviors of symmetric and asymmetric double-well potentials. The properties of the nonlinear modes differ for bifurcations occurring below and above the mobility edge. In the generic case, when the quasiperiodic potential consists of two incommensurate lattices with a nonzero phase shift between them, the formation of localized modes in the spectral gaps occurs through a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations. Because of the analogy between the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, our results can also be applied to optical modes guided by quasiperiodic photonic lattices.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for a class of quantum models of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum models of interacting bosons have wide range of applications, among them the propagation of optical modes in nonlinear media, such as the $k$-photon down conversion. Many of such models are related to nonlinear deformations of finite group algebras, thus, in this sense, they are exactly solvable. Whereas the advanced group-theoretic methods have been developed to study the eigenvalue spectrum of exactly solvable Hamiltonians, in quantum optics the prime interest is not the spectrum of the Hamiltonian, but the evolution of an initial state, such as the generation of optical signal modes by a strong pump mode propagating in a nonlinear medium. I propose a simple and general method of derivation of the solution to such a state evolution problem, applicable to a wide class of quantum models of interacting bosons. For the $k$-photon down conversion model and its generalizations, the solution to the state evolution problem is given in the form of an infinite series expansion in the powers of propagation time with the coefficients defined by a recursion relation with a single polynomial function, unique for each nonlinear model. As an application, I compare the exact solution to the parametric down conversion process with the semiclassical parametric approximation.</description>

      <title>Full counting statistics after quantum quenches as hydrodynamic fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistics of fluctuations on large regions of space encodes universal properties of many-body systems. At equilibrium, it is described by thermodynamics. However, away from equilibrium such as after quantum quenches, the fundamental principles are more nebulous. In particular, although exact results have been conjectured in integrable models, a correct understanding of the physics is largely missing. In this letter, we explain these principles, taking the example of the number of particles lying on a large interval in one-dimensional interacting systems. These are based on simple hydrodynamic arguments from the theory of ballistically transported fluctuations, and in particular the Euler-scale transport of long-range correlations. Using these principles, we obtain the full counting statistics (FCS) in terms of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities, whose validity depends on the structure of hydrodynamic modes. In fermionic-statistics interacting integrable models with a continuum of hydrodynamic modes, such as the Lieb-Liniger model for cold atomic gases, the formula reproduces previous conjectures, but is in fact not exact: it gives the correct cumulants up to, including, order 5, while long-range correlations modify higher cumulants. In integrable and non-integrable models with two or less hydrodynamic modes, the formula is expected to give all cumulants.</description>

      <title>Insulator phases of Bose-Fermi mixtures induced by intraspecies next-neighbor interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05594v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional mixture of two-color fermions and scalar bosons at the hardcore limit, focusing on the effect that the intraspecies next-neighbor interactions have on the zero-temperature ground state of the system for different fillings of each carrier. Exploring the problem's parameters, we observed that the non-local interaction could favor or harm the well-known mixed Mott and spin-selective Mott insulators. We also found the emergence of three unusual insulating states with charge density wave (CDW) structures in which the orders of the carriers are out of phase with each other. For instance, the immiscible CDW appears only at half-filling bosonic density, whereas the mixed CDW state is characterized by equal densities of bosons and fermions. Finally, the spin-selective CDW couples the bosons and only one kind of fermions. Appropriate order parameters were proposed for each phase to obtain the critical parameters for the corresponding superfluid-insulator transition. Our results can inspire or contribute to understanding experiments in cold-atom setups with long-range interactions or recent reports involving quasiparticles in semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Exact semiclassical dynamics of generic Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model is paradigmatic to study quantum phase transition in equilibrium or non-equilibrium systems and entanglement dynamics for a variety of disciplines. In thermodynamics limit, quantum fluctuations are negligible, its semiclassical dynamics in presence of only one nonlinear couplings, as a good benchmark to study quantum fluctuation in finite-size system, can be well obtained in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions. In this work, we extend this semiclassical analysis into the regime where both nonlinear interactions are present, and successfully obtain its exact solutions of semiclassical equations by constructing an auxiliary function that is a linear combination of the $y$ and $z$ component of the classical spin in thermodynamic limit. Taking implementation of Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model in a Bose-Einstein condensate setup as an example, we figure out all classical dynamical modes, specially find out mesoscopic self-trapping mode in population and phase-difference space even persists in presence of both nonlinear couplings. Our results would be useful to analyze dynamical phase transitions and entanglement dynamics of Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model in presence of both nonlinear couplings.</description>

Abstract: We measure universal temperature-independent density shifts for the thermal conductivity $\kappa_T$ and shear viscosity $\eta$, relative to the high temperature limits, for a normal phase unitary Fermi gas confined in a box potential. We show that a time-dependent kinetic theory model enables extraction of the hydrodynamic transport times $\tau_\eta$ and $\tau_\kappa$ from the time-dependent free-decay of a spatially periodic density perturbation, yielding the static transport properties and density shifts, corrected for finite relaxation times.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the dynamics of Tonks-Girardeau (TG) gases in a harmonic potential driven by Gaussian pulse, which is a correspondence of the excitation dynamics of electrons in matters driven by ultrashort laser pulse. The evolving dynamics of TG gas are obtained with Bose-Fermi mapping method combined with the numerical techniques. We calculate the evolving dynamics of occupation distribution of single-particle energy levels, density distribution and momentum distribution of the system. It is shown that the system arrived at a dynamically stable state at the end of driving. At high-frequency regime TG gases return back to ground state while at low-frequency regime the population inversion exhibits and all atoms occupy high levels.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the quantum hall effect, we study N two dimensional interacting fermions in a large magnetic field limit. We work in a bounded domain, ensuring finite degeneracy of the Landau levels. In our regime, several levels are fully filled and inert: the density in these levels is constant. We derive a limiting mean-field and semi classical description of the physics in the last, partially filled Landau level.</description>

      <title>Directly observing replica symmetry breaking in a vector quantum-optical spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04216</link>

Abstract: Spin glasses are quintessential examples of complex matter. Although much about their order remains uncertain, abstract models of them inform, e.g., the classification of combinatorial optimization problems, the magnetic ordering in metals with impurities, and artificial intelligence -- where they form a mathematical basis for neural network computing and brain modeling. We demonstrate the ability of an active quantum gas microscope to realize a spin glass of a novel driven-dissipative and vector form. By microscopically visualizing its glassy spin states, the technique allows us to directly measure replica symmetry breaking and the resulting ultrametric hierarchical structure. Ultrametricity is known to be emergent in models of evolution, protein folding, climate change, and infinite-range equilibrium spin glasses; this work shows it to be directly observable in a physically realized system.</description>

      <title>Temporal Bell inequalities in non-relativistic many-body physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing the spreading of information in many-body systems is crucial to understanding their quantum dynamics. At the most fundamental level, this task is accomplished by Bell inequalities, whose violation by quantum mechanics implies that information cannot always be stored locally. While Bell-like inequalities, such as the one of Clauser and Horne, envisage a situation in which two parties perform measurements on systems at different positions, one could formulate temporal inequalities, in which the two parties measure at different times. However, for causally-connected parties, these extensions are compatible with local hidden-variable theories, so that no intrinsically-quantum information spreading occurs in such temporal correlations. Here we show that a temporal Clauser-Horne inequality for two spins is violated for a nonzero time interval between the measurements if the two measured parties are connected by a spin chain. The chain constitutes a medium for the spreading of quantum information, which prevents the immediate signaling and thus the deterministic time evolution after the first measurement. Our result suggests that, as expected in a many-body setup, the Lieb-Robinson bound substitutes the speed of light as the fundamental limit for the spreading of information.</description>

      <title>Extractable energy from quantum superposition of current states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the energy content of superpositions of current states. Specifically, we focus on the maximum energy that can be extracted from them through local unitary transformations. The figure of merit we employ is the local ergotropy. We perform a complete analysis in the whole range of the system's parameters. This way, we prove that superpositions of two current states in spatially closed spin networks are characterized by specific peaks in extractable energy, generally overcoming the ergotropy of each of the two separate current states characterized by a single winding number. The many-body state dynamics entails to ergotropy evolving in a controlled fashion. The implementation we suggest is based on a Rydberg-atom platform. Optimal transformations able to extract locally the maximum possible amount of energy are sorted out.</description>

      <title>Many-body nonequilibrium dynamics in a self-induced Floquet system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet systems are periodically driven systems. In this framework, the system Hamiltonian and associated spectra of interest are modified, giving rise to new quantum phases of matter and nonequilibrium dynamics without static counterparts. Here we experimentally demonstrate a self-induced Floquet system in the interacting Rydberg gas. This originates from the photoionization of thermal Rydberg gases in a static magnetic field. Importantly, by leveraging the Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency spectrum, we probe the nonequilibrium dynamics in the bistable regime and identify the emergence of a discrete time crystalline phase. Our work fills the experimental gap in the understanding the relation of multistability and dissipative discrete time crystalline phase. In this regard, it constitutes a highly controlled platform for exploring exotic nonequilibrium physics in dissipative interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Critical states exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The critical states of disordered systems are intriguing subjects within the realm of condensed matter physics and complex systems. These states manifest in materials where disorder plays a significant role, and are distinguished by their multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, accurately characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge. In this study, we argue that critical states exhibit a certain invariance in both position and momentum spaces, leading to their delocalization in both domains. More specifically, it is expected that typical physical quantities characterizing critical states, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, should exhibit invariance in both position space and momentum space. Subsequent numerical simulations validate the correctness of this invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.</description>

      <title>Simulating the two-dimensional $t-J$ model at finite doping with neural quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating large, strongly interacting fermionic systems remains a major challenge for existing numerical methods. In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</description>

      <title>Ab-Initio Approach to Many-Body Quantum Spin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental longstanding problem in studying spin models is the efficient and accurate numerical simulation of the long-time behavior of larger systems. The exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the entanglement accumulation at long times pose major challenges for current methods. To address these issues, we employ the multilayer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) framework to simulate the many-body spin dynamics of the Heisenberg model in various settings, including the Ising and XYZ limits with different interaction ranges and random couplings. Benchmarks with analytical and exact numerical approaches show that ML-MCTDH accurately captures the time evolution of one- and two-body observables in both one- and two-dimensional lattices. A comparison of ML-MCTDH with the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) demonstrates that our approach excels in handling anisotropic models and consistently provides better results for two-point observables in all simulation instances. Our results indicate that the multilayer structure of ML-MCTDH is a promising numerical framework for handling the dynamics of generic many-body spin systems.</description>
