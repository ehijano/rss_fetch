      <title>High-Performance Data Format for Scientific Data Storage and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07666v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present the High-Performance Output (HiPO) data format developed at Jefferson Laboratory for storing and analyzing data from Nuclear Physics experiments. The format was designed to efficiently store large amounts of experimental data, utilizing modern fast compression algorithms. The purpose of this development was to provide organized data in the output, facilitating access to relevant information within the large data files. The HiPO data format has features that are suited for storing raw detector data, reconstruction data, and the final physics analysis data efficiently, eliminating the need to do data conversions through the lifecycle of experimental data. The HiPO data format is implemented in C++ and JAVA, and provides bindings to FORTRAN, Python, and Julia, providing users with the choice of data analysis frameworks to use. In this paper, we will present the general design and functionalities of the HiPO library and compare the performance of the library with more established data formats used in data analysis in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (such as ROOT and Parquete).</description>

      <title>Bayesian estimation of coupling strength and heterogeneity in a coupled oscillator model from macroscopic quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various macroscopic oscillations, such as the heartbeat and the flushing of fireflies, are created by synchronizing oscillatory units (oscillators). To elucidate the mechanism of synchronization, several coupled oscillator models have been devised and extensively analyzed. Although parameter estimation of these models has also been actively investigated, most of the proposed methods are based on the data from individual oscillators, not from macroscopic quantities. In the present study, we propose a Bayesian framework to estimate the model parameters of coupled oscillator models, using the time series data of the Kuramoto order parameter as the only given data. We adopt the exchange Monte Carlo method for the efficient estimation of the posterior distribution and marginal likelihood. Numerical experiments are performed to confirm the validity of our method and examine the dependence of the estimation error on the observational noise and system size.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional (3D) tensor-based methodology for characterizing 3D anisotropic thermal conductivity tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of advanced materials with anisotropic thermal properties necessitates more generic and efficient methods to determine three-dimensional (3D) anisotropic thermal conductivity tensors with up to six independent components. Current methods rely on a vector-based framework that can handle only up to four independent components, often leading to inefficiencies and inaccuracies. We introduce Three-Dimensional Spatially Resolved Lock-In Micro-Thermography (3D SR-LIT), a novel optical thermal characterization technique combining a 3D tensor-based framework with an efficient area-detection experimental system. For simple tensors (e.g., x-cut quartz, k_xz=k_yz=0), our method reduces uncertainty by over 50% compared to vector-based methods. For complex tensors with six independent components (e.g., AT-cut quartz), 2{\sigma} uncertainties remain below 12% for all components. A novel adaptive mapping approach enables high-throughput data acquisition (40 seconds to 3 minutes, depending on tensor complexity), over 35 times faster than current methods, and accommodates samples with 200 nm surface roughness. Extensive numerical validation on 1,000 arbitrary anisotropic tensors ranging from 1 to 1,000 Wm^(-1) K^(-1) further validates the robustness of this methodology. This work highlights significant advancements in thermal characterization of complex anisotropic materials.</description>

      <title>Avoiding subtraction and division of stochastic signals using normalizing flows: NFdeconvolve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Across the scientific realm, we find ourselves subtracting or dividing stochastic signals. For instance, consider a stochastic realization, $x$, generated from the addition or multiplication of two stochastic signals $a$ and $b$, namely $x=a+b$ or $x = ab$. For the $x=a+b$ example, $a$ can be fluorescence background and $b$ the signal of interest whose statistics are to be learned from the measured $x$. Similarly, when writing $x=ab$, $a$ can be thought of as the illumination intensity and $b$ the density of fluorescent molecules of interest. Yet dividing or subtracting stochastic signals amplifies noise, and we ask instead whether, using the statistics of $a$ and the measurement of $x$ as input, we can recover the statistics of $b$. Here, we show how normalizing flows can generate an approximation of the probability distribution over $b$, thereby avoiding subtraction or division altogether. This method is implemented in our software package, NFdeconvolve, available on GitHub with a tutorial linked in the main text.</description>

      <title>SeeBand: A highly efficient, interactive tool for analyzing electronic transport data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linking the fundamental physics of band structure and scattering theory with macroscopic features such as measurable bulk thermoelectric transport properties is indispensable to a thorough understanding of transport phenomena and ensures more targeted and efficient experimental research. Here, we introduce SeeBand, a highly efficient and interactive fitting tool based on Boltzmann transport theory. A fully integrated user interface and visualization tool enable real-time comparison and connection between the electronic band structure (EBS) and microscopic transport properties. It allows simultaneous analysis of data for the Seebeck coefficient $S$, resistivity $\rho$ and Hall coefficient $R_\text{H}$ to identify suitable EBS models and extract the underlying microscopic material parameters and additional information from the model. Crucially, the EBS can be obtained by directly fitting the temperature-dependent properties of a single sample, which goes beyond previous approaches that look into doping dependencies. Finally, the combination of neural-network-assisted initial guesses and an efficient subsequent fitting routine allows for a rapid processing of big datasets, facilitating high-throughput analyses to identify underlying, yet undiscovered dependencies, thereby guiding material design.</description>

      <title>Neural network biased corrections: Cautionary study in background corrections for quenched jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jets clustered from heavy ion collision measurements combine a dense background of particles with those actually resulting from a hard partonic scattering. The background contribution to jet transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) may be corrected by subtracting the collision average background; however, the background inhomogeneity limits the resolution of this correction. Many recent studies have embedded jets into heavy ion backgrounds and demonstrated a markedly improved background correction is achievable by using neural networks (NNs) trained with aspects of jet substructure which are used to map measured jet $p_\mathrm{T}$ to the embedded truth jet $p_\mathrm{T}$. However, jet quenching in heavy ion collisions modifies jet substructure, and correspondingly biases the NNs' background corrections. This study investigates those biases by using simulations of jet quenching in central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200\;\mathrm{GeV}/c$ with hydrodynamically modeled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) evolution. To demonstrate the magnitude of the effect of such biases in measurement, a leading jet nuclear modification factor ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) is calculated and reported using the NN background correction on jets quenched utilizing a brick of QGP.</description>

      <title>Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity: a Bayesian mean-field framework for epidemic inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity (SCDC) method, a novel generalized mean-field approximation for epidemic inference and risk assessment within a fully Bayesian framework. SCDC accounts for non-causal effects of observations and uses a graphical model representation of epidemic processes to derive self-consistent equations for edge probability marginals. A small-coupling expansion yields time-dependent cavity messages capturing individual infection probabilities and observational conditioning. With linear computational cost per iteration in the epidemic duration, SCDC is particularly efficient and valid even for recurrent epidemic processes, where standard methods are exponentially complex. Tested on synthetic networks, it matches Belief Propagation in accuracy and outperforms individual-based mean-field methods. Notably, despite being derived as a small-infectiousness expansion, SCDC maintains good accuracy even for relatively large infection probabilities. While convergence issues may arise on graphs with long-range correlations, SCDC reliably estimates risk. Future extensions include non-Markovian models and higher-order terms in the dynamic cavity framework.</description>
