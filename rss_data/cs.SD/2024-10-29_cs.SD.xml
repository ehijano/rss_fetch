      <title>An approach to hummed-tune and song sequences matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Melody stuck in your head, also known as "earworm", is tough to get rid of, unless you listen to it again or sing it out loud. But what if you can not find the name of that song? It must be an intolerable feeling. Recognizing a song name base on humming sound is not an easy task for a human being and should be done by machines. However, there is no research paper published about hum tune recognition. Adapting from Hum2Song Zalo AI Challenge 2021 - a competition about querying the name of a song by user's giving humming tune, which is similar to Google's Hum to Search. This paper covers details about the pre-processed data from the original type (mp3) to usable form for training and inference. In training an embedding model for the feature extraction phase, we ran experiments with some states of the art, such as ResNet, VGG, AlexNet, MobileNetV2. And for the inference phase, we use the Faiss module to effectively search for a song that matched the sequence of humming sound. The result comes at nearly 94\% in MRR@10 metric on the public test set, along with the top 1 result on the public leaderboard.</description>

      <title>Conditional GAN for Enhancing Diffusion Models in Efficient and Authentic Global Gesture Generation from Audios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-driven simultaneous gesture generation is vital for human-computer communication, AI games, and film production. While previous research has shown promise, there are still limitations. Methods based on VAEs are accompanied by issues of local jitter and global instability, whereas methods based on diffusion models are hampered by low generation efficiency. This is because the denoising process of DDPM in the latter relies on the assumption that the noise added at each step is sampled from a unimodal distribution, and the noise values are small. DDIM borrows the idea from the Euler method for solving differential equations, disrupts the Markov chain process, and increases the noise step size to reduce the number of denoising steps, thereby accelerating generation. However, simply increasing the step size during the step-by-step denoising process causes the results to gradually deviate from the original data distribution, leading to a significant drop in the quality of the generated actions and the emergence of unnatural artifacts. In this paper, we break the assumptions of DDPM and achieves breakthrough progress in denoising speed and fidelity. Specifically, we introduce a conditional GAN to capture audio control signals and implicitly match the multimodal denoising distribution between the diffusion and denoising steps within the same sampling step, aiming to sample larger noise values and apply fewer denoising steps for high-speed generation.</description>

      <title>MusicFlow: Cascaded Flow Matching for Text Guided Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MusicFlow, a cascaded text-to-music generation model based on flow matching. Based on self-supervised representations to bridge between text descriptions and music audios, we construct two flow matching networks to model the conditional distribution of semantic and acoustic features. Additionally, we leverage masked prediction as the training objective, enabling the model to generalize to other tasks such as music infilling and continuation in a zero-shot manner. Experiments on MusicCaps reveal that the music generated by MusicFlow exhibits superior quality and text coherence despite being over $2\sim5$ times smaller and requiring $5$ times fewer iterative steps. Simultaneously, the model can perform other music generation tasks and achieves competitive performance in music infilling and continuation. Our code and model will be publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementations of popular symbolic music generative models often differ significantly in terms of the libraries utilized and overall project structure. Therefore, directly comparing the methods or becoming acquainted with them may present challenges. To mitigate this issue we introduce Symbotunes, an open-source unified hub for symbolic music generative models. Symbotunes contains modern Python implementations of well-known methods for symbolic music generation, as well as a unified pipeline for generating and training.</description>

      <title>Automatic Estimation of Singing Voice Musical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Musical dynamics form a core part of expressive singing voice performances. However, automatic analysis of musical dynamics for singing voice has received limited attention partly due to the scarcity of suitable datasets and a lack of clear evaluation frameworks. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology for dataset curation. Employing the proposed methodology, we compile a dataset comprising 509 musical dynamics annotated singing voice performances, aligned with 163 score files, leveraging state-of-the-art source separation and alignment techniques. The scores are sourced from the OpenScore Lieder corpus of romantic-era compositions, widely known for its wealth of expressive annotations. Utilizing the curated dataset, we train a multi-head attention based CNN model with varying window sizes to evaluate the effectiveness of estimating musical dynamics. We explored two distinct perceptually motivated input representations for the model training: log-Mel spectrum and bark-scale based features. For testing, we manually curate another dataset of 25 musical dynamics annotated performances in collaboration with a professional vocalist. We conclude through our experiments that bark-scale based features outperform log-Mel-features for the task of singing voice dynamics prediction. The dataset along with the code is shared publicly for further research on the topic.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Unauthorized Speech Synthesis for Voice Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With just a few speech samples, it is possible to perfectly replicate a speaker's voice in recent years, while malicious voice exploitation (e.g., telecom fraud for illegal financial gain) has brought huge hazards in our daily lives. Therefore, it is crucial to protect publicly accessible speech data that contains sensitive information, such as personal voiceprints. Most previous defense methods have focused on spoofing speaker verification systems in timbre similarity but the synthesized deepfake speech is still of high quality. In response to the rising hazards, we devise an effective, transferable, and robust proactive protection technology named Pivotal Objective Perturbation (POP) that applies imperceptible error-minimizing noises on original speech samples to prevent them from being effectively learned for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis models so that high-quality deepfake speeches cannot be generated. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art (SOTA) TTS models utilizing objective and subjective metrics to comprehensively evaluate our proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate outstanding effectiveness and transferability across various models. Compared to the speech unclarity score of 21.94% from voice synthesizers trained on samples without protection, POP-protected samples significantly increase it to 127.31%. Moreover, our method shows robustness against noise reduction and data augmentation techniques, thereby greatly reducing potential hazards.</description>

      <title>An Ensemble Approach to Music Source Separation: A Comparative Analysis of Conventional and Hierarchical Stem Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music source separation (MSS) is a task that involves isolating individual sound sources, or stems, from mixed audio signals. This paper presents an ensemble approach to MSS, combining several state-of-the-art architectures to achieve superior separation performance across traditional Vocal, Drum, and Bass (VDB) stems, as well as expanding into second-level hierarchical separation for sub-stems like kick, snare, lead vocals, and background vocals. Our method addresses the limitations of relying on a single model by utilising the complementary strengths of various models, leading to more balanced results across stems. For stem selection, we used the harmonic mean of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR), ensuring that extreme values do not skew the results and that both metrics are weighted effectively. In addition to consistently high performance across the VDB stems, we also explored second-level hierarchical separation, revealing important insights into the complexities of MSS and how factors like genre and instrumentation can influence model performance. While the second-level separation results show room for improvement, the ability to isolate sub-stems marks a significant advancement. Our findings pave the way for further research in MSS, particularly in expanding model capabilities beyond VDB and improving niche stem separations such as guitar and piano.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Low-Complexity Acoustic Scene Classification via Distilling and Progressive Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of the acoustic scene classification (ASC) task is to classify recordings into one of the predefined acoustic scene classes. However, in real-world scenarios, ASC systems often encounter challenges such as recording device mismatch, low-complexity constraints, and the limited availability of labeled data. To alleviate these issues, in this paper, a data-efficient and low-complexity ASC system is built with a new model architecture and better training strategies. Specifically, we firstly design a new low-complexity architecture named Rep-Mobile by integrating multi-convolution branches which can be reparameterized at inference. Compared to other models, it achieves better performance and less computational complexity. Then we apply the knowledge distillation strategy and provide a comparison of the data efficiency of the teacher model with different architectures. Finally, we propose a progressive pruning strategy, which involves pruning the model multiple times in small amounts, resulting in better performance compared to a single step pruning. Experiments are conducted on the TAU dataset. With Rep-Mobile and these training strategies, our proposed ASC system achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results so far, while also winning the first place with a significant advantage over others in the DCASE2024 Challenge.</description>

      <title>Atrial Fibrillation Detection System via Acoustic Sensing for Mobile Phones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterized by irregular electrical impulses originating in the atria, which can lead to severe complications and even death. Due to the intermittent nature of the AF, early and timely monitoring of AF is critical for patients to prevent further exacerbation of the condition. Although ambulatory ECG Holter monitors provide accurate monitoring, the high cost of these devices hinders their wider adoption. Current mobile-based AF detection systems offer a portable solution, however, these systems have various applicability issues such as being easily affected by environmental factors and requiring significant user effort. To overcome the above limitations, we present MobileAF, a novel smartphone-based AF detection system using speakers and microphones. In order to capture minute cardiac activities, we propose a multi-channel pulse wave probing method. In addition, we enhance the signal quality by introducing a three-stage pulse wave purification pipeline. What's more, a ResNet-based network model is built to implement accurate and reliable AF detection. We collect data from 23 participants utilizing our data collection application on the smartphone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our system, with 97.9% accuracy, 96.8% precision, 97.2% recall, 98.3% specificity, and 97.0% F1 score.</description>

      <title>SepMamba: State-space models for speaker separation using Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based single-channel speaker separation has improved significantly in recent years largely due to the introduction of the transformer-based attention mechanism. However, these improvements come at the expense of intense computational demands, precluding their use in many practical applications. As a computationally efficient alternative with similar modeling capabilities, Mamba was recently introduced. We propose SepMamba, a U-Net-based architecture composed primarily of bidirectional Mamba layers. We find that our approach outperforms similarly-sized prominent models - including transformer-based models - on the WSJ0 2-speaker dataset while enjoying a significant reduction in computational cost, memory usage, and forward pass time. We additionally report strong results for causal variants of SepMamba. Our approach provides a computationally favorable alternative to transformer-based architectures for deep speech separation.</description>

      <title>ST-ITO: Controlling Audio Effects for Style Transfer with Inference-Time Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio production style transfer is the task of processing an input to impart stylistic elements from a reference recording. Existing approaches often train a neural network to estimate control parameters for a set of audio effects. However, these approaches are limited in that they can only control a fixed set of effects, where the effects must be differentiable or otherwise employ specialized training techniques. In this work, we introduce ST-ITO, Style Transfer with Inference-Time Optimization, an approach that instead searches the parameter space of an audio effect chain at inference. This method enables control of arbitrary audio effect chains, including unseen and non-differentiable effects. Our approach employs a learned metric of audio production style, which we train through a simple and scalable self-supervised pretraining strategy, along with a gradient-free optimizer. Due to the limited existing evaluation methods for audio production style transfer, we introduce a multi-part benchmark to evaluate audio production style metrics and style transfer systems. This evaluation demonstrates that our audio representation better captures attributes related to audio production and enables expressive style transfer via control of arbitrary audio effects.</description>

      <title>OmniSep: Unified Omni-Modality Sound Separation with Query-Mixup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling up has brought tremendous success in the fields of vision and language in recent years. When it comes to audio, however, researchers encounter a major challenge in scaling up the training data, as most natural audio contains diverse interfering signals. To address this limitation, we introduce Omni-modal Sound Separation (OmniSep), a novel framework capable of isolating clean soundtracks based on omni-modal queries, encompassing both single-modal and multi-modal composed queries. Specifically, we introduce the Query-Mixup strategy, which blends query features from different modalities during training. This enables OmniSep to optimize multiple modalities concurrently, effectively bringing all modalities under a unified framework for sound separation. We further enhance this flexibility by allowing queries to influence sound separation positively or negatively, facilitating the retention or removal of specific sounds as desired. Finally, OmniSep employs a retrieval-augmented approach known as Query-Aug, which enables open-vocabulary sound separation. Experimental evaluations on MUSIC, VGGSOUND-CLEAN+, and MUSIC-CLEAN+ datasets demonstrate effectiveness of OmniSep, achieving state-of-the-art performance in text-, image-, and audio-queried sound separation tasks.

      <description>arXiv:2410.19793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying auditory attention by comparing auditory stimuli and corresponding brain responses, is known as auditory attention decoding (AAD). The majority of AAD algorithms utilize the so-called envelope entrainment mechanism, whereby auditory attention is identified by how the envelope of the auditory stream drives variation in the electroencephalography (EEG) signal. However, neural processing can also be decoded based on endogenous cognitive responses, in this case, neural responses evoked by attention to specific words in a speech stream. This approach is largely unexplored in the field of AAD but leads to a single-word auditory attention decoding problem in which an epoch of an EEG signal timed to a specific word is labeled as attended or unattended. This paper presents a deep learning approach, based on EEGNet, to address this challenge. We conducted a subject-independent evaluation on an event-based AAD dataset with three different paradigms: word category oddball, word category with competing speakers, and competing speech streams with targets. The results demonstrate that the adapted model is capable of exploiting cognitive-related spatiotemporal EEG features and achieving at least 58% accuracy on the most realistic competing paradigm for the unseen subjects. To our knowledge, this is the first study dealing with this problem.</description>

      <title>Do Discrete Self-Supervised Representations of Speech Capture Tone Distinctions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete representations of speech, obtained from Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) foundation models, are widely used, especially where there are limited data for the downstream task, such as for a low-resource language. Typically, discretization of speech into a sequence of symbols is achieved by unsupervised clustering of the latents from an SSL model. Our study evaluates whether discrete symbols - found using k-means - adequately capture tone in two example languages, Mandarin and Yoruba. We compare latent vectors with discrete symbols, obtained from HuBERT base, MandarinHuBERT, or XLS-R, for vowel and tone classification. We find that using discrete symbols leads to a substantial loss of tone information, even for language-specialised SSL models. We suggest that discretization needs to be task-aware, particularly for tone-dependent downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Get Large Language Models Ready to Speak: A Late-fusion Approach for Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) with impressive performance across various text-based tasks. However, the extension of text-dominant LLMs to with speech generation tasks remains under-explored. In this work, we introduce a text-to-speech (TTS) system powered by a fine-tuned Llama model, named TTS-Llama, that achieves state-of-the-art speech synthesis performance. Building on TTS-Llama, we further propose MoLE-Llama, a text-and-speech multimodal LLM developed through purely late-fusion parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and a mixture-of-expert architecture. Extensive empirical results demonstrate MoLE-Llama's competitive performance on both text-only question-answering (QA) and TTS tasks, mitigating catastrophic forgetting issue in either modality. Finally, we further explore MoLE-Llama in text-in-speech-out QA tasks, demonstrating its great potential as a multimodal dialog system capable of speech generation.</description>

      <title>Using Confidence Scores to Improve Eyes-free Detection of Speech Recognition Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational systems rely heavily on speech recognition to interpret and respond to user commands and queries. Nevertheless, recognition errors may occur, which can significantly affect the performance of such systems. While visual feedback can help detect errors, it may not always be practical, especially for people who are blind or low-vision. In this study, we investigate ways to improve error detection by manipulating the audio output of the transcribed text based on the recognizer's confidence level in its result. Our findings show that selectively slowing down the audio when the recognizer exhibited uncertainty led to a relative increase of 12% in participants' error detection ability compared to uniformly slowing down the audio.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Approaches for Improving Detection of Unseen Speech Deepfakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current speech deepfake detection approaches perform satisfactorily against known adversaries; however, generalization to unseen attacks remains an open challenge. The proliferation of speech deepfakes on social media underscores the need for systems that can generalize to unseen attacks not observed during training. We address this problem from the perspective of meta-learning, aiming to learn attack-invariant features to adapt to unseen attacks with very few samples available. This approach is promising since generating of a high-scale training dataset is often expensive or infeasible. Our experiments demonstrated an improvement in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 21.67% to 10.42% on the InTheWild dataset, using just 96 samples from the unseen dataset. Continuous few-shot adaptation ensures that the system remains up-to-date.</description>

      <title>GPT-4o System Card</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GPT-4o is an autoregressive omni model that accepts as input any combination of text, audio, image, and video, and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs. It's trained end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network. GPT-4o can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time in conversation. It matches GPT-4 Turbo performance on text in English and code, with significant improvement on text in non-English languages, while also being much faster and 50\% cheaper in the API. GPT-4o is especially better at vision and audio understanding compared to existing models. In line with our commitment to building AI safely and consistent with our voluntary commitments to the White House, we are sharing the GPT-4o System Card, which includes our Preparedness Framework evaluations. In this System Card, we provide a detailed look at GPT-4o's capabilities, limitations, and safety evaluations across multiple categories, focusing on speech-to-speech while also evaluating text and image capabilities, and measures we've implemented to ensure the model is safe and aligned. We also include third-party assessments on dangerous capabilities, as well as discussion of potential societal impacts of GPT-4o's text and vision capabilities.</description>

      <title>Frequency-aware convolution for sound event detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In sound event detection (SED), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely employed to extract time-frequency (TF) patterns from spectrograms. However, the ability of CNNs to recognize different sound events is limited by their insensitivity to shifts of TF patterns along the frequency dimension, caused by translation equivariance. To address this issue, a model called frequency dynamic convolution (FDY) has been proposed, which involves applying specific convolution kernels to different frequency components. However, FDY requires a significantly larger number of parameters and computational resources compared to a standard CNN. This paper proposes a more efficient solution called frequency-aware convolution (FAC). FAC incorporates frequency positional information by encoding it in a vector, which is then explicitly added to the input spectrogram. To ensure that the amplitude of the encoding vector matches that of the input spectrogram, the encoding vector is adaptively and channel-dependently scaled using self-attention. To evaluate the effectiveness of FAC, we conducted experiments within the context of the DCASE 2023 task 4. The results show that FAC achieves comparable performance to FDY while requiring only an additional 515 parameters, whereas FDY necessitates an additional 8.02 million parameters. Furthermore, an ablation study confirms that the adaptive and channel-dependent scaling of the encoding vector is critical to the performance of FAC.</description>

      <title>Frieren: Efficient Video-to-Audio Generation Network with Rectified Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize content-matching audio from silent video, and it remains challenging to build V2A models with high generation quality, efficiency, and visual-audio temporal synchrony. We propose Frieren, a V2A model based on rectified flow matching. Frieren regresses the conditional transport vector field from noise to spectrogram latent with straight paths and conducts sampling by solving ODE, outperforming autoregressive and score-based models in terms of audio quality. By employing a non-autoregressive vector field estimator based on a feed-forward transformer and channel-level cross-modal feature fusion with strong temporal alignment, our model generates audio that is highly synchronized with the input video. Furthermore, through reflow and one-step distillation with guided vector field, our model can generate decent audio in a few, or even only one sampling step. Experiments indicate that Frieren achieves state-of-the-art performance in both generation quality and temporal alignment on VGGSound, with alignment accuracy reaching 97.22%, and 6.2% improvement in inception score over the strong diffusion-based baseline. Audio samples are available at http://frieren-v2a.github.io.</description>

      <title>Towards Open Respiratory Acoustic Foundation Models: Pretraining and Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Respiratory audio, such as coughing and breathing sounds, has predictive power for a wide range of healthcare applications, yet is currently under-explored. The main problem for those applications arises from the difficulty in collecting large labeled task-specific data for model development. Generalizable respiratory acoustic foundation models pretrained with unlabeled data would offer appealing advantages and possibly unlock this impasse. However, given the safety-critical nature of healthcare applications, it is pivotal to also ensure openness and replicability for any proposed foundation model solution. To this end, we introduce OPERA, an OPEn Respiratory Acoustic foundation model pretraining and benchmarking system, as the first approach answering this need. We curate large-scale respiratory audio datasets (~136K samples, over 400 hours), pretrain three pioneering foundation models, and build a benchmark consisting of 19 downstream respiratory health tasks for evaluation. Our pretrained models demonstrate superior performance (against existing acoustic models pretrained with general audio on 16 out of 19 tasks) and generalizability (to unseen datasets and new respiratory audio modalities). This highlights the great promise of respiratory acoustic foundation models and encourages more studies using OPERA as an open resource to accelerate research on respiratory audio for health. The system is accessible from https://github.com/evelyn0414/OPERA.</description>

      <title>FINALLY: fast and universal speech enhancement with studio-like quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of speech enhancement in real-world recordings, which often contain various forms of distortion, such as background noise, reverberation, and microphone artifacts. We revisit the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for speech enhancement and theoretically show that GANs are naturally inclined to seek the point of maximum density within the conditional clean speech distribution, which, as we argue, is essential for the speech enhancement task. We study various feature extractors for perceptual loss to facilitate the stability of adversarial training, developing a methodology for probing the structure of the feature space. This leads us to integrate WavLM-based perceptual loss into MS-STFT adversarial training pipeline, creating an effective and stable training procedure for the speech enhancement model. The resulting speech enhancement model, which we refer to as FINALLY, builds upon the HiFi++ architecture, augmented with a WavLM encoder and a novel training pipeline. Empirical results on various datasets confirm our model's ability to produce clear, high-quality speech at 48 kHz, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of speech enhancement.

      <title>Audio-Visual Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new multi-modal task, termed audio-visual instance segmentation (AVIS), which aims to simultaneously identify, segment and track individual sounding object instances in audible videos. To facilitate this research, we introduce a high-quality benchmark named AVISeg, containing over 90K instance masks from 26 semantic categories in 926 long videos. Additionally, we propose a strong baseline model for this task. Our model first localizes sound source within each frame, and condenses object-specific contexts into concise tokens. Then it builds long-range audio-visual dependencies between these tokens using window-based attention, and tracks sounding objects among the entire video sequences. Extensive experiments reveal that our method performs best on AVISeg, surpassing the existing methods from related tasks. We further conduct the evaluation on several multi-modal large models; however, they exhibits subpar performance on instance-level sound source localization and temporal perception. We expect that AVIS will inspire the community towards a more comprehensive multi-modal understanding.</description>

      <title>Double Mixture: Towards Continual Event Detection from Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech event detection is crucial for multimedia retrieval, involving the tagging of both semantic and acoustic events. Traditional ASR systems often overlook the interplay between these events, focusing solely on content, even though the interpretation of dialogue can vary with environmental context. This paper tackles two primary challenges in speech event detection: the continual integration of new events without forgetting previous ones, and the disentanglement of semantic from acoustic events. We introduce a new task, continual event detection from speech, for which we also provide two benchmark datasets. To address the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and effective disentanglement, we propose a novel method, 'Double Mixture.' This method merges speech expertise with robust memory mechanisms to enhance adaptability and prevent forgetting. Our comprehensive experiments show that this task presents significant challenges that are not effectively addressed by current state-of-the-art methods in either computer vision or natural language processing. Our approach achieves the lowest rates of forgetting and the highest levels of generalization, proving robust across various continual learning sequences. Our code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/status/Continual-SpeechED-6461.</description>

      <title>Images that Sound: Composing Images and Sounds on a Single Canvas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectrograms are 2D representations of sound that look very different from the images found in our visual world. And natural images, when played as spectrograms, make unnatural sounds. In this paper, we show that it is possible to synthesize spectrograms that simultaneously look like natural images and sound like natural audio. We call these visual spectrograms images that sound. Our approach is simple and zero-shot, and it leverages pre-trained text-to-image and text-to-spectrogram diffusion models that operate in a shared latent space. During the reverse process, we denoise noisy latents with both the audio and image diffusion models in parallel, resulting in a sample that is likely under both models. Through quantitative evaluations and perceptual studies, we find that our method successfully generates spectrograms that align with a desired audio prompt while also taking the visual appearance of a desired image prompt.

      <title>Style Mixture of Experts for Expressive Text-To-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in style transfer text-to-speech (TTS) have improved the expressiveness of synthesized speech. However, encoding stylistic information (e.g., timbre, emotion, and prosody) from diverse and unseen reference speech remains a challenge. This paper introduces StyleMoE, an approach that addresses the issue of learning averaged style representations in the style encoder by creating style experts that learn from subsets of data. The proposed method replaces the style encoder in a TTS framework with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer. The style experts specialize by learning from subsets of reference speech routed to them by the gating network, enabling them to handle different aspects of the style space. As a result, StyleMoE improves the style coverage of the style encoder for style transfer TTS. Our experiments, both objective and subjective, demonstrate improved style transfer for diverse and unseen reference speech. The proposed method enhances the performance of existing state-of-the-art style transfer TTS models and represents the first study of style MoE in TTS.</description>

      <title>On the Effect of Purely Synthetic Training Data for Different Automatic Speech Recognition Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we evaluate the utility of synthetic data for training automatic speech recognition (ASR). We use the ASR training data to train a text-to-speech (TTS) system similar to FastSpeech-2. With this TTS we reproduce the original training data, training ASR systems solely on synthetic data. For ASR, we use three different architectures, attention-based encoder-decoder, hybrid deep neural network hidden Markov model and a Gaussian mixture hidden Markov model, showing the different sensitivity of the models to synthetic data generation. In order to extend previous work, we present a number of ablation studies on the effectiveness of synthetic vs. real training data for ASR. In particular we focus on how the gap between training on synthetic and real data changes by varying the speaker embedding or by scaling the model size. For the latter we show that the TTS models generalize well, even when training scores indicate overfitting.</description>
