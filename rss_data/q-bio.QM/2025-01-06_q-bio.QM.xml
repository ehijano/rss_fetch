      <title>GAN-TAT: A Novel Framework Using Protein Interaction Networks in Druggable Gene Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying druggable genes is essential for developing effective pharmaceuticals. With the availability of extensive, high-quality data, computational methods have become a significant asset. Protein Interaction Network (PIN) is valuable but challenging to implement due to its high dimensionality and sparsity. Previous methods relied on indirect integration, leading to resolution loss. This study proposes GAN-TAT, a framework utilizing an advanced graph embedding technology, ImGAGN, to directly integrate PIN for druggable gene inference work. Tested on three Pharos datasets, GAN-TAT achieved the highest AUC-ROC score of 0.951 on Tclin. Further evaluation shows that GAN-TAT's predictions are supported by clinical evidence, highlighting its potential practical applications in pharmacogenomics. This research represents a methodological attempt with the direct utilization of PIN, expanding potential new solutions for developing drug targets. The source code of GAN-TAT is available at (https://github.com/george-yuanji-wang/GAN-TAT).</description>

      <title>Explainable Brain Age Gap Prediction in Neurodegenerative Conditions using coVariance Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain age is the estimate of biological age derived from neuroimaging datasets using machine learning algorithms. Increasing \textit{brain age gap} characterized by an elevated brain age relative to the chronological age can reflect increased vulnerability to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Hence, brain age gap is a promising biomarker for monitoring brain health. However, black-box machine learning approaches to brain age gap prediction have limited practical utility. Recent studies on coVariance neural networks (VNN) have proposed a relatively transparent deep learning pipeline for neuroimaging data analyses, which possesses two key features: (i) inherent \textit{anatomically interpretablity} of derived biomarkers; and (ii) a methodologically interpretable perspective based on \textit{linkage with eigenvectors of anatomic covariance matrix}. In this paper, we apply the VNN-based approach to study brain age gap using cortical thickness features for various prevalent neurodegenerative conditions. Our results reveal distinct anatomic patterns for brain age gap in Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and atypical Parkinsonian disorders. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the distinct anatomic patterns of brain age gap are linked with the differences in how VNN leverages the eigenspectrum of the anatomic covariance matrix, thus lending explainability to the reported results.</description>

      <title>Evaluation Metric for Quality Control and Generative Models in Histopathology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our study introduces ResNet-L2 (RL2), a novel metric for evaluating generative models and image quality in histopathology, addressing limitations of traditional metrics, such as Frechet inception distance (FID), when the data is scarce. RL2 leverages ResNet features with a normalizing flow to calculate RMSE distance in the latent space, providing reliable assessments across diverse histopathology datasets. We evaluated the performance of RL2 on degradation types, such as blur, Gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise, and rectangular patches, as well as diffusion processes. RL2's monotonic response to increasing degradation makes it well-suited for models that assess image quality, proving a valuable advancement for evaluating image generation techniques in histopathology. It can also be used to discard low-quality patches while sampling from a whole slide image. It is also significantly lighter and faster compared to traditional metrics and requires fewer images to give stable metric value.</description>
