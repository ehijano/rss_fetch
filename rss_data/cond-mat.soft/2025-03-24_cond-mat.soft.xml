      <title>Sub-singularities for shaping thin sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The principles behind the sharp, singular structures in a crumpled sheet are well understood. Here we discuss more general ways of exploiting such sharp structures to control the shape of a sheet by deforming or forcing it elsewhere. Often, the induced shape leads to further sharp structures -- ``sub-singularities". Though weaker and softer than the primary singularities, they nevertheless provide robust ways of shaping a sheet. In simple cases we understand the reason for these and their strength. This paper surveys a broad range of other sub-structure phenomena and reports recent progress in understanding some of them.</description>

      <title>Opening and closing a bandgap via alternating softening and hardening nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown some unusual nonlinear dispersion behaviors that are disconnected from the linear regime. However, existing analytical techniques, such as perturbation methods, fail to correctly capture these behaviors. Here we propose a general theoretical approach that converts the nonlinear wave equation to an equivalent linear eigenvalue problem, which directly gives the nonlinear dispersion relation and modal vectors. The theoretical approach is employed to 1D phononic chains and 2D hexagonal lattices with alternating softening and hardening nonlinearities, revealing amplitude-induced bandgap opening and closing phenomena. The theoretical results are validated via full-scale simulations with periodic boundary conditions, in which steady-state nonlinear plane wave responses are numerically obtained. Moreover, we leverage these nonlinear phenomena to achieve tunable frequency splitting and focusing effects. Thus, our work opens new paradigms for understanding nonlinear wave physics and for achieving novel wave control capabilities.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear model of shearable elastic rod from an origami-like microstructure displaying folding and faulting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new continuous model of shearable rod, subject to large elastic deformation, is derived from nonlinear homogenization of a one-dimensional periodic microstructured chain. As particular cases, the governing equations reduce to the Euler elastica and to the shearable elastica known as 'Engesser', that has been scarcely analysed so far. The microstructure that is homogenized is made up of elastic hinges and four-bar linkages, which may be realized in practice using origami joints. The equivalent continuous rod is governed by a Differential-Algebraic system of nonlinear Equations (DAE), containing an internal length ratio, and showing a surprisingly rich mechanical landscape, which involves a twin sequence of bifurcation loads, separated by a 'transition' mode. The latter occurs, for simply supported and cantilever rods in a 'bookshelf-like' mode and in a mode involving faulting (formation of a step in displacement), respectively. The postcritical response of the simply supported rod exhibits the emergence of folding, an infinite curvature occurring at a point of the rod axis, developing into a curvature jump at increasing load. Faulting and folding, excluded for both Euler and Reissner models and so far unknown in the rod theory, represent 'signatures' revealing the origami design of the microstructure. These two features are shown to be associated with bifurcations and, in particular folding, with a secondary bifurcation of the corresponding discrete chain when the number of elements is odd. Beside the intrinsic theoretical relevance to the field of structural mechanics, our results can be applied to various technological contexts involving highly compliant mechanisms, such as the achievement of objective trajectories with soft robot arms through folding and localized displacement of origami-inspired or multi-material mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically consistent lattice Monte Carlo method for active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing interest in the thermodynamic cost of dissipative structures formed by active particles. Given the strong finite-size effects of such systems, it is essential to develop efficient numerical approaches that discretize both space and time while preserving the original dynamics and thermodynamics of active particles in the continuum limit. To address this challenge, we propose two thermodynamically consistent kinetic Monte Carlo methods for active lattice gases, both of which correctly reproduce the continuum dynamics. One method follows the conventional Kawasaki dynamics, while the other incorporates an extra state-dependent prefactor in the transition rate to more accurately capture the self-propulsion velocity. We find that the error scales linearly with time step size and that the state-dependent prefactor improves accuracy at high P\'{e}clet numbers by a factor of $\mathrm{Pe}^2$. Our results are supported by rigorous proof of convergence as well as extensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of local plastic strain in granular media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study the heterogeneity of strain in a granular medium subjected to oscillatory shear in a rotating drum. Two complementary methods are used. The first method relies on optical imaging and grain tracking, allowing us to compute some components of the strain tensor and their variance. The second method, Diffusive Acoustic Wave Spectroscopy (DAWS), provides the variance of strain components within the bulk. Our results show that strain is spatially heterogeneous, with fluctuations about ten times larger than the mean, primarily dominated by variability at the grain scale. We then analyze in detail the strain fluctuations occurring during the forward and backward branches of the shear cycles, as well as the plastic strain at the completion of each cycle. Both methods reveal that each shear cycle consists of two consecutive diffusive-like branches, and that the resulting plastic strain fluctuations grow linearly with shear. We propose a simple framework to rationalize these effects, suggesting that plastic strain fluctuations increase with the diffusion coefficient and decrease with the anticorrelation between forward and backward strain, which is enhanced in denser packings.</description>

      <title>Wall torque controls curvature-driven propulsion in bacterial baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistent dynamics of active particles makes them explore extended portions of an obstacle's boundary during collisions. From impact to escape, the net applied forces depend on the curvature of the wall and increase in the presence of concave features. Here we systematically investigate the forces exerted by swimming bacteria on microfabricated structures, where the radii of curvature can be varied parametrically. We find that these micro-sails are propelled with a speed that scales linearly with curvature and is directed from concave to convex side along the axis of symmetry. By solving the collision problem for microswimmers with aligning torque interactions, we demonstrate that, unlike spherical active particles, curvature mainly affects cell orientation during sliding, leading to greater normal thrust on the concave side and an net applied thrust that scales linearly with curvature.</description>

      <title>The inconvenient truth about flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reanalyze the hydrodynamic theory of "flock" that is, polar ordered "dry" active fluids in two dimensions. For "Malthusian" flocks, in which birth and death cause the density to relax quickly, thereby eliminating density as a hydrodynamic variable, we are able to obtain two exact scaling laws relating the three scaling exponents characterizing the long-distance properties of these systems. We also show that it is highly plausible that such flocks display long-range order in two dimensions. In addition, we demonstrate that for "immortal" flocks, in which the number of flockers is conserved, the extra non-linearities allowed by the presence of an extra slow variable (number density) make it impossible to obtain any exact scaling relations between the exponents. We thereby demonstrate that several past published claims of exact exponents for Malthusian and immortal flocks are all incorrect.</description>

      <title>Colloidal Pivots Enable Brownian Metamaterials and Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological machines harness targeted deformations that can be actuated by Brownian fluctuations. However, while synthetic micromachines can similarly leverage targeted deformations they are too stiff to be driven by thermal fluctuations and thus require strong forcing. Furthermore, systems that are able to change their conformation by thermal fluctuations do so uncontrollably or require external control. Here we leverage DNA-based sliding contacts to create colloidal pivots, rigid anisotropic objects that freely fluctuate around their pivot point, and use a hierarchical strategy to assemble these into Brownian metamaterials and machines with targeted deformation modes. We realize the archetypical rotating diamond and rotating triangle, or Kagome, geometries, and quantitatively show how thermal fluctuations drive their predicted auxetic deformations. Finally, we implement magnetic particles into the colloidal pivots to achieve an elementary Brownian machine with easily actuatable deformations that can harness Brownian fluctuations. Together, our work introduces a strategy for creating thermal mechanical metamaterials and leverages them for functional Brownian devices, paving the way to materialize flexible, actuatable structures for micro-robots, smart materials, and nano-medicine.</description>

      <title>The Energy Barrier of Precritical Nuclei in Hard Spheres is Consistent with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17270v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting crystal nucleation is among the most significant long--standing challenges in condensed matter. In the system most studied (hard sphere colloids), the comparison between experiments performed using static light scattering and computer simulations is woeful, with a discrepancy of over 10 orders of magnitude. The situation with other well-studied materials (such as water and sodium chloride) is no better. It has thus far proven impossible to access the regime of this discrepancy with particle-resolved techniques which might shed light on the origins of this discrepancy due to the relatively sluggish dynamics of the larger colloids required for confocal microscopy.
  Here we address this challenge with two developments. Our work is a marked improvement in the precision of mapping the state point of experiments to simulation. For this, we employed a combination of novel machine-learning methods for particle tracking and higher-order correlation functions. Our second innovation is to consider the free energy of \emph{pre--critical} nuclei which can be detected in the discrepancy regime. These are in agreement with computer simulation. This is the first time that such free energies have been directly compared between experiment and simulation in any material as far as we are aware. The agreement provides important validation of rare event sampling techniques which are used very widely in simulation, but which can seldom be directly compared with experiment.</description>

      <title>Random packing fraction of binary hyperspheres with small or large size difference: a geometric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The random packing fraction of binary particles in D-dimensional Euclidean space R^D is studied using a geometric approach. First, the binary packing fraction of assemblies with small size difference are studied, using the excluded volume model by Onsager for particles in three-dimensional space (D = 3). According to this model the packing increase by bidispersity is proportional to (1 - f)(u^D - 1)^2, with f as monosized packing fraction, u as size ratio and D as space dimension. The model predictions are compared with computational results for disks in two dimensions (D = 2) and hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit (D to infinity), yielding good agreement. Subsequently, the packing of hyperspheres with large size difference is modeled, employing the classic theory of Furnas. This theory, developed for three dimensions, starts from an infinite size ratio of larger and smaller particles (u to infinity). Here, the pertaining equations are applied to hyperspheres, and successfully compared with computational results for hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit. Furthermore, an asymptotic approximation of the binary packing fraction for large size ratio is derived, which shows that the first order variation of the Furnas packing fraction (u^-1 = 0) is proportional to (2 - f)u^-1. Finally, a scaled D-dimensional binary packing graph is presented, governing a simplified phase diagram that borders the binary random packing fraction of amorphous assemblies. To summarize, basic space-filling and geometric (athermal) theories on simple hard spheres appear to be a valuable tool for the study of hyperspheres packing and amorphization.</description>

      <title>Reflection of Phase Anisotropy on Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores how molecular shape changes influence the phase behavior of liquid crystals, particularly the nematic (N) phase of 5CB, through all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results demonstrate that molecular shape anisotropy increases in the N phase, with molecules adopting more elongated conformations as aggregation occurs. We find that the shape distribution is temperature- and aggregation-dependent, and the molecular shape relaxation time is longer in the N phase compared to isolated molecules. Additionally, the study proposes a revision to Onsager and Maier-Saupe theories, considering molecular shape distribution changes, which could improve the explanation of the N-I phase transition in liquid crystals. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular behavior in liquid crystalline phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the mechanisms behind the helical structures in cholesteric liquid crystalline (CLC) phases using molecular dynamics simulations. By adding chiral agents to the nematic liquid crystalline (NLC) compound, 5CB, the research examines how the shape and motion chirality of the agents influence the overall twisting behavior. The results show that chiral agents induce shape chirality in the 5CB molecules, but dynamic chirality is not detectable at this stage. The study suggests that equilibrium is required for motion chirality to become evident, highlighting the need for further investigation.</description>
