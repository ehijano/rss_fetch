      <title>Probabilistic Proton Treatment Planning: a novel approach for optimizing underdosage and overdosage probabilities of target and organ structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01763v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Treatment planning uncertainties are typically managed using margin-based or robust optimization. Margin-based methods expand the clinical target volume (CTV) to a planning target volume, generally unsuited for proton therapy. Robust optimization considers worst-case scenarios, but its quality depends on the uncertainty scenario set: excluding extremes reduces robustness, while too many make plans overly conservative. Probabilistic optimization overcomes these limits by modeling a continuous scenario distribution. We propose a novel probabilistic optimization approach that steers plans toward individualized probability levels to control CTV and organs-at-risk (OARs) under- and overdosage. Voxel-wise dose percentiles ($d$) are estimated by expected value ($E$) and standard deviation (SD) as $E[d] \pm \delta \cdot SD[d]$, where $\delta$ is iteratively tuned to match the target percentile given Gaussian-distributed setup (3 mm) and range (3%) uncertainties. The method involves an inner optimization of $E[d] \pm \delta \cdot SD[d]$ for fixed $\delta$, and an outer loop updating $\delta$. Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) provides accurate and efficient dose estimates during optimization. We validated the method on a spherical CTV abutted by an OAR in different directions and a horseshoe-shaped CTV surrounding a cylindrical spine. For spherical cases with similar CTV coverage, $P(D_{2\%} &gt; 30 Gy)$ dropped by 10-15%; for matched OAR dose, $P(D_{98\%} &gt; 57 Gy)$ increased by 67.5-71%. In spinal plans, $P(D_{98\%} &gt; 57 Gy)$ increased by 10-15% while $P(D_{2\%} &gt; 30 Gy)$ dropped 24-28%. Probabilistic and robust optimization times were comparable for spherical (hours) but longer for spinal cases (7.5 - 11.5 h vs. 9 - 20 min). Compared to discrete scenario-based optimization, the probabilistic method offered better OAR sparing or target coverage depending on the set priorities.</description>

      <title>Harnessing coherent-wave control for sensing applications</title>

Abstract: Imaging techniques such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and diffuse optical tomography (DOT) achieve deep, non-invasive sensing in turbid media, but they are constrained by the photon budget. Wavefront shaping (WFS) can enhance signal strength via interference at specific locations within scattering media, enhancing light-matter interactions and potentially extending the penetration depth of these techniques. Interpreting the resulting measurements rests on the knowledge of optical sensitivity - a relationship between detected signal changes and perturbations at a specific location inside the medium. However, conventional diffusion-based sensitivity models rely on assumptions that become invalid under coherent illumination. In this work, we develop a microscopic theory for optical sensitivity that captures the inherent interference effects that diffusion theory necessarily neglects. We analytically show that under random illumination, the microscopic and diffusive treatments coincide. Using our microscopic approach, we explore WFS strategies for enhancing optical sensitivity beyond the diffusive result. We demonstrate that the input state obtained through phase conjugation at a given point inside the system leads to the largest enhancement of optical sensitivity but requires an input wavefront that depends on the target position. In sharp contrast, the maximum remission eigenchannel leads to a global enhancement of the sensitivity map with a fixed input wavefront. This global enhancement equals to remission enhancement and preserves the spatial distribution of the sensitivity, making it compatible with existing DOT reconstruction algorithms. Our results establish the theoretical foundation for integrating wavefront control with diffuse optical imaging, enabling deeper tissue penetration through improved signal strength in biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Genetic algorithm as a tool for detection setup optimisation: SiFi-CC case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Proton therapy is a precision-focused cancer treatment where accurate proton beam range monitoring is critical to ensure effective dose delivery. This can be achieved by prompt gamma detection with a Compton camera like the SiFi-CC. This study aims to show the feasibility of optimising the geometry of SiFi-CC Compton camera for verification of dose distribution via prompt gamma detection using a genetic algorithm (GA). Approach: The SiFi-CC key geometric parameters for optimisation with the GA are the source-to-scatterer and scatterer-to-absorber distances, and the module thicknesses. The optimisation process was conducted with a software framework based on the Geant4 toolkit, which included detailed and realistic modelling of gamma interactions, detector response, and further steps such as event selection and image reconstruction. The performance of each individual configuration was evaluated using a fitness function incorporating factors related to gamma detection efficiency and image resolution. Results: The GA-optimised SiFi-CC configuration demonstrated the capability to detect a 5 mm proton beam range shift with a 2 mm resolution using 5e8 protons. The best-performing geometry, with 16 fibre layers in the scatterer, 36 layers in the absorber, source-to-scatterer distance 150 mm and scatterer-to-absorber distance 120 mm, has an imaging sensitivity of 5.58(1)e-5. Significance: This study demonstrates that the SiFi-CC setup, optimised through a GA, can reliably detect clinically relevant proton beam range shifts, improving real-time range verification accuracy in proton therapy. The presented implementation of a GA is a systematic and feasible way of searching for a SiFi-CC geometry that shows the best performance.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Diffusion Models for Sparse-View Motion-Corrected Head Cone-beam CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a imaging modality widely used in head and neck diagnostics due to its accessibility and lower radiation dose. However, its relatively long acquisition times make it susceptible to patient motion, especially under sparse-view settings used to reduce dose, which can result in severe image artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel framework, joint reconstruction and motion estimation (JRM) with adaptive diffusion model (ADM), that simultaneously addresses motion compensation and sparse-view reconstruction in head CBCT. Leveraging recent advances in diffusion-based generative models, our method integrates a wavelet-domain diffusion prior into an iterative reconstruction pipeline to guide the solution toward anatomically plausible volumes while estimating rigid motion parameters in a blind fashion. We evaluate our method on simulated motion-affected CBCT data derived from real clinical computed tomography (CT) volumes. Experimental results demonstrate that JRM-ADM substantially improves reconstruction quality over traditional model-based and learning-based baselines, particularly in highly undersampled scenarios. Our approach enables motion-robust and low-dose CBCT imaging, paving the way for improved clinical viability.</description>
