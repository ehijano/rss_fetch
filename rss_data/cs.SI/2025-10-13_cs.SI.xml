      <title>Web Crawler Restrictions, AI Training Datasets \&amp;amp; Political Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models rely on web-scraped text for training; concurrently, content creators are increasingly blocking AI crawlers to retain control over their data. We analyze crawler restrictions across the top one million most-visited websites since 2023 and examine their potential downstream effects on training data composition. Our analysis reveals growing restrictions, with blocking patterns varying by website popularity and content type. A quarter of the top thousand websites restrict AI crawlers, decreasing to one-tenth across the broader top million. Content type matters significantly: 34.2% of news outlets disallow OpenAI's GPTBot, rising to 55% for outlets with high factual reporting. Additionally, outlets with neutral political positions impose the strongest restrictions (58%), whereas hyperpartisan websites and those with low factual reporting impose fewer restrictions -only 4.1% of right-leaning outlets block access to OpenAI. Our findings suggest that heterogeneous blocking patterns may skew training datasets toward low-quality or polarized content, potentially affecting the capabilities of models served by prominent AI-as-a-Service providers.</description>

      <title>Cross-Platform Narrative Prediction: Leveraging Platform-Invariant Discourse Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online narratives spread unevenly across platforms, with content emerging on one site often appearing on others, hours, days or weeks later. Existing cross-platform information diffusion models often treat platforms as isolated systems, disregarding cross-platform activity that might make these patterns more predictable. In this work, we frame cross-platform prediction as a network proximity problem: rather than tracking individual users across platforms or relying on brittle signals like shared URLs or hashtags, we construct platform-invariant discourse networks that link users through shared narrative engagement. We show that cross-platform neighbor proximity provides a strong predictive signal: adoption patterns follow discourse network structure even without direct cross-platform influence. Our highly-scalable approach substantially outperforms diffusion models and other baselines while requiring less than 3% of active users to make predictions. We also validate our framework through retrospective deployment. We sequentially process a datastream of 5.7M social media posts occurred during the 2024 U.S. election, to simulate real-time collection from four platforms (X, TikTok, Truth Social, and Telegram): our framework successfully identified emerging narratives, including crises-related rumors, yielding over 94% AUC with sufficient lead time to support proactive intervention.</description>

      <title>From Birdwatch to Community Notes, from Twitter to X: four years of community-based content moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community Notes (formerly known as Birdwatch) is the first large-scale crowdsourced content moderation initiative that was launched by X (formerly known as Twitter) in January 2021. As the Community Notes model gains momentum across other social media platforms, there is a growing need to assess its underlying dynamics and effectiveness. This Resource paper provides (a) a systematic review of the literature on Community Notes, and (b) a major curated dataset and accompanying source code to support future research on Community Notes. We parsed Notes and Ratings data from the first four years of the program and conducted language detection across all Notes. Focusing on English-language Notes, we extracted embedded URLs and identified discussion topics in each Note. Additionally, we constructed monthly interaction networks among the Contributors. Together with the literature review, these resources offer a robust foundation for advancing research on the Community Notes system.</description>

      <title>Multiplexons: Limits of Multiplex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a multiplex network, a set of nodes is connected by different types of interactions, each represented as a separate layer within the network. Multiplexes have emerged as a key instrument for modeling large-scale complex systems, due to the widespread coexistence of diverse interactions in social, industrial, and biological domains. This motivates the development of a rigorous and readily applicable framework for studying properties of large multiplex networks. In this article, we provide a self-contained introduction to the limit theory of dense multiplex networks, analogous to the theory of graphons (limit theory of dense graphs). As applications, we derive limiting analogues of commonly used multiplex features, such as degree distributions and clustering coefficients. We also present a range of illustrative examples, including correlated versions of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and inhomogeneous random graph models and dynamic networks. Finally, we discuss how multiplex networks fit within the broader framework of decorated graphs, and how the convergence results can be recovered from the limit theory of decorated graphs. Several future directions are outlined for further developing the multiplex limit theory.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed High-order Graph Dynamics Identification Learning for Predicting Complex Networks Long-term Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand, existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.</description>

      <title>What Do Temporal Graph Learning Models Learn?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density, temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Sanctions on decentralised Privacy Tools: A Case Study of Tornado Cash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of sanctions on Tornado Cash, a smart contract protocol designed to enhance transaction privacy. Following the U.S. Department of the Treasury's sanctions against Tornado Cash in August 2022, platform activity declined sharply. We document a significant and sustained reduction in transaction volume, user diversity, and overall protocol utilization after the sanctions were imposed. Our analysis draws on transaction data from three major blockchains: Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon. We further examine developments following the partial lifting and eventual removal of sanctions by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in March 2025. Although activity partially recovered, the rebound remained limited. The Tornado Cash case illustrates how regulatory interventions can affect decentralized protocols, while also highlighting the challenges of fully enforcing such measures in decentralized environments.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning Augmented Social Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems are essential for modern content platforms, yet traditional behavior-based models often struggle with cold users who have limited interaction data. Engaging these users is crucial for platform growth. To bridge this gap, we propose leveraging the social-relation graph to enrich interest representations from behavior-based models. However, extracting value from social graphs is challenging due to relation noise and cross-domain inconsistency. To address the noise propagation and obtain accurate social interest, we employ a dual-view denoising strategy, employing low-rank SVD to the user-item interaction matrix for a denoised social graph and contrastive learning to align the original and reconstructed social graphs. Addressing the interest inconsistency between social and behavioral interests, we adopt a "mutual distillation" technique to isolate the original interests into aligned social/behavior interests and social/behavior specific interests, maximizing the utility of both. Experimental results on widely adopted industry datasets verify the method's effectiveness, particularly for cold users, offering a fresh perspective for future research. The implementation can be accessed at https://github.com/WANGLin0126/CLSRec.</description>

      <title>Reimagining Agent-based Modeling with Large Language Model Agents via Shachi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S. tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and scientifically grounded research.</description>

      <title>Understanding How Network Geometry Influences Diffusion Processes in Complex Networks: A Focus on Cryptocurrency Blockchains and Critical Infrastructure Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study provides essential insights into how diffusion processes unfold in complex networks, with a focus on cryptocurrency blockchains and infrastructure networks. The structural properties of these networks, such as hub-dominated, heavy-tailed topology, network motifs, and node centrality, significantly influence diffusion speed and reach. Using epidemic diffusion models, specifically the Kertesz threshold model and the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model, we analyze key factors affecting diffusion dynamics. To assess the uncertainty in the fraction of infected nodes over time, we employ bootstrap confidence intervals, while Bayesian credible intervals are constructed to quantify parameter uncertainties in the SI models. Our findings reveal substantial variations across different network types, including Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi networks, Geometric Random Graphs, and Delaunay Triangulation networks, emphasizing the role of network architecture in failure propagation. We identify that network motifs are crucial in diffusion. We highlight that hub-dominated networks, which dominate blockchain ecosystems, provide resilience against random failures but remain vulnerable to targeted attacks, posing significant risks to network stability. Furthermore, centrality measures such as degree, betweenness, and clustering coefficient strongly influence the transmissibility of diffusion in both blockchain and critical infrastructure networks.</description>
