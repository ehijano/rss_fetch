      <title>The study of periphery uniqueness and balance in ecological networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of ecological networks is crucial for modern conservation biology, addressing habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss, especially in complex regions. These networks, including corridors, sources, and nodes, are key for species movement and ecosystem functioning. The Periphery Analysis Model (PAM) is introduced as a new approach to study the periphery of these networks, focusing on peripheral nodes' role in environmental change response and network resilience. PAM, drawing from graph theory, complex network analysis, and landscape ecology, uses the Periphery Uniqueness Index (PuI) and the Periphery Balance Index (PbI) to measure peripheral nodes' attributes and balance. It also offers derived indices for a detailed understanding of the periphery's influence. By revealing the periphery's defining characteristics, PAM enhances knowledge of ecological networks' structural features, providing insights for biodiversity, connectivity, and ecosystem health. The research encourages integrating PAM into conservation strategies to inform policy for ecosystem preservation amid environmental challenges.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Information Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge when describing the origin of life is to explain how instructional information control systems emerge naturally and spontaneously from mere molecular dynamics. So far, no one has clarified how information control emerged ab initio and how primitive control mechanisms in life might have evolved, becoming increasingly refined. Based on recent experimental results showing that chemical computation does not require the presence of life-related chemistry, we elucidate the origin and early evolution of information handling by chemical automata, from information processing (computation) to information storage (memory) and information transmission (communication). In contrast to other theories that assume the existence of initial complex structures, our narrative starts from trivial self-replicators whose interaction leads to the arising of more powerful molecular machines. By describing precisely the primordial transitions in chemistry-based computation, our metaphor is capable of explaining the above-mentioned gaps and can be translated to other models of computation, which allow us to explore biological phenomena at multiple spatial and temporal scales. At the end of our manuscript, we propose some ways to extend our ideas, including experimental validation of our theory (both in vitro and in silico).</description>

      <title>High Fidelity Freeform Manufacturing via Polyspectral Tomographic Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key goal of freeform manufacturing is to achieve speed, precision and design freedom at the same time. Volumetric additive manufacturing via tomographic reconstruction offers high speed but cannot achieve optical resolution at high design freedom. Here we combine polyspectral tomographic reconstruction with pseudo-negative illumination to resolve the trilemma. We used the same units on a digital micromirror device to modulate two colors of illumination simultaneously to control the chemical stability of binary photoinhibition. The methodology enables a typical 4K projector to 3D-print up to 8.9 billion voxels in a 30x30x50 mm vial at two-digit-m-resolution in minutes, with prolonged process window and geometrically fidelous greyscale printing. These results are linked to, and thus can be improved directly upon upgrading, the precision of the optomechanical modality.</description>

      <title>Causal evidence for social group sizes from Wikipedia editing data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human communities have self-organizing properties in which specific Dunbar Numbers may be invoked to explain group attachments. By analyzing Wikipedia editing histories across a wide range of subject pages, we show that there is an emergent coherence in the size of transient groups formed to edit the content of subject texts, with two peaks averaging at around $N=8$ for the size corresponding to maximal contention, and at around $N=4$ as a regular team. These values are consistent with the observed sizes of conversational groups, as well as the hierarchical structuring of Dunbar graphs. We use the Promise Theory model of bipartite trust to derive a scaling law that fits the data and may apply to all group size distributions, when based on attraction to a seeded group process. In addition to providing further evidence that even spontaneous communities of strangers are self-organizing, the results have important implications for the governance of the Wikipedia commons and for the security of all online social platforms and associations.</description>
