      <title>The Dirichlet problem for second-order elliptic equations in non-divergence form with continuous coefficients: The two-dimensional case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Dirichlet problem for a non-divergence form elliptic operator $L$ in a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^2$. Assuming that the principal coefficients satisfy the Dini mean oscillation condition, we establish the equivalence between regular points for $L$ and those for the Laplace operator. This result bridges a gap in the authors' recent work on higher-dimensional cases. Furthermore, we construct the Green's function for $L$ in regular two-dimensional domains, extending a result by Dong and Kim.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of a 2D fluid-structure interaction problem with free surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the analysis of the incompressible Euler equation in a time-dependent fluid domain, whose interface evolution is governed by the law of linear elasticity. Our main result asserts that the Cauchy problem is globally well-posed in time for any irrotational initial data in the energy space, without any smallness assumption. We also prove continuity with respect to the initial data and the propagation of regularity. The main novelty is that no dissipative effect is assumed in the system. In the absence of parabolic regularization, the key observation is that the system can be transformed into a nonlinear Schr\"odinger-type equation, to which dispersive estimates are applied. This allows us to construct solutions that are very rough from the point of view of fluid dynamics-the initial fluid velocity has merely one-half derivative in $L^2$. The main difficulty is that the problem is critical in the energy space with respect to several key inequalities from harmonic analysis. The proof incorporates new estimates for the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator in the low-regularity regime, including refinements of paralinearization formulas and shape derivative formulas, which played a key role in the analysis of water waves.</description>

      <title>On the essential spectrum of adiabatic stellar oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generator $\mathbf{L}$ of the linearized evolution equation of adiabatic oscillations of a gaseous star, ELASO, is a second order integro-differential operator and is realized as a self-adjoint operator in the Hilbert space of square integrable unknown functions with weight, which is the density distribution of the compactly supported background. Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the operator $\mathbf{L}$ have been investigated in practical point of view of eigenmode expansion of oscillations. But it should be examined whether continuous spectra are absent in the spectrum of $\mathbf{L}$ or not. In order to discuss this question, the existence of essential spectra in a closely related evolution problem is established.</description>

      <title>Perturbation Analysis and Neural Network-Based Initial Condition Estimation for the Sine-Gordon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sine-Gordon equation is a fundamental nonlinear partial differential equation that governs soliton dynamics and phase evolution in a variety of physical systems, including Josephson junctions and superconducting circuits. In this study, we analyze the effects of external perturbations such as damping and driving forces on the stability of soliton solutions. Using a rigorous Hilbert space framework, we establish well-posedness and derive regularity results for the perturbed equation. In particular, we provide sufficient conditions for the boundedness of the perturbation function, which plays a crucial role in determining the persistence of the soliton structure. Furthermore, we propose a neural network-based approach for solving the inverse problem of estimating unknown initial conditions. By training a data-driven model on simulated PDE solutions, we demonstrate that the network can accurately recover the initial states from limited or noisy observations. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and highlight the potential of combining mathematical analysis with machine learning techniques to study nonlinear wave phenomena. This approach offers valuable insights into soliton behavior and has potential applications in the design of quantum computing systems based on Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Existence of martingale solutions to a stochastic kinetic model of chemotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence of local and global in time weak martingale solutions for a stochastic version of the Othmer-Dunbar-Alt kinetic model of chemotaxis under suitable assumptions on the turning kernel and stochastic drift coefficients, using dispersion and stochastic Strichartz estimates. The analysis is based on new Strichartz estimates for stochastic kinetic transport. The derivation of these estimates involves a local in time dispersion analysis using properties of stochastic flows, and a time-splitting argument to extend the local in time results to arbitrary time intervals.</description>

      <title>A game approach to free boundary problems of anisotropic forced mean curvature flow equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the free boundary problems of degenerate elliptic equations that describe the level set formulation of the interface motion evolved by anisotropic forced mean curvature flows. The type of free boundary problems in this paper was initially studied as the first-order Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations arising in pursuit-evasion differential games and applied to the models of first-order front propagation in Soravia (1994). In this paper, we consider an extension of these free boundary problems to the second-order equations and give a deterministic game representation based on a discrete approximation scheme in Kohn and Serfaty (2006). Furthermore, we prove the comparison principle for our free boundary problems by using the framework of time-discrete games.</description>

      <title>The eternal solutions of parabolic equations with boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the parabolic equations of the form $$ \left\{ \begin{array}{rcll} Lu(y,t) &amp;=&amp; f, \qquad &amp;(y,t)\in Q,\\ u(y,t)&amp;=&amp; 0, \qquad &amp;(y,t)\in \partial Q, \\ u(y,t)&amp;&amp; \hspace{-8mm}\mbox{is uniformly bounded from below}, \qquad &amp;(y,t)\in Q, \end{array} \right. $$ where $Q=\Omega\times\mathbb{R}\subset\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a bounded Lipschitz domain with $0\in\Omega$. Here $L$ is a general second order uniformly parabolic differential operator in non-divergence form or divergence form. For $f=0$, we establish the structure of the solution space, which is one dimensional and the solutions in this space grow exponentially at one end and decay exponentially at the other. For $f\neq0$, we show that all solutions can be presented by the solutions corresponding to the homogenous equations($f=0$) and a bounded special solution of the inhomogeneous equations. Our method is based on maximum principle in $Q$ and the Harnack type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Linear Quadratic Nash Systems and Master Equations in Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to develop a theory for linear-quadratic Nash systems and Master equations in possibly infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. As a first step and motivated by the recent results in [31], we study a more general model in the linear quadratic case where the dependence on the distribution enters just in the objective functional through the mean. This property enables the Nash systems and the Master equation to be reduced to two systems of coupled Riccati equations and backward abstract evolution equations. We show that solutions for such systems exist and are unique for all time horizons, a result that is completely new in the literature in our setting. Finally, we apply the results to a vintage capital model, where capital depends on time and age, and the production function depends on the mean of the vintage capital.</description>

      <title>Meyers exponent rules the first-order approach to second-order elliptic boundary value problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first-order approach to boundary value problems for second-order elliptic equations in divergence form with transversally independent complex coefficients in the upper half-space rewrites the equation algebraically as a first-order system, much like how harmonic functions in the plane relate to the Cauchy-Riemann system in complex analysis. It hinges on global Lp -bounds for some p &gt; 2 for the resolvent of a perturbed Dirac-type operator acting on the boundary. At the same time, gradients of local weak solutions to such equations exhibit higher integrability for some p &gt; 2, expressed in terms of weak reverse H{\"o}lder estimates. We show that the optimal exponents for both properties coincide. Our proof relies on a simple but seemingly overlooked connection with operator-valued Fourier multipliers in the tangential direction.</description>

      <title>Parametric shape optimization for the convected Helmholtz equation with a generalized Myers boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the convected Helmholtz equation with a generalized Myers boundary condition (a boundary condition of the second-order) and characterize the set of physical parameters for which the problem is weakly well-posed. The model comes from industrial applications to absorb acoustic noise in jet engines filled with absorbing liners (porous material). The problem is set on a 3D cylinder filled with a d-upper regular boundary measure, with a real 1 &lt; d $\le$ 2. This setup leads to a parametric shape optimization problem, for which we prove the existence of at least one optimal distribution for any fixed volume fraction of the absorbing liner on the boundary that minimizes the total acoustic energy on any bounded wavenumber range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the eigenvalues of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator, a boundary integral operator associated with the harmonic double-layer potential. Specifically, we examine how the eigenvalues depend on the support of integration and prove that the map associating the support's shape to the eigenvalues is real-analytic. We then compute its first derivative and present applications of the resulting formula. The proposed method allows for handling infinite-dimensional perturbation parameters for multiple eigenvalues and perturbations that are not necessarily in the normal direction.</description>

      <title>KMS Inequalities: From Elliptic Operators to Constant Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Korn-Maxwell-Sobolev (KMS) inequalities represent a tool for estimating differential expressions and have gained particular importance in recent years, especially concerning elliptic operators. In my Master's thesis, together with Peter Lewintan (University of Duisburg-Essen), we extended this concept to also apply to operators of constant rank. This makes it possible to cover more complex structures such as the curl or divergence of vector fields.
  A key difference from the elliptic theory is that in the constant rank case, a correction term $\Pi_\mathbb{B}$ is necessary on the left-hand side of the inequality. Results were also obtained for the limiting case $p=1$, although additional assumptions are required here. This article provides an illustrative introduction to KMS inequalities and demonstrates their application in both the elliptic and constant rank cases.</description>

      <title>Alpha-unstable flows and the fast dynamo problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a time-independent, incompressible, and Lipschitz-continuous velocity field in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that generates a fast kinematic dynamo - an instability characterized by exponential growth of magnetic energy, independent of diffusivity. Specifically, we show that the associated vector transport-diffusion equation admits solutions that grow exponentially fast, uniformly in the vanishing diffusivity limit $\varepsilon\to 0$. Our construction is based on a periodic velocity field $U$ on $\mathbb{T}^3$, such as an Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, which satisfies a generic spectral instability property called alpha-instability, established via perturbation theory. This provides a rigorous mathematical framework for the alpha-effect, a mechanism conjectured in the late 1960s to drive large-scale magnetic field generation. By rescaling with respect to $\varepsilon$ and employing a Bloch-type theorem, we extend the solution to the whole space. Finally, through a gluing procedure that spatially localizes the instability, we construct a globally defined velocity field $u$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that drives the dynamo instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that mean field optimal controls satisfy a first order optimality condition (at a.e. time) without any a priori requirement on their spatial regularity. This principle is obtained by a careful limit procedure of the Pontryagin maximum principle for finite particle systems. In particular, our result applies to the case of mean field selective optimal control problems for multipopulation and replicator dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the zero-noise limit for SDE's singular at the initial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the zero-noise limit for SDE's driven by Brownian motion with a divergence-free drift singular at the initial time and prove that a unique probability measure concentrated on the integral curves of the drift is selected. More precisely, we prove uniqueness of the zero-noise limit for divergence-free drifts in $L^1_{loc}((0,T];BV(\mathbb{T}^d;\mathbb{R}^d))\cap L^q((0,T);L^p(\mathbb{T}^d;\mathbb{R}^d))$ where $p$ and $q$ satisfy a Prodi-Serrin condition. The vector field constructed by Depauw [C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, 2003] lies in this class and we show that for almost every intial datum, the zero-noise limit selects a probability measure concentrated on several distinct integral curves of this vector field.</description>

      <title>An operator approach to the analysis of electromagnetic wave propagation in dispersive media. Part 2: transmission problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this second chapter, we analyse transmission problems between a dielectric and a dispersive negative material. In the first part, we consider a transmission problem between two half-spaces, filled respectively by the vacuum and a Drude material, and separated by a planar interface. In this setting, we answer to the following question: does this medium satisfy a limiting amplitude principle? This principle defines the stationary regime as the large time asymptotic behavior of a system subject to a periodic excitation. In the second part, we consider the transmission problem of an infinite strip of Drude material embedded in the vacuum and analyse the existence and dispersive properties of guided waves. In both problems, our spectral analysis enlighten new and unusual physical phenomena for the considered transmission problems due to the presence of the dispersive negative material. In particular, we prove the existence of an interface resonance in the first part and the existence of slow light phenomena for guiding waves in the second part.</description>

      <title>An operator approach to the analysis of electromagnetic wave propagation in dispersive media. Part 1: general results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate in this chapter the mathematical models for electromagnetic wave propagation in dispersive isotropic passive linear media for which the dielectric permittivity $\varepsilon$ and magnetic permeability $\mu$ depend on the frequency. We emphasize the link between physical requirements and mathematical properties of the models. A particular attention is devoted to the notions of causality and passivity and its connection to the existence of Herglotz functions that determine the dispersion of the material. We consider successively the cases of the general passive media and the so-called local media for which $\varepsilon$ and $\mu$ are rational functions of the frequency. This leads us to analyse the important class of non dissipative and dissipative generalized Lorentz models. In particular, we discuss the connection between mathematical and physical properties of models through the notions of stability, energy conservation, dispersion and modal analyses, group and phase velocities and energy decay in dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of wide spectrum forcing in transport-diffusion and Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article considers the problem of reconstructing unknown driving forces based on incomplete knowledge of the system and its state. This is studied in both a linear and nonlinear setting that is paradigmatic in geophysical fluid dynamics and various applications. Two algorithms are proposed to address this problem: one that iteratively reconstructs forcing and another that provides a continuous-time reconstruction. Convergence is shown to be guaranteed provided that observational resolution is sufficiently high and algorithmic parameters are properly tuned according to the prior information; these conditions are quantified precisely. The class of reconstructable forces identified here include those which are time-dependent and potentially inject energy at all length scales. This significantly expands upon the class of forces in previous studies, which could only accommodate those with band-limited spectra. The second algorithm moreover provides a conceptually streamlined approach that allows for a more straightforward analysis and simplified practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Bounding Escape Rates and Approximating Quasi-Stationary Distributions of Brownian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Throughout physics Brownian dynamics are used to describe the behaviour of molecular systems. When the Brownian particle is confined to a bounded domain, a particularly important question arises around determining how long it takes the particle to encounter certain regions of the boundary from which it can escape. Termed the first passage time, it sets the natural timescale of the chemical, biological, and physical processes that are described by the stochastic differential equation. Probabilistic information about the first passage time can be studied using spectral properties of the deterministic generator of the stochastic process. In this work we introduce a framework for bounding the leading eigenvalue of the generator which determines the exponential rate of escape of the particle from the domain. The method employs sum-of-squares programming to produce nearly sharp numerical upper and lower bounds on the leading eigenvalue, while also giving good numerical approximations of the associated leading eigenfunction, the quasi-stationary distribution of the process. To demonstrate utility, the method is applied to prototypical low-dimensional problems from the literature.</description>

      <title>Subordination based approximation of Caputo fractional propagator and related numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an exponentially convergent numerical method for the Caputo fractional propagator $S_\alpha(t)$ and the associated mild solution of the Cauchy problem with time-independent sectorial operator coefficient $A$ and Caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha \in (0,2)$ in time. The proposed methods are constructed by generalizing the earlier developed approximation of $S_\alpha(t)$ with help of the subordination principle. Such technique permits us to eliminate the dependence of the main part of error estimate on $\alpha$, while preserving other computationally relevant properties of the original approximation: native support for multilevel parallelism, the ability to handle initial data with minimal spatial smoothness, and stable exponential convergence for all $t \in [0, T]$. Ultimately, the use of subordination leads to a significant improvement of the method's convergence behavior, particularly for small $\alpha &lt; 0.5$, and opens up further opportunities for efficient data reuse. To validate theoretical results, we consider applications of the developed methods to the direct problem of solution approximation, as well as to the inverse problem of fractional order identification.</description>

Abstract: We prove a Hopf bifurcation theorem in general Banach spaces, which improves a classical result by Crandall and Rabinowitz. Actually, our theorem does not need any compactness conditions, which leads to wider applications. In particular, our theorem can be applied to semilinear and quasi-linear partial differential equations in unbounded domains of $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>On classification of global dynamics for energy-critical equivariant harmonic map heat flows and radial nonlinear heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the global dynamics of finite energy solutions to energy-critical equivariant harmonic map heat flow (HMHF) and radial nonlinear heat equation (NLH). It is known that any finite energy equivariant solutions to (HMHF) decompose into finitely many harmonic maps (bubbles) separated by scales and a body map, as approaching to the maximal time of existence. Our main result for (HMHF) gives a complete classification of their dynamics for equivariance indices $D\geq3$; (i) they exist globally in time, (ii) the number of bubbles and signs are determined by the energy class of the initial data, and (iii) the scales of bubbles are asymptotically given by a universal sequence of rates up to scaling symmetry. In parallel, we also obtain a complete classification of $\dot{H}^{1}$-bounded radial solutions to (NLH) in dimensions $N\geq7$, building upon soliton resolution for such solutions. To our knowledge, this provides the first rigorous classification of bubble tree dynamics within symmetry. We introduce a new approach based on the energy method that does not rely on maximum principle. The key ingredient of the proof is a monotonicity estimate near any bubble tree configurations, which in turn requires a delicate construction of modified multi-bubble profiles also.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the existence of normalized solutions to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on noncompact metric graphs in the $L^2$ supercritical regime. For sufficiently small prescribed mass ($L^2$ norm), we prove existence of positive solutions on two classes of graphs: periodic graphs, and noncompact graphs with finitely many edges and suitable topological assumptions. Our approach is based on mountain pass techniques. A key point to overcome the serious lack of compactness is to show that all solutions with small mass have positive energy. To complement our analysis, we prove that this is no longer true, in general, for large masses. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results with an $L^2$ supercritical nonlinearity extended on the whole graph and unraveling the role of topology in the existence of solutions.</description>

Abstract: Half-wave maps appear in the physics literature as the continuum limit of Calogero-Moser spin systems. We obtain a uniqueness result for the Half-Wave Maps equation in dimension $d \ge 3$ in the natural energy class with $\mathbb{H}^2$ target. In the proof, we differentiate in time to arrive at a wave-type equation and isometrically embed $\mathbb{H}^2$ into some $\mathbb{R}^m$ using the Nash embedding theorem. Relying on geometric properties of $\mathbb{H}^2$, combined with fractional Leibniz rules and commutator estimates, we then use a Gr\"{o}nwall inequality argument to obtain uniqueness.</description>

      <title>Mass-conserving weak solutions to the continuous nonlinear fragmentation equation in the presence of mass transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mathematical model for the continuous nonlinear fragmentation equation is considered in the presence of mass transfer. In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of mass-conserving weak solutions to the nonlinear fragmentation equation with mass transfer for collision kernels of the form $\Phi(x,y) = \kappa(x^{{\sigma_1}} y^{{\sigma_2}} + y^{{\sigma_1}} x^{{\sigma_2}})$, $\kappa&gt;0$, $0 \leq {\sigma_1} \leq {\sigma_2} \leq 1$, and ${\sigma_1} \neq 1$ for $(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}_+^2$, with integrable daughter distribution functions, thereby extending previous results obtained by Giri \&amp; Lauren\c cot (2021). In particular, the existence of at least one global weak solution is shown when the collision kernel exhibits at least linear growth, and one local weak solution when the collision kernel exhibits sublinear growth. In both cases, finite superlinear moment bounds are obtained for positive times without requiring the finiteness of initial superlinear moments. Additionally, the uniqueness of solutions is confirmed in both cases.</description>

      <title>On the Time-decay of solutions arising from periodically forced Dirac Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is increased interest in time-dependent (non-autonomous) Hamiltonians, stemming in part from the active field of Floquet quantum materials. Despite this, dispersive time-decay bounds, which reflect energy transport in such systems, have received little attention.
  We study the dynamics of non-autonomous, time-periodically forced, Dirac Hamiltonians: $i\partial_t\alpha =D(t)\alpha$, where $D(t)=i\sigma_3\partial_x+ \nu(t)$ is time-periodic but not spatially localized. For the special case $\nu(t)=m\sigma_1$, which models a relativistic particle of constant mass $m$, one has a dispersive decay bound: $\|\alpha(t,x)\|_{L^\infty_x}\lesssim t^{-\frac12}$. Previous analyses of Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians suggest that this decay bound persists for small, spatially-localized and time-periodic $\nu(t)$. However, we show that this is not necessarily the case if $\nu(t)$ is not spatially localized. Specifically, we study two non-autonomous Dirac models whose time-evolution (and monodromy operator) is constructed via Fourier analysis. In a rotating mass model, the dispersive decay bound is of the same type as for the constant mass model. However, in a model with a periodically alternating sign of the mass, the results are quite different. By stationary-phase analysis of the associated Fourier representation, we display initial data for which the $L^\infty_x$ time-decay rate are considerably slower: $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/3})$ or even $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/5})$ as $t\to\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09485v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a geometric flow framework to investigate the following two classical shape functionals: the torsional rigidity and the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplacian. First, by constructing novel deformation paths governed by stretching flows, we prove several new monotonicity properties of the torsional rigidity and the first eigenvalue along the evolutions restricted to triangles and rhombuses. These results also lead to new and simpler proofs of some known results, unifying and extending prior symmetrization-based proofs. Second, utilizing the mean curvature flow, we give a new proof of the Saint-Venant inequality for smooth convex bodies. This might be the first flow-based proof to establish geometric functional inequalities that couple both the domain and the state function associated with it. Third, by discovering a gradient norm inequality for the sides of rectangles, we prove monotonicity and rigidity results of the torsional rigidity on rectangles.</description>

      <title>Representation and Stability Analysis of 1D PDEs with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PDEs with periodic boundary conditions are frequently used to model processes in large spatial environments, assuming solutions to extend periodically beyond some bounded interval. However, for 2nd order PDEs with periodic boundary conditions, the nullspace of the differential operator $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$ is nontrivial on the PDE domain, and solutions may converge to non-stationary trajectories existing in this nullspace. To test this convergence behaviour, in this paper, it is shown how we can model these trajectories for a broad class of linear, 2nd order, 1D PDEs with periodic as well as more general boundary conditions, using the Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. In particular, it is first shown how any function $\mathbf{u}(t)$ in the PDE domain can be decomposed into a component defined by $\mathbf{u}_{xx}(t)$, and a component $\bar{\mathbf{u}}(t)$ existing in the nullspace of $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$. An equivalent representation of linear PDEs is then derived as a PIE, explicitly defining the dynamics of both $\mathbf{u}_{xx}(t)$ and $\bar{\mathbf{u}}(t)$. Finally, a notion of exponential stability is defined for trajectories $\mathbf{u}^*(t)=\bar{\mathbf{u}}(t)$, and it is shown that stability of these trajectories as well as of the equilibrium $\mathbf{u}^*\equiv0$ can be tested by solving a linear operator inequality. The proposed methodology is applied to two examples, demonstrating that stability can be verified with tight bounds on the rate of exponential decay.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate certain theoretical aspects of the hierarchical controllability problem in one-dimensional wave equations within a moving domain using Stackelberg strategy. The controls are applied along a portion of the boundary and establish an equilibrium strategy among them, considering a leader control and a follower. We consider a linear wave equation.</description>

      <title>Dense networks of integrate-and-fire neurons: Spatially-extended mean-field limit of the empirical measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of spatially-structured networks of $N$ interacting stochastic neurons can be described by deterministic population equations in the mean-field limit. While this is known, a general question has remained unanswered: does synaptic weight scaling suffices, by itself, to guarantee the convergence of network dynamics to a deterministic population equation, even when networks are not assumed to be homogeneous or spatially structured? In this work, we consider networks of stochastic integrate-and-fire neurons with arbitrary synaptic weights satisfying a $O(1/N)$ scaling condition. Borrowing results from the theory of dense graph limits, or graphons, we prove that, as $N\to\infty$, and up to the extraction of a subsequence, the empirical measure of the neurons' membrane potentials converges to the solution of a spatially-extended mean-field partial differential equation (PDE). Our proof requires analytical techniques that go beyond standard propagation of chaos methods. In particular, we introduce a weak metric that depends on the dense graph limit kernel and we show how the weak convergence of the initial data can be obtained by propagating the regularity of the limit kernel along the dual-backward equation associated with the spatially-extended mean-field PDE. Overall, this result invites us to reinterpret spatially-extended population equations as universal mean-field limits of networks of neurons with $O(1/N)$ synaptic weight scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish stable quantum ergodicity for spin Hamiltonians, also known as Pauli-Schr\"odinger operators. Our approach combines new analytic techniques of mixed quantization, inspired by local index theory, with stable ergodicity results for partially hyperbolic systems.</description>
