      <title>Constraints on the properties of $\nu$MSM dark matter using the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass galaxies provide a powerful tool with which to investigate departures from the standard cosmological paradigm in models that suppress the abundance of small dark matter structures. One of the simplest metrics that can be used to compare different models is the abundance of satellite galaxies in the Milky Way. Viable dark matter models must produce enough substructure to host the observed number of Galactic satellites. Here, we scrutinize the predictions of the neutrino Minimal Standard Model ($\nu{\rm MSM}$), a well-motivated extension of the Standard Model of particle physics in which the production of sterile neutrino dark matter is resonantly enhanced by a lepton asymmetry in the primordial plasma. This process enables the model to evade current constraints associated with non-resonantly produced dark matter. Independently of assumptions about galaxy formation physics we rule out, with at least 95 per cent confidence, all parameterizations of the $\nu{\rm MSM}$ with sterile neutrino rest mass, $M_{\rm s} \leq 1.4\, {\rm keV}$. Incorporating physically motivated prescriptions of baryonic processes and modelling the effects of reionization strengthen our constraints, and we exclude all $\nu{\rm MSM}$ parameterizations with $M_{\rm s} \leq 4\, {\rm keV}$. Unlike other literature, our fiducial constraints do not rule out the putative 3.55 keV X-ray line, if it is indeed produced by the decay of a sterile neutrino; however, some of the most favoured parameter space is excluded. If the Milky Way satellite count is higher than we assume, or if the Milky Way halo is less massive than $M^{\rm MW}_{200} = 8 \times 10^{11}\, {\rm M_\odot}$, we rule out the $\nu{\rm MSM}$ as the origin of the 3.55 keV excess. In contrast with other work, we find that the constraints from satellite counts are substantially weaker than those reported from X-ray non-detections.</description>

      <title>Boson Cloud Atlas: Direct Observation of Superradiance Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight scalars emerge naturally in several motivated particle physics scenarios and are viable candidates for dark matter. While laboratory detection of such bosons is challenging, their existence in nature can be imprinted on measurable properties of astrophysical black holes (BHs). The phenomenon of superradiance can convert the BH spin kinetic energy into a bound cloud of scalars. In this letter, we propose a new technique for directly measuring the mass of a dark cloud around a spinning BH. We compare the measurement of the BH spin obtained with two independent electromagnetic techniques: continuum fitting and iron K$\alpha$ spectroscopy. Since the former technique depends on a dynamical observation of the BH mass while the latter does not, a mismatch between the two measurements can be used to infer the presence of additional extended mass around the BH. We find that a precision of $\sim 1\%$ on the two spin measurements is required to exclude the null hypothesis of no dark mass around the BH at a 2$\sigma$ confidence level for dark masses about a few percent of the BH mass, as motivated in some superradiance scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Moving Lens Effect: Simulations, Forecasts and Foreground Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The peculiar motion of massive objects across the line of sight imprints a dipolar temperature anisotropy pattern on the cosmic microwave background known as the moving lens effect. This effect provides a unique probe of the transverse components of the peculiar velocity field, but has not yet been detected due to its small size. We implement and validate a stacking estimator for the moving lens signal using a galaxy catalog as a tracer of massive haloes combined with reconstructed velocities from the galaxy number density field. Using simulations, we forecast detection prospects for the moving lens signal from current and upcoming microwave background and galaxy surveys. We demonstrate a new foreground mitigation strategy sufficient for current data sets, and discuss various sources of systematic error and noise. Upcoming galaxy surveys will provide high-significance statistical detections of the moving lens effect.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Stasis from a Single Annihilating Particle Species: Extending Stasis Into the Thermal Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that extended cosmological epochs can exist during which the abundances associated with different energy components remain constant despite cosmological expansion. Indeed, this "stasis" behavior has been found to arise generically in many BSM theories containing large towers of states, and even serves as a cosmological attractor. However, all previous studies of stasis took place within non-thermal environments, or more specifically within environments in which thermal effects played no essential role in realizing or sustaining the stasis. In this paper, we demonstrate that stasis can emerge and serve as an attractor even within thermal environments, with thermal effects playing a critical role in the stasis dynamics. Moreover, within such environments, we find that no towers of states are needed -- a single state experiencing two-body annihilations will suffice. This work thus extends the stasis phenomenon into the thermal domain and demonstrates that thermal effects can also generally give rise to an extended stasis epoch, even when only a single matter species is involved.</description>

      <title>Efficient Compression of Redshift-Space Distortion Data for Late-Time Modified Gravity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current cosmological observations allow for deviations from the standard growth of large-scale structures in the universe. These deviations could indicate modifications to General Relativity on cosmological scales or suggest the dynamical nature of dark energy. It is important to characterize these departures in a model-independent manner to understand their significance objectively and explore their fundamental causes more generically across a wider spectrum of theories and models. In this paper, we compress the information from redshift-space distortion data into 2-3 parameters $\mu_i$, which control the ratio between the effective gravitational coupling in Poisson's equation and Newton's constant in several redshift bins in the late universe. We test the efficiency of this compression using mock final-year data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and considering three different models within the class of effective field theories of dark energy. The constraints on the parameters of these models, obtained from both the direct fit to the data and the projection of the compressed parameters onto the parameters of the models, are fully consistent, demonstrating the method's good performance. Then, we apply it to current data and find hints of a suppressed matter growth in the universe at $\sim 2.7\sigma$ C.L., in full accordance with previous works in the literature. Finally, we perform a forecast with DESI data and show that the uncertainties on the parameters $\mu_1$ at $z&lt;1$ and $\mu_2$ at $1&lt;z&lt;3$ are expected to decrease by approximately $40\%$ and $20\%$, respectively, compared to those obtained with current data. Additionally, we project these forecasted constraints onto the parameters of the aforesaid models.</description>

      <title>Pair Counting without Binning -- A New Approach to Correlation Functions in Clustering Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel perspective on correlation functions in the clustering analysis of the large-scale structure of the universe. We first recognise that pair counting in bins of radial separation is equivalent to evaluating counts-in-cells (CIC), which can be modelled using a filtered density field with a binning-window function. This insight leads to an in situ expression for the two-point correlation function (2PCF). Essentially, the core idea underlying our method is to introduce a window function to define the binning scheme, enabling pair-counting without binning. This approach develops a concept of generalised 2PCF, which extends beyond conventional discrete pair counting by accommodating non-sharp-edged window functions. To extend this framework to N-point correlation functions (NPCF) using current optimal edge-corrected estimators, we developed a binning scheme independent of the specific parameterisation of polyhedral configurations. In particular, we demonstrate a fast algorithm for the three-point correlation function (3PCF), where triplet counting is accomplished by assigning either a spherical tophat or a Gaussian filter to each vertex of triangles. Additionally, we derive analytical expressions for the 3PCF using a multipole expansion in Legendre polynomials, accounting for filtered field (binning) corrections. Numerical tests using several suites of N-body simulation samples show that our approach aligns remarkably well with the theoretical predictions. Our method provides an exact solution for quantifying binning effects in practical measurements and offers a high-speed algorithm, enabling high-order clustering analysis in extremely large datasets from ongoing and upcoming surveys such as Euclid, LSST, and DESI.</description>

      <title>A Compaction Function Analysis of CMB $\mu$ distortion Constraints on Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are considered viable candidates for dark matter and the seeds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), with their fruitful physical influences providing significant insights into the conditions of the early Universe. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) $\mu$ distortion tightly constrain the abundance of PBHs in the mass range of $10^4 \sim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ recently, limiting their potential to serve as seeds for the SMBHs observed. Given that $\mu$ distortion directly constrain the primordial power spectrum, it is crucial to employ more precise methods in computing PBH abundance to strengthen the reliability of these constraints. By a Press-Schechter (PS) type method utilizing the compaction function, we find that the abundance of PBHs could be higher than previously estimated constraints from $\mu$ distortion observations. Furthermore, our analysis shows that variations in the shape of the power spectrum have a negligible impact on our conclusions within the mass ranges under consideration. This conclusion provides us a perspective for further research on the constrain of PBH by $\mu$ distortion.</description>

      <title>The MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey Data Release 2: Wideband continuum catalogues and a measurement of the cosmic radio dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the second data release of the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS), consisting of wideband continuum catalogues of 391 pointings observed at L~band. The full wideband catalogue covers 4344 deg$^2$ of sky, reaches a depth of 10 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, and contains 971,980 sources. With its balance between survey depth and sky coverage, MALS DR2 covers five orders of magnitude of flux density, presenting a robust view of the extragalactic radio source population down to 200 $\mu$Jy. Using this catalogue, we perform a measurement of the cosmic radio dipole, an anisotropy in the number counts of radio sources with respect to the cosmic background, analogous to the dipole found in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). For this measurement, we present the characterisation of completeness and noise properties of the catalogue, and show that a declination-dependent systematic affects the number density of faint sources. In the dipole measurement on the MALS catalogue, we recover reasonable dipole measurements once we model the declination systematic with a linear fit between the size of the major axis of the restoring beam and the amount of sources of each pointing. The final results are consistent with the CMB dipole in terms of direction and amplitude, unlike many recent measurements of the cosmic radio dipole made with other centimetre wavelength catalogues, which generally show a significantly larger amplitude. This result demonstrates the value of dipole measurements with deeper and more sparse radio surveys, as the population of faint sources probed may have had a significant impact on the measured dipole.</description>

      <title>The consequence of higher-order curvature-based constraints on $ f(R, L_m) $ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this investigation, we perform an observational statistical analysis in the theory of $ f(R, L_m) $ gravity. The proposed theoretical model is based on the Ricci scalar's non-linear contribution. We use a distinct parameterization for the deceleration parameter and constrain the model parameters by using various observational data. To determine the best-fit model for the cosmological parameters, we use different observational datasets such as the Hubble Space Telescope, the Pantheon Supernova Survey, the Gold dataset, the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB), and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). Furthermore, we study the late-time cosmic evolution of the Universe in detail and examine the implications of the constraint values on cosmological parameters. Additionally, we conduct a thorough comparison with the standard cosmological model $ \Lambda $CDM and other standard models obtained by Odintsov et al. \cite{Odintsov:2023cli, Odintsov:2024lid} to examine the validity of our proposed model in the low-redshift regimes. Finally, we find that the proposed model encapsulates an intriguing transition from early deceleration at high redshift to acceleration at low redshift, a quintessence dark energy scenario, and convergence towards the well-established $ \Lambda $CDM model in late-time Universe's evolution.</description>

      <title>Gravitino Thermal Production, Dark Matter, and Reheating of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a full one-loop calculation of the gravitino thermal production rate, beyond the so-called hard thermal loop approximation, using the corresponding thermal spectral functions in numerical form on both sides of the light cone. This framework requires a full numerical evaluation. We interpret our results within the framework of a general supergravity-based model, remaining agnostic about the specifics of supersymmetry breaking. In this context, assuming that gravitinos constitute the entirety of the dark matter in the Universe imposes strict constraints on the reheating temperature. For example, with a gluino mass at the current LHC limit, a maximum reheating temperature of $T_\mathrm{reh} \simeq 10^9$ GeV is compatible with a gravitino mass of $m_{3/2} \simeq 1$ TeV. Additionally, with a reheating temperature an order of magnitude lower at $T_\mathrm{reh} \simeq 10^8$ GeV, the common gaugino mass $M_{1/2}$ can range from $2$ to $4 $ TeV within the same gravitino mass range. For much higher values of $M_{1/2}$, which are favored by current accelerator and cosmological data in the context of supersymmetric models, such as $M_{1/2} = 10$ TeV, and for $m_{3/2} \simeq 1$ TeV the reheating temperature compatible with the gravitino dark matter scenario is $ 10^7$ GeV. If other dark matter particles are considered, the reheating temperature could be much lower.</description>

      <title>Search for ultralight dark matter in the SuperMAG high-fidelity dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter, such as kinetically mixed dark-photon dark matter (DPDM) or axionlike-particle dark matter (axion DM), can source an oscillating magnetic-field signal at Earth's surface. Previous work searched for this signal in a publicly available dataset of global magnetometer measurements maintained by the SuperMAG collaboration. This "low-fidelity" dataset reported measurements with a 1-minute time resolution, allowing the search to set leading direct constraints on DPDM and axion DM with Compton frequencies $f_\mathrm{DM}\leq1/(1\,\mathrm{min})$ [corresponding to masses $m_\mathrm{DM}\leq7\times10^{-17}\,\mathrm{eV}$]. More recently, a dedicated experiment undertaken by the SNIPE Hunt collaboration has also searched for this same signal at higher frequencies $f_\mathrm{DM}\geq0.5\,\mathrm{Hz}$ (or $m_\mathrm{DM}\geq2\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{eV}$). In this work, we search for this signal of ultralight DM in the SuperMAG "high-fidelity" dataset, which features a 1-second time resolution, allowing us to probe the gap in parameter space between the low-fidelity dataset and the SNIPE Hunt experiment. The high-fidelity dataset exhibits lower geomagnetic noise than the low-fidelity dataset and features more data than the SNIPE Hunt experiment, making it a powerful probe of ultralight DM. Our search finds no robust DPDM or axion DM candidates. We set constraints on DPDM and axion DM parameter space for $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{Hz}\leq f_\mathrm{DM}\leq0.98\,\mathrm{Hz}$ (or $4\times10^{-18}\,\mathrm{eV}\leq m_\mathrm{DM}\leq4\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{eV}$). Our results are the leading direct constraints on both DPDM and axion DM in this mass range, and our DPDM constraint surpasses the leading astrophysical constraint in a narrow range around $m_{A'}\approx2\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{MEDEA}$: A New Model for Emulating Radio Antenna Beam Patterns for 21-cm Cosmology and Antenna Design Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 21-cm experimental cosmology, accurate characterization of a radio telescope's antenna beam response is essential to measure the 21-cm signal. Computational electromagnetic (CEM) simulations estimate the antenna beam pattern and frequency response by subjecting the EM model to different dependencies, or beam hyper-parameters, such as soil dielectric constant or orientation with the environment. However, it is computationally expensive to search all possible parameter spaces to optimize the antenna design or accurately represent the beam to the level required for use as a systematic model in 21-cm cosmology. We therefore present $\texttt{MEDEA}$, an emulator which rapidly and accurately generates farfield radiation patterns over a large hyper-parameter space. $\texttt{MEDEA}$ takes a subset of beams simulated by CEM software, spatially decomposes them into coefficients in a complete, linear basis, and then interpolates them to form new beams at arbitrary hyper-parameters. We test $\texttt{MEDEA}$ on an analytical dipole and two numerical beams motivated by upcoming lunar lander missions, and then employ $\texttt{MEDEA}$ as a model to fit mock radio spectrometer data to extract covariances on the input beam hyper-parameters. We find that the interpolated beams have RMS relative errors of at most $10^{-2}$ using 20 input beams or less, and that fits to mock data are able to recover the input beam hyper-parameters when the model and mock derive from the same set of beams. When a systematic bias is introduced into the mock data, extracted beam hyper-parameters exhibit bias, as expected. We propose several future extensions to $\texttt{MEDEA}$ to potentially account for such bias.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic strings, theoretical one-dimensional topological defects from the early universe, provide a valuable opportunity for exploring dark matter (DM) production and gravitational wave (GW) emission. Our study investigates the production of gauge bosons and GW emission from cosmic string decay, considering the constraints imposed by cosmological observations. We specifically examine how gauge bosons radiated from strings contribute to DM and dark radiation, with limits set by the observed DM abundance and cosmic microwave background data, respectively. Additionally, we analyze the gravitational wave spectrum of this model across both low and high frequencies. Notably, the spectrum typically follows a $f^{-1/3}$ pattern at high frequencies, beyond the pivot frequency $f_*$. We derive an analytical expression for the frequency $f_*$ and confirm its accuracy through numerical verification. Furthermore, we compare the GW spectrum of this model with the forecasted capabilities of future GW observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, the Big Bang Observer, and $\mu$Ares. Finally, we discuss how these considerations impact the model parameters, specifically the gauge boson mass and the energy scale of U(1) symmetry breaking, providing insights into how cosmic strings could enhance our understanding of DM and GW astronomy.</description>

      <title>On the Schwinger effect during axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair-creation of charged particles in a strong gauge-field background - the renowned Schwinger effect - can strongly alter the efficiency of gauge-field production during axion inflation. It is therefore crucial to have a clear understanding and proper description of this phenomenon to obtain reliable predictions for the physical observables in this model. In the present work, we revisit the problem of Schwinger pair-production during axion inflation in the presence of both electric and magnetic fields and improve on the state of the art in two ways: (i) taking into account that the electric- and magnetic-field three-vectors are in general noncollinear, we derive the vector decomposition of the Schwinger-induced current in terms of these fields and determine the corresponding effective electric and magnetic conductivities; (ii) by identifying the physical momentum scale associated with the pair-creation process, we incorporate Schwinger damping of the gauge field in a scale-dependent fashion in the relevant equations of motion. Implementing this new description in the framework of the gradient-expansion formalism, we obtain numerical results in a benchmark scenario of axion inflation and perform a comprehensive comparison with earlier results in the literature. In some cases, the resulting energy densities of the produced gauge fields differ from the old results by more than one order of magnitude, which reflects the importance of taking the new effects into account.</description>

      <title>Deep extragalactic HI survey of the COSMOS field with FAST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a deep HI survey at L-band conducted with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) over the COSMOS field. This survey is strategically designed to overlap with the MIGHTEE COSMOS field, aiming to combine the sensitivity of the FAST and high-resolution of the MeerKAT. We observed the field with FAST for 11 hours covering $\sim$2 square degrees, and reduced the raw data to HI spectral cubes over the frequency range 1310-1420 MHz. The FAST-HI data reach a median 3$\sigma$ column density of $N_{\rm HI}\sim2\times10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ over a 5 km s$^{-1}$ channel width, allowing for studies of the distribution of HI gas in various environments, such as in galaxies, the Circum-Galactic Medium (CGM) and Intergalactic Medium (IGM). We visually searched the spectral cubes for HI sources, and found a total of 80 HI detections, of which 56 have been cross-matched with the MIGHTEE-HI catalogue. With the cross-matched sources, we compare their HI masses and find that the total HI mass fraction in the IGM and CGM surrounding the galaxy pairs is statistically higher than the HI fraction surrounding the isolated galaxies by a difference of 13$\pm$4%, indicating that the CGM and IGM associated with interacting systems are richer in neutral hydrogen compared to those around isolated galaxies in the local Universe. We also describe several FAST-MeerKAT synergy projects, highlighting the full potential of exploiting both single-dish and interferometric observations to study the distribution and evolution of the diffuse HI gas.</description>

      <title>Impact of cosmic web on galaxy properties and their correlations: Insights from Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze a volume-limited sample from the SDSS and explore how cosmic web environments affect the interrelations between various galaxy properties, such as $(u-r)$ colour, stellar mass, specific star formation rate, metallicity, concentration index, and $D4000$. Our analysis reveals that the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) account for approximately $\sim 72\%$ of the data variance. We then classify galaxies into different cosmic web environments based on the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor and compare PC1 and PC2 across these environments, ensuring a mass-matched sample of equal size for each environment. We observe that PC1 displays clear bimodality across all cosmic web environments, with sheets and clusters showing distinct preferences for negative and positive PC1 values, respectively. PC2, on the other hand, shows a positively skewed unimodal distribution in all environments. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test confirms that the distributions of PC1 and PC2 differ significantly across environments, with a confidence level exceeding $99.99\%$. Furthermore, we calculate the normalized mutual information (NMI) between the principal components and individual galaxy properties within different cosmic web environments. A two-tailed t-test reveals that for each relationship and each pair of environments, the null hypothesis is rejected with a confidence level $&gt;99.99\%$. Our analysis confirms that cosmic web environments play a significant role in shaping the correlations between galaxy properties.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background detection using NANOGrav 15-year data set in the context of massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convincing evidence of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background has been found by the NANOGrav Collaboration in the 15-year data set. From this signal, we can evaluate the possibility of its source being from the early Universe through the tensor perturbations induced by a massive spin-2 graviton field. We consider a time-dependent model of the minimal theory of massive gravity and find values of the graviton mass, mass cutoff time, and Hubble rate of inflation that amplify the energy spectra of primordial GWs sufficiently to reproduce the signal from the NANOGrav data within 1-3 standard deviation. However, a suppression mechanism for high-frequency modes must be introduced to conservatively obey the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound. While there are regions of the parameter space that reproduce the signal, it remains a challenge to simultaneously respect the BBN and cosmic microwave background bounds without making the graviton mass cutoff time too deep into the matter-dominated era.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. Optical identification and properties of galaxy clusters and groups in the western galactic hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) provides the largest intracluster medium-selected galaxy cluster and group catalog covering the western galactic hemisphere. Compared to samples selected purely on X-ray extent, the sample purity can be enhanced by identifying cluster candidates using optical and near-infrared data from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. Using the red-sequence-based cluster finder eROMaPPer, we measured individual photometric properties (redshift $z_\lambda$, richness $\lambda$, optical center, and BCG position) for 12,000 eRASS1 clusters over a sky area of 13,116 deg$^2$, augmented by 247 cases identified by matching the candidates with known clusters from the literature. The median redshift of the identified eRASS1 sample is $z=0.31$, with 10% of the clusters at $z&gt;0.72$. The photometric redshifts have an accuracy of $\delta z/(1+z)&lt;0.005$ for $0.05&lt;z&lt;0.9$. Spectroscopic cluster properties (redshift $z_{\rm spec}$ and velocity dispersion $\sigma$) are measured a posteriori for a subsample of 3,210 and 1,499 eRASS1 clusters, respectively, using an extensive compilation of spectroscopic redshifts of galaxies from the literature. We infer that the primary eRASS1 sample has a purity of 86% and optical completeness &gt;95% for $z&gt;0.05$. For these and further quality assessments of the eRASS1 identified catalog, we applied our identification method to a collection of galaxy cluster catalogs in the literature, as well as blindly on the full Legacy Surveys covering 24,069 deg$^2$. Using a combination of these cluster samples, we investigated the velocity dispersion-richness relation, finding $\log(\lambda)=2.401\times\log(\sigma)-5.074$ with an intrinsic scatter of $0.10\pm0.01$ dex. Our main result is the identified eRASS1 cluster catalog with a high purity and a well-defined X-ray selection process, enabling precise cosmological analyses presented in companion papers.</description>

      <title>Impact of Dark Sector Preheating on CMB Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prediction of a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of curvature and tensor fluctuations is among the main features of cosmic inflation. The current measurements of the primordial fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide tight constraints on the amplitude of the scalar and tensor spectra, and the scalar tilt. However, the precise connection between these observables and a given inflationary model, depends on the expansion history between the end of inflation and the beginning of the radiation dominated era, which corresponds to the reheating epoch. This mapping between horizon exit and reentry of fluctuations, parametrized by the number of $e$-folds $N_*$, can therefore be affected by the presence of a transient epoch of non-perturbative particle production during reheating ({\em preheating}). Using a combination of perturbative and lattice computations, we quantify the impact of preheating in a non-equilibrated dark matter sector on the CMB observables, under the assumption of a simultaneous perturbative decay of the inflaton into Standard Model particles. Combined with structure formation constraints, this allows us to impose stringent bounds on the post-inflationary reheating temperature.</description>

      <title>Reassessing constant-roll Warm Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Departing from standard slow-roll conditions is one way of putting the inflationary paradigm to test, and constraining the dynamics of the inflaton field with a constant-rate of roll of the inflaton field, a.k.a. the constant-roll scenario, is one way of exploring such deviation from the standard slow-roll dynamics. In this manuscript we explore such a possibility in a variant inflationary scenario, known as Warm Inflation. We construct and derive the conditions for having constant-roll WI models where inflation lasts at least for 60 $e-$folds, gracefully exits the constant-roll inflation phase, and maintains near thermal equilibrium of the system which is an essential feature of WI in the slow-roll regime. We show that while certain models of WI (the ones with dissipative coefficient as a function of temperature alone) can accommodate constant-roll dynamics, others (with dissipative coefficient as a function of temperature and the inflaton field both) fail to maintain thermal equilibrium once the constant-roll condition is imposed and hence cannot produce a constant-roll WI phase.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds on the Mass of Fundamental Fields from Primordial Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations in the vacuum zero point energy associated to quantum fields and their statistical distributions during inflation. It is shown that the perturbations in the vacuum zero point energy have large amplitudes which are highly non-Gaussian. The effects of vacuum zero point fluctuations can be interpreted as the loop corrections in primordial power spectrum and bispectrum. Requiring that the primordial curvature perturbation to remain nearly Gaussian and the loop corrections to be under perturbative control impose strong upper bounds on the mass of fundamental fields during inflation. We show that the fundamental fields can not be much heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, otherwise their vacuum zero point fluctuations induce large non-Gaussianities in primordial perturbations. Considering the observational upper bound on tensor to scalar ratio, we conclude that all fundamental fields are lighter than $10^{14}$ GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1510.05020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A model of dark sector where $O({\rm few~GeV})$ mass dark matter particles $\chi$ couple to a lighter dark force mediator $V$, $m_V \ll m_\chi$, is motivated by the recently discovered mismatch between simulated and observed shapes of galactic haloes. Such models, in general, provide a challenge for direct detection efforts and collider searches. We show that for a large range of coupling constants and masses, the production and decay of the bound states of $\chi$, such as $0^{-+}$ and $1^{--}$ states, $\eta_D$ and $ \Upsilon_D$, is an important search channel. We show that $e^+e^-\to \eta_D +V$ or $\Upsilon_D +\gamma$ production at $B$-factories for $\alpha_D &gt; 0.1$ is sufficiently strong to result in multiple pairs of charged leptons and pions via $\eta_D\to 2V \to 2(l^+l^-)$ and $\Upsilon_D\to 3V \to 3(l^+l^-)$ $(l=e,\mu,\pi)$. The absence of such final states in the existing searches performed at \babar\ and Belle sets new constraints on the parameter space of the model. We also show that a search for multiple bremsstrahlung of dark force mediators, $e^+e^-\to \chi\bar\chi+nV$, resulting in missing energy and multiple leptons, will further improve the sensitivity to self-interacting dark matter.</description>

Abstract: We study the kinetic mixing between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photon and the birefringent dark photon. These birefringent dark photon may exist in parity-violating dark sector, for example, through the coupling to axion field. We show that the birefringence of the dark photon propagates to the CMB photon, but the resulting birefringence may not be isotropic over the sky, but will be anisotropic in general. Moreover, our investigation sheds light on the essential role played by kinetic mixing in the generation of two fundamental characteristics of the CMB: circular polarization and spectral distortion.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the formation of high-redshift supermassive black holes (SMBHs) via the direct collapse of baryonic clouds, where the unwanted formation of molecular hydrogen is successfully suppressed by a Lyman-Werner (LW) photon background from relic particle decay. We improve on existing studies by dynamically simulating the collapse, accounting for the adiabatic contraction of the DM halo, as well as the in-situ production of the LW photons within the cloud which reduce the impact of the cloud's shielding. We find a viable parameter space where the decay of either some of the dark matter or all of a subdominant decaying species successfully allows direct collapse of the cloud to a SMBH.</description>

      <title>On the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Debye shielding cannot be employed to constrain the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles, contrary to what is stated in the previous literature. Current model-independent bounds on the monopole abundance are then revisited for unit Dirac magnetic charge. We find that the Andromeda Parker bound can be employed to set an upper limit on the monopole flux at the level of $F_M\lesssim 5.3\times 10^{-19}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{sr}^{-1}$ for a monopole mass $10^{13}\,\text{GeV}/c^2\lesssim m\lesssim 10^{16}\,\text{GeV}/c^2$, which is more stringent than the MACRO direct search limit by two orders of magnitude. This translates into stringent constraints on the monopole density parameter $\Omega_M$ at the level of $10^{-7}-10^{-4}$ depending on the mass. For larger monopole masses the scenarios in which magnetic monopoles account for all or the majority of dark matter are disfavored.</description>

Abstract: In order to investigate the potential observational signals of different regularization ambiguities in loop quantum cosmological models, we systematically compute and compare the primordial scalar power spectra and the resulting angular power spectra in the standard loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and its Thiemann regularized versions -- modified LQC-I/II (mLQC-I/II), using both the dressed metric and the hybrid approaches. All three loop quantum cosmological models yield a non-singular bounce with a post-bounce physics that converges rapidly in a few Planck seconds. Using Starobinsky potential and the initial conditions for the background dynamics chosen to yield the same inflationary e-foldings, which are fixed to be $65$ in all three LQC models, we require that all three models result in the same scale-invariant regime for the primordial power spectrum with a relative difference of less than one percent. This permits us to explore the differences resulting from the deep Planck regime in the angular power spectrum. For the adiabatic states, our results demonstrate that the angular power spectrum predicted by the hybrid approach has a smaller deviation from the angular power spectrum predicted by the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model at large angles in comparison with the dressed metric approach for all three models. The angular power spectrum predicted by mLQC-I in both the hybrid and the dressed metric approaches shows the smallest deviation from the one predicted by the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model at large angular scales, except for the case of fourth order adiabatic initial states in the hybrid approach. On the contrary, mLQC-II results in the largest deviations for the amplitude of the angular power spectrum at large angles and is most disfavored.</description>

      <title>Black hole event horizons are cosmologically coupled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that an exactly static and spherically symmetric black hole event horizon cannot be embedded in a time-dependent geometry. Forcing it to do so results in a naked null singularity at the would-be horizon. Therefore, since the universe is expanding, black holes must couple to the cosmological expansion, which was suggested as the growth mechanism for supermassive black holes in galaxies, with implications for the dark energy puzzle.</description>
