      <title>Non-invertible and higher-form symmetries in 2+1d lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore exact generalized symmetries in the standard 2+1d lattice $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to the Ising model, and compare them with their continuum field theory counterparts. One model has a (non-anomalous) non-invertible symmetry, and we identify two distinct non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases. The non-invertible algebra involves a lattice condensation operator, which creates a toric code ground state from a product state. Another model has a mixed anomaly between a 1-form symmetry and an ordinary symmetry. This anomaly enforces a nontrivial transition in the phase diagram, consistent with the "Higgs=SPT" proposal. Finally, we discuss how the symmetries and anomalies in these two models are related by gauging, which is a 2+1d version of the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating charge-density-wave correlations in the three-band Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-temperature superconducting cuprates host unidirectional spin- and charge-density-wave orders that can intertwine with superconductivity in non-trivial ways. While the charge components of these stripes have now been observed in nearly all cuprate families, their detailed evolution with doping varies across different materials and at high and low temperatures. We address this problem using non-perturbative determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations for the three-band Hubbard model. Using an efficient implementation, we can resolve the model's fluctuating spin and charge modulations and map their evolution as a function of the charge transfer energy and doping. We find that the incommensurability of the charge modulations is decoupled from the spin modulations and decreases with hole doping, consistent with experimental measurements at high temperatures. These findings support the proposal that the high-temperature charge correlations are distinct from the intertwined stripe order observed at low-temperature and in the single-band Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Exploring quantum criticality and ergodicity-breaking dynamics in spin-1 Kitaev chains via single-ion anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological gauge-theory terms and quantum criticality in spin-1 Kitaev chain with generic single-ion anisotropies (SIAs). The ground-state phase diagram, including Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) phase and gapless dimer phase, is determined by the infinite time evolving block decimation (iTEBD) method. By varying the strength of uniaxial SIA, there is quantum phase transition between the KSL phase and the dimer phase, which is equivalent to the confinement-deconfinement transition in the lattice Schwinger model with a topological $\theta$-angle of $\pi$. Here, we demonstrate an added rhombic SIA to the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric model shifts topological angle $\theta$ away from $\pi$, leading to the emergence of $y$-ferroquadrupole and $x$-ferroquadrupole phases for negative and positive values of rhombic SIAs, respectively. By adjusting these rhombic SIAs, the system from the $y$-ferroquadrupole to the $x$-ferroquadrupole phases undergoes either a crossover through the KSL phase or a genuine phase transition through the deconfined line, thus providing an example for unnecessary phase transitions. We find the spin-1 Hamiltonian can be exactly mapped to the spin-1/2 effective extended PXP Hamiltonian coupled to all positive $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges, where the uniaxial SIA is equivalent to the uniform detuning while the rhombic SIA plays a role of staggered detuning. We then examine the hierarchical fragmentation of the Hilbert space and its associated dynamics in specific limiting cases. The quantum many-body scar (QMBS) arises from the Fibonacci constraint under a weak field of SIAs. When the staggered detuning is sufficiently large, the resultant slow dynamics can be nominally understood using a second-order effective Hamiltonian derived by the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation.</description>

      <title>Spin Green's Function Approach to Understanding Localized Majorana Fermions in the Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kitaev model, defined on a honeycomb lattice, features an exactly solvable ground state with fractionalized Majorana fermion excitations, which can potentially form non-Abelian anyons crucial for fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. Although Majorana fermions are essential for obtaining the exact ground state, their physical interpretation in terms of spin operators remains unclear. In this study, we employ a Green's function approach that maintains SU(2) symmetry to address this issue and explore the model's finite temperature properties. Our results demonstrate that the computed temperature dependence of the correlation functions closely approximates the exact values at zero temperature, confirming the accuracy of our method. We also present several exact results concerning the spin Green's function and spin-spin correlation functions that are specific to the Kitaev model. Furthermore, the spin Green's function effectively describes the behavior of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes, which are formed by the product of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fields around the sides of each hexagon, where the gauge field has the form of the product of two localized Majorana fermions. However, the contribution of itinerant Majorana fermions remains an open challenge for future research.</description>

      <title>Spinons in a new Shastry-Sutherland lattice magnet Pr$_2$Ga$_2$BeO$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the elusive spinon excitations in quantum spin liquid (QSL) materials is what scientists have long sought for. Recently, thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) has emerged to be a decisive probe because the fermionic nature of spinons leads to a characteristic nonzero linear $\kappa_0/T$ term while approaching zero Kelvin. So far, only a few systems have been reported to exhibit such term. Here, we report a $\kappa_0/T \approx$ 0.01 WK$^{-2}$m$^{-1}$, the largest $\kappa_0/T$ value ever observed in magnetic oxide QSL candidates, in a new quantum magnet Pr$_2$Ga$_2$BeO$_7$ with a Shastry-Sutherland lattice (SSL). Its QSL nature is further supported by the power-law temperature dependence of the specific heat, a plateau of muon spin relaxation rate, and gapless inelastic neutron spectra. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the introduction of XY spin anisotropy is the key for Pr$_2$Ga$_2$BeO$_7$ to be the first QSL realized on the SSL, after more than four decades of extensive studies on this celebrated magnetically frustrated lattice.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbital excitations encoding the magnetic phase transition in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rich phases of van der Waals (vdW) materials featuring intertwined electronic order and collective phenomena, characterizing elementary dynamics that entail the low-energy Hamiltonian and electronic degrees of freedom is of paramount importance. Here we performed resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to elaborate the spin-orbital ground and excited states of the vdW antiferromagnetic insulator FePS$_{3}$, as well as their relation to magnetism. We observed the spectral enhancement of spin-orbital multiplet transitions about $\sim$ 100 and $\sim$ 220 meV, as well as quasielastic response, when entering the zig-zag antiferromagnetic phase, where the spectral changes develop an order-parameter-like evolution with temperature. By comparing with ligand field theory calculations, we discovered the essential role of trigonal lattice distortion and negative metal-ligand charge-transfer to account for these emergent excitations. Such spectral profiles are further examined upon confinement by mechanical exfoliation. We reveal their spectral robustness down to the few atomic layer limit, in accordance with the persistent antiferromagnetic state previously reported in optical measurements. Our study demonstrates the versatile RIXS capability that resolves magneto-crystalline anisotropy and charge-transfer energetics. These provide the crucial insight to understand how the spontaneous magnetic symmetry-breaking stabilizes in the quasi-two-dimensional limit for the vdW magnet FePS$_{3}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum melting of long-range ordered quantum antiferromagnets investigated by momentum-space continuous similarity transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply continuous similarity transformations (CSTs) to study the zero-temperature breakdown of long-range ordered quantum antiferromagnets. The CST flow equations are truncated in momentum space by the scaling dimension so that all operators with scaling dimension up to two are taken into account. We determine the quantum phase transition out of the N\'eel-ordered phase in the unfrustrated square lattice Heisenberg bilayer as well as the quantum melting of the N\'eel-ordered and columnar phase in the highly frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ model on the square lattice. In all cases the CST is set up to isolate the ground state so that the stability of the flow equations, the ground-state energy, and the sublattice magnetization are used to explore the long-range ordered phases. We extract quantum-critical points which agree well with values in the literature. Further, we estimate the associated critical exponents $\alpha$ and $\beta$ which turns out to be a challenging task for the CST approach.</description>

      <title>Disorder Enhanced Thermalization in Interacting Many-Particle System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the non-equilibrium dynamical mean field theory to incorporate the effects of static random disorder in the dynamics of a many-particle system by integrating out different disorder configurations resulting in an effective time-dependent density-density interaction. We use this method to study the non-equilibrium transient dynamics of a system described by the Fermi Anderson-Hubbard model following an interaction and disorder quench. The method recovers the solution of the disorder-free case for which the system exhibits qualitatively distinct dynamical behaviors in the weak-coupling (prethermalization) and strong-coupling regimes (collapse-and-revival oscillations). However, we find that weak random disorder promotes thermalization. In the weak coupling regime, the jump in the quasiparticle weight in the prethermal regime is suppressed by random disorder while in the strong-coupling regime, random disorder reduces the amplitude of the quasiparticle weight oscillations. These results highlight the importance of disorder in the dynamics of realistic many-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-Peierls transition in the frustrated spinels ZnCr2O4 and MgCr2O4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chromium spinels MgCr2O4 and ZnCr2O4 are prime examples of the highly frustrated pyrochlore lattice antiferromagnet. Experiment has carefully established that both materials, upon cooling, distort to lower symmetry and order magnetically. We study the nature of this process by a combination of density-functional-theory based energy mapping and classical Monte Carlo simulations. We first computationally establish precise Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameters for the high temperature cubic and the low temperature tetragonal and orthorhombic structures of both spinels. We then investigate the respective ordering temperatures of high symmetry and low symmetry structures. We carefully compare our results with experimental facts and find that our simulations are remarkably consistent with a type of spin-Peierls mechanism, adapted to three dimensions, where the structural distortion is mediated by a magnetic energy gain due to a lower degree of frustration.</description>

      <title>Out-of-plane magnetic phase diagram of Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate Na2Co2TeO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the magnetic properties and mapped out the phase diagram of the honeycomb magnet Na2Co2TeO6 with Co 3d7 in out-of-plane magnetic fields. This material has previously been proposed to show nearest-neighbor Kitaev interactions between Co spins and maybe even Kitaev quantum spin liquid behavior in high fields. At low magnetic fields, we observe a thermal phase transition at TN = 27 K, transitioning from a paramagnetic state to a canonical ferrimagnetic state. Under the application of magnetic fields, a spin flop-like phase transition occurred before saturation of J = 1/2 between 10 K and TN. Below 10 K, a peak-dip-peak structure emerges between 10 and 17 T in the magnetic susceptibility (dM/dH) before the magnetic saturation, reminiscent of magnetic plateau behavior. The measurement of the magnetocaloric effect also shows dip-peak-dip behavior in this field range. Our data can be explained by an XXZ model with a single ion anisotropy and possibly small Kitaev and {\Gamma} exchange interactions. We also unambiguously determined the magnetization saturation field that helps constrain the energy scale of the exchange interactions</description>

      <title>Spin-$S\,$ Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice: A high-order treatment via the many-body coupled cluster method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spin-$S$ Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice for $S\!=\!1/2$, $1$ and $3/2$, by using the coupled cluster method (CCM) of microscopic quantum many-body theory. This system is one of the earliest extensions of the Kitaev model and is believed to contain two extended spin liquid phases for any value of the spin quantum number $S$. We show that the CCM delivers accurate estimates for the phase boundaries of these spin liquid phases, as well as other transition points in the phase diagram. Moreover, we find evidence of two unexpected narrow phases for $S\!=\!1/2$, one sandwiched between the zigzag and ferromagnetic phases and the other between the N\'eel and the stripy phases. The results establish the CCM as a versatile numerical technique that can capture the strong quantum-mechanical fluctuations that are inherently present in generalized Kitaev models with competing bond-dependent anisotropies.</description>

      <title>Concurrence of directional Kondo transport and incommensurate magnetic order in the layered material AgCrSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report on the concurrent emergence of the directional Kondo behavior and incommensurate magnetic ordering in a layered material. We employ temperature- and magnetic field-dependent resistivity measurements, susceptibility measurements, and high resolution wavelength X-ray diffraction spectroscopy to study the electronic properties of AgCrSe$_2$. Impurity Kondo behavior with a characteristic temperature of $T_\text K$ = 32 K is identified through quantitative analysis of the in-plane resistivity, substantiated by magneto-transport measurements. The agreement between our experimental data and the Schlottmann's scaling theory allows us to determine the impurity spin as $S$ = 3/2. Furthermore, we discuss the origin of the Kondo behavior and its relation to the material's antiferromagnetic transition. Our study uncovers an unusual phenomenon -- the equivalence of the N\'eel temperature and the Kondo temperature -- paving the way for further investigations into the intricate interplay between impurity physics and magnetic phenomena in quantum materials, with potential applications in advanced electronic and magnetic devices.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of orbital ordering in cooperative Jahn-Teller models: Machine-learning enabled large-scale simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning (ML) force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of cooperative Jahn-Teller (JT) systems. Large scale dynamical simulations of the JT model also shed light on the orbital ordering dynamics in colossal magnetoresistance manganites. The JT effect in these materials describes the distortion of local oxygen octahedra driven by a coupling to the orbital degrees of freedom of $e_g$ electrons. An effective electron-mediated interaction between the local JT modes leads to a structural transition and the emergence of long-range orbital order at low temperatures. Assuming the principle of locality, a deep-learning neural-network model is developed to accurately and efficiently predict the electron-induced forces that drive the dynamical evolution of JT phonons. A group-theoretical method is utilized to develop a descriptor that incorporates the combined orbital and lattice symmetry into the ML model. Large-scale Langevin dynamics simulations, enabled by the ML force-field models, are performed to investigate the coarsening dynamics of the composite JT distortion and orbital order after a thermal quench. The late-stage coarsening of orbital domains exhibits pronounced freezing behaviors which are likely related to the unusual morphology of the domain structures. Our work highlights a promising avenue for multi-scale dynamical modeling of correlated electron systems.</description>

Abstract: We study electron-electron interaction induced states of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ in an out-of-plane magnetic field $B\hat{\bf z}$ near one hole per moir\'e unit cell filling. The 3D phase diagram showing the evolution of competing phases with $B$, interaction strength and an out-of-plane electric field is presented at electron fillings that follow the Diophantine equation along Chern number $-\text{sign}\left(B\right)$ line, that is pointing away from the charge neutral filling, where we find prominent Chern insulators consistent with the experiments. We also explain the experimental absence of prominent Chern insulators along the Chern number $+\text{sign}\left(B\right)$ line.</description>

      <title>Role of stacking defects on the magnetic behavior of CrCl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of van der Waals-layered magnetic materials, the properties of CrCl$_3$ continue to attract attention. This compound is reported to undergo antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering below $\sim$14 K, with a ferromagneticlike region proposed to exist between 14 and 17 K. Ideally, the crystal structure is rhombohedral (R) below $\sim$235 K, separated from a higher-temperature monoclinic (M) phase by a layer-sliding structural phase transition. However, the structural transition is often inhibited even in bulk single crystals, allowing M-type layer stacking, reported to have a tenfold greater interlayer magnetic coupling than R-type stacking, to be present at low temperature. To clarify the effect of stacking defects on CrCl$_3$, we report magnetization measurements on samples of varying crystalline quality. At low applied magnetic field, some crystals predominantly show the $T_N=14$ K peak, but other crystals show hysteretic behavior and a magnetization enhancement at a slightly higher temperature ($14 &lt; T \lesssim 17$ K.) Samples with anomalous behavior exhibit a transition around $\sim$2 T in isothermal magnetization-field data, providing evidence that M-type stacking defects are the source of these anomalies. Ground powder samples are especially likely to show strongly anomalous behavior. We suggest that the anomalous behavior arises from few-layer magnetic domains that form just above $T_N$ in an environment of mixed interlayer magnetic coupling strength. We argue that the influence of M-type stacking boundaries on sublattice magnetization is already observable in reported neutron scattering data, and may be responsible for a certain feature in reported specific heat data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landau Fermi liquid theory, a cornerstone in condensed matter physics, encounters limitations in explaining certain phenomena, like the peculiar behavior of strange metals in high-temperature superconductors. Non-Fermi liquids, like Bose metals with uncondensed bosonic ground state, offer potential explanations, yet constructing an elusive Bose metal phase in two dimensions (2D) remains a formidable challenge. Utilizing constraint path quantum Monte Carlo and functional renormalization group methods on a fermionic system with spin anisotropy in a 2D lattice, we reveal the emergence of a Cooper pair Bose metal in a highly anisotropic regime (a &lt; 0.30) with wide range of filling, most notably at a filling fraction of n~0.8. Our findings exhibit a visible nonzero momentum Bose surface in the Cooper-pair distribution function, accompanied by a distinct signal of dxy correlation between pairs. Our results highlight that spin-dependent anisotropy in the Fermi surface leads to versatile pairing forms. Platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and recently proposed altermagnets hold promise for realizing this intriguing phase.</description>

Abstract: We study the topological Weyl type-II semimetal WTe$_2$ via Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and Density Functional Theory calculations (DFT). We succesfully determine the band structure at zero field close to the Fermi level by comparing quasiparticle interference (QPI) experiments with DFT. Under magnetic fields, we observe Landau level quantization on atomic scale measurements and find a level sequence evidencing a linearly dispersing portion of the band structure. Our results establish the long sought connection between Weyl cones and Landau quantization in WTe$_2$. Atomic scale Landau quantization emerges as a powerful probe of topological surface states for semimetals, superconductors and topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Quantum Energy Teleportation versus Information Teleportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET) is the phenomenon in which locally inaccessible energy is activated as extractable work through collaborative local operations and classical communication (LOCC) with an entangled partner. It closely resembles the more well-known quantum information teleportation (QIT) where quantum information can be sent through an entangled pair with LOCC. It is tempting to ask how QET is related to QIT. Here we report a first study of this connection. Despite the apparent similarity, we show that these two phenomena are not only distinct but moreover are mutually exclusive to each other. We show a perturbative trade-off relation between their performance in a thermal entangled chaotic many-body system, in which both QET and QIT are simultaneously implemented through a traversable wormhole in an emergent spacetime. To better understand their competition, we study the finite-dimensional counterpart of two entangled qudits and prove a universal non-perturbative trade-off bound. It shows that for any teleportation scheme, the overall performance of QET and QIT together is constrained by the amount of the entanglement resource. We discuss some explanations of our results.</description>

Abstract: Carbon-based nanostructures have unparalleled electronic properties. At the same time, using an allotrope of carbon as the contacts can yield better device control and reproducibility. In this work, we simulate a single-electron transistor composed of a segment of a graphene nanoribbon coupled to carbon nanotubes electrodes. Using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism we atomistically describe the electronic transport properties of the system including electron-electron interactions. Using this methodology we are able to recover experimentally observed phenomena, such as the Coulomb blockade, as well as the corresponding Coulomb diamonds. Furthermore, we are able to separate the different contributions to transport and show that incoherent effects due to the interaction play a crucial role in the transport properties depending on the region of the stability diagram being considered.</description>

Abstract: Mesoscopic superconducting islands hosting Majorana zero modes (MZMs), or Majorana islands in short, offer a prototype of topological qubits. In this work we investigate theoretically the model of a generic Majorana island tunneling-coupled to a single-piece metallic substrate, hence an \textit{embedded Majorana island}. We show the crucial consequences of an interplay between the topological ground states nonlocally addressed by the MZMs and the metallic bath with coherent electron propagation: on the one hand, the topological degeneracy on the Majorana island can be preserved, by virtue of the particle-hole symmetry, despite the apparent bath-induced coupling between MZMs; on the other hand, the electronic interference in the metallic bath may lead to profound alterations to the renormalization group behavior of the hybrid system towards low energy/temperature compared with conventional Kondo physics. This work serves to establish the model of embedded Majorana islands as an experimentally relevant and theoretically intriguing problem particularly in the direction of topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Odd-frequency pairing of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in superconductor junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a superconductor Josephson junction with a Bogoliubov Fermi surface, employing McMillan's Green's function technique. The low-energy degrees of freedom are described by spinless fermions (bogolons), where the characteristic feature appears as an odd-frequency pair potential. The differential equation of the Green's function is reduced to the eigenvalue problem of the non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian. The physical quantities such as the density of states and pair amplitude are then extracted from the obtained Green's function. We find that the zero energy local density of states at the interface decreases as the relative phase of the Josephson junction increases. This decrease is accompanied by the generation of an even-frequency pair amplitude near the interface. We also clarify that the $\pi$-junction-like current phase relation is realized in terms of bogolons. In contrast to conventional $s$-wave superconductor junctions, where even-frequency pairs dominate in the bulk and odd-frequency pairs are generated near the interface, our findings illuminate the distinct behaviors of junctions with Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. We further explore spatial dependences of these physical quantities systematically using quasiclassical Green's functions.</description>

      <title>Emergence of spatial patterns and synchronization in superconducting time crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a time crystal phase characterized by a frequency half of the driving frequency in disordered superconductors by employing the time dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism at zero temperature with a periodically driven coupling constant. After a period of exponential increase of spatial inhomogeneities and exponential suppression of the order parameter amplitude, the time crystal develops islands of different sizes. Each of these islands is a time crystal with the same frequency albeit with a phase shift $\pi$ with respect to the homogeneous time crystal. After its emergence, the island gradually becomes smaller, though the phase shift persists, until it is abruptly synchronized at a time that it depends on its initial size. We find a critical disorder strength, still deep in the metallic phase, at which the time crystal phase terminates. For even stronger disorder, the order parameter oscillates with the driving frequency in regions where localization effects are not important.</description>

      <title>Active Magnetic Matter: Propelling Ferrimagnetic Domain Walls by Dynamical Frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active matter encompasses many-particle systems with self-propelling units, such as flocks of birds or schools of fish. Here, we show how self-propelling domain walls can be realised in a solid-state system when a ferrimagnet is weakly driven out of thermal equilibrium by an oscillating field. This activates the Goldstone mode, inducing a rotation of the antiferromagnetic xy-order in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction, determined by the sign of the ferromagnetic component. Two opposite directions of rotation meet at a ferromagnetic domain wall, resulting in 'dynamical frustration', with three main consequences. (i) Domain walls move actively in a direction chosen by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Their speed is proportional to the square root of the driving power across large parameter regimes. (ii) In one dimension (1D), after a quench into the ferrimagnetic phase, this motion and strong hydrodynamic interactions lead to a linear growth of the magnetic correlation length over time, much faster than in equilibrium. (iii) The dynamical frustration makes the system highly resilient to noise. The correlation length of the weakly driven 1D system can be orders of magnitude larger than in the corresponding equilibrium system with the same noise level.</description>

      <title>Theory of Generalized Landau Levels and Implication for non-Abelian States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry is a fundamental concept to characterize the local properties of quantum states. It is recently demonstrated that saturating certain quantum geometric bounds allows a topological Chern band to share many essential features with the lowest Landau level, facilitating fractionalized phases in moir\'e flat bands. In this work, we systematically extend the consequence and universality of saturated geometric bounds to arbitrary Landau levels by introducing a set of single-particle states, which we term as ``generalized Landau levels''. These generalized Landau levels exhibit exactly quantized values of integrated trace of quantum metric determined by their corresponding Landau level indices, regardless of the nonuniformity of their quantum geometric quantities. We derive all geometric quantities for individual and multiple generalized Landau levels, discuss their relations, and understand them in light of the theory of holomorphic curves and moving frames. We further propose a model by superposing few generalized Landau levels which is supposed to capture a large portion of the single-particle Hilbert space of a generic Chern band analogous to the first Landau level. Using this model, we employ exact diagonalization to identify a single-particle geometric criterion for permitting the non-Abelian Moore-Read phase, which is potentially useful for future engineering of moir\'e materials and beyond. We use a double twisted bilayer graphene model with only adjacent layer hopping term to show the existence of first generalized Landau level type narrow band and zero-field Moore-Read state at the second magic angle which serves as a promising starting point for more detailed future studies. We expect that generalized Landau levels will serve as a systematic tool for analyzing topological Chern bands and fractionalized phases therein.</description>

      <title>Functional Renormalization Group Analysis of $O(3)$ Nonlinear Sigma Model and Non-Abelian Bosonization Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the $SU(2)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model is dual to the free fermion theory in two dimensions via non-Abelian bosonization. Additionally, the $SU(2)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model is believed to be equivalent to the $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model with the theta term. In this work, we reexamine this duality through the lens of renormalization group (RG) flow. We analyze the RG flow structure of the $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model with the theta term in two dimensions using the functional renormalization group. Our results reveal a nontrivial fixed point with a nonzero value of the topological coupling. The scaling dimensions (critical exponents) at this fixed point suggest the realization of duality between the $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model with the theta term and the free fermion theory, indicating that these models belong to the same universality class.</description>

      <title>Engineering ultra-strong electron-phonon coupling and nonclassical electron transport in crystalline gold with nanoscale interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical resistivity in good metals, particularly noble metals such as gold (Au), silver (Ag), or copper, increases linearly with temperature ($T$) for $T &gt; \Theta_{\mathrm{D}}$, where $\Theta_{\mathrm{D}}$ is the Debye temperature. This is because the coupling ($\lambda$) between the electrons and the lattice vibrations, or phonons, in these metals is rather weak with $\lambda \sim 0.1-0.2$, and a perturbative analysis suffices to explain the $T$-linear electron-phonon scattering rate. In this work, we outline a new nanostructuring strategy of crystalline Au where this foundational concept of metallic transport breaks down. We show that by embedding a distributed network of ultra-small Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) of radius $\sim1-2$ nm inside a crystalline Au shell, an unprecedented enhancement in the electron-phonon interaction, with $\lambda$ as high as $\approx 20$, can be achieved. This is over hundred times that of bare Au or Ag, and ten times larger than any known metal. With increasing AgNP density, the electrical resistivity deviates from $T$-linearity, and approaches a saturation to the Mott-Ioffe-Regel scale $\rho_{\mathrm{MIR}}\sim h a /e^2$ for both disorder ($T\to 0$) and phonon ($T \gg \Theta_{\mathrm{D}}$)-dependent components of resistivity (here, $a=0.3$~nm, is the lattice constant of Au). This giant electron-phonon interaction, which we suggest arises from the coulomb interaction-induced coupling of conduction electrons to the localized phonon modes at the buried Au-Ag hetero-interfaces, allows experimental access to a regime of nonclassical metallic transport that has never been probed before.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets constitute a novel, third fundamental class of collinear magnetic ordered materials, alongside with ferro- and antiferromagnets. They share with conventional antiferromagnets the feature of a vanishing net magnetization. At the same time they show a spin-splitting of electronic bands, just as in ferromagnets, caused by the atomic exchange interaction. Interestingly, the altermagnetic spin-splitting may in principle allow for topological electronic structures far beyond collinear antiferromagnets with spin-degenerate bands. Here, using high-resolution and spin angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe that the momentum-dependent spin-splitting in altermagnetic CrSb reaches up to 1 eV, while vanishing at high symmetry lines in the Brillouin zone. We find it causes spin-carrying altermagnetic Weyl points, and observe their protected Fermi-arc surface states. This establishes that in altermagnets the large energy scale intrinsic to the spin-splitting - orders of magnitude larger that the relativistic spin-orbit coupling - creates its own realm of robust electronic topology, with spin-polarized topological surface states that are altermagnetic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials have enabled the realization of flat electron bands and quantum phases that are driven by strong correlations associated with flat bands. Superconductivity has been observed, but solely, in graphene moir\'e materials. The absence of robust superconductivity in moir\'e materials beyond graphene, such as semiconductor moir\'e materials, has remained a mystery and challenged our current understanding of superconductivity in flat bands. Here, we report the observation of robust superconductivity in 3.65-degree twisted bilayer WSe2 which hosts a honeycomb moir\'e lattice. Superconductivity emerges at half-band filling and under small sublattice potential differences, where the moir\'e band is a flat Chern band. The optimal superconducting transition temperature is about 220 mK and constitutes 2% of the effective Fermi temperature; the latter is comparable to the value in high-temperature cuprate superconductors and suggests strong pairing. The superconductor borders on two distinct metals below and above half-band filling; it undergoes a continuous transition to a correlated insulator by tuning the sublattice potential difference. The observed superconductivity on the verge of Coulomb-induced charge localization suggests roots in strong electron correlations.</description>

Abstract: Plutonium's phase diagram is host to complex structures and interactions that make the description of its ground state properties elusive. Using all-electron density functional theory, we study the thermodynamic properties of $\alpha$-Pu. To do this, we build on recent work in the literature by introducing a novel noncollinear magnetic ansatz for $\alpha$-Pu's ground state. The noncollinear ansatz accurately recovers the experimental phonon density of states, heat capacity, and thermal expansion. These new results on $\alpha$-Pu along with recent results on $\delta$-Pu demonstrate the efficacy of noncollinear ansatzes for the description of plutonium.</description>

Abstract: Monte Carlo methods have led to profound insights into the strong-coupling behaviour of lattice gauge theories and produced remarkable results such as first-principles computations of hadron masses. Despite tremendous progress over the last four decades, fundamental challenges such as the sign problem and the inability to simulate real-time dynamics remain. Neural network quantum states have emerged as an alternative method that seeks to overcome these challenges. In this work, we use gauge-invariant neural network quantum states to accurately compute the ground state of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories in $2+1$ dimensions. Using transfer learning, we study the distinct topological phases and the confinement phase transition of these theories. For $\mathbb{Z}_2$, we identify a continuous transition and compute critical exponents, finding excellent agreement with existing numerics for the expected Ising universality class. In the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ case, we observe a weakly first-order transition and identify the critical coupling. Our findings suggest that neural network quantum states are a promising method for precise studies of lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Electric, thermal, and thermoelectric magnetoconductivity for Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals in planar Hall set-ups induced by the combined effects of topology and strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations where a three-dimensional Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the combined influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $, generalizing the considerations of Phys. Rev. B 108 (2023) 155132 and Physica E 159 (2024) 115914. The electromagnetic fields are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other, thus leading to the possibility of having a collinear component, which does not arise in a Hall set-up. The net effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $ consists of two parts - (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $ applied externally; and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. Using a semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we derive the generic expressions for the response tensors, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the bandstructures. We elucidate the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the longitudinal and transverse (or Hall) components of the electric, thermal, and thermoelectric response tensors. Especially, for the planar transverse components of the response tensors, the OMM part acts exclusively in opposition (sync) with the BC-only part for the Weyl (multi-Weyl) semimetals.</description>

      <title>Nonmesonic Quantum Many-Body Scars in a 1D Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the meson excitations (particle-antiparticle bound states) in quantum many-body scars of a 1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to a dynamical spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain as a matter field. By introducing a string representation of the physical Hilbert space, we express a scar state $\ket {\Psi_{n,l}}$ as a superposition of all string bases with an identical string number $n$ and a total length $l$. For the small-$l$ scar state $\ket {\Psi_{n,l}}$, the gauge-invariant spin exchange correlation function of the matter field hosts an exponential decay as the distance increases, indicating the existence of stable mesons. However, for large $l$, the correlation function exhibits a power-law decay, signaling the emergence of nonmesonic excitations. Furthermore, we show that this mesonic-nonmesonic crossover can be detected by the quench dynamics, starting from two low-entangled initial states, respectively, which are experimentally feasible in quantum simulators. Our results expand the physics of quantum many-body scars in lattice gauge theories and reveal that the nonmesonic state can also manifest ergodicity breaking.</description>

      <title>Phases and Exotic Phase Transitions of a Two-Dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon model on a square lattice by means of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The addition of a symmetry-allowed interaction permits analytical integration over the phonons at the expense of discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich fields with imaginary-time correlations. Using single-spin-flip and global updates, we investigate the phase diagram at the O(4)-symmetric point as a function of hopping $t$ and phonon frequency $\omega_0$. For $t=0$, where electron hopping is boson assisted, the model maps onto an unconstrained $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. A key quantity is the emergent effective flux per plaquette, which equals $\pi$ in the assisted-hopping regime and vanishes for large $t$. Phases in the former regime can be understood in terms of instabilities of emergent Dirac fermions. Our results support a direct and continuous transition between a $(\pi,0)$ valence bond solid (VBS) and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase with increasing $\omega_0$. For large $t$ and small $\omega_0$, we find finite-temperature signatures, a disordered pseudogap phase, of a previously reported $(\pi,\pi)$ VBS ground state related to a nesting instability. With increasing $\omega_0$, AFM order again emerges.</description>

      <title>A Fermi Surface Descriptor Quantifying the Correlations between Anomalous Hall Effect and Fermi Surface Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last few decades, basic ideas of topology have completely transformed the prediction of quantum transport phenomena. Following this trend, we go deeper into the incorporation of modern mathematics into quantum material science focusing on geometry. Here we investigate the relation between the geometrical type of the Fermi surface and Anomalous and Spin Hall Effects. An index, $\mathbb{H}_F$, quantifying the hyperbolic geometry of the Fermi surface, shows a universal correlation (R$^2$ = 0.97) with the experimentally measured intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity, of 16 different compounds spanning a wide variety of crystal, chemical, and electronic structure families, including those where topological methods give R$^2$ = 0.52. This raises a question about the predictive limits of topological physics and its transformation into a wider study of bandstructures' and Fermi surfaces' geometries, opening horizon for prediction of phenomena beyond topological understanding.</description>

      <title>First principle prediction of structural distortions in the cuprates and their impact on the electronic structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials-realistic microscopic theoretical descriptions of copper-based superconductors are challenging due to their complex crystal structures combined with strong electron interactions. Here, we demonstrate how density functional theory can accurately describe key structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of the normal state of the prototypical cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212). We emphasize the importance of accounting for energy-lowering structural distortions, which then allows us to: (a) accurately describe the insulating antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state of the undoped parent compound (in contrast to the metallic state predicted by previous {\it ab initio} studies); (b) identify numerous low-energy competing spin and charge stripe orders in the hole-overdoped material nearly degenerate in energy with the AFM ordered state, indicating strong spin fluctuations; (c) predict the lowest-energy hole-doped crystal structure including its long-range structural distortions and oxygen dopant positions that match high-resolution scanning microscopy measurements; and (d) describe electronic bands near the Fermi energy with flat antinodal dispersions and Fermi surfaces that in agreement with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and provide a clear explanation for the structural origins of the so-called ``shadow bands''. We also show how one must go beyond band theory and include fully dynamic spin fluctuations via a many-body approach when aiming to make quantitative predictions to measure the ARPES spectra in the overdoped material.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional hydrodynamic electron flow through periodic and random potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic flow of electrons through a smooth potential energy landscape in two dimensions, for which the electrical current is concentrated along thin channels that follow percolating equipotential contours. The width of these channels, and hence the electrical resistance, is determined by a competition between viscous and thermoelectric forces. For the case of periodic (moir\'{e}) potentials, we find that hydrodynamic flow provides a new route to linear-in-$T$ resistivity. We calculate the associated prefactors for potentials with $C_3$ and $C_4$ symmetry. On the other hand, for a random potential the resistivity has qualitatively different behavior because equipotential paths become increasingly tortuous as their width is reduced. This effect leads to a resistivity that grows with temperature as $T^{10/3}$.</description>

      <title>Many-body Chern insulator in the Kondo lattice model on a triangular lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realization of topological insulators induced by correlation effects is one of the main issues of modern condensed matter physics. An intriguing example of the correlated topological insulators is a magnetic Chern insulator induced by a noncoplanar multiple-Q magnetic order. Although the realization of the magnetic Chern insulator has been studied in the classical limit of the Kondo lattice model, research on the magnetic Chern insulator in the original Kondo lattice model is limited. Here, we investigate the possibility of the many-body Chern insulator with the noncoplanar triple-Q magnetic order in the Kondo lattice model on a triangular lattice. Using the many-variable variational Monte Carlo method, we reveal that the triple-Q magnetic order becomes a ground state at quarter filling in an intermediate Kondo coupling region. We also show that the many-body Chern number is quantized to one in the triple-Q magnetic ordered phase utilizing the polarization operators. Our results provide a pathway for the realization of the many-body Chern insulator in correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Anyon condensation web and multipartite entanglement in 2D modulated gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an anyon condensation web that interconnects a broad class of 2D fracton gauge theories with multipolar conservation laws at a microscopic level. We find that condensation of anyons triggers the emergence of additional spatially modulated symmetries, which has the general effect of increasing the number of super-selection anyon sectors, as well as the ground state degeneracy for systems with periodic boundary conditions. As explicit examples, we start with the rank-2 toric code model and implement various anyon condensation protocols, resulting in a range of 2D fracton-like theories, each with a distinct gauge structure. We also expand the scope of anyon condensation by introducing lattice defects into spatially modulated gauge theories and demonstrate that these geometric defects can be viewed as effective anyon condensations along the branch cut. Furthermore, we introduce the Multipartite Entanglement Mutual Information measure as a diagnostic tool to differentiate among various distinct multipole conserving phases. A captivating observation is the UV sensitivity of the mutual information sourced from multipartite entanglement in such spatially modulated gauge theories, which depends on the geometric cut and the system size, and exhibits periodic oscillations at large distances.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement constitutes one of the key concepts in quantum mechanics and serves as an indispensable tool in the understanding of quantum many-body systems. In this work, we perform extensive numerical investigations of extensive entanglement properties of coupled quantum spin chains. This setup has proven useful for e.g. extending the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem to open systems, and contrasts the majority of previous research where the entanglement cut has one lower dimension than the system. We focus on the cases where the entanglement Hamiltonian is either gapless or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking behavior. We further employ conformal field theoretical formulae to identify the universal behavior in the former case. The results in our work can serve as a paradigmatic starting point for more systematic exploration of the largely uncharted physics of extensive entanglement, both analytical and numerical.</description>

      <title>Robust $T$-Linear Resistivity due to SU(4) Valley + Spin Fluctuation Mechanism in Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), non-Fermi liquid like transport phenomena are universally observed. To understand their origin, we perform the self-consistent analysis of the self-energy due to SU(4) valley + spin fluctuations induced by the electron-electron correlation. In the SU(4) fluctuation mechanism, the fifteen channels of fluctuations contribute additively to the self-energy. Therefore, the SU(4) fluctuation mechanism gives much higher electrical resistance than the spin fluctuation mechanism. By the same reason, SU(4) fluctuations of intermediate strength provide $T$-linear resistivity down to $\sim1$K. Interestingly, the $T$-linear resistivity is robustly realizedfor wide range of electron filling, even away from the van-Hove filling. This study provides a strong evidence for the importance of electron-electron correlation in MATBG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Luttinger model is a paradigm for the breakdown due to interactions of the Fermi liquid description of one-dimensional massless Dirac fermions. Attempts to discretize the model on a one-dimensional lattice have failed to reproduce the established bosonization results, because of the fermion-doubling obstruction: A local and symmetry-preserving discretization of the Hamiltonian introduces a spurious second species of low-energy excitations, while a nonlocal discretization opens a single-particle gap at the Dirac point. Here we show how to work around this obstruction, by discretizing both space and time to obtain a \textit{local} Lagrangian for a helical Luttinger liquid with Hubbard interaction. The approach enables quantum Monte Carlo simulations that preserve the topological protection of an unpaired Dirac cone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We map out the ground state phase diagram of a one-dimensional SU($N$) Kondo-Heisenberg lattice model at half filling and in the fully antisymmetric self-adjoint representation as a function of $\tfrac {1}{N}$ and Kondo coupling $J_k/t$. On the basis of auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations with even $N$ up to 8, we show that the enlarged SU($N\ge 4$) symmetry realizes a quantum phase transition separating a valence bond solid (VBS) phase occupying a weak coupling part of the phase diagram and the Kondo insulator (KI) state dominating in the strong $J_k/t$ limit. Along the phase boundary, we always observe critical exponents that belong to a two-dimensional classical Ising universality class. We next trace the evolution of the composite fermion and spin spectral functions across the phase boundary and conclude that VBS order triggers a bond order wave state of conduction electrons, both coexisting with Kondo screening. Upon further reducing $J_k/t$ we observe that composite quasiparticles lose their spectral weight indicating that VBS order gradually liberates localized $f$ spins from forming Kondo singlets with conduction electron spins. We contrast the QMC results with a static large-$N$ approximation, and we show that in the limit of infinite degeneracy $N\to\infty$ the order-disorder transition becomes of first order and is accompanied by a full decoupling of conduction electrons and localized $f$ spins. We complete our analysis by considering the limit of a vanishing Heisenberg coupling $J_h=0$, and we provide evidence that the enlarged SU($N$) symmetry and low dimensionality of the RKKY exchange interaction are not sufficient to induce VBS order in the conventional SU($N$) Kondo chain which hosts solely a KI phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the topology of the parameter space of invertible phases with an onsite symmetry $G$, i.e., quantum many-body ground states that have neither fractionalization nor spontaneous breaking of the symmetry. The classification of invertible phases is known to be obtained by counting the connected components in the parameter space of the invertible phases. We consider its generalization -- the deformation classes of the mappings from $n$-dimensional spheres $S^n$ to this parameter space for arbitrary integer $n$. We argue a direct one-to-one correspondence in the framework of lattice models between the non-contractibility of $S^n$ and (i) the classification of invertible phases in $d$ dimensions when $d\geq n$; or (ii) zero-dimensional invertible Hamiltonians parametrized by $S^{n-d}$ when $d&lt;n$, using an isotropic modulating Hamiltonian approach. Explicitly, we construct the noncontractible spheres of two-dimensional invertible phases, i.e., $n=2$ and $d=2$. We also propose a large class of crystalline topological phases protected by a generalized magnetic translations.</description>

      <title>Operator scars in open systems and their relation to Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen scars in closed bilayer systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study open many-body systems governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation. We identify broad classes of many-body models that support explicitly known eigen operators $Q$ of the Lindbladian superoperators (Lindbladians) $\mathcal L$. The expectation value of the observables defined by these operators exhibits a simple exponential decay, $\langle Q\rangle_t=e^{-\Gamma t} \langle Q \rangle_0$, irrespectively of the initial state. Generically, the Lindbladians under study are nonintegrable; in such cases operators $Q$ are similar to special eigenstates in closed many-body systems known as quantum many-body scars. We make this analogy precise by employing the duality between open systems and closed systems with doubled degrees of freedom. Under this duality, operator scars in open systems map to recently discovered Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) scars in closed bilayer systems. Furthermore, we show that there is a family of such dualities which allows one to obtain EPR-like scars with a prescribed entanglement between layers. This opens a novel perspective on EPR scars in closed bilayer systems that clarifies known facts and facilitates new developments.</description>

Abstract: Experimental progress in atomic, molecular, and optical platforms in the last decade has stimulated strong and broad interest in the quantum coherent dynamics of many long-range interacting particles. The prominent collective character of these systems enables novel non-equilibrium phenomena with no counterpart in conventional quantum systems with local interactions. Much of the theory work in this area either focussed on the impact of variable-range interaction tails on the physics of local interactions or relied on mean-field-like descriptions based on the opposite limit of all-to-all infinite-range interactions. In this Report, we present a systematic and organic review of recent advances in the field. Working with prototypical interacting quantum spin lattices without disorder, our presentation hinges upon a versatile theoretical formalism that interpolates between the few-body mean-field physics and the many-body physics of quasi-local interactions. Such a formalism allows us to connect these two regimes, providing both a formal quantitative tool and basic physical intuition. We leverage this unifying framework to review several findings of the last decade, including the peculiar non-ballistic spreading of quantum correlations, counter-intuitive slowdown of entanglement dynamics, suppression of thermalization and equilibration, anomalous scaling of defects upon traversing criticality, dynamical phase transitions, and genuinely non-equilibrium phases stabilized by periodic driving. The style of this Report is on the pedagogical side, which makes it accessible to readers without previous experience in the subject matter.</description>

      <title>Plasmon Excitations Across the Charge-Density-Wave Transition in Single-Layer TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $1T$-TiSe$_2$ is believed to posses a soft electronic mode, i.e., plasmon or exciton, that might be responsible for the exciton condensation and charge-density-wave (CDW) transition. Here, we explore collective electronic excitations in single-layer $1T$-TiSe$_2$ by using the ab-initio electromagnetic linear response and unveil intricate scattering pathways of two-dimensional (2D) plasmon mode near the CDW phase. We found the dominant role of plasmon-phonon scattering, which in combination with the CDW gap excitations leads to the anomalous temperature dependence of the plasmon linewidth across the CDW transition. Below the transition temperature $T_{\rm CDW}$ a strong hybridization between 2D plasmon and CDW excitations is obtained. These optical features are highly tunable due to temperature-dependent CDW-related modifications of electronic structure and electron-phonon coupling and make CDW-bearing systems potentially interesting for applications in optoelectronics and low-loss plasmonics.</description>

      <title>Cross-cap defects and fault-tolerant logical gates in the surface code and the honeycomb Floquet code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code, surface code and Floquet code defined on a non-orientable surface, which can be considered as families of codes extending Shor's 9-qubit code. We investigate the fault-tolerant logical gates of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code in this setup, which corresponds to $e\leftrightarrow m$ exchanging symmetry of the underlying $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. We find that non-orientable geometry provides a new way the emergent symmetry acts on the code space, and discover the new realization of the fault-tolerant Hadamard gate of 2d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code on a surface with a single cross-cap, dubbed a non-orientable toric code. This Hadamard gate can be realized by a constant-depth local unitary circuit modulo non-locality caused by a cross-cap. Via folding, the non-orientable surface code can be turned into a bilayer local quantum code, where the folded cross-cap is equivalent to a bi-layer twist terminated on a gapped boundary and the logical Hadamard only contains local gates with intra-layer couplings. We further obtain the complete logical Clifford gate set for a stack of non-orientable surface codes. We then construct the honeycomb Floquet code in the presence of a single cross-cap, and find that the period of the sequential Pauli measurements acts as a $HZ$ logical gate on the single logical qubit, where the cross-cap enriches the dynamics compared with the orientable case. We find that the dynamics of the honeycomb Floquet code is precisely described by a condensation operator of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, and illustrate the exotic dynamics of our code in terms of a condensation operator supported at a non-orientable surface.</description>

      <title>Robust effective ground state in a nonintegrable Floquet quantum circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An external periodic (Floquet) drive is believed to bring any initial state to the featureless infinite temperature state in generic nonintegrable isolated quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit, irrespective of the driving frequency $\Omega$. However, numerical or analytical evidence either proving or disproving this hypothesis is very limited and the issue has remained unsettled. Here, we study the initial state dependence of Floquet heating in a nonintegrable kicked Ising chain of length up to $L=30$ with an efficient quantum circuit simulator, showing a possible counterexample: The ground state of the effective Floquet Hamiltonian is exceptionally robust against heating, and could stay at finite energy density even after infinitely many Floquet cycles, if the driving period is shorter than a threshold value. This sharp energy localization transition/crossover does not happen for generic excited states. The exceptional robustness of the ground state is interpreted by (i) its isolation in the energy spectrum and (ii) the fact that those states with $L$-independent $\hbar\Omega$ energy above the ground state energy of any generic local Hamiltonian, like the approximate Floquet Hamiltonian, are atypical and viewed as a collection of noninteracting quasipartiles. Our finding paves the way for engineering Floquet protocols with finite driving periods realizing long-lived, or possibly even perpetual, Floquet phases by initial state design.</description>

      <title>Accurate optimal quantum error correction thresholds from coherent information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correcting (QEC) codes protect quantum information from decoherence, as long as error rates fall below critical error thresholds. In general, obtaining thresholds implies simulating the QEC procedure using, in general, sub-optimal decoding strategies. In a few cases and for sufficiently simple noise models, optimal decoding of QEC codes can be framed as a phase transition in disordered classical spin models. In both situations, accurate estimation of thresholds demands intensive computational resources. Here we use the coherent information of the mixed state of noisy QEC codes to accurately estimate the associated optimal QEC thresholds already from small-distance codes at moderate computational cost. We show the effectiveness and versatility of our method by applying it first to the topological surface and color code under bit-flip and depolarizing noise. We then extend the coherent information based methodology to phenomenological and quantum circuit level noise settings. For all examples considered we obtain highly accurate estimates of optimal error thresholds from small, low-distance instances of the codes, in close accordance with threshold values reported in the literature. Our findings establish the coherent information as a reliable competitive practical tool for the calculation of optimal thresholds of state-of-the-art QEC codes under realistic noise models.</description>

      <title>Atomic multiplet and charge-transfer screening effects in 1$s$ and 2$p$ core-level X-ray photoelectron spectra of early 3$d$ transition-metal oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13951v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of 1$s$ and 2$p$ core-level hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) spectra in metallic VO$_2$ and CrO$_2$. Even though the V 1$s$ and 2$p$ spectra in VO$_2$ display similar line shapes except the absence or presence of a spin-orbit coupling splitting, the Cr 1$s$ and 2$p$ spectra exhibit distinct main-line shapes. The experimental HAXPES spectra are analyzed by the Anderson impurity model based on the density functional theory + dynamical mean-field theory and a conventional MO$_6$ cluster model. We elucidate the complex interplay between formation of the intra-atomic multiplet and charge transfer effect on the chemical bonding followed by the 1$s$ and 2$p$ core electron excitations. We demonstrate the advantage of the 1$s$ excitations to the routinely-employed 2$p$ excitations for distinguishing between metal-ligand and metal-metal charge transfer contributions in early 3$d$ transition-metal oxides.</description>

      <title>Nonstabilizerness via matrix product states in the Pauli basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, also known as ``magic'', stands as a crucial resource for achieving a potential advantage in quantum computing. Its connection to many-body physical phenomena is poorly understood at present, mostly due to a lack of practical methods to compute it at large scales. We present a novel approach for the evaluation of nonstabilizerness within the framework of matrix product states (MPS), based on expressing the MPS directly in the Pauli basis. Our framework provides a powerful tool for efficiently calculating various measures of nonstabilizerness, including stabilizer R\'enyi entropies, stabilizer nullity, and Bell magic, and enables the learning of the stabilizer group of an MPS. We showcase the efficacy and versatility of our method in the ground states of Ising and XXZ spin chains, as well as in circuits dynamics that has recently been realized in Rydberg atom arrays, where we provide concrete benchmarks for future experiments on logical qubits up to twice the sizes already realized.</description>

      <title>QCD Kondo effect for single heavy quark in chiral-symmetry broken phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) Kondo effect for a single heavy quark in quark matter composed of light quarks with chiral symmetry breaking. Introducing several spinor structures in QCD Kondo condensates, i.e., particle-projected condensate, antiparticle-projected condensate, and normal condensate without projection, we calculate the attractive energy gained by the heavy quark within the mean-field approximation in the path-integral formalism. We show that the normal condensate is favored at low density and the particle-projected condensate is favored at high density, when the light quark has a nonzero mass. We interpret such a density-dependent transition between the two condensates in terms of the Kondo resonances.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic superconducting diode effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal superconductivity, also known as the superconducting diode effect, has been extensively studied in the presence of a magnetic field or some form of ferromagnetic order breaking time-reversal symmetry. We here show that another class of magnetic order known as altermagnetism, which also breaks time-reversal symmetry but does not exhibit a finite net magnetic moment, can also give rise to a superconducting diode effect. Whether this is the case depends on the combination of the system's point group and altermagnetic order parameter which we explore systematically for two-dimensional crystalline systems. If the superconducting electrons are in a centrosymmetric crystalline environment, an electric field $E_z$ (or other sources of inversion symmetry breaking) can be used to turn on and tune the non-reciprocity, yielding an electric-field tunable diode effect; there are also non-centrosymmetric point groups, which are not reached by applying $E_z \neq 0$ in a centrosymmetric crystal, but still allow for an altermagnetic order parameter with non-reciprocal superconductivity. Depending on the residual magnetic point group, the zeros of the critical current asymmetry, $J_c(\hat{n}) - J_c(-\hat{n})$, are pinned along high-symmetry crystalline directions $\hat{n}=\hat{e}_j$ or are free to rotate in the plane of the system. In some cases, the zeros can be rotated by tuning the electric field $E_z$. We discuss all of these phenomena both on the general level using exact symmetry arguments and more explicitly by constructing and solving minimal lattice models. We provide experimental setups to realize the altermagnetic superconducting diode effect.</description>

Abstract: Efficient and accurate algorithm for partition function, free energy and thermal entropy calculations is of great significance in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics. Here we present an unbiased but low-technical-barrier algorithm within the quantum Monte Carlo framework, which has exceptionally high accuracy and no systemic error. Compared with the conventional specific heat integral method and Wang-Landau sampling algorithm, our method can obtain a much more accurate result of the sub-leading coefficient of the entropy. This method can be widely used in both classical and quantum Monte Carlo simulations and is easy to be parallelized on computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a quantum many-body system driven by two competing measurements, which induces a topological entanglement transition between two distinct area law phases. We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with variable coupling between the system and detector within free Fermion dynamics. This approach allows us to continuously track the universal properties of the transition between projective and continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest that the percolation universality of the transition in the projective limit is unstable when the system-detector coupling is reduced.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Computations That Capture Strict Variationality, Volume Law Behavior, and the Efficient Representation of Neural Network States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a change of perspective on tensor network states that is defined by the computational graph of the contraction of an amplitude. The resulting class of states, which we refer to as tensor network functions, inherit the conceptual advantages of tensor network states while removing computational restrictions arising from the need to converge approximate contractions. We use tensor network functions to compute strict variational estimates of the energy on loopy graphs, analyze their expressive power for ground-states, show that we can capture aspects of volume law time evolution, and provide a mapping of general feed-forward neural nets onto efficient tensor network functions. Our work expands the realm of computable tensor networks to ones where accurate contraction methods are not available, and opens up new avenues to use tensor networks.</description>

      <title>Topological quantum phase transitions driven by displacement fields in the twisted MoTe2 bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ systems at fractional fillings of the lowest hole band under applied out-of-plane displacement fields. By employing exact diagonalization in finite-size systems, we systematically map out the ground state quantum phase diagram for two filling fractions, $\nu=1/3$ and $2/3$, and provide a detailed characterization of each phase. We identify the phase transition between a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) and a layer-polarized charge density wave (CDW) at a filling fraction of $\nu=1/3$, denoted as CDW-$1$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the competition between the displacement field and twist angle leads to another phase transition from a layer-polarized CDW-$1$ to a layer-hybridized CDW-$2$, identified as a first-order phase transition. Furthermore, at $\nu=2/3$ filling of the lowest hole band, we observe that the FCI remains stable against the displacement field until it approaches proximity to a transition in single-particle band topology at a smaller twist angle.</description>
