      <title>Anisotropic multi-orbital Hubbard model simulated with impurity approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental findings on the orbital ordering of cuprate SC, we have investigated the multi-orbital Hubbard model in the framework of Cu impurity approximation embedded in the O lattice by incorporating the 3d$^{8}$ multiplet structure coupled to a full O-2p band.Our systematic investigation on the impact of anisotropy of various parameters reveal rich phenomena in terms of the ground state (GS) weight asymmetry between $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$ directions.The numerical evidence demonstrate that the GS weight of Zhang-Rice singlet (ZRS) can be affected by the asymmetry of these parameters to distinct extent. Although the experimentally motivated asymmetric charge transfer energy only induces tiny weight difference, the asymmetric $d$-$p$ hybridization can result in considerable change of the weight. Besides, the nearest-neighbor $V_{pd}$ has much stronger impact than the local $U_{pp}$, which stems from the nature of ZRS consisting of nearest-neighbor two holes. Our systematic exploration provide valuable knowledge on the role of the artificial symmetry breaking on the two-hole GS nature and serves as the starting point of more sophisticated many-body simulations to uncover more interesting physics of multi-orbital Hubbard model within the symmetry breaking setup.</description>

      <title>Higgs-like stiffness and fractons on the verge of phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In condensed matter Physics, massive longitudinal Higgs modes emerge from fluctuations of the order parameter. A few years ago, the Higgs mode was \emph{caught} experimentally in the vicinity of an insulator-to-superconductor quantum phase transition [Nat. Phys. $\textbf{11}$, 188 (2015)]. Here, we propose, in analogy to the Higgs mode, the concept of Higgs-like stiffness (HLS), which emerges close to both classical and quantum phase transitions as a universal manifestation of matter. We build up a Landau free energy for the dielectric response function to demonstrate that \emph{any} complex physical quantity can be used to infer the presence of the HLS. Our analysis is corroborated by experimental results of the quasi-static dielectric constant for the (TMTTF)$_2$SbF$_6$ Fabre salt. Yet, we discuss the appearance of fractons in connection with the locking of particular molecular rotational degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Anisotropy Effect on Stabilizing Magnetization Plateaus of Kagome Strip Chain Heisenberg Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the anisotropic effect of magnetization plateaus in the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a kagome strip chain. The kagome strip chain Heisenberg model, composed of a hexagonal net of triangles forming five-site unit cells, exhibits four magnetization plateaus in the presence of an applied magnetic field. Using numerical density matrix renormalization group method, we find that the magnetization plateaus are stable against anisotropic interactions in the same direction of the applied magnetic field but the plateaus vanish with strong anisotropic interactions in other directions. We further analyze the stability of the magnetic plateaus with spin wave theory. The emergence of the lowest flat magnon band and its evolution with the anisotropic interactions can explain the robustness of magnetization plateaus, which is consistent with our numerical findings. In addition, upon tuning down the interaction strength for the two lower legs below a critical value, the kagome strip chain decouples into two spin chains, which can be used to determine the effective lattice structure in materials with strong distortions. Our results enhance the theoretical understanding of the anisotropic effect and the nature of magnetization plateaus in frustrated kagome lattice materials, which can contribute to the design and manipulation of kagome materials with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Instability of metals with respect to strong electron-phonon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using standard kinetic equations, we show that the thermal equilibrium between conduction electrons and phonons is unstable when the renormalized electron-phonon coupling exceeds a certain threshold. We prove that negative electronic specific heat, $C_\mathrm{el}&lt;0$, is sufficient for instability. Specifically, the instability sets in as soon as the quasiparticle weight becomes negative for a range of energies, even before $C_\mathrm{el}$ turns negative. Similarly to the negative compressibility of the Van der Waals gas, the $C_\mathrm{el}&lt;0$ instability signals a first order phase transition, in this case a structural one.</description>

      <title>$d$-wave Superconductivity in the Hubbard model on the isotropic triangular lattice and a possibility of the chiral $d+id$ pairing as a quasi-stable state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $d$-wave superconductivity(SC) in the Hubbard model on the isotropic triangular lattice described by the hopping parameter $t$ and on-site Coulomb repulsion $U$ at zero temperature and half-filling using the variational cluster approximation. We found that the $d_{xy}$ SC is the ground state below the Mott insulator phase $U/t \lesssim 6$, and the energy of chiral $d+id$ SC is slightly higher than the $d_{xy}$ SC. The energy difference between the normal and $d_{xy}$ states is about $0.02t \sim 0.06t$ for $U/t \simeq 5$. This result is semi-quantitatively consistent with the SC transition temperature $T_K=3.9$ K of $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$, where $t$ is estimated to be about $0.06$ eV, and the predicted pairing symmetry $d_{xy}$ agrees with the STM observations. The energy difference between the $d+id$ and $d_{xy}$ is about $0.01t\sim 0.03t$ for $U/t \simeq 5$ so the transition from $d+id$ to $d_{xy}$, or some effects of $d+id$ in $d_{xy}$ phase may be observed in experiments for $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$.</description>

      <title>Transient selection of competing order in frustrated spin Peierls systems after a quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretically the dynamics of frustrated spin Peierls systems after a quench from the paramagnetic state to the magnetically ordered state. By constructing and numerical simulating a minimal model, we show that it can exhibit a transient non-collinear magnetic order before settling in the equilibrium collinear magnetic order. The transient magnetic order is selected by the phonon fluctuations originated from the initial state. Our results reveal a mechanism for controlling the phases of matter by exploiting incoherent, nonequilibrium fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous quantum oscillations from boson-mediated interband scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum oscillations (QO) in metals refer to the periodic variation of thermodynamic and transport properties as a function of inverse applied magnetic field. QO frequencies are normally associated with semi-classical trajectories of Fermi surface orbits but recent experiments challenge the canonical description. We develop a theory of composite frequency quantum oscillations (CFQO) in two-dimensional Fermi liquids with several Fermi surfaces and interband scattering mediated by a dynamical boson, e.g. phonons or spin fluctuations. Specifically, we show that CFQO arise from oscillations in the fermionic self-energy with anomalous frequency splitting and distinct strongly non-Lifshitz-Kosevich temperature dependencies. Our theory goes beyond the framework of semi-classical Fermi surface trajectories highlighting the role of many-body effects. We provide experimental predictions and discuss the effect of non-equilibrium boson occupation in driven systems.</description>

      <title>Low-energy spin excitations in field-induced phases of the spin-ladder antiferromagnet BiCu$_2$PO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on terahertz spectroscopic measurements of quantum spin dynamics on single crystals of a spin-1/2 frustrated spin-ladder antiferromagnet BiCu$_2$PO$_6$ as a function of temperature, polarization, and applied external magnetic fields. Spin triplon excitations are observed at zero field and split in applied magnetic fields. For magnetic fields applied along the crystallographic $a$ axis, a quantum phase transition at $B_{c1}=21.4$~T is featured by a low-energy excitation mode emerging above $B_{c1}$ which indicates a gap reopening. For fields along the $b$ axis and the $c$ axis, different field dependencies are observed for the spin triplon excitations, whereas no low-lying modes could be resolved at field-induced phase transitions. We perform a theoretical analysis of the magnetic field dependence of the spin triplon modes by using continuous unitary transformations to determine an effective low energy Hamiltonian. Through an exhaustive parameter search we find numerically optimized parameters to very well describe the experimentally observed modes, which corroborate the importance of significant magnetic anisotropy in the system.</description>

      <title>High-field ultrasound study of elastic constants and possible magnetic symmetry transformations in UO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we probe the coupling between magnetism and lattice dynamics in UO2, a 3k antiferromagnet that undergoes magnetic ordering below its Neel temperature (TN) of 30.8 K. Ultrasound measurements provide insights into the interplay between the material's magnetic properties and lattice vibrations in response to the applied high magnetic field. A model analysis based on ab initio calculated superexchange interactions predicts a change in the magnetic structure from 3k to 2k at around 50 T. Although this change is not evident in the magnetization curve, we observe a crossover of ultrasound velocity Dv/v using a phase-sensitive pulse-echo technique in pulsed magnetic fields of up to 65 T. We show that at Hz &gt; 50 T, the structure remains antiferromagnetic in the (x, y) plane and becomes ferromagnetic in the z direction. A further transition into the 1k structure is theoretically predicted to take place at a magnetic field of ~104 tesla.</description>

      <title>Doping dependence of linear-in-temperature scattering rate in three-orbital Emery model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental demonstration of the doping dependence of the linear-in-temperature resistivity coefficient in cuprates, we numerically investigated the three-orbital Emery model focusing on the slope of the $T$-linear electronic and quasiparticle scattering rates by adopting dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our exploration discovered that the slope of electronic scattering rate evolves linearly with the electron-doping; while it is inversely proportional to the hole-doping level at intermediate doping regime and then crossovers to the linear-like dependence on further hole doping. These features remarkably match with the experimental findings qualitatively. We further discuss the doping-dependent slope of the quasiparticle scattering rate and also estimate the resistivity coefficient. Our presented work provides promising insight on the three-orbital Emery model, particularly its doping evolution and connection to the underlying mechanism of the $T$-linear resistivity in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Dynamic-RKKY induced time-reversal symmetry breaking and chiral spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in various Kondo lattice systems. We argue that the weak Kondo-coupling expansion contains certain physics which is lost in the usual static approximation to the spin susceptibility. Most notably, while the former is sensitive to the time-reversal symmetry breaking, the latter is blind to it. Using exact diagonalization on small systems, we show that this enables inducing spin chirality by an external magnetic field. To study larger systems, we use a large-N approximation to capture the effect of dynamic-RKKY interaction on U(1) spin liquids. On a honeycomb Kondo lattice with Haldane fluxes for electrons, we show that the non-trivial topology and chiral edge states are induced on the spinons. Our results suggest that dynamic RKKY in combination with external magnetic field or in proximity to topological electronic materials, can be used as a tunable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya even in centrosymmetric materials.</description>

      <title>Doping a fractional quantum anomalous Hall insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study novel itinerant phases that can be accessed by doping a fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) insulator, with a focus on the experimentally observed Jain states at lattice filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$. Unlike in the lowest Landau level, where charge motion is confined into cyclotron orbits, the charged excitations in the FQAH occupy Bloch states with well-defined crystal momenta. At a non-zero doping density, this enables the formation of itinerant states of the doped anyons just beyond the FQAH plateau region. Specializing to the vicinity of $\nu = 2/3$, we describe a few possible such itinerant states. These include a topological superconductor with chiral neutral fermion edge modes as well as a more exotic Pair Density Wave (PDW) superconductor with non-trivial non-Abelian topological order. A Fermi liquid metal with a doping-induced period-3 charge density wave also occurs naturally in our analysis. This Fermi liquid (as well as the PDW) arises from pairing instabilities of a composite Fermi liquid metal that can emerge near filling $2/3$. Though inspired by the theory of anyon superconductivity, we explain how our construction is qualitatively different. At a general Jain filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$, the same analytical framework leads to a wider variety of phases including higher-charge superconductors and generalized composite Fermi liquids. We predict unusual physical signatures associated with each phase and analyze the crossover between different temperature regimes. These results provide a proof-of-principle that exotic itinerant phases can be stabilized by correlations intrinsic to the FQAH setup.</description>

      <title>Designing exciton-condensate Josephson junction in quantum Hall heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exciton condensate (EC), a coherent state of electron-hole pairs, has been robustly realized in two-dimensional quantum Hall bilayer systems at integer fillings. However, direct experimental evidence for many of the remarkable signatures of phase coherence, such as an in-plane Josephson effect, has been lacking. In this work, we propose a gate-defined exciton-condensate Josephson junction suitable for demonstrating the Josephson effect in vdW heterostructures. The design is similar to the S-I-S superconducting Josephson junction but functions with a completely different microscopic mechanism: two exciton condensates are spatially separated by a gated region that is nearly layer-polarized, and the variation of layer pseudospin mediates a Josephson coupling sufficiently strong to have an observable effect. The Josephson coupling can be controlled by both the gate voltage and the magnetic field, and we show our design's high range of tunability and experimental feasibility with realistic parameters in vdW heterostructures.</description>

      <title>A combined Quantum Monte Carlo and DFT study of the strain response and magnetic properties of two-dimensional (2D) 1T-VSe$_2$ with charge density wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) 1T-VSe$_2$ has prompted significant interest due to the discrepancies regarding alleged ferromagnetism (FM) at room temperature, charge density wave (CDW) states and the interplay between the two. We employed a combined Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and density functional theory (DFT) approach to accurately investigate the magnetic properties and response of strain of monolayer 1T-VSe$_2$. Our calculations show the delicate competition between various phases, revealing critical insights into the relationship between their energetic and structural properties. We went on to perform Classical Monte Carlo simulations informed by our DMC and DFT results, and found the magnetic transition temperature ($T_c$) of the undistorted (non-CDW) FM phase to be 228 K and the distorted (CDW) phase to be 68 K. Additionally, we studied the response of biaxial strain on the energetic stability and magnetic properties of various phases of 2D 1T-VSe$_2$ and found that small amounts of strain can enhance the $T_c$, suggesting a promising route for engineering and enhancing magnetic behavior. Finally, we synthesized 1T-VSe$_2$ and performed Raman spectroscopy measurements, which were in close agreement with our calculated results. Our work emphasizes the role of highly accurate DMC methods in advancing the understanding of monolayer 1T-VSe$_2$ and provides a robust framework for future studies of 2D magnetic materials.</description>

Abstract: In our earlier work arXiv:2311.09334, we introduced a lattice Hamiltonian for Adjoint QCD$_2$ using staggered Majorana fermions. We found the gauge invariant space of states explicitly for the gauge group $\text{SU}(2)$ and used them for numerical calculations of observables, such as the spectrum and the expectation value of the fermion bilinear. In this paper, we carry out a more in-depth study of our lattice model, extending it to any compact and simply-connected gauge group $G$. We show how to find the gauge invariant space of states and use it to study various observables. We also use the lattice model to calculate the mixed 't Hooft anomalies of Adjoint QCD$_2$ for arbitrary $G$. We show that the matrix elements of the lattice Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the Wigner 6$j$-symbols of $G$. For $G = \text{SU}(3)$, we perform exact diagonalization for lattices of up to six sites and study the low-lying spectrum, the fermion bilinear condensate, and the string tension. We also show how to write the lattice strong coupling expansion for ground state energies and operator expectation values in terms of the Wigner 6$j$-symbols. For $\text{SU}(3)$ we carry this out explicitly and find good agreement with the exact diagonalizations, and for $\text{SU}(4)$ we give expansions that can be compared with future numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Magnetization Plateaus by the Field-Induced Partitioning of Spin Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To search for a conceptual picture describing the magnetization plateau phenomenon, we surveyed the crystal structures and the spin lattices of those magnets exhibiting plateaus in their magnetization vs. magnetic field curves by probing the three questions: (a) why only certain magnets exhibit magnetization plateaus, (b) why there occur several different types of magnetization plateaus, and (c) what controls the widths of magnetization plateaus. We show that the answers to these questions lie in how the magnets under field absorb Zeeman energy hence changing their magnetic structures. The magnetic structure of a magnet insulator is commonly described in terms of its spin lattice, which requires the determination of the spin exchanges nonnegligible strengths between the magnetic ions. Our work strongly suggests that a magnet under magnetic field partitions its spin lattice into antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferrimagnetic fragments by breaking its weak magnetic bonds. Our supposition of the field-induced partitioning of spin lattice into magnetic fragments is supported by the anisotropic magnetization plateaus of Ising magnets and by the highly anisotropic width of the 1/3-magnetization plateau in azurite. The answers to the three questions (a) - (c) emerge naturally by analyzing how these fragments are formed under magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric imprint of skyrmions in van der Waals bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To effectively track and manipulate topological solitons (e.g. skyrmions) are the key challenge before their applications. Inspired by the idea of sliding ferroelectricity, here a general strategy is proposed to print magnetic skyrmions to electric skyrmions in van der Waals bilayers. Through the proximate interactions, there is an isoperiodic bijection relationship between local dipoles and spin moments. This magnetoelectric imprint effect not only extends the strategies to create electric skyrmions, but also leads to an approach for all-electrical readout/manipulation of magnetic skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Perspective: imaging atomic step geometry to determine surface terminations of kagome materials and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we review scanning tunneling microscopy research on the surface determination for various types of kagome materials, including 11-type (CoSn, FeSn, FeGe), 32-type (Fe3Sn2), 13-type (Mn3Sn), 135-type (AV3Sb5, A = K, Rb, Cs), 166-type (TbMn6Sn6, YMn6Sn6 and ScV6Sn6), and 322-type (Co3Sn2S2 and Ni3In2Se2). We first demonstrate that the measured step height between different surfaces typically deviates from the expected value of +-0.4~0.8A, which is owing to the tunneling convolution effect with electronic states and becomes a serious issue for Co3Sn2S2 where the expected Sn-S interlayer distance is 0.6A. Hence, we put forward a general methodology for surface determination as atomic step geometry imaging, which is fundamental but also experimentally challenging to locate the step and to image with atomic precision. We discuss how this method can be used to resolve the surface termination puzzle in Co3Sn2S2. This method provides a natural explanation for the existence of adatoms and vacancies, and beyond using unknown impurity states, we propose and use designer layer-selective substitutional chemical markers to confirm the validity of this method. Finally, we apply this method to determine the surface of a new kagome material Ni3In2Se2, as a cousin of Co3Sn2S2, and we image the underlying kagome geometry on the determined Se surface above the kagome layer, which directly visualizes the p-d hybridization physics. We emphasize that this general method does not rely on theory, but the determined surface identity can provide guidelines for first-principles calculations with adjustable parameters on the surface-dependent local density of states and quasi-particle interference patterns.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for extracting entanglement entropy in interacting fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy probing novel phases and phase transitions numerically via quantum Monte Carlo has made great achievements in large-scale interacting spin/boson systems. In contrast, the numerical exploration in interacting fermion systems is rare, even though fermion systems attract more attentions in condensed matter. The fundamental restrictions is that the computational cost of fermion quantum Monte Carlo ($\sim \beta N^3$) is much higher than that of spin/boson ($\sim \beta N$). To tackle the problem cumbersome existent methods of eantanglement entropy calculation, we propose a fermionic quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the incremental technique along physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency of extracting entanglement entropy. Taking a two-dimensional square lattice Hubbard model as an example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and show the high computation precision. In this simulation, the calculated scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy elucidates the different phases of the Fermi surface and Goldstone modes.</description>

      <title>Linear Magnetoresistance and Type-I Superconductivity in $\beta$-IrSn$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered material $\beta$-IrSn$_4$ ($I4_1/acd$, $D^{20}_{4h}$, #142), whose electron bands have symmetry-enforced Dirac points, was investigated using high-quality single crystals. It exhibits a pronounced linear field-dependence of magnetoresistance (LMR), which cannot be explained by currently existing models. Structures in the field-angle dependence of magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity are attributable to the Fermi surface topology; the presence of open orbits is inferred. At the superconducting (SC) transition, the specific-heat jump exhibits a significant increase in applied fields, revealing the type-I SC nature. This feature is attributable to the high Fermi velocity of linearly dispersive multibands. To clarify the mechanism of the puzzling LMR, investigations into the topological nature of those multibands in applied fields are highly desired.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate Floquet time-evolution of a truncated SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills theory on a two-leg ladder geometry under open boundary conditions using IBM's superconducting 156-qubit device ibm\_fez. To this end, we derive the quantum spin representation of the lattice Yang-Mills theory, and compose a quantum circuit carefully tailored to hard wares, reducing the use of CZ gates. Since it is still challenging to simulate Hamiltonian evolution in present noisy quantum processors, we make the step size in the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition very large, and simulate thermalization dynamics in Floquet circuit composed of the Suzuki-Trotter evolution. We demonstrate that IBM's Heron quantum processor can simulate, by error mitigation, Floqeut thermalization dynamics in a large system consisting of $62$ qubits. Our work would be a benchmark for further quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories using real devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a computational approach designed to leverage quantum fluctuations for solving large-scale classical optimization problems. Although incorporating standard transverse field (TF) terms in the annealing process can help navigate sharp minima, the potential for achieving a scalable quantum advantage for general optimization problems remains uncertain. Here, we examine the effectiveness of including chaotic quantum driver Hamiltonians in the annealing dynamics. Specifically, we investigate driver Hamiltonians based on a bosonic spin version of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which features a high degree of non-locality and non-commutativity. Focusing on MaxCut instances on regular graphs, we find that a considerable proportion of SYK model instances demonstrate significant speedups, especially for challenging graph configurations. Additionally, our analysis of time-to-solution scalings for the low autocorrelation binary sequence (LABS) problem suggests that SYK-type fluctuations can outperform traditional transverse field annealing schedules in large-scale optimization tasks.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the correlation effects in unconventional topological materials, in which the fermion excitations take unusual dispersion, is an important topic in recent condensed matter physics. We study the influence of short-range four-fermion interactions on three-dimensional semi-Dirac semimetal with an unusual fermion dispersion, that is linear along two directions and quadratic along the third one. Based on renormalization group theory, we find all of 11 unstable fixed points including 5 quantum critical points, 5 bicritical points, and one tricritical point. The physical essences of the quantum critical points are determined by analyzing the susceptibility exponents for all of the source terms in particle-hole and particle-particle channels. We also verify phase diagrams of the system in the parameter space through numerically studying the flows of the four-fermion coupling parameters and behaviors of the susceptibility exponents. These results are helpful for us to understand the physical properties of candidate materials for three-dimensional semi-Dirac semimetal such as ZrTe$_{5}$.</description>

      <title>Origin of spin reorientation and intrinsic anomalous Hall effect in the kagome ferrimagnet TbMn6Sn6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.17246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$ has attracted a lot of recent interest for a variety of reasons, most importantly, because of the hypothesis that it may support quantum-limit Chern topological magnetism, derived from the kagome geometry. Besides, TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$ features a highly unusual magnetic reorientation transition about 100 K below the Curie point, whereby all spins in the system, remaining collinear, rotate by 90$^\circ$. In this work, we address both issues combining experiment, mean-field theory and first-principle calculations. Both magnetic reorientation and the unusual temperature dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) find quantitative explanation in the fact that Mn and Tb, by virtue of the Mermin-Wagner theorem, have very different spin dynamics, with Tb spins experiencing much more rapid fluctuation. We were able to cleanly extract the intrinsic AHC from our experiment, and calculated the same microscopically, with good semiquantitative agreement. We have identified the points in the band structure responsible for the AHC and showed that they are not the kagome-derived Dirac points at the K-corner of the Brillouin zone, as conjectured previously.</description>

Abstract: A characteristic property of a gapless liquid state is its emergent symmetry and dual symmetry, associated with the conservation laws of symmetry charges and symmetry defects respectively. These conservation laws, considered on an equal footing, can't be described simply by the representation theory of a group (or a higher group). They are best described in terms of a topological order (TO) with gappable boundary in one higher dimension; we call this the symTO of the gapless state. The symTO can thus be considered a fingerprint of the gapless state. We propose that a largely complete characterization of a gapless state, up to local-low-energy equivalence, can be obtained in terms of its maximal emergent symTO. In this paper, we review the symmetry/topological-order (Symm/TO) correspondence and propose a precise definition of maximal symTO. We discuss various examples to illustrate these ideas. We find that the 1+1D Ising critical point has a maximal symTO described by the 2+1D double-Ising topological order. We provide a derivation of this result using symmetry twists in an exactly solvable model of the Ising critical point. The critical point in the 3-state Potts model has a maximal symTO of double (6,5)-minimal-model topological order. As an example of a noninvertible symmetry in 1+1D, we study the possible gapless states of a Fibonacci anyon chain with emergent double-Fibonacci symTO. We find the Fibonacci-anyon chain without translation symmetry has a critical point with unbroken double-Fibonacci symTO. In fact, such a critical theory has a maximal symTO of double (5,4)-minimal-model topological order. We argue that, in the presence of translation symmetry, the above critical point becomes a stable gapless phase with no symmetric relevant operator.</description>

      <title>Favorable phase transitions induced by spinful electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional semimetal with a quadratic band crossing point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of marginally spinful electron-electron interactions on the low-energy instabilities and favorable phase transitions in a two-dimensional (2D) spin-$1/2$ semimetal that owns a quadratic band crossing point (QBCP) parabolically touched by the upper and lower bands. In the framework of a renormalization group procedure, all sorts of interactions are treated on the equal footing to derive the coupled energy-dependent evolutions of all interaction couplings that govern the low-energy properties. Deciphering the essential physical information of such flows, we at first find that the tendencies of interaction parameters fall into three categories including Limit case, Special case, and General case based on the initial conditions. In addition, the 2D QBCP system is attracted to several distinct kinds of fixed points (FPs) in the interaction-parameter space, namely $\mathrm{FP}_1^{+}$/$\mathrm{FP}_2^{-}$, $\mathrm{FP}_1^{\pm}$/ $\mathrm{FP}_2^{\pm}$/$\mathrm{FP}_3^{\pm}$, and $\mathrm{FP}_1^{\pm}/\mathrm{FP}_3^{\pm}/\mathrm{FP}_{41,42,43}^{\pm}$ with the subscripts characterizing the features of FPs for the Limit, Special, and General cases, respectively. Furthermore, as approaching these FPs, we demonstrate that the spinful fermion-fermion interactions can induce a number of favorable instabilities accompanied by certain phase transitions. Specifically, the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH), quantum spin Hall (QSH), and nematic (Nem.) site(bond) states are dominant for $\mathrm{FP}_{1}^{\pm}$, $\mathrm{FP}_{2}^{\pm}$, and $\mathrm{FP}_{3}^{\pm}$, respectively. Rather, QSH becomes anisotropic nearby $\mathrm{FP}_{41,42,43}^{\pm}$ with one component leading and the others subleading. Besides, Nem.site(bond), chiral superconductivity, and nematic-spin-nematic (NSN.) site(bond) are subleading candidates around these FPs.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Non-Hermitian Skin Effect for Multipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the fate of the non-Hermitian skin effect in one-dimensional systems that conserve the dipole moment and higher moments of an associated global $\text{U}(1)$ charge. Motivated by field theoretical arguments and lattice model calculations, we demonstrate that the key feature of the non-Hermitian skin effect for $m$-pole conserving systems is the generation of an $(m+1)$th multipole moment. For example, in contrast to the conventional skin effect where charges are anomalously localized at one boundary, the dipole-conserving skin effect results in charges localized at both boundaries, in a configuration that generates an extremal quadrupole moment. In addition, we explore the dynamical consequences of the $m$-pole skin effect, focusing on charge and entanglement propagation. Both numerically and analytically, we provide evidence that long-time steady-states have Fock-space localization and an area-law scaling of entanglement entropy, which serve as quantum indicators of the skin effect.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic Chern insulator with large charge gap in heavy transition-metal compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the discovery of multiple intrinsic magnetic topological insulators in recent years the observation of Chern insulators is still restricted to very low temperatures due to the negligible charge gaps. Here, we uncover the potential of heavy transition-metal compounds for realizing a collinear antiferromagnetic Chern insulator (AFCI) with a charge gap as large as 300 meV. Our analysis relies on the Kane-Mele-Kondo model with a ferromagnetic Hund coupling $J_{\rm H}$ between the spins of itinerant electrons and the localized spins of size $S$. We show that a spin-orbit coupling $\lambda_{\rm SO} \gtrsim 0.03t$, where $t$ is the nearest-neighbor hopping element, is already large enough to stabilize an AFCI provided the alternating sublattice potential $\delta$ is in the range $\delta \approx SJ_{\rm H}$. We establish a remarkable increase in the charge gap upon increasing $\lambda_{\rm SO}$ in the AFCI phase. Using our results we explain the collinear AFCI recently found in monolayers of CrO and MoO with charge gaps of 1 and $50$ meV, respectively. In addition, we propose bilayers of heavy transition-metal oxides of perovskite structure as candidates to realize a room-temperature AFCI if grown along the $[111]$ direction and subjected to a perpendicular electric field.</description>

      <title>Disordered 2D ferromagnetism at the surface of FeSi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: FeSi is a curious example of a $d$-electron system that manifests many of the same phenomena associated with $f$-electron Kondo insulators, including conducting surface states with potentially non-trivial topology. Here we investigate the magnetization and magnetotransport of these surface states and how a 2D ferromagnetic state at the surface of FeSi influences the surface conductivity. We confirm the 2D ferromagnetism via a systematic study of magnetization on groups of filtered fragments with increasing surface area-to-volume ratios, identifying characteristic temperatures and magnetic fields associated with the ordered state. The paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition appears broadened, suggesting disorder, which allows spin fluctuations to manifest up to at least 9 T at 2 K. This highlights the need to understand the relation between the disorder of the 2D ferromagnetism and the surface conductivity in FeSi.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat bands are intriguing platforms for correlated and topological physics. Various methods have been developed to create flat bands utilizing lattice geometry, but the investigation of orbital symmetry in multiorbital materials is a new area of focus. Here, we introduce a site symmetry based approach to emerging multiorbital 2D and 3D flat bands on the kagome and pyrochlore lattices. As a conceptual advance, the one-orbital flat bands are shown to originate as mutual eigenstates of isolated molecular motifs. Further developing the mutual eigenstate method for multiple orbitals transforming differently under the site symmetries, we derive interorbital hopping generated flat bands from the antisymmetric interorbital Hamiltonian and introduce group-theoretic descriptions of the flat band wavefunctions. Realizations of multiorbital flat bands in realistic materials are shown to be possible in the Slater-Koster formalism. Our findings provide new directions for exploring flat band electronic structures for novel correlated and topological quantum states.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Freezing in Exactly Solvable Models of Driven Chaotic Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The late-time equilibrium behavior of generic interacting models is determined by the coupled hydrodynamic equations associated with the globally conserved quantities. In the presence of an external time-dependent drive, non-integrable systems typically thermalize to an effectively infinite-temperature state, losing all memory of their initial states. However, in the presence of a large time-periodic Floquet drive, there exist special points in phase-space where the strongly interacting system develops approximate {\it emergent} conservation laws. Here we present results for an exactly solvable model of two coupled chaotic quantum dots with multiple orbitals interacting via random two and four-fermion interactions in the presence of a Floquet drive. We analyze the phenomenology of dynamically generated freezing using a combination of exact diagonalization, and field-theoretic analysis in the limit of a large number of electronic orbitals. The model displays universal freezing behavior irrespective of whether the theory is averaged over the disorder configurations or not. We present explicit computations for the growth of many-body chaos and entanglement entropy, which demonstrates the long-lived coherence associated with the interacting degrees of freedom even at late-times at the dynamically frozen points. We also compute the slow timescale that controls relaxation away from exact freezing in a high-frequency expansion.</description>

      <title>Universal Planckian relaxation in the strange metal state of the cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Immediately following the discovery of the high-transition-temperature (Tc) superconducting cuprates, Anderson proposed that Mott physics plays a crucial role in understanding their phase diagrams. Specifically, he suggested that, much like the 'almost-localized' Fermi liquid in 3He, the effective mass renormalization in the cuprates is driven by the physics of a doped Mott insulator, scaling inversely with doping as the system moves away from half-filling. Here, we report a comprehensive survey of calorimetry and resistivity data in the cuprates across a broad range of dopings and temperatures, extending into the strange metal state at high temperatures. We find that the experimentally determined mass renormalization scales inversely with doping, indicating a strong reduction in the quasiparticle spectral weight approaching the Mott insulating state. This establishes Mott physics as the primary driver of mass renormalization across the entire doping range of the strange metal state. In fact, it is only through such Mott scaling that the T-linear slope of the relaxation rate $\hbar/{\tau}$ is independent of doping in the strange metal state. The experimental evidence for true universality of the Planckian relaxation rate across the entire doping range of the cuprates is not merely qualitative but also quantitative: i.e. $\hbar/{\tau} = {\alpha}k_BT$ with ${\alpha} \approx 1$.</description>

Abstract: The cooperation of electronic correlation and spin-orbit coupling can stabilize magnetic topological insulators which host novel quantum phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall state also known as Chern insulator (CI). Here, we investigate the existence of magnetic topological insulators with antiferromagnetic (AF) order in heavy-fermion materials. Our analysis relies on the half-filled Kane-Mele-Kondo (KMK) model with the AF Kondo interaction $J_{\rm K}$ coupling the spin of itinerant electrons with a $S=1/2$ localized spin at each lattice site. We consider the N\'eel AF ordering with the local magnetization not only perpendicular ($z$-AF ordering) but also parallel ($xy$-AF ordering) to the honeycomb plane. We show that in the absence of an energy offset between the two sublattices of the honeycomb structure the system is always topologically trivial. There is a transition from the trivial $xy$-AF insulator ($xy$-AFI) to the trivial Kondo insulator (KI) upon increasing $J_{\rm K}$. We unveil that an alternating sublattice potential can lead to the stabilization of the $z$-AFCI and the $z$-AF quantum spin Hall insulator ($z$-AFQSHI). We address the charge excitations in the bulk as well as at the edges of the KMK model. We provide a systematic comparison between the size of the charge gap in the AFCI in heavy-fermion materials and the size of the charge gap in the AFCI in transition-metal compounds. Our findings can guide the future experimental studies searching for AF topological insulators in novel class of systems which can survive up to higher temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Due to the presence of flat Chern bands, moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) bilayers are a platform to realize strongly correlated topological phases of fermions such as fractional Chern insulators. TMDs are also known to host long-lived excitons, which inherit the topology of the underlying Chern bands. For the particular example of MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers we perform a time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculation to identify a regime in the phase diagram where the excitons themselves form a topological flat band. This paves a way towards realizing strongly correlated states of bosons in moir\'e TMDs.</description>

      <title>Charge Susceptibility and Kubo Response in Hatsugai-Kohmoto-related Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study in depth the charge susceptibility for the band Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) and orbital (OHK) models. As either of these models describes a Mott insulator, the charge susceptibility takes on the form of a modified Lindhard function with lower and upper Hubbard bands, thereby giving rise to a multi-pole structure. The particle-hole continuum consists of hot spots along the $\omega$ vs $q$ axis arising from inter-band transitions. Such transitions, which are strongly suppressed in non-interacting systems, are obtained here because of the non-rigidity of the Hubbard bands. This modified Lindhard function gives rise to a plasmon dispersion that is inversely dependent on the momentum, resulting in an additional contribution to the conventional f-sum rule. This extra contribution originates from a long-range diamagnetic contribution to the current. This results in a non-commutativity of the long-wavelength ($q\rightarrow 0$) and thermodynamic ($L\rightarrow\infty$) limits. When the correct limits are taken, we find that the Kubo response computed with either open or periodic boundary conditions yields identical results that are consistent with the continuity equation contrary to recent claims. We also show that the long wavelength pathology of the current noted previously also plagues the Anderson impurity model interpretation of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Coupled with our previous work\cite{mai20231} which showed that HK is the correct $d=\infty$ limit of the Hubbard model, we arrive at the conclusion that single-orbital HK=DMFT.</description>

Abstract: The Hubbard model, a cornerstone in the field of condensed matter physics, serves as a fundamental framework for investigating the behavior of strongly correlated electron systems. This paper presents a novel perspective on the model, uncovering its inherent inverted duality which has profound implications for our comprehension of this complex system. Taking advantage of this special mathematical property, we have formulated an equation that the electron Green's function must satisfy. Our findings pave the way for further exploration and potentially new insights into the dynamics of electron correlations and phase transitions in the Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Quantum Advantage of Trotterized MERA for Strongly-Correlated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems are difficult to study and simulate classically. Our recent work [arXiv:2108.13401] proposed a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based on the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) with tensors constrained to certain Trotter circuits. Here, we determine the scaling of computation costs for various critical spin chains which substantiates a polynomial quantum advantage in comparison to classical MERA simulations based on exact energy gradients or variational Monte Carlo. Algorithmic phase diagrams suggest an even greater separation for higher-dimensional systems. Hence, the Trotterized MERA VQE is a promising route for the efficient investigation of strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems on quantum computers. Furthermore, we show how the convergence can be substantially improved by building up the MERA layer by layer in the initialization stage and by scanning through the phase diagram during optimization. For the Trotter circuits being composed of single-qubit and two-qubit rotations, it is experimentally advantageous to have small rotation angles. We find that the average angle amplitude can be reduced considerably with negligible effect on the energy accuracy. Benchmark simulations suggest that the structure of the Trotter circuits for the TMERA tensors is not decisive; in particular, brick-wall circuits and parallel random-pair circuits yield very similar energy accuracies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose relativistic Luttinger fermions as a new ingredient for the construction of fundamental quantum field theories. We construct the corresponding Clifford algebra and the spin metric for relativistic invariance of the action using the spin-base invariant formalism. The corresponding minimal spinor has 32 complex components, matching with the degrees of freedom of a standard-model generation including a right-handed neutrino. The resulting fermion fields exhibit a canonical scaling different from Dirac fermions and thus support the construction of novel relativistic and perturbatively renormalizable, interacting quantum field theories. In particular, new asymptotically free self-interacting field theories can be constructed, representing first examples of high-energy complete quantum field theories based on pure matter degrees of freedom. Gauge theories with relativistic Luttinger fermions exhibit a strong paramagnetic dominance, requiring large nonabelian gauge groups to maintain asymptotic freedom. We comment on the possibility to use Luttinger fermions for particle physics model building and the expected naturalness properties of such models.</description>

      <title>The Club Sandwich: Gapless Phases and Phase Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a generalization of the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) framework to characterize phase transitions and gapless phases with categorical symmetries. The central tool is the club sandwich, which extends the SymTFT setup to include an interface between two topological orders: there is a symmetry boundary, which is gapped, and a physical boundary that may be gapless, but in addition, there is also a gapped interface in the middle. The club sandwich generalizes so-called Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations. Building on the results in [1, 2] on gapped phases with categorical symmetries, we construct gapless theories describing phase transitions with non-invertible symmetries by applying suitable KT transformations on known phase transitions provided by the critical Ising model and the 3-state Potts model. We also describe in detail the order parameters in these gapless theories characterizing the phase transitions, which are generally mixtures of conventional and string-type order parameters mixed together by the action of categorical symmetries. Additionally, removing the physical boundary from the club sandwiches results in club quiches, which characterize all possible gapped boundary phases with (possibly non-invertible) symmetries that can arise on the boundary of a bulk gapped phase. We also provide a mathematical characterization of gapped boundary phases with symmetries as pivotal tensor functors whose targets are pivotal multi-fusion categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the intricate relationship between dissipative processes of open quantum systems and the non-Hermitian quantum field theory of relativistic fermionic systems. By examining the influence of dissipative effects on Dirac fermions via Lindblad formalism, we elucidate the effects of coupling relativistic Dirac particles with the environment and show the lack of manifest Lorentz invariance. Employing rigorous theoretical analysis, we generalize the collisionless Boltzmann equations for the relativistic dissipation-driven fermionic system and find the Lyapunov equation, which governs the stationary solutions. Using our formalism, one presents a simple non-Hermitian model that the relativistic fermionic particles and anti-particles are stable. Going further, using the solution to the Lyapunov equations, one analyses the effect of dissipation on the stationary charge imbalance of this non-Hermitian model and finds that the dissipation can induce a new kind of charge imbalance compared with the collisionless equilibrium case.</description>

      <title>General criterion for non-Hermitian skin effects and Application: Fock space skin effects in many body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity enables macroscopic accumulation of bulk states, named non-Hermitian skin effects. The non-Hermitian skin effects are well-established for single-particle systems, but their proper characterization for general systems is elusive. Here, we propose a general criterion of non-Hermitian skin effects, which works for any finite-dimensional system evolved by a linear operator. The applicable systems include many-body systems and network systems. A system meeting the criterion exhibits enhanced non-normality of the evolution operator, accompanied by exceptional characteristics intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Applying the criterion, we discover a new type of non-Hermitian skin effect in many-body systems, which we dub the Fock space skin effect. We also discuss the Fock space skin effect-induced slow dynamics, which gives an experimental signal for the Fock space skin effect.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos in the sparse SYK model</title>

Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a system of $N$ Majorana fermions with random interactions and strongly chaotic dynamics, which at low energy admits a holographically dual description as two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Hence the SYK model provides a toy model of quantum gravity that might be feasible to simulate with near-term quantum hardware. Motivated by the goal of reducing the resources needed for such a simulation, we study a sparsified version of the SYK model, in which interaction terms are deleted with probability $1{-p}$. Specifically, we compute numerically the spectral form factor (SFF, the Fourier transform of the Hamiltonian's eigenvalue pair correlation function) and the nearest-neighbor eigenvalue gap ratio $r$ (characterizing the distribution of gaps between consecutive eigenvalues). We find that when $p$ is greater than a transition value $p_1$, which scales as $1/N^3$, both the SFF and $r$ match the values attained by the full unsparsified model and with expectations from random matrix theory (RMT). But for $p&lt;p_1$, deviations from unsparsified SYK and RMT occur, indicating a breakdown of holography in the highly sparsified regime. Below an even smaller value $p_2$, which also scales as $1/N^3$, even the spacing of consecutive eigenvalues differs from RMT values, signaling a complete breakdown of spectral rigidity. Our results cast doubt on the holographic interpretation of very highly sparsified SYK models obtained via machine learning using teleportation infidelity as a loss function.</description>

      <title>Superfluid transition temperature of bond bipolarons with Coulomb interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing an exactly sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo method, we explore the influence of long-range Coulomb interaction on the superfluid transition temperature of bipolarons in a two dimensional square lattice. The model studied here is the bond Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with phonon-modulated electron hopping. Previously, in the absence of long-range Coulomb interaction, this model demonstrated the emergence of small-size, light-mass bipolarons that undergo a superfluid transition at high values of the transition temperature $T_c$ [Physical Review X 13, 011010, (2023)]. Our findings indicate that with the long-range Coulomb interaction, $T_c$ remains relatively high, even in the deep adiabatic regime where the phonon frequency $\omega/t = 0.5$ and the Coulomb interaction $V = U/10$. This result suggests a relatively high superfluid transition temperature for bond bipolarons with long range Coulomb interaction in the low-density regime, which could provide a new insights for the future experiments on dilute superconductors.</description>

      <title>Highly asymmetric superconducting dome and strange metallicity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has stimulated intensive investigations concerning its paring mechanism and a correct description of its effective low-energy physics. Notable experimental observations include the right-triangle-shaped superconducting dome with the maximum $T_c$ of about 80 K and the strange metal behavior in the normal state above $T_c$. Here we apply the Schwinger boson approach to the bilayer $t$-$V$-$J$ model, which allows us to treat well both the magnetic correlations and the superconducting instability. We obtain a global phase diagram with both metallic and superconducting ground states separated by a quantum phase transition, and predict a minimal interlayer superexchange $J$ and a minimal $d_{z^2}$-hole concentration necessary for the superconductivity, with a highly asymmetric right-triangle-like shape for the $T_c$ curve as well as a maximum $T_c$ comparable with experiments. The normal state is featured with a pseudogap in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ spectra associated with preformed Cooper pairs and non-Fermi liquid strange metal behavior due to hybridization-induced spinon-holon-electron scattering. Our work clarifies the key difference of the two-component scenario of the superconductivity from other mechanisms, and provides a consistent understanding of the high-temperature superconductivity and strange metallic properties of La$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric superfluid weight in multiband superconductors: A microscopic interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Even in non-interacting limit, electrons on different Bloch bands of a multiband system do not move as if they are oblivious to the presence of one another. Instead, they move in concert by virtue of a non-Abelian interband Berry connection. While the impact of this quantum geometric attribute manifests most famously through the Hall response of topological bands, the geometric effects in superconductors have attracted significant recent attention. In particular, much has been discussed about the quantum-metric-induced superfluid weight (SW) in flatband superconductors. In this study, we revisit the geometric SW in generic multiband superconductors and trace its origin to a series of microscopic processes. We separately derive the SW of models containing only intraband Cooper pairing and those involving interband pairing. Two classes of processes enabled by the so-called interband velocity (or the closely related interband Berry connection) are identified: one resembles the transfer of Cooper pairs between different bands, and the other corresponds to virtual single-electron back-and-forth tunneling between the bands. The former contribution manifests as effective Josephson coupling between the multiband superconducting order parameters, while the latter constitutes the only source of SW for a superconducting flatband well isolated from other bands. We further numerically evaluate the SW of a simple two-band superconductor with trivial band topology, showcasing how the geometric contribution is sensitive to the details of the multiband pairing configuration. In particular, we highlight an intriguing scenario of negative SW, which may pave way for the formation of novel pair density wave order. Our study provides deeper and more intuitive insight into the origin and nature of the SW induced by the quantum geometry of paired Bloch states.</description>
