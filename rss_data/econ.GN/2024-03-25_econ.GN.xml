      <title>The Power of Linear Programming in Sponsored Listings Ranking: Evidence from Field Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sponsored listing is one of the major revenue sources for many prominent online marketplaces, such as Amazon, Walmart, and Alibaba. When consumers visit a marketplace's webpage for a specific item, in addition to that item, the marketplace might also display a ranked listing of sponsored items from various third-party sellers. These sellers are charged an advertisement fee if a user purchases any of the sponsored items from this listing. Determining how to rank these sponsored items for each incoming visit is a crucial challenge for online marketplaces, a problem known as sponsored listings ranking (SLR). The major difficulty of SLR lies in balancing the trade-off between maximizing the overall revenue and recommending high-quality and relevant ranked listings. While a more relevant ranking may result in more purchases and consumer engagement, the marketplace also needs to take account of the potential revenue when making ranking decisions. Due to the latency requirement and historical reasons, many online marketplaces use score-based ranking algorithms for SLR optimization. Alternatively, recent research also discusses obtaining the ranking by solving linear programming (LP). In this paper, we collaborate with a leading online global marketplace and conduct a series of field experiments to compare the performance of the score-based ranking algorithms and the LP-based algorithms. The field experiment lasted for $19$ days, which included $329.3$ million visits in total. We observed that the LP-based approach improved all major metrics by $1.80\%$ of revenue, $1.55\%$ of purchase, and $1.39\%$ of the gross merchandise value (GMV), compared to an extremely-tuned score-based algorithm that was previously used in production by the marketplace.</description>

      <title>Teamwork and Spillover Effects in Performance Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article shows how coworker performance affects individual performance evaluation in a teamwork setting at the workplace. We use high-quality data on football matches to measure an important component of individual performance, shooting performance, isolated from collaborative effects. Employing causal machine learning methods, we address the assortative matching of workers and estimate both average and heterogeneous effects. There is substantial evidence for spillover effects in performance evaluations. Coworker shooting performance, meaningfully impacts both, manager decisions and third-party expert evaluations of individual performance. Our results underscore the significant role coworkers play in shaping career advancements and highlight a complementary channel, to productivity gains and learning effects, how coworkers impact career advancement. We characterize the groups of workers that are most and least affected by spillover effects and show that spillover effects are reference point dependent. While positive deviations from a reference point create positive spillover effects, negative deviations are not harmful for coworkers.</description>

      <title>AI Exposure and Strategic Positioning on an Online Work Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI technologies have the potential to affect labor market outcomes by both increasing worker productivity and reducing the demand for certain skills or tasks. Such changes may have important implications for the ways in which workers seek jobs and position themselves. In this project, we examine how exposure to generative AI technologies affects the strategic behavior of freelancer workers on an online work platform following the launch of ChatGPT in December 2022. Relative to their less exposed counterparts, we show that freelancers that are more exposed to language modeling technologies apply for more job posts on the platform following the launch of ChatGPT and increase the concentration of these applications across specializations. We document heterogeneity in this effect across freelancer characteristics and consider how such behaviors shape whether and to what extent the technological shock affects freelancer performance on the platform.</description>

      <title>Measuring Gender and Racial Biases in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In traditional decision making processes, social biases of human decision makers can lead to unequal economic outcomes for underrepresented social groups, such as women, racial or ethnic minorities. Recently, the increasing popularity of Large language model based artificial intelligence suggests a potential transition from human to AI based decision making. How would this impact the distributional outcomes across social groups? Here we investigate the gender and racial biases of OpenAIs GPT, a widely used LLM, in a high stakes decision making setting, specifically assessing entry level job candidates from diverse social groups. Instructing GPT to score approximately 361000 resumes with randomized social identities, we find that the LLM awards higher assessment scores for female candidates with similar work experience, education, and skills, while lower scores for black male candidates with comparable qualifications. These biases may result in a 1 or 2 percentage point difference in hiring probabilities for otherwise similar candidates at a certain threshold and are consistent across various job positions and subsamples. Meanwhile, we also find stronger pro female and weaker anti black male patterns in democratic states. Our results demonstrate that this LLM based AI system has the potential to mitigate the gender bias, but it may not necessarily cure the racial bias. Further research is needed to comprehend the root causes of these outcomes and develop strategies to minimize the remaining biases in AI systems. As AI based decision making tools are increasingly employed across diverse domains, our findings underscore the necessity of understanding and addressing the potential unequal outcomes to ensure equitable outcomes across social groups.</description>

      <title>Human behaviour through a LENS: How Linguistic content triggers Emotions and Norms and determines Strategy choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last two decades, a growing body of experimental research has provided evidence that linguistic frames influence human behaviour in economic games, beyond the economic consequences of the available actions. This article proposes a novel framework that transcends the traditional confines of outcome-based preference models. According to the LENS model, the Linguistic description of the decision problem triggers Emotional responses and suggests potential Norms of behaviour, which then interact to shape an individual's Strategic choice. The article reviews experimental evidence that supports each path of the LENS model. Furthermore, it identifies and discusses several critical research questions that arise from this model, pointing towards avenues for future inquiry.</description>

      <title>New Concept for the Value Function of Prospect Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00131v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the prospect theory, value function is typically concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, with losses usually having a steeper slope than gains. The neural system largely differs from the loss and gains sides. Five new studies on neurons related to this issue have examined neuronal responses to losses, gains, and reference points. This study investigates a new concept of the value function. A value function with a neuronal cusp may show variations and behavior cusps with catastrophe where a trader closes one's position.</description>

      <title>Path-dependency and leverage effect on capital return in periodic growth processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probability theory is applied to the finances of periodic growth processes. The expected value of the profit rate, on accrual basis, does not directly depend on divestments, neither on the capitalization path. The expected value of capitalization is path dependent. Because of the path-dependent capitalization, the return rate on capital is path-dependent, and the time-average return rate on capital differs from the expected value of the return rate on capital for the growth cycle. In the absence of intermediate divestments, the internal rate of return is path-independent, thereby differing from the expected value of the rate of return on capital. It is shown that the rotation cycle length maximizing the return rate on equity is independent of market interest rate. Correspondingly, from the viewpoint of wealth accumulation, the often-suggested dependency of suitable rotation length on discount rate appears to be a modeling artifact. Leverage effect enters the microeconomics of the growth processes through a separate leverage equation, where the leverage coefficient may reach positive or negative values. The leverage effect on the internal rate of return and the net present value are discussed. Both effects are solvable, resulting in incorrect estimates.</description>
