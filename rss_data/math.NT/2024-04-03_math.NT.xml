      <title>Norm one tori and Hasse norm principle, III: Degree $16$ case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field, $T$ be an algebraic $k$-torus, $X$ be a smooth $k$-compactification of $T$ and ${\rm Pic}\,\overline{X}$ be the Picard group of $\overline{X}=X\times_k\overline{k}$ where $\overline{k}$ is a fixed separable closure of $k$. Hoshi, Kanai and Yamasaki [HKY22], [HKY23] determined $H^1(k,{\rm Pic}\, \overline{X})$ for norm one tori $T=R^{(1)}_{K/k}(\mathbb{G}_m)$ and gave a necessary and sufficient condition for the Hasse norm principle for extensions $K/k$ of number fields with $[K:k]\leq 15$. In this paper, we treat the case where $[K:k]=16$. Among $1954$ transitive subgroups $G=16Tm\leq S_{16}$ $(1\leq m\leq 1954)$ up to conjugacy, we determine $1101$ (resp. $774$, $31$, $37$, $1$, $1$, $9$) cases with $H^1(k,{\rm Pic}\, \overline{X})=0$ (resp. $Z/2Z$, $(Z/2Z)^{\oplus 2}$, $(Z/2Z)^{\oplus 3}$, $(Z/2Z)^{\oplus 4}$, $(Z/2Z)^{\oplus 6}$, $Z/4Z$) where $G$ is the Galois group of the Galois closure $L/k$ of $K/k$. We see that $H^1(k,{\rm Pic}\, \overline{X})=0$ implies that the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. In particular, among $22$ primitive $G=16Tm$ cases, i.e. $H\leq G=16Tm$ is maximal with $[G:H]=16$, we determine exactly $6$ cases $(m=178, 708, 1080, 1329, 1654, 1753)$ with $H^1(k,{\rm Pic}\, \overline{X})\neq 0$ $($$(Z/2Z)^{\oplus 2}$, $Z/2Z$, $(Z/2Z)^{\oplus 2}$, $Z/2Z$, $Z/2Z$, $Z/2Z$). Moreover, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the Hasse norm principle for $K/k$ with $[K:k]=16$ for $22$ primitive $G=16Tm$ cases. As a consequence of the $22$ primitive $G$ cases, we get the Tamagawa number $\tau(T)=1$, $1/2$, $1/4$ of $T=R^{(1)}_{K/k}(\mathbb{G}_m)$ over a number field $k$ via Ono's formula $\tau(T)=1/|Sha(T)|$ where $Sha(T)$ is the Shafarevich-Tate group of $T$.</description>

      <title>Converse theorems for Hilbert modular forms of higher level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove two results on converse theorems for Hilbert modular forms of higher level over totally real fields of degree $r&gt;1$. The first result recovers a Hilbert modular form (of some level) from an $L$-series satisfying functional equations twisted by all the Hecke characters that are unramified at all finite places. The second result assumes both the above functional equations and an Euler product, and recovers a Hilbert modular form of the expected level predicted by the shape of the functional equations.</description>

      <title>Creating Decidable Diophantine Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing an argument of Matiyasevich, we illustrate a method to generate infinitely many diophantine equations whose solutions can be completely described by linear recurrences. In particular, we provide an integer-coefficient polynomial $p(x, y, z)$ whose only integer roots are consecutive triples of Tribonacci numbers.</description>

      <title>A Complete Congruence System for the Erdos-Straus Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we attack the Erdos-Straus conjecture by means of the structure of its solutions, extending and improving the results of a previous paper. Using previous results and supported by the works of Elsholtz and Tao and Monks and Velingker we define a system of congruences for which there are always solutions to the Erdos-Straus conjecture and which we conjecture to include all prime numbers. For this purpose, and always taking into account a result due to Mordell that limits the congruences admitting polynomial identities to those that are not quadratic residues, we will adopt a transversal approach and classify the solutions by their form and not by those congruences that produce them. Thus we define two new types of solutions, which we call Type A and B, and relate them to the already known Type II solutions and study their properties. Finally we conjecture that every prime number has at least one solution of Type A or B and we associate a congruence and a general polynomial to each Type of solution.</description>

      <title>An Infinite Family of Real Quadratic Fields with Three Classes of Perfect Unary Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the theory of perfect unary forms over real quadratic fields. Specifically, we deduce an infinite family of real quadratic fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ when $d=2$ or $3$ mod $4$, such that there are three classes of perfect unary forms up to homothety and equivalence. This work, along with the work in \cite{unitred}, seems to suggest that the number of classes of perfect unary forms is related to the fundamental unit of $K$.</description>

      <title>Motivic interpretations for iterated integrals on some specific algebraic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple zeta values (MZVs for short) can be represented as iterated integrals of $\mathbb{Q}$-rational algebraic differential forms on $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})\setminus\{0, 1, \infty\}$. This interpretation allows us to consider MZVs geometrically, and this is one of the motivations for Deligne--Goncharov, Terasoma et al. to give motivic interpretations of MZVs by using the theory of mixed Tate motives and the motivic fundamental groups.
  In this paper, we consider the iterated integrals on some rational curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ and study their arithmetic properties. They are an extension of MZVs and also include some other known special values such as multiple $\widetilde{T}$-values. Furthermore, we give motivic interpretations of them by investigating a relationship with motivic iterated integrals given by Goncharov. At this point, it is important to consider the base expansion and the Galois invariant part of the space of motivic iterated integrals. Finally, we denote that a motivic interpretation of the alternating multiple mixed values can be given by the same method. Our results also extend a part of author's previous work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime number. Let $f$ be a normalized Hecke eigen-cuspform that is non-ordinary at $p$. Let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field in which $p$ splits. We study the Artin formalism for the two-variable signed $p$-adic $L$-functions attached to $f$ over $K$. In particular, we give evidence of a prediction made by Castella--Ciperiani--Skinner--Sprung.</description>

      <title>Degree $p$ Extensions of Arbitrary Valuation Rings and "Best $f$"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the explicit characterization of the so-called "best f" for degree $p$ Artin-Schreier and degree $p$ Kummer extensions of Henselian valuation rings in residue characteristic $p$. This characterization is mentioned briefly in [Th16, Th18]. Existence of best $f$ is closely related to the defect of such extensions and this characterization plays a crucial role in understanding their intricate structure. We also treat degree $p$ Artin-Schreier defect extensions of higher rank valuation rings, extending the results in [Th16], and thus completing the study of degree $p$ extensions that are the building blocks of the general theory.</description>

      <title>Upper Ramification Groups for Arbitrary Valuation Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.09832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: T. Saito established a ramification theory for ring extensions locally of complete intersection. We show that for a Henselian valuation ring $A$ with field of fractions $K$ and for a finite Galois extension $L$ of $K$, the integral closure $B$ of $A$ in $L$ is a filtered union of subrings of $B$ which are of complete intersection over $A$. By this, we can obtain a ramification theory of Henselian valuation rings as the limit of the ramification theory of Saito. Our theory generalizes the ramification theory of complete discrete valuation rings of Abbes-Saito. We study "defect extensions" which are not treated in these previous works.</description>

      <title>On the Gauss-Kuzmin-L\'evy problem for nearest integer continued fractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07452v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note provides an effective bound in the Gauss-Kuzmin-L\'evy problem for some Gauss type shifts associated with nearest integer continued fractions, acting on the interval $I_0=[0,\frac{1}{2}]$ or $I_0=[-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}]$. We prove asymptotic formulas $\lambda (T^{-n}I) =\mu(I)(\vert I_0 \vert +O(q^n))$ for such transformations $T$, where $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb R$, $\mu$ the normalized $T$-invariant Lebesgue absolutely continuous measure, $I$ subinterval in $I_0$, and $q=0.288$ is smaller than the Wirsing constant $q_W=0.3036\ldots$</description>

      <title>On a version of the Problem B of Mahler involving derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01907v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1902, Paul St\"ackel constructed an analytic function $f(z)$ in a neighborhood of the origin, which was transcendental, and with the property that both $f(z)$ and its inverse, as well as its derivatives, assumed algebraic values at all algebraic points in this neighborhood. Inspired by this result, Mahler in 1976 questioned the existence of an transcendental entire function $f(z)$ such that $f(\overline{\mathbb{Q}})$ and $f^{-1}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}})$ are subsets of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}.$ This problem was solved by Marques and Moreira in 2017. As St\"acklel's result involved derivatives, it is natural to question whether we have an analogous result for transcendental entire functions involving derivatives. In this article, we show that there are an uncountable amount of such functions.</description>

      <title>Randomisation in the Josephus Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Josephus problem is a well--studied elimination problem consisting in determining the position of the survivor after repeated applications of a deterministic rule removing one person at a time from a given group.
  A natural probabilistic variant of this process is introduced in this paper. More precisely, in this variant, the survivor is determined after performing a succession of Bernouilli trials with parameter $p$ designating each time the person to remove. When the number of participants tends to infinity, the main result characterises the limit distribution of the position of the survivor with an increasing degree of precision as the parameter approaches the unbiaised case $p=1/2$. Then, the convergence rate to the position of the survivor is obtained in the form of a Central-Limit Theorem.
  A number of other variants of the suggested probabilistic elimination process are also considered. They each admit a specific limit behavior which, in most cases, is stated in the form of an open problem.</description>
