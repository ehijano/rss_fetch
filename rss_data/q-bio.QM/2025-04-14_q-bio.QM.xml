      <title>ICBM community cancer registry analysis: a focus on Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma cases in missileers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the incidence and age at diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) among missileers stationed at Malmstrom Air Force Base (MAFB) compared to national benchmarks. The analysis was motivated by reports of elevated cancer diagnoses within the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) community, specifically targeting NHL cases due to initial media focus and data collection through the Torchlight Initiative. The methodology integrates simulation-based estimation of expected diagnoses using incomplete data and expert knowledge on the underlying population. Statistical tests, including the Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) and a nonparametric Sign Test, were used to evaluate both the rate of diagnosis and age at diagnosis. The results demonstrate a statistically significant increase in NHL diagnoses among missileers in the later decades, with observed rates surpassing expected benchmarks. The study also finds that the median age of diagnosis is significantly younger for the study population compared to national averages. Key methodological contributions include estimating the population size and service start ages when comprehensive cohort data is unavailable, incorporating uncertainty quantification, and applying multiple hypothesis testing to identify temporal patterns. While the study acknowledges limitations such as small sample size and estimation uncertainty, as well as recognizing the study subjects as self-reported diagnoses, the findings highlight the effectiveness of these statistical techniques in identifying significant deviations from expected rates. Future studies should refine and build upon these methods, incorporating survival analysis and additional covariates to improve the robustness and scope of the results.</description>

      <title>Lemons and Learning: Adult and Juvenile Free-Ranging Dogs Navigate Aversive Foraging Challenges Differently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how animals make foraging decisions in challenging or unpleasant contexts sheds light on the processes that underlie cognitive development and the evolution of adaptive foraging techniques in complex ecological settings. In order to investigate how age, gender, and environmental cues impact decision-making and scavenging behaviour, this study explores how juvenile and adult free-ranging dogs (FRDs) respond to aversive stimuli, specifically different concentrations of lemon juice. We conducted a three-bowl choice experiment using lemon juice at concentrations of 25%, 33.3%, and 50% with 73 juvenile FRDs. The juvenile FRD data were compared with adult behavioural data from a prior experiment. The findings indicated that juvenile dogs' foraging behaviour was consistent under provided circumstances, suggesting that their capacity to adapt to aversive acidic stimuli was limited, possibly due to their inexperience and developing cognitive abilities. Adult dogs, on the other hand, exhibited selective foraging by preferring lower acidity and demonstrating more deliberate foraging strategies. Age, sex, and acidity all had significant impact on eating behaviour, with males displaying a higher tolerance to unpleasant stimuli. Markov chain analysis showed repetitive decision-making patterns, especially in adults, indicating continuous sensory evaluation before food consumption, while strategy-making behaviour increased the likelihood of food consumption in juveniles, suggesting juveniles are possibly beginning to build adaptive skills. These findings demonstrate the dynamic interaction of developmental stage, sensory processing, and individual diversity, in developing of foraging strategies of FRDs. This offers new perspectives to understand the cognitive basis of scavenging behaviour in aversive ecological conditions like urban and human-dominated landscapes.</description>

      <title>Efficient gPC-based quantification of probabilistic robustness for systems in neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robustness analysis is very important in biology and neuroscience, to unravel behavioural patterns of systems that are conserved despite large parametric uncertainties. To make studies of probabilistic robustness more efficient and scalable when addressing complex models in neuroscience, we propose an alternative to computationally expensive Monte Carlo (MC) methods by introducing and analysing the generalised polynomial chaos (gPC) framework for uncertainty quantification. We consider both intrusive and non-intrusive gPC approaches, which turn out to be scalable and allow for a fast comprehensive exploration of parameter spaces. Focusing on widely used models of neural dynamics as case studies, we explore the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy of gPC methods, and we adopt the proposed methodology to investigate parametric uncertainties in models that feature multiple dynamic regimes.</description>

      <title>OLAF: An Open Life Science Analysis Framework for Conversational Bioinformatics Powered by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: OLAF (Open Life Science Analysis Framework) is an open-source platform that enables researchers to perform bioinformatics analyses using natural language. By combining large language models (LLMs) with a modular agent-pipe-router architecture, OLAF generates and executes bioinformatics code on real scientific data, including formats like .h5ad. The system includes an Angular front end and a Python/Firebase backend, allowing users to run analyses such as single-cell RNA-seq workflows, gene annotation, and data visualization through a simple web interface. Unlike general-purpose AI tools, OLAF integrates code execution, data handling, and scientific libraries in a reproducible, user-friendly environment. It is designed to lower the barrier to computational biology for non-programmers and support transparent, AI-powered life science research.</description>

      <title>An Agnostic Biosignature Based on Modeling Panspermia and Terraformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental goal of astrobiology is to detect life outside of Earth. This proves to be an exceptional challenge outside of our solar system, where strong assumptions must be made about how life would manifest and interact with its planet. Such assumptions are required because of the lack of a consensus theory of living systems, or an understanding of the possible extent of planetary dynamics. Here we explore a model of life spreading between planetary systems via panspermia and terraformation. Our model shows that as life propagates across the galaxy, correlations emerge between planetary characteristics and location, and can function as a population-scale agnostic biosignature. This biosignature is agnostic because it is independent of strong assumptions about any particular instantiation of life or planetary characteristic--by focusing on a specific hypothesis of what life may do, rather than what life may be. By clustering planets based on their observed characteristics, and examining the spatial extent of these clusters, we demonstrate (and evaluate) a way to prioritize specific planets for further observation--based on their potential for containing life. We consider obstacles that must be overcome to practically implement our approach, including identifying specific ways in which better understanding astrophysical and planetary processes would improve our ability to detect life. Finally, we consider how this model leads us to think in novel ways about scales of life and planetary replication.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fine-Tuning of Single-Cell Foundation Models Enables Zero-Shot Molecular Perturbation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting transcriptional responses to novel drugs provides a unique opportunity to accelerate biomedical research and advance drug discovery efforts. However, the inherent complexity and high dimensionality of cellular responses, combined with the extremely limited available experimental data, makes the task challenging. In this study, we leverage single-cell foundation models (FMs) pre-trained on tens of millions of single cells, encompassing multiple cell types, states, and disease annotations, to address molecular perturbation prediction. We introduce a drug-conditional adapter that allows efficient fine-tuning by training less than 1% of the original foundation model, thus enabling molecular conditioning while preserving the rich biological representation learned during pre-training. The proposed strategy allows not only the prediction of cellular responses to novel drugs, but also the zero-shot generalization to unseen cell lines. We establish a robust evaluation framework to assess model performance across different generalization tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results across all settings, with significant improvements in the few-shot and zero-shot generalization to new cell lines compared to existing baselines.</description>
