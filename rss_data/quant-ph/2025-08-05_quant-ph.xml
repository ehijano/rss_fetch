      <title>Proof of Hiding Conjecture in Gaussian Boson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a promising protocol for demonstrating quantum computational advantage. One of the key steps for proving classical hardness of GBS is the so-called ``hiding conjecture'', which asserts that one can ``hide'' a complex Gaussian matrix as a submatrix of the outer product of Haar unitary submatrices in total variation distance. In this paper, we prove the hiding conjecture for input states with the maximal number of squeezed states, which is a setup that has recently been realized experimentally [Madsen et al., Nature 606, 75 (2022)]. In this setting, the hiding conjecture states that a $o(\sqrt{M})\times o(\sqrt{M})$ submatrix of an $M\times M$ circular orthogonal ensemble (COE) random matrix can be well-approximated by a complex Gaussian matrix in total variation distance as $M\to\infty$. This is the first rigorous proof of the hiding property for GBS in the experimentally relevant regime, and puts the argument for hardness of classically simulating GBS with a maximal number of squeezed states on a comparable level to that of the conventional boson sampling of [Aaronson and Arkhipov, Theory Comput. 9, 143 (2013)].</description>

      <title>Ultimate resolution limits in coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering is a widely used imaging technique that provides chemical contrast without the need for labels, making it an extremely valuable tool in physics, chemistry, and biology. In this work, we explore its fundamental precision limits by applying tools from quantum information theory. We identify optimal measurement strategies and show that spatial mode demultiplexing--a technique already accessible in current experimental setups--can achieve these quantum limits and in many situations improve the sensitivity of conventional intensity measurements. Building on this, we introduce an advanced imaging scheme based on vortex beams, which we predict to enhance the image information in the final quantum state of light and thereby lead to even higher resolution and sensitivity. These findings establish a clear path for enhancing nonlinear imaging techniques using concepts from quantum science, bridging the gap between established microscopy methods and the emerging capabilities of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Telecommunications fiber-optic and free-space quantum local area networks at the Air Force Research Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing, sensing, timing, and networking technologies mature, quantum network testbeds are being deployed across the United States and around the world. To support the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)'s mission of building heterogeneous quantum networks, we report on the development of Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs) operating at telecommunications-band frequencies. The multi-node, reconfigurable QLANs include deployed optical fiber and free-space links connected to pristine laboratory environments and rugged outdoor test facilities. Each QLAN is tailored to distinct operating conditions and use cases, with unique environmental characteristics and capabilities. We present network topologies and in-depth link characterization data for three such networks. Using photonic integrated circuit-based sources of entangled photons, we demonstrate entanglement distribution of time-energy Bell states across deployed fiber in a wooded environment. The high quality of the entanglement is confirmed by a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality violation of $S=2.700$, approaching the theoretical maximum of $S=2.828$. We conclude with a discussion of future work aimed at expanding QLAN functionality and enabling entanglement distribution between heterogeneous matter-based quantum systems, including superconducting qubits and trapped ions. These results underscore the practical viability of field-deployable, qubit-agnostic quantum network infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of an always-on exchange-only spin qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional exchange-only (EO) spin qubit demonstrations, quantum gates have been implemented using sequences of individually pulsed pairwise exchange interactions with only one exchange coupling active at a time. Alternatively, multiple non-commuting exchange interactions can be pulsed simultaneously, reducing circuit depths and providing protection against leakage. We demonstrate high-fidelity quantum control of an always-on exchange-only (AEON) qubit, operated using simultaneous exchange pulses in a triangular quantum dot (QD) array. We use blind randomized benchmarking to characterize the performance of the full AEON single-qubit Clifford gate set, achieving an average Clifford gate fidelity $F_{\rm C1}$ = 99.86\%. Extensions of this work may enable more efficient EO two-qubit entangling gates as well as the implementation of native $i$-Toffoli gates in Loss-DiVincenzo single-spin qubits.</description>

      <title>QPP-RNG: A Conceptual Quantum System for True Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate the \emph{Quasi-Superposition Quantum-inspired System (QSQS)} -- a conceptual quantum system for randomness generation built on measuring two conjugate observables of a permutation sorting process: the deterministic permutation count $n_p$ and the fundamentally non-deterministic sorting time $t$. By analogy with quantum systems, these observables are linked by an uncertainty-like constraint: algorithmic determinism ensures structural uniformity, while system-level fluctuations introduce irreducible unpredictability. We realize this framework concretely as \emph{QPP-RNG}, a system-embedded, software-based true random number generator (TRNG). In QPP-RNG, real-time measurements of sorting time $t$ -- shaped by CPU pipeline jitter, cache latency, and OS scheduling -- dynamically reseed the PRNG driving the permutation sequence. Crucially, QSQS transforms initially right-skewed raw distributions of $n_p$ and $t$ into nearly uniform outputs after modulo reduction, thanks to internal degeneracies that collapse many distinct states into the same output symbol. Empirical results show that as the repetition factor $m$ increases, output entropy converges toward theoretical maxima: Shannon and min-entropy values approach 8 bits, chi-squared statistics stabilize near ideal uniformity, and bell curves visually confirm the flattening from skewed to uniform distributions. Beyond practical implications, QSQS unifies deterministic algorithmic processes with non-deterministic physical fluctuations, offering a physics-based perspective for engineering true randomness in post-quantum cryptographic systems.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic RF-to-Microwave Transducer based on a DC-Biased Electromechanical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a two-stage, heterodyne rf-to-microwave transducer that combines a tunable electrostatic pre-amplifier with a superconducting electromechanical cavity. A metalized Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane (3 MHz frequency) forms the movable plate of a vacuum-gap capacitor in a microwave LC resonator. A dc bias across the gap converts any small rf signal into a resonant electrostatic force proportional to the bias, providing a voltage-controlled gain that multiplies the cavity's intrinsic electromechanical gain. In a flip-chip device with a 1.5 $\mathrm{\mu}$m gap operated at 10 mK we observe dc-tunable anti-spring shifts, and rf-to-microwave transduction at 49 V bias, achieving a charge sensitivity of 87 $\mathrm{\mu}$e/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ (0.9 nV/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$). Extrapolation to sub-micron gaps and state-of-the-art $Q&gt;10^8$ membrane resonators predicts sub-200 fV/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity, establishing dc-biased electromechanics as a practical route towards quantum-grade rf electrometers and low-noise modular heterodyne links for superconducting microwave circuits and charge or voltage sensing.</description>

      <title>Robustly self-testing all maximally entangled states in every finite dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a device-independent, noise-tolerant certification of maximally entangled states in every finite dimension $d$. The core ingredient is a $d$-input, $d$-outcome Bell experiment that generalizes the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt test from qubits to qudits, where each setting is a non-diagonal Heisenberg-Weyl observable. For every odd prime $d \geq 3$, the associated Bell operator has an exact sum-of-positive-operators decomposition, yielding the Cirelson bound in closed form, from which we reconstruct the Heisenberg-Weyl commutation relations on the support of the state. We then extend the Mayers-Yao local isometry from qubits to prime-dimensional systems and show that any $\epsilon$-near-optimal strategy below that bound is, up to local isometries, within trace distance $\delta = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\epsilon})$ of the ideal maximally entangled state; the implemented measurements are correspondingly close to the target observables. Via a tensor-factor argument, the prime-dimension result extends the self-testing protocol to every composite dimension $d$. The protocol uses standard Heisenberg-Weyl operations and non-Clifford phase gates that are diagonal in the computational basis, making it directly applicable to high-dimensional photonic and atomic platforms.</description>

      <title>Biorthogonal Neural Network Approach to Two-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems exhibit a rich array of physical phenomena, including non-Hermitian skin effects and exceptional points, that remain largely inaccessible to existing numerical techniques. In this work, we investigate the application of variational Monte Carlo and neural network wavefunction representations to examine their ground-state (the eigenstate with the smallest real part energy) properties. Due to the breakdown of the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle in non-Hermitian settings, we develop a self-consistent symmetric optimization framework based on variance minimization with a dynamically updated energy estimate. Our approach respects the biorthogonal structure of left and right eigenstates, and is further strengthened by exploiting system symmetries and pseudo-Hermiticity. Tested on a two-dimensional non-Hermitian transverse field Ising model endowed with a complex longitudinal field, our method achieves high accuracy across both parity-time symmetric and broken phases. Moreover, we propose novel optimization routines that address the challenges posed by exceptional points and provide reliable convergence to the ground state in regimes where standard variational techniques fail. Lastly, we show, through extensive numerical evidence, that our method offers a scalable and flexible computational tool to investigate non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems, beyond the reach of conventional numerical techniques such as the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm.</description>

      <title>A causal derivation of the algebraic approach to quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is commonly assumed that every quantum system is represented by some algebra of operators. Doubt is cast on this assumption by what appears, at first glance, to be a reasonable candidate for a quantum system that is not naturally represented by any algebra. To resolve this puzzle, this work draws inspiration from recent frameworks for causal modelling in quantum theory to propose a "causal view" of quantum systems. The causal view defines quantum systems purely in terms of the causal structure of the unitary dynamics. The algebraic representation of quantum systems is derived from the causal view: it is proven that every quantum system corresponds to a unique von Neumann algebra of operators. The causal view is extended with a definition of a "classical quantum system" inspired by quantum Darwinism. It is shown that such a system corresponds to a unique commutative von Neumann operator algebra, completing the derivation of the traditional algebraic approach to quantum systems from the causal view. The causal view is contrasted with the "epistemic view" of quantum systems, which is incompatible with the algebraic approach.</description>

      <title>TensoMeta-VQC: A Tensor-Train-Guided Meta-Learning Framework for Robust and Scalable Variational Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental barriers in scalability, primarily due to barren plateaus and quantum noise sensitivity. To address these challenges, we introduce TensoMeta-VQC, a novel tensor-train (TT)-guided meta-learning framework designed to improve the robustness and scalability of VQC significantly. Our framework fully delegates the generation of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Based on Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum simulation tasks demonstrate that TensoMeta-VQC consistently achieves superior performance and robust noise tolerance, establishing it as a principled pathway toward practical and scalable VQC on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Gowers Norm Estimation, Polynomial Testing, and Arithmetic Progression Counting over Finite Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a family of quantum algorithms for estimating Gowers uniformity norms $ U^k $ over finite abelian groups and demonstrate their applications to testing polynomial structure and counting arithmetic progressions. Building on recent work for estimating the $ U^2 $-norm over $ \mathbb{F}_2^n $, we generalize the construction to arbitrary finite fields and abelian groups for higher values of $ k $. Our algorithms prepare quantum states encoding finite differences and apply Fourier sampling to estimate uniformity norms, enabling efficient detection of structural correlations.
  As a key application, we show that for certain degrees $ d = 4, 5, 6 $ and under appropriate conditions on the underlying field, there exist quasipolynomial-time quantum algorithms that distinguish whether a bounded function $ f(x) $ is a degree-$ d $ phase polynomial or far from any such structure. These algorithms leverage recent inverse theorems for Gowers norms, together with amplitude estimation, to reveal higher-order algebraic correlations.
  We also develop a quantum method for estimating the number of 3-term arithmetic progressions in Boolean functions $ f : \mathbb{F}_p^n \to \{0,1\} $, based on estimating the $ U^2 $-norm. Though not as query-efficient as Grover-based counting, our approach provides a structure-sensitive alternative aligned with additive combinatorics.
  Finally, we demonstrate that our techniques remain valid under certain quantum noise models, due to the shift-invariance of Gowers norms. This enables noise-resilient implementations within the NISQ regime and suggests that Gowers-norm-based quantum algorithms may serve as robust primitives for quantum property testing, learning, and pseudorandomness.</description>

      <title>In situ Al$_2$O$_3$ passivation of epitaxial tantalum and aluminum films enables long-term stability in superconducting microwave resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term stability of superconducting microwave resonators is essential for scalable quantum technologies; however, surface and interface degradation continue to limit device stability. Here, we demonstrate exceptional stability in microstrip resonators fabricated from epitaxial tantalum and aluminum films, protected by in situ deposited Al$_2$O$_3$ under ultra-high vacuum. These resonators initially exhibit internal quality factors (Qi) exceeding one million and maintain high performance with minimal degradation after up to fourteen months of air exposure. In contrast, devices relying on native surface oxides show substantial declines in Qi over time, indicating increased microwave losses. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the in situ Al$_2$O$_3$ effectively suppresses interfacial oxidation and preserves the chemical integrity of the underlying superconducting films, whereas native oxides permit progressive oxidation, leading to device degradation. These findings establish a robust, scalable passivation strategy that addresses a longstanding materials challenge in the development of superconducting quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Unitary Gate Synthesis via Polynomial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control plays a crucial role in the development of quantum technologies, particularly in the design and implementation of fast and accurate gates for quantum computing. Here, we present a method to synthesize gates using the Magnus expansion. In particular, we formulate a polynomial optimization problem that allows us to find the global solution without resorting to approximations of the exponential. The global method we use provides a certificate of globality and lets us do single-shot optimization, which implies it is generally faster than local methods. By optimizing over Hermitian matrices generating the unitaries, instead of the unitaries themselves, we can reduce the size of the polynomial to optimize, leading to faster convergence and better scalability, compared to the QCPOP method. Numerical experiments comparing our results with CRAB and GRAPE show that we maintain high accuracy of QCPOP, while improving computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Proof of quantum to classical transition for the center of mass of quantum many body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical limit of quantum mechanics is investigated, by focusing on the study of the center of mass of a many-body system where each particle is described by quantum mechanics. We study how, in the limit when the number of particles diverges and under quite general assumptions, the center of mass of the system is not anymore described by quantum mechanics but by classical mechanics: the center of mass of the system becomes with a well-defined position and momentum, the state of the center of mass is fully determined by its position and by its momentum, and its dynamics is given by the classical law of dynamics. In order to get this result, three assumptions on the many-body system are necessary: the total mass of the system must be much larger than the mass of each particle composing the system; at most a finite number of particles has non-zero correlation in position with an infinite number of particles; finally, when the number of particles composing the system diverge, the variance in position of each particle converges to a finite value. These assumptions are commonly realized for a macroscopic solid and liquid systems. Finally, we sketch a possible experimental setup aiming at observing the quantum-to-classical transition of the center of mass of a massive many-body system. The results obtained in this paper show how the classical limit of quantum mechanics can be naturally achieved without the need to modify quantum mechanics, without the need to have an external environment and without the need of changing the interpretations of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Elastic Electron Scattering: Perturbation theory misses fundamental aspects of Bragg scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic electron scattering is one of the primary means of investigating materials on the atomic scale. It is usually described by modeling the sample as a fixed, static, perturbative potential, thereby completely neglecting the quantum nature of the atoms inside. In this work, we present a quantum treatment of elastic electron scattering. We show that the interaction of the probe beam and the sample results in entanglement between the two systems, which can have far-reaching consequences, particularly on coherence and image contrast. As a timely example, we discuss decoherence in Bragg scattering on nanoparticles. We also investigate under which conditions the conventional scattering theory is recovered.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Gravity-Induced Entanglement via Squeezed Input Light under Finite Measurement Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01397v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the advantage of using squeezed input light for generating gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) through Fourier-domain analysis. Based on the findings of [1], which demonstrated the feasibility of detecting GIE in optomechanical systems under quantum control, we further demonstrate that squeezed input light can reduce the optical noise in the mechanical conditional state and enhance GIE. Furthermore, we estimate the systematic and statistical errors in the measurement of GIE using the Fourier transformation over a finite measurement time. Based on the error estimations using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in GIE detection, we find that a total measurement time of 10^6 s is required to achieve SNR=1 when using squeezed input light, whereas 10^{6.8} s is needed without squeezed input light. This result highlights the effectiveness of optomechanical systems and the critical role of squeezed input light in enhancing the detectability of GIE.</description>

      <title>Erbium-Doped Fibre Quantum Memory for Chip-Integrated Quantum-Dot Single Photons at 980 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of long-distance quantum communication and the envisioned quantum internet relies on coherent hybrid light-matter interfaces connecting quantum light emitters with quantum memory (QM) systems. Unlike probabilistic photon pair sources such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion, deterministic quantum light emitters enable the on-demand production of pure and bright single and entangled photons, essential for scalable quantum networks. In this work, we present the first experimental realization of a coherent hybrid light-matter interface between a chip-integrated InAsP/InP nanowire quantum dot (QD) and a solid-state QM based on Er$^{3+}$ ions doped in a glass silica fiber (erbium-doped fiber, EDF). The emission spectrum of the InAsP/InP nanowire QD aligns with the absorption bandwidth of the EDF at 980 nm at cryogenic temperatures, allowing efficient interaction between the two systems. To demonstrate this, we present a spectroscopic characterization of the $^{4}I_{15/2} \leftrightarrow ^{4}I_{11/2}$ optical transition in EDF at 980 nm. Our measurements reveal substantial inhomogeneous broadening of this optical transition and a long spin population lifetime, underscoring EDFs potential for broadband QM implementation. We implement an 8 GHz bandwidth multimode QM based on the Atomic Frequency Comb protocol, enabling the storage and retrieval of 59 weak coherent pulses. Furthermore, we characterize single-photon emission from an InAsP/InP nanowire QD at 980 nm and demonstrate its deterministic storage and recall in the EDF QM. Notably, this is achieved without spectral tuning of the QD emission, demonstrating its direct compatibility with a solid-state QM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we develop in detail a causal model of the hydrogen atom, building on the earlier work of Dewdney and Malik [1] in which they outlined a causal model of the hydrogen atom, focusing more on a causal model of angular momentum measurement and of the EPR experiment. We interpret the resulting formulae differently leading to new electron orbits. We develop in detail the relationship between electron orbits, angular momentum and the quantum potential.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing with Bright Two-Mode Squeezed Light in a Distributed Network of Gyroscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in quantum technologies have enabled significant improvements in the precision of optical sensing systems. This work explores the integration of distributed quantum sensing (DQS) with optical gyroscopes to improve the estimation accuracy of angular velocity. Utilizing bright two-mode squeezed states (bTMSS), which offer high photon numbers and strong bipartite quantum correlations, we propose a novel configuration that leverages continuous-variable entanglement across multiple spatially separated optical gyroscopes. Unlike traditional quantum sensing that enhances a single sensor, our approach focuses on estimating a global phase shift corresponding to the average angular rotation across distributed optical gyroscopes with quantum-enhanced sensitivity. We analyze the phase sensitivities of different bTMSS configurations, including M mode-entangled bTMSS and separable M-bTMSS, and evaluate their performance through the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. The analysis shows that, with 5% photon loss in every channel in the system, the proposed scheme shows a sensitivity enhancement of ~9.3 dB beyond the shot-noise limit, with an initial squeezing of ~9.8 dB. The present scheme has potential applications in quantum-enhanced inertial navigation and precision metrology within emerging quantum networks.</description>

      <title>A machine learning approach to tomographic pattern generation and classification of quantum states of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical tomograms can be envisaged as patterns. The Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) algorithm provides a platform to train the machine to compare patterns corresponding to input and generated tomograms. Using a deep-learning framework with two convolutional neural networks and WGAN, we have trained the machine to generate tomograms of Fock states, coherent states (CS) and the single photon added CS ($1$-PACS). The training process was continued until the Wasserstein distance between the input and output tomographic patterns levelled off at a low value. The mean photon number, variances and higher moments were extracted directly from the generated tomograms, to distinguish between different Fock states and also between the CS and the $1$-PACS, without using an additional classifier neural network. The robustness of our results has been verified using two error models and also with different colormaps that define the tomographic patterns. We have examined if the training program successfully reflected some of the findings in a recent experiment in which state reconstruction was carried out to establish that the fidelities between an amplified CS, an optimal CS and a $1$-PACS were close to unity, over a range of parameter values. By training the machine to reproduce tomograms corresponding to these specific states, and comparing the mean photon numbers of these states obtained directly from the tomograms, we have established that the variations in these observables reflect the experimental trends. State reconstruction from tomograms could be challenging, in general, since the Hilbert space associated with quantized light is large. The tomographic approach provides a viable alternative to detailed state reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the use of machine learning to generate optical tomograms from which the states can be directly characterized.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Clifford to qubit mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algebras with given (anti-)commutativity structure are widespread in quantum mechanics. This structure is captured by quasi-Clifford algebras (QCA): a QCA generated by $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ is is given by the relations $\alpha_i^2 = k_i$ and $\alpha_j \alpha_i = (-1)^{\chi_{ij}} \alpha_i \alpha_j$, where $k_i \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\chi_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}$. We present a mapping from QCA to Pauli algebras and discuss its use in quantum information and computation. The mapping also provides a Wedderburn decomposition of matrix groups with quasi-Clifford structure. This provides a block-diagonalization for e.g. Pauli groups, while for Majorana operators the Jordan-Wigner transform is recovered. Applications to the symmetry reduction of semidefinite programs and for constructing maximal anti-commuting subsets are discussed.</description>

      <title>RinQ: Predicting central sites in proteins on current quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce RinQ, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for identifying functionally critical residues in proteins, utilizing techniques in quantum optimization. To that end, protein structures are modeled as residue interaction networks (RINs), and the centrality detection task is cast as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. Solved using D-Wave's simulated annealing, this approach is applied to a diverse set of proteins, including small peptides and biologically significant regulatory proteins. RinQ consistently finds residues that align with classical centrality benchmarks, underscoring the accuracy and reliability of the approach. This work highlights the promise of near-term quantum and quantum-inspired methods for advancing protein network analysis and lays the groundwork for future extensions to larger systems using real quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs, named for their comb-like peaks in the spectrum, are essential for various sensing applications. As the technology develops, its performance has reached the standard quantum limit dictated by the quantum fluctuations of coherent light field. Quantum combs, with their quantum fluctuation engineered via squeezing and entanglement, are the necessary ingredient for overcoming such limits. We develop the theory for designing and analyzing quantum combs, focusing on dual-comb interferometric measurement. Our analyses cover both squeezed and entangled quantum combs with division receivers and heterodyne receivers, leading to four protocols with quantum advantages scalable with squeezing/entanglement strength. In the spectroscopy of a single absorption line, whereas the division receiver with the squeezed comb suffers from amplified thermal noise, the other three protocols demonstrate a surprising robustness to loss at a few comb lines. Such a unique loss-robustness of a scalable quantum advantage has not been found in any traditional quantum sensing protocols.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum-classical framework for Betti number estimation with applications to topological data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a rapidly growing area that applies techniques from algebraic topology to extract robust features from large-scale data. A key task in TDA is the estimation of (normalized) Betti numbers, which capture essential topological invariants. While recent work has led to quantum algorithms for this problem, we explore an alternative direction: combining classical and quantum resources to estimate the Betti numbers of a simplicial complex more efficiently. Assuming the classical description of a simplicial complex, that is, its set of vertices and edges, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm. The classical component enumerates all simplices, and this combinatorial structure is subsequently processed by a quantum algorithm to estimate the Betti numbers. We analyze the performance of our approach and identify regimes where it potentially achieves polynomial to exponential speedups over existing quantum methods, at the trade-off of using more ancilla qubits. We further demonstrate the utility of normalized Betti numbers in concrete applications, highlighting the broader potential of hybrid quantum algorithms in topological data analysis.</description>

      <title>Microscopic analysis of above-threshold ionization driven by squeezed light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Above-threshold ionization (ATI) is a strong-field-driven process where electrons absorb more photons than required for ionization. While ATI dynamics and outputs are well-understood when driven by classical, perfectly coherent light, the recent development of non-classical light sources for strong-field phenomena has spurred interest in their effect on the involved electron dynamics. In this work, we present a microscopic quantum optical theory describing ATI under the influence of strong squeezed light. We observe that squeezed light significantly enhances the coupling between light and matter, making their mutual backaction more important than under classical driving. This backaction profoundly impacts the electronic ionization times, as well as the non-classical properties of the joint electron-light state. This results in pronounced entanglement features, both immediately after ionization, and at later times. These entanglement features are reflected in the properties of the quantum optical state of the driving field revealing notable non-Gaussian features that depend on both, the amount of squeezing, and the number of ionization events occurring during the interaction.</description>

      <title>Bimodal phase transition in a periodically modulated $\Lambda$-type three-level system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of dynamical quantum phase transitions (QPTs) in a periodically driven $\Lambda$-type three-level system (3LS) embedded in a double-mode cavity, described by a three-level Jaynes-Cumming (3L-JC) Hamiltonian. To begin with, we probe the undriven static Hamiltonian in the dressed-state basis to identify and define distinct coupling regimes and critical points associated with both cavity modes. Furthermore, to investigate the dynamical QPTs in this system, we incorporate a periodic modulation across two atomic states (denoted by $|3\rangle_{at}$ and $|2\rangle_{at}$) out of the three available energy levels. By performing necessary transformations and approximations, we reduce the overall Hamiltonian, which contains static and dynamic modulation terms, into an effective 3L-JC Hamiltonian whose system parameters are dependent on the driving parameters. The validity of our approximations is verified using the Loschmidt echo of time-evolved states corresponding to Hamiltonians before and after the approximations. Finally, we demonstrate that by tuning the modulation parameters, it is possible to explore bimodal superradiant phases in a three-level $\Lambda$-type system while remaining within the critical coupling limits of the static Hamiltonian. Our results provide an insight into the manipulation of quantum phases in a three-level system within an effective extended Jaynes-Cummings regime.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian simulation for nonlinear partial differential equation by Schr\"{o}dingerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is a fundamental algorithm in quantum computing that has attracted considerable interest owing to its potential to efficiently solve the governing equations of large-scale classical systems. Exponential speedup through Hamiltonian simulation has been rigorously demonstrated in the case of coupled harmonic oscillators. The question arises as to whether Hamiltonian simulations in other physical systems also accelerate exponentially. Schr\"odingerization is a technique that transforms the governing equations of classical systems into the Schr\"odinger equation. However, since the Schr\"odinger equation is a linear equation, Hamiltonian simulation is often limited to linear equations. The research on Hamiltonian simulation methods for nonlinear governing equations remains relatively limited. In this study, we propose a Hamiltonian simulation method for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The proposed method is named Carleman linearization + Schr\"odingerization (CLS), which combines Carleman linearization (CL) and warped phase transformation (WPT). CL is first applied to transform a nonlinear PDE into a linear differential equation. This linearized equation is then mapped to the Schr\"odinger equation via WPT. The original nonlinear PDE can be solved efficiently by the Hamiltonian simulation of the resulting Schr\"odinger equation. By applying this method, we transform the original governing equation into the Schr\"odinger equation. Solving the transformed Schr\"odinger equation then enables the analysis of the original nonlinear equation. As a specific application, we apply this method to the nonlinear reaction--diffusion equation to demonstrate that Hamiltonian simulations are applicable to nonlinear PDEs.</description>

      <title>First Experience with Real-Time Control Using Simulated VQC-Based Quantum Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of quantum computing into offline reinforcement learning and the deployment of the resulting quantum policy in a real-time control hardware realization of the cart-pole system. Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) are used to represent the policy. Classical model-based offline policy search was applied, in which a pure VQC with trainable input-output weights is used as a policy network instead of a classical multilayer perceptron. The goal is to evaluate the potential of deploying quantum architectures in real-world industrial control problems. The experimental results show that the investigated model-based offline policy search is able to generate quantum policies that can balance the hardware cart-pole.

      <title>Orbital angular momentum of entangled photons as a probe for relativistic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) as both classical and quantum states of light has proven essential in numerous applications, from high-capacity information transfer to enhanced precision and accuracy in metrology. Here, we extend OAM metrology to relativistic scenarios to determine the Lorentz factor of a moving reference frame, exploiting the fact that OAM is not Lorentz invariant. Using OAM correlations of entangled states, we show that their joint OAM spectrum is modified by length contraction, where the rescaling of spatial dimensions alters the orthogonality of the OAM modes themselves. In an emulated experiment, we confirm the predicted broadening of the OAM spectrum and use this to quantitatively infer the Lorentz (contraction) factor, reaching experimentally simulated velocities of up to 0.99c. Our work provides a pathway for novel measurement techniques suitable for relativistic conditions that leverages OAM structured light as a resource.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimal Control for Coherent Spin Dynamics of Radical Pairs via Pontryagin Maximum Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims at devising the shape of the external electromagnetic field which drives the spin dynamics of radical pairs to quantum coherent state through maximization of the triplet-singlet yield in biochemical reactions. The model is a Schr\"{o}dinger system with spin Hamiltonians given by the sum of Zeeman interaction and hyperfine coupling interaction terms. We introduce a one-parameter family of optimal control problems by coupling the Schr\"{o}dinger system to a control field through filtering equations for the electromagnetic field. Fr\'echet differentiability and the Pontryagin Maximum Principle in Hilbert space is proved, and the bang-bang structure of the optimal control is established. A new iterative Pontryagin Maximum Principle (IPMP) method for the identification of the bang-bang optimal control is developed. Numerical simulations based on IPMP and the gradient projection method (GPM) in Hilbert spaces are pursued, and the convergence, stability and the regularization effect are demonstrated. Comparative analysis of filtering with regular optimal electromagnetic field versus non-filtering with bang-bang optimal field ({\it Abdulla et al, Quantum Sci. Technol., {\bf9}, 4, 2024}) demonstrates the change of the maxima of the singlet yield is less than 1\%. The results open a venue for a potential experimental work for the magnetoreception as a manifestation of quantum biological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Distributed fault-tolerant quantum memories over a 2xL array of qubit modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an architecture for a quantum memory distributed over a $2 \times L$ array of modules equipped with a cyclic shift implemented via flying qubits. The logical information is distributed across the first row of $L$ modules and quantum error correction is executed using ancilla modules on the second row equipped with a cyclic shift. This work proves that quantum LDPC codes such as BB codes can maintain their performance in a distributed setting while using solely one simple connector: a cyclic shift. We propose two strategies to perform quantum error correction on a $2 \times L$ module array: (i) The cyclic layout which applies to any stabilizer codes, whereas previous results for qubit arrays are limited to CSS codes. (ii) The sparse cyclic layout, specific to bivariate bicycle (BB) codes. For the $[[144,12,12]]$ BB code, using the sparse cyclic layout we obtain a quantum memory with $12$ logical qubits distributed over $12$ modules, containing $12$ physical qubits each. We propose physical implementations of this architecture using flying qubits, that can be faithfully transported, and include qubits encoded in ions, neutral atoms, electrons or photons. We performed numerical simulations when modules are long ion chains and when modules are single-qubit arrays of ions showing that the distributed BB code achieves a logical error rate below $2 \cdot 10^{-6}$ when the physical error rate is $10^{-3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically investigated the robustness of the Bernstein--Vazirani algorithm in the presence of depolarizing noise using the density matrix formalism. We derive exact expressions for the algorithm's success probability as a function of the depolarizing error rate $\boldsymbol{p}$ and number of qubits $\boldsymbol{n}$. The analysis reveals how performance degrades with increasing system size under realistic noise conditions. Furthermore, it was seen that scaling up quantum systems without simultaneously improving qubit quality leads to a sharp decline in the quantum advantage for this algorithm.</description>

      <title>BVQC: A Backdoor-style Watermarking Scheme for Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) have emerged as a powerful quantum computing paradigm, demonstrating a scaling advantage for problems intractable for classical computation. As VQCs require substantial resources and specialized expertise for their design, they represent significant intellectual properties (IPs). However, existing quantum circuit watermarking techniques suffer from two primary drawbacks: (1) watermarks can be removed during re-compilation of the circuits, and (2) these methods significantly increase task loss due to the extensive length of the inserted watermarks across multiple compilation stages. To address these challenges, we propose BVQC, a backdoor-based watermarking technique for VQCs that preserves the original loss in typical execution settings, while deliberately increasing the loss to a predefined level during watermark extraction. Additionally, BVQC employs a grouping algorithm to minimize the watermark task's interference with the base task, ensuring optimal accuracy for the base task. BVQC retains the original compilation workflow, ensuring robustness against re-compilation. Our evaluations show that BVQC greatly reduces Probabilistic Proof of Authorship (PPA) changes by 9.89e-3 and ground truth distance (GTD) by 0.089 compared to prior watermarking technologies.</description>

      <title>Zeeman Degenerate Sideband Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore degenerate Raman sideband cooling in which neighboring Zeeman states of a fixed hyperfine level are coupled via a two-photon Raman transition. The degenerate coupling between $|F,m_F\rangle\rightarrow |F,m_F-1\rangle$ facilitates the removal of multiple motional quanta in a single cycle. This method greatly reduces the number of cooling cycles required to reach the ground state compared to traditional sideband cooling. We show that near ground state cooling can be achieved with a pulse number as low as $\bar{n}$ where $\bar{n}$ is the average phonon number in the initial thermal state. We demonstrate proof-of-concept in $^{176}\mathrm{Lu}^+$ by coupling neighboring Zeeman levels on the motional sideband for the $F=7$ hyperfine level in $^3D_1$. Starting from a thermal distribution with an average phonon number of 6, we demonstrate near ground-state cooling with $\sim10$ pulses. A theoretical description is given that applies to any $F$ level and demonstrates how effective this approach can be.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty relations are pivotal in delineating the limits of simultaneous measurements for observables. In this paper, we derive four novel uncertainty and reverse uncertainty relations for the sum of variances of two incompatible observables, leveraging the mathematical framework of the Maligranda inequality. These relations are shown to provide tighter bounds than several well-known existing relations. Furthermore, we extend these results to multi-observable scenarios by employing an inequality from M. Kato et al., deriving generalized uncertainty relations that similarly exhibit enhanced precision. The incorporation of the phase angle of the measurement state contributes to strengthening the derived inequalities. Comparative analyses with prior studies confirm the effectiveness of our inequalities in two-observable systems via three illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Quantum Semi-Supervised Learning via Improved Laplacian and Poisson Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a hybrid quantum approach for graph-based semi-supervised learning to enhance performance in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. We introduce two enhanced quantum models, the Improved Laplacian Quantum Semi-Supervised Learning (ILQSSL) and the Improved Poisson Quantum Semi-Supervised Learning (IPQSSL), that incorporate advanced label propagation strategies within variational quantum circuits. These models utilize QR decomposition to embed graph structure directly into quantum states, thereby enabling more effective learning in low-label settings. We validate our methods across four benchmark datasets like Iris, Wine, Heart Disease, and German Credit Card -- and show that both ILQSSL and IPQSSL consistently outperform leading classical semi-supervised learning algorithms, particularly under limited supervision. Beyond standard performance metrics, we examine the effect of circuit depth and qubit count on learning quality by analyzing entanglement entropy and Randomized Benchmarking (RB). Our results suggest that while some level of entanglement improves the model's ability to generalize, increased circuit complexity may introduce noise that undermines performance on current quantum hardware. Overall, the study highlights the potential of quantum-enhanced models for semi-supervised learning, offering practical insights into how quantum circuits can be designed to balance expressivity and stability. These findings support the role of quantum machine learning in advancing data-efficient classification, especially in applications constrained by label availability and hardware limitations.</description>

      <title>Distributed quantum sensing with multi-mode $N00N$ states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum sensing, which estimates a global parameter across distant nodes, has attracted significant interest for applications such as quantum imaging, sensor networks, and global-scale clock synchronization. $N00N$ states are regarded as one of the optimal quantum resources for quantum metrology, enabling the Heisenberg scaling. Recently, the concept of $N00N$ states has been extended to multi-mode $N00N$ states for quantum-enhanced multiple-parameter estimation. However, the application of multi-mode $N00N$ states in distributed quantum sensing remains unexplored. Here, we propose a distributed quantum sensing scheme that achieves the Heisenberg scaling using multi-mode $N00N$ states. We theoretically show that multi-mode $N00N$ states can reach the Heisenberg scaling by examining both the Cram\'er-Rao bound and the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. For experimental demonstration, we employ a four-mode $2002$ state to estimate the average of two spatially distributed phases, achieving a 2.74 dB sensitivity enhancement over the standard quantum limit. We believe that utilizing multi-mode $N00N$ states for distributed quantum sensing offers a promising approach for developing entanglement-enhanced sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Solving Markov Chains with Analog Quantum Computing: The Fine Print</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a growing interest in quantum computing, the number of proposed quantum algorithms grows as well. The practical applicability of these algorithms differs: Some can be applied out-of-the-box, while others require black box oracles, which can not always be easily implemented. One of the first works to explicitly discuss these practical applicability aspects is by Aaronson discussing the \textit{fine print} of the HHL quantum algorithm that solves linear systems of equations. We extend this line of research by providing a similar fine print for the first analog quantum algorithm that computes the stationary distribution of Markov chains. We conclude that more focus should be put on this practical applicability of quantum algorithms, either through a separate line of research, or through more attention when introducing the algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of C-band wavelengths in the field of quantum communication has grown significantly, driving the need for versatile detection solutions, especially in the low intensity domain. Among the desirable features for such detectors, photon-number-resolving (PNR) capability is particularly valuable, since it can offer new possibilities for enhancing security of communication protocols. In this paper, we present the implementation of a receiver that combines low-cost PNR detectors with nonlinear optical interactions to achieve sensitivity at telecom wavelengths. Specifically, we use this receiver to characterize the Poissonian nature of a femtosecond source at 1.5 $\mu$m, produced via white light continuum generation followed by a single-stage amplification process. The obtained results encourage the exploitation of such a detector in more complex schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) enables information-theoretically secure key distribution between remote parties without any assumptions on the internal workings of the devices used for its implementation. However, its communication distance is strictly limited since the loophole-free Bell violation is required to guarantee its security. Therefore, in this paper, we propose two long-distance DI-QKD protocols which use a heralding scheme based on single-photon interference. Our protocols consist of only standard quantum optics tools such as two-mode squeezed states, displacement operations and on-off detectors, making the experimental implementation feasible with current technology. We employ a classical postprocessing method to enhance our protocols' robustness against experimental imperfections. We calculate key rates of the protocols by numerical optimization and show the supremacy of this implementation over existing protocols in terms of communication distances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bargmann invariants, multivariate traces of states, completely characterize any unitary-invariant property of a set of states. Unitary invariants enable the description of quantum resources such as basis-independent coherence and imaginarity, nonstabilizerness, and contextuality. We show that the quantum switch, a higher-order process featuring indefinite causal order, can be used to measure Bargmann invariants of arbitrary order. We also show how simple Hadamard test circuits can deterministically simulate an arbitrary unitary quantum switch. Our results establish a solid bridge between the theory and applications of unitary invariants and higher-order maps in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Heat Transfer across a Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat transfer is a fundamental concept in physics, and how to characterize the microscopical physical mechanism of heat transfer is a significant topic. Recently, a new mechanism for heat transfer, phonon heat transfer across a vacuum through quantum fluctuations, has been experimentally demonstrated in a two-vibrating-membrane system. However, a microscopic quantum electrodynamics theory behind this phenomenon remains unexplored. Here, we establish the nonrelativistic microscopic theory of phonon heat transfer across a vacuum confined by two movable end mirrors of a one-dimensional optomechanical cavity. Under the multimode-cavity-field framework, we obtain a second-order effective Hamiltonian governing the heat transfer effect. This Hamiltonian describes a phonon-exchange interaction between the two mirrors with a strength proportional to a multimode factor and $l_{0}^{-3}$, where $l_{0}$ is the rest cavity length. We also confirm the dependence of the mode temperatures and heat flux on the rest cavity length, corresponding to the thermal steady state of the mirrors. This work initiates the microscopic investigation of thermodynamics based on the optomechanical cavity platform, and will have profound implications for both thermal management in nanoscale devices and cavity optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Designing lattice proteins with variational quantum algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum heuristics have shown promise in solving various optimization problems, including lattice protein folding. Equally relevant is the inverse problem, protein design, where one seeks sequences that fold to a given target structure. The latter problem is often split into two steps: (i) searching for sequences that minimize the energy in the target structure, and (ii) testing whether the generated sequences fold to the desired structure. Here, we investigate the utility of variational quantum algorithms for the first of these two steps on today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We focus on the sequence optimization task, which is less resource-demanding than folding computations. We test the quantum approximate optimization algorithm and variants of it, with problem-informed quantum circuits, as well as the hardware-efficient ansatz, with problem-agnostic quantum circuits. While the former algorithms yield acceptable results in noiseless simulations, their performance drops under noise. With the problem-agnostic circuits, which are more compatible with hardware constraints, an improved performance is observed in both noisy and noiseless simulations. However, the results deteriorate when running on a real quantum device. We attribute this discrepancy to features not captured by the simulated noise model, such as the temporal aspect of the hardware noise.</description>

Abstract: For two non-communicating parties, quantum theory can give rise to probability distributions of outcomes that cannot be reproduced by any local classical model without communication. However, in the case of two-dimensional systems ($d=2$), it is known that allowing a finite amount of classical communication to shared classical resources makes it possible to simulate these quantum correlations. Whether such a simulation remains possible in higher dimensions is still an open question. In this work, we identify the key features of the exact classical protocol in $d=2$, and use them to construct robust approximate protocols in higher dimensions. We assess their performance through a randomized numerical study based on the Total Variation Distance. Our approach exactly reproduces the quantum probability distributions for $d=2$, and performs very well compared to existing protocols for higher dimensions, being the most robust protocol in all cases studied. These results offer new insights into the analytical structure of classical protocols in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Superior resilience to poisoning and amenability to unlearning in quantum machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence hinges on the integrity of its training data, a foundation often compromised by noise and corruption. Here, through a comparative study of classical and quantum neural networks on both classical and quantum data, we reveal a fundamental difference in their response to data corruption. We find that classical models exhibit brittle memorization, leading to a failure in generalization. In contrast, quantum models demonstrate remarkable resilience, which is underscored by a phase transition-like response to increasing label noise, revealing a critical point beyond which the model's performance changes qualitatively. We further establish and investigate the field of quantum machine unlearning, the process of efficiently forcing a trained model to forget corrupting influences. We show that the brittle nature of the classical model forms rigid, stubborn memories of erroneous data, making efficient unlearning challenging, while the quantum model is significantly more amenable to efficient forgetting with approximate unlearning methods. Our findings establish that quantum machine learning can possess a dual advantage of intrinsic resilience and efficient adaptability, providing a promising paradigm for the trustworthy and robust artificial intelligence of the future.</description>

      <title>A kilometer photonic link connecting superconducting circuits in two dilution refrigerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are a leading platform for implementing practical quantum computation algorithms. Although superconducting quantum processors with hundreds of qubits have been demonstrated, their further scaling up is constrained by the physical size and cooling power of dilution refrigerators. This constraint can be overcome by constructing a quantum network to interconnect qubits hosted in different refrigerators, which requires microwave-to-optical transducers to enable low-loss signal transmission over long distances. Despite that various designs and demonstrations have achieved high-efficiency and low-added-noise transducers, a coherent photonic link between separate refrigerators has not yet been realized. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate coherent signal transfer between two superconducting circuits housed in separate dilution refrigerators, enabled by a pair of frequency-matched aluminum nitride electro-optic transducers connected via a 1-km telecom optical fiber. With transducers at each node achieving &gt;0.1% efficiency, an overall 80 dB improvement in transduction efficiency over commercial electro-optic modulators is attainable, paving the way towards a fully quantum-enabled link. This work provides critical design guidelines towards scalable superconducting quantum networks interconnected by photonic links.</description>

      <title>Quantum Convolutional Neural Network with Nonlinear Effects and Barren Plateau Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) leverage quantum entanglement and superposition to enable large-scale parallel linear computation, offering a potential solution to the scalability limits of classical deep learning. However, their practical deployment is hampered by two key challenges: the lack of intrinsic nonlinear operations and the barren plateau phenomenon. We propose a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) architecture that simultaneously addresses both issues. Nonlinear effects are introduced via orthonormal basis expansions of power series, while barren plateaus are mitigated by directly parameterizing unitary matrices rather than stacking multiple parameterized gates. Our design further incorporates quantum analogs of convolutional kernels and strides for scalable circuit construction. Experiments on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets achieve 99.0% and 88.0% test accuracy, respectively. Consistency between PyTorch-based matrix simulation and Qiskit-based quantum circuit simulation validates the physical fidelity of the model. These results demonstrate a flexible and effective quantum architecture that faithfully integrates classical convolutional mechanisms into a quantum framework, paving the way for practical and expressive QNNs.</description>

      <title>An equivalence between time-symmetry and cyclic causality in quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between the time-symmetric nature of physical laws and the apparent directionality of causality is a central question in quantum foundations. The standard operational formulation, widely used in quantum information, imposes a definite, acyclic causal order on agents' operations, contrasting with time-symmetric dynamics. Two prominent extensions of this framework are the multi-time state (MTS) formalism, which incorporates time symmetry via arbitrary pre- and post-selection, and the post-selected closed timelike curve (P-CTC) framework, which enables cyclic causal influences through post-selection on maximally entangled states. While prior work has noted structural connections between MTS and P-CTCs, it remained unclear whether an operational equivalence exists, or whether constructive mappings can be established between their most general objects. In this work, we address this gap by extending the P-CTC framework to define time-labelled P-CTC assisted combs, a more general class of P-CTC-assisted objects that support open processing slots and explicit temporal structure. We prove that for every (possibly mixed) MTS, there exists an operationally equivalent time-labelled P-CTC-assisted comb, and vice versa. The equivalence is shown via explicit mappings, while discussing the number and dimensionality of the P-CTCs involved. We also explore a resource-theoretic view of MTS, defining a partial order under free transformations that do not use P-CTCs. We conclude by discussing future directions informed by the operational equivalence between time symmetry and cyclic causality established here.</description>

      <title>Measuring the dynamics of an XXZ quantum simulator and controlling collapse through symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically consider the quantum simulation of a spin Hamiltonian whose twelve sites are arranged in a planar configuration with high spatial symmetry, $D_{6h}$. We map the system onto an effective fermionic Hamiltonian and identify its symmetry group. Comparing different initial states evolving under the Heisenberg or XXZ Hamiltonians, we analyze the impact of symmetry on the probability distribution for the outcomes of a measurement in a given basis, as a function of the evolution time. The considered measurement basis resolves only a part of the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We show that, for suitable choices of the initial state, unresolved symmetries make some configurations equiprobable. We identify four different regimes for the time evolution of the probabilities: these may be constant, vary sinusoidally in time, evolve aperiodically, or collapse. We propose an experimentally accessible scheme which exploits quantum parallelism to probe these regimes efficiently.</description>

      <title>Co-designed reflective and leaky-waveguide low-pass filter for superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stepped-impedance low-pass filter with integrated hollow waveguide absorbers is presented. The filter combines low insertion loss in the passband with strong attenuation at high frequencies, making it well suited for superconducting quantum computing applications, where qubits are sensitive to both near-band and far out-of-band radiation. The structure is implemented in a rectangular coaxial geometry, with inductive sections coupled to circular hollow waveguides oriented orthogonally to the transmission axis. Above their cutoff frequency, these waveguides efficiently couple to radiation inside the stepped-impedance filter, absorbing energy that would otherwise cause Cooper pair breaking in conventional superconductors. Optimal dimensions were obtained using a differential evolution algorithm applied to interpolated electromagnetic simulation data. A prototype was fabricated and characterized using a calibrated vector network analyzer up to 67 GHz. Measurements confirm a 3 dB cutoff frequency at 13.5 GHz, insertion loss below 0.45 dB for frequencies under 8 GHz, and more than 52.7 dB rejection above 17.3 GHz. The design offers a compact, low-loss solution for near-band filtering and suppression of quasiparticle-generating radiation in cryogenic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Forrelation is Extremally Hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Forrelation problem is a central problem that demonstrates an exponential separation between quantum and classical capabilities. In this problem, given query access to $n$-bit Boolean functions $f$ and $g$, the goal is to estimate the Forrelation function $\mathrm{forr}(f,g)$, which measures the correlation between $g$ and the Fourier transform of $f$.
  In this work we provide a new linear algebraic perspective on the Forrelation problem, as opposed to prior analytic approaches. We establish a connection between the Forrelation problem and bent Boolean functions and through this connection, analyze an extremal version of the Forrelation problem where the goal is to distinguish between extremal instances of Forrelation, namely $(f,g)$ with $\mathrm{forr}(f,g)=1$ and $\mathrm{forr}(f,g)=-1$.
  We show that this problem can be solved with one quantum query and success probability one, yet requires $\tilde{\Omega}\left(2^{n/4}\right)$ classical randomized queries, even for algorithms with a one-third failure probability, highlighting the remarkable power of one exact quantum query. We also study a restricted variant of this problem where the inputs $f,g$ are computable by small classical circuits and show classical hardness under cryptographic assumptions.</description>

      <title>Diverging conditional correlation lengths in the approach to high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Markov length was recently proposed as an information-theoretic diagnostic for quantum mixed-state phase transitions [Sang &amp; Hsieh, Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 070403 (2025)]. Here, we show that the Markov length diverges even under classical stochastic dynamics, when a low-temperature ordered state is quenched into the high temperature phase. Conventional observables do not exhibit growing length scales upon quenching into the high-temperature phase; however, the Markov length grows exponentially in time. Consequently, the state of a system as it heats becomes increasingly non-Gibbsian, and the range of its putative "parent Hamiltonian" must diverge with the Markov length. From this information-theoretic point of view the late-time limit of thermalization is singular. We introduce a numerical technique for computing the Markov length based on matrix-product states, and explore its dynamics under general thermal quenches in the one-dimensional classical Ising model. For all cases, we provide simple information-theoretic arguments that explain our results.</description>

      <title>Quantum chemistry with provable convergence via randomized sample-based quantum diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) is a recently proposed algorithm to approximate the ground-state wave function of many-body quantum systems on near-term and early-fault-tolerant quantum devices. In SQD, the quantum computer acts as a sampling engine that generates the subspace in which the Hamiltonian is classically diagonalized. A recently proposed SQD variant, Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD), uses quantum Krylov states as circuits from which samples are collected. Convergence guarantees can be derived for SKQD under similar assumptions to those of quantum phase estimation, provided that the ground-state wave function is concentrated, i.e., has support on a small subset of the full Hilbert space. Implementations of SKQD on current utility-scale quantum computers are limited by the depth of time-evolution circuits needed to generate Krylov vectors. For many complex many-body Hamiltonians of interest, such as the molecular electronic-structure Hamiltonian, this depth exceeds the capability of state-of-the-art quantum processors. In this work, we introduce a new SQD variant that combines SKQD with the qDRIFT randomized compilation of the Hamiltonian propagator. The resulting algorithm, termed SqDRIFT, enables SQD calculations at the utility scale on chemical Hamiltonians while preserving the convergence guarantees of SKQD. We apply SqDRIFT to calculate the electronic ground-state energy of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, up to system sizes beyond the reach of exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Learning Feasible Quantum States for Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing approaches excel at solving quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, however solving quadratic constrained binary optimization problems (QCBOs) is more challenging. In this work, we develop a variational approach that creates an equal superposition of quantum states that satisfy constraints in a QCBO. The method relies on flag qubits, one per constraint, to identify when a constraint is violated or not. The resulting equal superposition can be used as an initial state for quantum algorithms that solve QUBOs/QCBOs such as Grover's search algorithm or the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). We test the approach on sets of one and two linear inequality constraints and find that it is able to generate an equal superposition of feasible states with a .98 AR on average. We then use the approach to generate initial states for Grover-mixer QAOA (GM-QAOA) and find that GM-QAOA with the constraint gadgets yields significantly higher probability of measuring the optimal solution than random guessing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution to Abraham Nitzan's Festschrift, we present a perspective of theoretical research over the years that has pointed to the potential of molecular processes to act as quantum information resources. Under appropriate control, homonuclear dimer (diatom) dissociation (half-collision) and the inverse process of atom-pair collisions are shown to reveal translational (EPR-like) entanglement that enables molecular wavepacket teleportation. When such processes involve electronic-state excitation of the diatom, the fluorescence following dissociation can serve as an entanglement witness that unravels the molecular-state characteristics and evolution. Such entangling processes can also exhibit anomalous quantum thermodynamic features, particularly temperature enhancement of a cavity field that interacts with dissociated entangled diatoms.</description>

      <title>Work extraction from long-lived quantum coherence of a three-level system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze work extraction protocols using the long-lived quantum coherence of a three-level quantum system, which is coupled to a thermal bath through dipole-monopole interactions. We identify situations where persistent quantum coherence arises, i.e., for systems with degenerate excited states with aligned transition dipoles or nearly degenerate systems with small energy splittings. By designing two innovative thermodynamic protocols involving energy-preserving unitary operations, we show that quantum coherence can be transformed into population asymmetry, serving as a quantum resource for work extraction. As the system approaches final thermal equilibrium, the initial quantum coherence effectively acts as fuel, being progressively consumed. Specifically, we propose an optimized protocol capable of extracting the maximal extractable work (MEW), measured by the free energy difference (FED), from quantum coherence in a single-shot thermodynamic cycle. Our results highlight the thermodynamic advantages of long-lived coherence in a three-level quantum system and could influence future designs of coherence-driven quantum thermal machines.</description>

      <title>Anticipating Decoherence: a Predictive Framework for Enhancing Coherence in Quantum Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale quantum systems require optical coherence between distant quantum devices, necessitating spectral indistinguishability. Scalable solid-state platforms offer promising routes to this goal. However, environmental disorders, including dephasing, spectral diffusion, and spin-bath interactions, influence the emitters' spectra and deteriorate the coherence. Using statistical theory, we identify correlations in spectral diffusion from slowly varying environmental coupling, revealing predictable dynamics extendable to other disorders. Importantly, this could enable the development of an anticipatory framework for forecasting and decoherence engineering in remote quantum emitters. To validate this framework, we demonstrate that a machine learning model trained on limited data can accurately forecast unseen spectral behavior. Realization of such a model on distinct quantum emitters could reduce the spectral shift by factors $\approx$ 2.1 to 15.8, depending on emitter stability, compared to no prediction. This work presents, for the first time, the application of anticipatory systems and replica theory to quantum technology, along with the first experimental demonstration of internal prediction that generalizes across multiple quantum emitters. These results pave the way for real-time decoherence engineering in scalable quantum systems. Such capability could lead to enhanced optical coherence and multi-emitter synchronization, with broad implications for quantum communication, computation, imaging, and sensing.</description>

      <title>atommovr: An open-source simulation framework for rearrangement in atomic arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of atom rearrangement has emerged in the last decade as a fundamental building block for the development of neutral atom-based quantum processors. However, despite many recent efforts to develop algorithms with favorable asymptotic scaling, no time-optimal algorithm has been developed for any rearrangement task. Moreover, no open-source code exists to reproduce or benchmark existing algorithms, and to assist the development of new rearrangement protocols. To address this deficiency, we develop an open-source simulation framework for developing, comparing, and benchmarking algorithms under realistic and customizable noise models. Using this framework, we \textbf{a)} numerically extract lower bounds for the scaling of a time-optimal rearrangement algorithm and compare it to existing heuristic algorithms \textbf{b)} develop a naive dual-species algorithm able to prepare arbitrary targets with near-unity success rate. With this framework, we hope to develop a common tool for the community to study rearrangement, lower the barrier to entry for new experimental groups, and stimulate progress in developing algorithms which approach time-optimal scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00840v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a theoretical approach to enhance RSA's resistance against quantum attacks by optimizing prime selection through R\'enyi entropy constraints. We develop a framework where primes are generated with controlled proximity ($|p-q| &lt; \gamma\sqrt{pq}$) to minimize the collision entropy $\mathscr{H}_2$ of the quantum period-finding operator.
  The main contributions include: (1) establishing a connection between prime distribution properties and quantum attack complexity via Maynard's prime gap theorem, (2) providing a constructive proof for prime existence under entropy constraints, and (3) demonstrating security reduction to ideal lattice problems under the quantum random oracle model.
  Theoretical analysis suggests that for $k$-bit moduli with $\gamma &lt; k^{-1/2+\epsilon}$, Shor's algorithm requires $\Omega(\gamma^{-1}k^{3/2})$ quantum operations while maintaining classical security equivalent to standard RSA. Key Enhancements: (1) Prime existence proof via Maynard's theorem (Theorem 3.1), (2) Ideal lattice embedding for SVP reduction (Theorem 5.3), (3) Quantum Fano bound for information-theoretic analysis (Theorem 6.3), (4) Multi-prime RSA extension (Section 7.3).</description>

      <title>Prime Factorization Equation from a Tensor Network Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an exact and explicit equation for prime factorization, along with an algorithm for its computation. The proposed method is based on the MeLoCoToN approach, which addresses combinatorial optimization problems through classical tensor networks. The presented tensor network performs the multiplication of every pair of possible input numbers and selects those whose product is the number to be factorized. Additionally, in order to make the algorithm more efficient, the number and dimension of the tensors and their contraction scheme are optimized. Finally, a series of tests on the algorithm are conducted, contracting the tensor network both exactly and approximately using tensor train compression, and evaluating its performance.</description>

      <title>Impact of quantum coherence on the dynamics and thermodynamics of quenched free fermions coupled to a localized defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium quantum dynamics and thermodynamics of free fermions suddenly coupled to a localized defect in a one-dimensional harmonic trap. This setup realizes a quantum quench transformation that gives rise to the orthogonalization of the system's wave-function as an effect of the localized perturbation. Using the Loschmidt echo and the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution of the work done by the defect, we quantify the extent and rate of the orthogonalization dynamics. In particular, we show that initializing the system in a coherent superpositions of energy eigenstates leads to non-classical features, such as Wigner function's negativity and non-positivity of the work KDQ distribution. Starting from simple single-particle superpositions and then progressing with coherent and cat states of few-body fermionic systems, we uncover how quantum coherence and few-body correlations shape the out-of-equilibrium response due to the presence of the defect.</description>

      <title>Parametric pair production of collective excitations in a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By exciting the transverse breathing mode of an elongated Bose-Einstein condensate, we parametrically produce longitudinal collective excitations in a pairwise manner. This process also referred to as Faraday wave generation, can be seen as an analog to cosmological particle production. Building upon single particle detection, we investigate the early time dynamics of the exponential growth and compare our observation with a Bogoliubov description. The growth rate we observe experimentally is in very good agreement with theoretical predictions, demonstrating the validity of the Bogoliubov description and thereby confirming the smallness of quasiparticle interactions in such an elongated gas. We also discuss the presence of oscillations in the atom number, which are due to pair correlations and to the rate at which interactions are switched off.</description>

      <title>Bose-Hubbard model in the canonical ensemble: a beyond mean-field approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms in optical lattices are versatile testbeds to study and manipulate equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium aspects of quantum many-body systems whose behavior can be described by Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. In this paper, we consider an ansatz wave-function which respects total particle-number conservation for such systems and goes beyond mean-field theory; this wave-function has the same complexity in the number of parameters as the mean-field Gutzwiller ansatz, and captures quantum correlations and entanglement via projection onto an effective low-energy manifold. This ansatz can be exploited to study quantum phases observed in a large class of systems realizable in such experimental platforms and is useful to study quantum dynamics. We show that the relaxation dynamics of various out-of-equilibrium initial states under sudden quench of Hamiltonian parameters can be studied with this ansatz wavefunction within the framework of time-dependent variational principle. We present a quantitative comparison with small-scale exact diagonalization results in the 1D Bose-Hubbard model with and without external trapping potentials.</description>

      <title>Exact diagonalization study of energy level statistics in harmonically confined interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact diagonalization study of the spectral properties of bosons harmonically confined in a quasi-2D plane and interacting via repulsive Gaussian potential. We consider the lowest $100$ energy levels for systems of $N=12, 16$ and $20$ bosons both for the moderate and strong interaction regimes for the non-rotating ($L_{z}=0$) and the rotating single-vortex state ($L_{z}=N$). For higher angular momenta, $L_{z}=2N$ and $L_{z}=3N$, only the strong interaction regime is considered. While the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution (NNSD) $P(s)$ and the ratios of consecutive level spacings distribution $P(r)$ are used to study the short-range correlations, the Dyson-Mehta $\Delta_3$ statistic and the level number variance $\Sigma^2(L)$ are used to examine the long-range correlations. In the moderate interaction regime when the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy, the non-rotating system exhibits a Poisson distribution, characteristic of the regular energy spectra. In the strong interaction regime when the interaction energy is comparable to the trap energy, the non-rotating system exhibits chaotic behavior signified by GOE distribution. Furthermore, in the rotating case for the single-vortex state ($L_{z} = N$) in the moderate interaction regime, the system exhibits signatures of weak chaos with some degree of regularity in the energy-level spectra. However, in the strong interaction regime for the rotating case with $L_{z} = N$, $2N$ and $3N$, the system exhibits strong chaotic behavior. The rotation is found to contribute to an enhancement of chaotic behavior in the system for both the moderate and the strong interaction regimes. Our results of NNSD analysis are supported by the analysis of the ratios of consecutive level spacings distribution $P(r)$.</description>

      <title>Floquet theory and applications in open quantum and classical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article reviews theoretical methods for analyzing Floquet engineering (FE) phenomena in open (dissipative) quantum or classical systems, with an emphasis on our recent results. In many theoretical studies for FE in quantum systems, researchers have used the Floquet theory for closed (isolated) quantum systems, that is based on the Schr\"odinger equation. However, if we consider the FE in materials driven by an oscillating field like a laser, a weak but finite interaction between a target system and an environment (bath) is inevitable. In this article, we describe these periodically driven dissipative systems by means of the quantum master (GKSL) equation. In particular, we show that a nonequilibrium steady state appears after a long driving due to the balance between the energy injection by the driving field and the release to the bath. In addition to quantum systems, if we try to simply apply Floquet theory to periodically driven classical systems, it failed because the equation of motion (EOM) is generally nonlinear, and the Floquet theorem can be applied only to linear differential equations. Instead, by considering the distribution function of the classical variables (i.e., Fokker-Planck equation), one can arrive at the effective EOM for the driven systems. We illustrate the essence of the Floquet theory for classical systems. On top of fundamentals of the Floquet theory, we review representative examples of FEs (Floquet topological insulators, inverse Faraday effects in metals and magnets, Kapitza pendulum, etc.) and dissipation-assisted FEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of robust quantum storage devices relies on the ability to generate long-lived, spatially localized quantum states. In this work, we introduce a method for the targeted creation of compact excitations in flat-band lattices. By injecting in-plane radiation waves from the system's edge and applying a localized on-site potential at the desired storage position, we induce hybridization between compact localized states (CLSs) of the flat-band and resonant dispersive plane waves. This hybridization enables the formation of spatially compact, stable excitations suitable for quantum memory applications. We experimentally validate this mechanism using photonic waveguide arrays, focusing on two representative geometries: the diamond chain and the one-dimensional Lieb ladder. Our approach is broadly applicable to any platform supporting flat-band physics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a brief review and introduction to Quadratic Unconstrained D-ary Optimization (QUDO), Tensor Quadratic Unconstrained D-ary Optimization (T-QUDO) and Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HOBO) formulations for combinatorial optimization problems. We also show their equivalences. To help their understanding, we make some examples for the knapsack problem, traveling salesman problem and different combinatorial games. The games chosen to exemplify are: Hashiwokakero, N-Queens, Kakuro, Inshi no heya, and Peg Solitaire. Although some of these games have already been formulated in a QUBO formulation, we are going to approach them with more general formulations, allowing their execution in new quantum or quantum-inspired optimization algorithms. This can be an easier way to introduce these more complicated formulations for harder problems.</description>

      <title>Path-Integral Formulation of Bosonic Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics with Monte Carlo stochastic trajectories using the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q Functions and Hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Monte Carlo (MC) trajectory sampling of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) based on the quasiprobabilities, such as the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q functions, enables us to investigate bosonic open quantum many-body dynamics described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation. In this method, the MC samplings for the initial distribution and stochastic noises incorporate quantum fluctuations, and thus, we can go beyond the mean-field approximation. However, description using SDEs is possible only when the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation has a positive-semidefinite diffusion matrix. In this work, we analytically derive the SDEs for arbitrary Hamiltonian and jump operators based on the path-integral formula, independently of the derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). In the course of the derivation, we formulate the path-integral representation of the GKSL equation by using the $s$-ordered quasiprobability, which systematically describes the aforementioned quasiprobabilities by changing the real parameter $s$. The essential point of this derivation is that we employ the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation in the path integral, and its application is not always feasible. We find that the feasible condition of the HS transformation is identical to the positive-semidefiniteness condition of the diffusion matrix in the FPE. In the benchmark calculations, we confirm that the MC simulations of the obtained SDEs well reproduce the exact dynamics of physical quantities and non-equal time correlation functions of numerically solvable models, including the Bose-Hubbard model. This work clarifies the applicability of the approximation and gives systematic and simplified procedures to obtain the SDEs to be numerically solved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the problem of observables is fully resolved for background independent theories defined on finite graphs. We argue the correct analogue of coordinate independence is the invariance under changes of graph labels, a kind of permutation invariance. Invariants are formed by a group average that probes the entire graph -- they are global. Strikingly, sets of complete observables can be constructed so that each seeks a connected subgraph structure -- local correlations. Geometrical information is fully encoded in background independent observables through this subtle interplay of global and local graph notions, a behavior we term glocal. This provides physically meaningful complete sets of observables for discrete general relativity, suggests a reformulation of the spin networks state space of loop quantum gravity, and reveals deep connections between the problem of observables and the graph isomorphism problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring entanglement entropy in interacting, multipartite systems remains a significant experimental challenge. We address this challenge by developing a protocol to measure von Neumann entropy (VNE) and mutual information in quantum transport systems with both many-body interactions and multiple subsystems. Our analysis indicates that the vital connection between VNE and two-point correlation functions persists under these realistic conditions. The measurement is shown to be feasible for systems with boundary interactions and, critically, for bulk-interacting systems subject to a quantum quench of their internal couplings. Our work provides a pathway to experimentally quantify entanglement in complex interacting systems and establishes mutual information as an experimentally accessible indicator for system-environment entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an all-optical Moir\'e-like exciton confinement by means of spatially periodic optical cavities. Such periodic photonic structures can control the material properties by coupling the matter excitations to the confined photons and their quantum fluctuations. We develop a low energy non-perturbative quantum electro-dynamical description of strongly coupled excitons and photons at finite momentum transfer. We find that in the classical limit of a laser driven cavity the induced optical confinement directly emulates Moir\'e physics. In a dark cavity instead, the sole presence of quantum fluctuations of light generates a sizable renormalization of the excitonic bands and effective mass. We attribute these effects to long-range cavity-mediated exciton-exciton interactions which can only be captured in a non-perturbative treatment. With these findings we propose spatially structured cavities as a promising avenue for cavity material engineering.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermalization in a dimerized J1-J2 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the J1-J2 frustrated Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain with dimerization ({\delta}) or modulation in the nearest-neighbor couplings to investigate its thermalization behavior. While the dimerization tends to induce localization, the next-nearest-neighbor interaction J2 generally favors thermalization, making the assessment of the model's compliance with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) particularly subtle. The challenge is further compounded by the model's SU(2) symmetry; the study of ETH compliance is necessarily done for each symmetry sector but separating different sectors of this symmetry is known to be a computationally demanding task. The current study is driven by two main motivations: first, to explore whether the well-known ground-state phases of the model have any bearing on its thermalization properties; and second, to understand how the interplay between two competing factors, namely, the non-uniformity (via {\delta}) and the beyond-nearest-neighbor interactions (via J2) governs the system's approach to thermal equilibrium. A systematic analysis shows that the ETH is most strongly satisfied for intermediate values of {\delta} (~ 0.5) with J2 ranging from intermediate (~ 0.5) to large (~ 1)- a parameter regime falls within the spiral ground-state phase. It is also found that when the system is in the gapless ground-state phase (which falls within the N'eel phase), the ETH is more prone to violation. In the regime of large {\delta} and small J2, the system is seen to enter a localized phase (characterized here by modulation in density-of-states; assessing ETH compliance is less meaningful for this phase.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cluster State Spin Chain with Ising Fusion Category Symmetry: A Perspective from Weak Hopf SymTFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a construction of a cluster state lattice Hamiltonian that exhibits the symmetry of the Ising fusion algebra. This construction is formulated within the framework of weak Hopf symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), where we assign smooth and rough boundaries to the weak Hopf quantum double model, thereby extending the conventional cluster state model. Central to our construction is the weak Hopf Ising boundary tube algebra $\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}$, whose representation category is equivalent to the Ising fusion category $\mathsf{Ising}$. We take this algebra as the input data for the weak Hopf quantum double model. The resulting model exhibits Ising fusion symmetry on both open and closed $1\text{d}$ manifolds. On open manifolds, the symmetry is governed by $\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}} \otimes \mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee}$; on closed manifolds, it reduces to $\operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}) \otimes \operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee})$. Since the Ising fusion algebra embeds into $\operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee})$, the model faithfully realizes the symmetry of the Ising fusion category.</description>

      <title>The analytically tractable zoo of similarity-induced exceptional structures</title>

Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies marking a simultaneous coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Despite the fact that multiband $n$-fold EPs (EP$n$s) generically emerge as special points on manifolds of EP$m$s, where $m&lt;n$, EP$n$s as well as their topological properties have hitherto been studied as isolated objects. In this work we address this issue and carefully map out the emerging properties of multifold exceptional structures in three and four dimensions under the influence of one or multiple generalized similarities, revealing diverse combinations of EP$m$s in direct connection to EP$n$s. We find that simply counting the number of constraints defining the EP$n$s is not sufficient in the presence of similarities; the constraints can also be satisfied by the EP$m$-manifolds obeying certain spectral symmetries in the complex eigenvalue plane, reducing their dimension beyond what is expected from counting the number of constraints. Furthermore, the induced spectral symmetries not always allow for any EP$m$-manifold to emerge in $n$-band systems, making the plethora of exceptional structures deviate further from naive expectations. We illustrate our findings in simple periodic toy models. By relying on similarity relations instead of the less general symmetries, we simultaneously cover several physically relevant scenarios, ranging from optics and topolectrical circuits, to open quantum systems. This makes our predictions highly relevant and broadly applicable in modern research, as well as experimentally viable within various branches of physics.</description>

      <title>Classification of Average Crystalline Topological Superconductors through a Generalized Real-Space Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel class of topological superconducting phases protected by exact fermion-parity symmetry and average crystalline symmetries. These phases belong to the broader class of average crystalline symmetry-protected topological (ACSPT) states and include numerous examples of intrinsic ACSPTs -- topological phases that arise only in the presence of disorder or decoherence. Unlike conventional symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, which require exact symmetry protection, average SPT (ASPT) phases remain robust as long as the symmetry is restored on average across disorder realizations or mixed-state ensembles. To classify these phases, we extend the real-space block state construction framework to account for average crystalline symmetries. In this generalized setting, lower-dimensional cells are decorated with ASPT phases, and the obstruction-free conditions are reformulated to incorporate the constraints imposed by average symmetry at block intersections. This provides a physically transparent and systematic method for classifying ASPTs with spatial symmetries that are only preserved statistically. We further validate our classification using a generalized spectral sequence analysis, which serves as an independent consistency check. Our results demonstrate that many crystalline topological superconductors remain well defined under realistic imperfections, and they uncover a rich landscape of intrinsically average-symmetry-protected phases that have no analog in clean systems.</description>

      <title>Compiling Arbitrary Single-Qubit Gates Via the Phase-Shifts of Microwave Pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.02398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an arbitrary single-qubit gate compilation scheme on superconducting processors that takes advantage of tuning the phase shift of microwave pulses to obtain a continuous gate set. This scheme is compatible with any two-qubit gate, and we only need to calibrate the $X_\pi$ and $X_{\pi/2}$ pulses. We implement this on fluxonium and obtain state-of-the-art fidelities. We give two other schemes: the first requires one $X_\pi$ pulse and one pulse with a variable rotation angle, and the second requires four $X_{\pi/2}$ pulses. We also find that if we can do virtual $Z$ gates, then we can also do virtual gates around any axis. Our results apply to any physical platform that natively supports virtual $Z$.</description>

Abstract: Atoms falling into a black hole (BH) through a cavity are shown to enable coherent amplification of light quanta powered by the BH gravitational vacuum energy. This process can harness the BH energy towards useful purposes, such as propelling a spaceship trapped by the BH. The process can occur via transient amplification of a signal field by falling atoms that are partly excited by Hawking radiation reflected by an orbiting mirror. In the steady-state regime of thermally equilibrated atoms that weakly couple to the field, this amplifier constitutes a BH-powered quantum heat engine. The envisaged effects substantiate the thermodynamic approach to BH acceleration radiation.</description>

      <title>Pilot-reference-free continuous-variable quantum key distribution with efficient decoy-state analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV QKD) using optical coherent detectors is practically favorable due to its low implementation cost, flexibility of wavelength division multiplexing, and compatibility with standard coherent communication technologies. However, the security analysis and parameter estimation of CV QKD are complicated due to the infinite-dimensional latent Hilbert space. Also, the transmission of strong reference pulses undermines the security and complicates the experiments. In this work, we tackle these two problems by presenting a time-bin-encoding CV protocol with a simple phase-error-based security analysis valid under general coherent attacks. With the key encoded into the relative intensity between two optical modes, the need for global references is removed. Furthermore, phase randomization can be introduced to decouple the security analysis of different photon-number components. We can hence tag the photon number for each round, effectively estimate the associated privacy using a carefully designed coherent-detection method, and independently extract encryption keys from each component. Simulations manifest that the protocol using multi-photon components increases the key rate by two orders of magnitude compared to the one using only the single-photon component. Meanwhile, the protocol with four-intensity decoy analysis is sufficient to yield tight parameter estimation with a short-distance key-rate performance comparable to the best Bennett-Brassard-1984 implementation.</description>

Abstract: The hybrid tensor network (HTN) method is a general framework allowing for the construction of an effective wavefunction with the combination of classical tensors and quantum tensors, i.e., amplitudes of quantum states. In particular, hybrid tree tensor networks (HTTNs) are very useful for simulating larger systems beyond the available size of the quantum hardware. However, while the realistic quantum states in NISQ hardware are highly likely to be noisy, this framework is formulated for pure states. In this work, as well as discussing the relevant methods, i.e., Deep VQE and entanglement forging under the framework of HTTNs, we investigate the noisy HTN states by introducing the expansion operator for providing the description of the expansion of the size of simulated quantum systems and the noise propagation. This framework enables the general tree HTN states to be explicitly represented and their physicality to be discussed. We also show that the expectation value of a measured observable exponentially vanishes with the number of contracted quantum tensors. Our work will lead to providing the noise-resilient construction of HTN states.</description>

      <title>Optimal energy storage in the Tavis-Cummings quantum battery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tavis-Cummings (TC) model, which serves as a natural physical realization of a quantum battery, comprises $N_b$ atoms as battery cells that collectively interact with a shared photon field, functioning as the charger, initially containing $n_0$ photons. In this study, we introduce the invariant subspace method to effectively represent the quantum dynamics of the TC battery. Our findings indicate that in the limiting case of $n_0\!\gg\! N_b$ or $N_b\!\gg\! n_0$, a distinct SU(2) symmetry emerges in the dynamics, thereby ensuring the realization of optimal energy storage. We also establish a negative relationship between the battery-charger entanglement and the energy storage capacity. As a result, we demonstrate that the asymptotically optimal energy storage can be achieved in the scenario where $N_b\!=\!n_0\!\gg\! 1$. Our approach not only enhances our comprehension of the algebraic structure inherent in the TC model but also contributes to the broader theoretical framework of quantum batteries. Furthermore, it provides crucial insights into the relation between energy transfer and quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Estimating the link budget of satellite-based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for uplink transmission through the atmosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite-based quantum communications including quantum key distribution (QKD) represent one of the most promising approaches toward global-scale quantum communications. To determine the viability of transmitting quantum signals through the atmosphere, it is essential to conduct atmospheric simulations for both uplink and downlink quantum communications. In the case of the uplink scenario, the initial phase of the beam's propagation involves interaction with the atmosphere, making simulation particularly critical. To analyze the atmosphere over the Indian subcontinent, we begin by validating our approach by utilizing atmospheric data obtained from the experiments carried out in the Canary Islands within the framework of Quantum Communication (QC). We also verify our simulation methodology by reproducing simulation outcomes from diverse Canadian locations, taking into account both uplink and downlink scenarios in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). In this manuscript, we explore the practicality of utilizing three different ground station locations in India for uplink-based QC, while also considering beacon signals for both uplink and downlink scenarios. The atmospheric conditions of various geographical regions in India are simulated, and a dedicated link budget analysis is performed for each location, specifically focusing on three renowned observatories: IAO Hanle, Aries Nainital, and Mount Abu. The analysis involves computing the overall losses of the signal and beacon beams. The findings indicate that the IAO Hanle site is a more suitable choice for uplink-based QC when compared to the other two sites.</description>

Abstract: Device imperfections and memory effects can result in undesired correlations among the states generated by a realistic quantum source. These correlations are called source correlations. Proving the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols in the presence of these correlations has been a persistent challenge. We present a simple and general method to reduce the security proof of the BB84 protocol with source correlations to one with an almost perfect source, for which security can be proven using previously known techniques. For this purpose, we introduce a simple source test, which randomly tests the output of the QKD source and provides a bound on the source correlations. We then use the recently proven entropic triangle inequality for the smooth min-entropy to carry out the reduction to the protocol with the almost perfect source.</description>

      <title>Thermal Area Law in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The area law of the bipartite information measure characterizes one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics. In thermal equilibrium, the area law for the mutual information universally holds at arbitrary temperatures as long as the systems have short-range interactions. In systems with power-law decaying interactions, $r^{-\alpha}$ ($r$: distance), conditions for the thermal area law are elusive. In this work, we aim to clarify the optimal condition $\alpha&gt; \alpha_c$ such that the thermal area law universally holds. A standard approach to considering the conditions is to focus on the magnitude of the boundary interaction between two subsystems. However, we find here that the thermal area law is more robust than this conventional argument suggests. We show the optimal threshold for the thermal area law by $\alpha_c= (D+1)/2$ ($D$: the spatial dimension of the lattice), assuming a power-law decay of the clustering for the bipartite correlations. Remarkably, this condition encompasses even the thermodynamically unstable regimes $\alpha &lt; D$. We verify this condition numerically, finding that it is qualitatively accurate for both integrable and non-integrable systems. Unconditional proof of the thermal area law is possible by developing the power-law clustering theorem for $\alpha &gt; D$ above a threshold temperature. Furthermore, the numerical calculation for the logarithmic negativity shows that the same criterion $\alpha &gt; (D+1)/2$ applies to the thermal area law for quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing chaos in a periodically driven Ising model with a ramping field via out-of-time-order correlation saturation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamic region of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) serves as a powerful indicator of chaos in classical and semiclassical systems, capturing the characteristic exponential growth. In contrast, this signature fails to appear in spin systems, where even chaotic dynamics lack such exponential escalation, making this region an unreliable marker of chaos. To address this limitation, we turn to the saturation behavior of OTOCs to differentiate between chaotic and integrable regimes. In integrable systems, the saturation region of OTOCs exhibits oscillatory behavior, while in chaotic systems, it shows a stable saturation. To evaluate this distinction, we investigate a time-dependent Ising spin system subjected to a linearly ramping transverse field, analyzing both integrable (without longitudinal field) and non-integrable (with longitudinal field) scenarios. The ramping introduces a time-dependent increase of the external field, which influences the saturation regime of the OTOC, a region crucial for characterizing the chaotic behavior of the system. To quantify the degree of chaoticity, we compute the normalized Fourier spectrum of the OTOC and observe that increasing the ramping field strength leads to a suppression of oscillation frequencies in the saturation region of the OTOC, thereby enhancing the system's chaotic behaviour. To further support our findings, we investigate the level spacing distribution of time-dependent unitary operators, which effectively distinguishes chaotic from regular regions in our system and corroborates the results obtained from the saturation behavior of the OTOC.</description>

      <title>Towards a Linear-Ramp QAOA protocol: Evidence of a scaling advantage in solving some combinatorial optimization problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), with performance governed by variational parameters $\{\gamma_i, \beta_i\}_{i=0}^{p-1}$. While most prior work has focused on classically optimizing these parameters, we demonstrate that fixed linear ramp schedules, linear ramp QAOA (LR-QAOA), can efficiently approximate optimal solutions across diverse COPs. Simulations with up to $N_q=42$ qubits and $p=400$ layers suggest that the success probability scales as $P(x^*) \approx 2^{-\eta(p) N_q + C}$, where $\eta(p)$ decreases with increasing $p$. For example, in Weighted Maxcut instances, $\eta(10) = 0.22$ improves to $\eta(100) = 0.05$. Comparisons with classical algorithms, including simulated annealing, Tabu Search, and branch-and-bound, show a scaling advantage for LR-QAOA. We show results of LR-QAOA on multiple QPUs (IonQ, Quantinuum, IBM) with up to $N_q = 109$ qubits, $p=100$, and circuits requiring 21,200 CNOT gates. Finally, we present a noise model based on two-qubit gate counts that accurately reproduces the experimental behavior of LR-QAOA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce SA-DQAS, a novel framework that enhances Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search (DQAS) by integrating a self-attention mechanism, enabling more effective quantum circuit design for variational quantum algorithms. Unlike DQAS, which treats placeholders independently, SA-DQAS captures inter-placeholder dependencies to improve architecture learning. We evaluate SA-DQAS across multiple tasks, including MaxCut, Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), quantum chemistry simulation, and error mitigation. Experimental results show that SA-DQAS outperforms baselines and prior QAS methods in most cases, producing architectures with better stability, convergence, and noise resilience. To assess scalability and hardware readiness, we further test SA-DQAS-generated circuits on IBM's quantum device using the MaxCut problem. Circuits trained on small graphs are stacked to solve larger instances without retraining, demonstrating generalization to real hardware and larger problem sizes. Our results suggest that SA-DQAS not only improves circuit quality during training but also enables practical deployment on near-term quantum devices. This research represents the first successful integration of self-attention mechanism with DQAS.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that any consistent interpretation of modern quantum mechanics is impossible, since its axiomatics is contradictory and incomplete: its provisions that the wave function in the Schr\"{o}dinger representation always describes pure states, and the wave function describing pure states imposes only statistical restrictions on the values of observables, are erroneous.</description>

      <title>Condensation of vanishing photon emission rates in random atomic clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the collective photon emission from atomic clouds both the atomic transition frequency and the decay rate are modified compared to a single isolated atom, leading to the effects of superradiance and subradiance. In this article, we analyse the properties of the Euclidean random matrix associated to the radiative dynamics of a cold atomic cloud, previously investigated in the contexts of photon localization and Dicke super- and subradiance. We present evidence of a new type of phase transition, surprisingly controlled by the cooperativeness parameter, rather than the spatial density or the diagonal disorder. The numerical results corroborate the occurrence of such a phase transition at a critical value of the cooperativeness parameter, above which the lower edge of the spectrum vanishes exhibiting a macroscopic accumulation of eigenvalues. Independent evaluations based on the two phenomena provide the same value of the critical cooperativeness parameter.</description>

      <title>Information Scrambling in Bosonic Gaussian Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of information scrambling in bosonic systems undergoing Gaussian unitary evolution associated with quadratic Hamiltonians. For initial Gaussian states, we observe the disappearance of the memory effect in the entanglement dynamics of disjoint blocks under Gaussian random local dynamics. In addition, we show that randomness in the Hamiltonian causes the tripartite mutual information to saturate at relatively large negative values. Therefore, despite being integrable, these systems exhibit information-scrambling diagnostics that mirror those observed in chaotic systems. We note, however, that random quadratic Hamiltonians can have a component exhibiting Wigner-Dyson energy-level statistics; for non-Gaussian states within the corresponding subspace, these systems can display chaotic behavior. Our results provide insight into the Gaussian dynamics of continuous-variable systems, which are useful and available resources for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Relational Dynamics with Periodic Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a systematic way in which a relational dynamics can be established relative to periodic clocks both in the classical and quantum theories, emphasising the parallels between them. We show that: (1) classical and quantum relational observables that encode the value of a quantity relative to a periodic clock are only invariant along the gauge orbits generated by the Hamiltonian constraint if the quantity itself is periodic, and otherwise the observables are only transiently invariant per clock cycle (this implies, in particular, that counting winding numbers does not lead to invariant observables relative to the periodic clock); (2) the quantum relational observables can be obtained from a partial group averaging procedure over a single clock cycle; (3) there is an equivalence ('trinity') between the quantum theories based on the quantum relational observables of the clock-neutral picture of Dirac quantisation, the relational Schr\"odinger picture of the Page-Wootters formalism, and the relational Heisenberg picture that follows from quantum deparametrisation, all three taken relative to periodic clocks (implying that the dynamics in all three is necessarily periodic); (4) in the context of periodic clocks, the original Page-Wootters definition of conditional probabilities fails for systems that have a continuous energy spectrum and, using the equivalence between the Page-Wootters and the clock-neutral, gauge-invariant formalism, must be suitably updated. Finally, we show how a system evolving periodically with respect to a periodic clock can evolve monotonically with respect to an aperiodic clock, without inconsistency. The presentation is illustrated by several examples, and we conclude with a brief comparison to other approaches in the literature that also deal with relational descriptions of periodic clocks.</description>

      <title>Optimizing a parameterized controlled gate using Free Quaternion Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In variational quantum algorithms, parameterization is typically applied to single-qubit gates.In this study, we instead parameterize a generalized controlled gate and propose an algorithm to locally minimize the cost function by maximally optimizing these parameters. This method extends the Free Quaternion Selection (FQS) technique, which was originally developed for single-qubit gate optimization. To evaluate its performance, we apply the proposed method to a variety of quantum optimization tasks, including the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for both Ising and molecular Hamiltonians, fidelity maximization in general variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), and unitary compilation of time evolution operators. Across these applications, our method demonstrates efficient optimization, enhanced expressibility, and the ability to construct shallower circuits compared to existing techniques. Moreover, the method can be generalized to optimize particle-number-conserving gates, which are particularly relevant for quantum chemistry. Leveraging this capability, we further demonstrate that the method achieves superior quantum compilation of molecular time-evolution operators by approximating them with shallower circuits than standard Trotter decomposition.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic Route to Entanglement Steering and Dynamical Freezing in the Floquet Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is crucial for developing quantum technologies. This work demonstrates that counter-diabatic (CD) driving provides a powerful tool for steering collective spin systems along entangled trajectories for a long time. In particular, CD driving leads to approximate stroboscopic freezing and eternal entanglement oscillations for a large class of initial states in the periodically driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Intriguingly, CD driving generates spin squeezing and its associated metrologically useful multipartite entanglement at the mid-point of every drive cycle, when the system is initially prepared in a fully x-polarized state. The CD driving induced non-ergodic dynamics is accompanied by a decrease in the average eigenstate entanglement and inverse participation ratio, thereby signalling greater eigenstate localization. Our work opens a new route to evade Floquet heating and control entanglement generation in collective spin systems.</description>

Abstract: The model of multi-level open quantum system interacting with a non-vacuum reservoir in the rotating wave approximation is considered. We provide an exact integral representation for the reduced density matrix of the system. For identical uncorrelated reservoirs in diagonal states, we have obtained the first perturbative correction for such dynamics in the Bogolubov-van Hove limit. We have shown that after initial state renormalization, it can be completely described in terms of finite-dimensional semigroup. The method we provide can also be applied to the further orders of perturbation theory with Bogolubov-van Hove scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization is a promising area for achieving quantum speedup. Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is designed to search for low-energy states of the Ising model, which correspond to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). However, effectively dealing with constraints of COPs remains a significant challenge. Existing methods, such as tailoring mixing operators, are typically limited to specific constraint types, like one-hot constraints. To address these limitations, we introduce a method for engineering a compressed space that represents the feasible solution space with fewer qubits than the original. Our approach includes a scalable technique for determining the unitary transformation between the compressed and original spaces on gate-based quantum computers. We then propose compressed space QAOA, which seeks near-optimal solutions within this reduced space, while utilizing the Ising model formulated in the original Hilbert space. Experimental results on a quantum simulator demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in solving various constrained COPs.</description>

Abstract: In this article, the weakest possible theorem providing a foundation for the Hilbert space formalism of quantum theory is stated. The necessary postulates are formulated, and the mathematics is spelt out in detail. It is argued that, from this approach, a general epistemic interpretation of quantum mechanics is natural. Some applications to the Bell experiment and to decision theory are briefly discussed. The article represents the conclusion of a series of articles and books on quantum foundations.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Feasible Contextuality-based Randomness Generation</title>

Abstract: Semi-device-independent (SDI) randomness generation protocols based on Kochen-Specker contextuality offer the attractive features of compact devices, high rates, and ease of experimental implementation over fully device-independent (DI) protocols. Here, we investigate this paradigm and derive four results to improve the state-of-art. Firstly, we introduce a family of simple, experimentally feasible orthogonality graphs (measurement compatibility structures) for which the maximum violation of the corresponding non-contextuality inequalities allows to certify the maximum amount of $\log_2 d$ bits of randomness from a qu$d$it system with projective measurements for $d \geq 3$. We analytically derive the Lov\'asz theta and fractional packing number for this graph family, and thereby prove their utility for optimal randomness generation in both randomness expansion and amplification tasks. Secondly, a central additional assumption in contextuality-based protocols over fully DI ones, is that the measurements are repeatable and satisfy an intended compatibility structure. We frame a relaxation of this condition in terms of $\epsilon$-orthogonality graphs for a parameter $\epsilon &gt; 0$, and derive quantum correlations that allow to certify randomness for arbitrary relaxation $\epsilon \in [0,1)$. Thirdly, it is well known that a single qubit is non-contextual, i.e., the qubit correlations can be explained by a non-contextual hidden variable (NCHV) model. We show however that a single qubit is \textit{almost} contextual, in that there exist qubit correlations that cannot be explained by $\epsilon$-faithful NCHV models for small $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Finally, we point out possible attacks by quantum and general consistent (non-signalling) adversaries for certain classes of contextuality tests over and above those considered in DI scenarios.</description>

      <title>Security Analysis of Ensemble-Based Quantum Token Protocol Under Advanced Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and characterize advanced attacks on an ensemble-based quantum token protocol that allows for implementing non-clonable quantum coins. Multiple differently initialized tokens of identically prepared qubit ensembles are combined to a quantum coin that can be issued by a bank. A sophisticated attempt to copy tokens can assume that measurements on sub-ensembles can be carried through and that even individual qubits can be measured. Even though such an advanced attack might be perceived as technically unfeasible, we prove the security of the protocol under these conditions. We performed numerical simulations and verified our results by experiments on the IBM Quantum Platforms for different types of advanced attacks. Finally, we demonstrate that the security of the quantum coin can be made high by increasing the number of tokens. This paper in conjunction with provided numerical simulation tools verified against experimental data from the IBM Quantum Platforms allows for securely implementing our ensemble-based quantum token protocol with arbitrary quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding low-energy excitations in fermionic systems is crucial for their characterization. They determine the response of the system to external weak perturbations, its dynamical correlation functions, and provide mechanisms for the emergence of exotic phases of matter. In this work, we study the spin excitation spectra of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model using a digital quantum processor. Introducing a protocol that is naturally suited for simulation on quantum computers, we recover the retarded spin Green's function from the time evolution of simple observables after a specific quantum quench. We exploit the robustness of the protocol to perturbations of the initial state to minimize the quantum resources required for the initial state preparation, and to allocate the majority of them to a Trotterized time-dynamics simulation. This, combined with the intrinsic resilience to noise of the protocol, allows us to accurately reconstruct the spin excitation spectrum for large instances of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model without making use of expensive error mitigation techniques, using up to 30 qubits of an IBM Heron r2 device.</description>

      <title>Dynamics in an emergent quantum-like state space generated by a nonlinear classical network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07500v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work exploits a framework whereby a graph (in the mathematical sense) serves to connect a classical system to a state space that we call `quantum-like' (QL). The QL states comprise arbitrary superpositions of states in a tensor product basis. The graph plays a special dual role by directing design of the classical system and defining the state space. We study a specific example of a large, dynamical classical system -- a system of coupled phase oscillators -- that maps, via a graph, to the QL state space. We investigate how mixedness of the state diminishes or increases as the underlying classical system synchronizes or de-synchronizes respectively. This shows the interplay between the nonlinear dynamics of the variables of the classical system and the QL state space. We prove that maps from one time point to another in the state space are linear maps. In the limit of a strongly phase-locked classical network -- that is, where couplings between phase oscillators are very large -- the state space evolves according to unitary dynamics, whereas in the cases of weaker synchronization, the classical variables act as a hidden environment that promotes decoherence of superpositions. We examine how similar the properties of QL states are to quantum states. We find that during decoherence of the QL states, the off-diagonal density matrix elements decay and that this decay can be observed in any basis we choose for measurement. More surprisingly, we show that a no-cloning theorem (that is, a state of a QL bit cannot be copied) applies not only to the QL states, but also to the underlying classical system.</description>

Abstract: Distinguishing resource states from resource-free states is a fundamental task in quantum information. We have approached the state detection problem through a hypothesis testing framework, with the alternative hypothesis set comprising resource-free states in a general context. Consequently, we derived the optimal exponential decay rate of the failure probability for detecting a given $n$-tensor product state when the resource-free states are separable states, positive partial transpose (PPT) states, or the convex hull of the set of stabilizer states. This optimal exponential decay rate is determined by the minimum of the reverse relative entropy, indicating that this minimum value serves as the general detectability measure. The key technique of this paper is a quantum version of empirical distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future quantum networks will enable the interconnection of multiple users distributed across vast geographic distances. Due to these large separations and limited physical resources, communication will often rely on multi-path routing strategies, where physical resources are distributed across channels of varying lengths and delivered to end users. Efficient long-distance quantum communication therefore requires optimizing the allocation of these resources across available paths. In this work, we introduce a performance-oriented approach to quantum network routing by extending the classical concept of Quality of Service (QoS) to the context of multi-path quantum resources distribution. Unlike prior models that consider entanglement generation or quantum memory coherence in isolation, we investigate the interplay between path assignment strategies, coherence time constraints, and quantum error correction (QEC), and how they jointly impact end-to-end communication fidelity. We analyze both unencoded and encoded transmissions over aggregated network paths, quantifying the effects of resource allocation on transmission success. Our findings show that fidelity cannot be optimized independently of memory lifetimes, and that while QEC can enhance performance under specific conditions, it also imposes additional constraints depending on network topology and path-length asymmetries. This work provides a foundation for developing QoS-aware quantum routing protocols that balance fidelity, throughput, and memory utilization -- key considerations for near-term quantum repeater networks.</description>

Abstract: Consider a fixed universe of $N=2^n$ elements and the uniform distribution over elements of some subset of size $K$. Given samples from this distribution, the task of complement sampling is to provide a sample from the complementary subset. We give a simple quantum algorithm that uses only a single quantum sample -- a single copy of the uniform superposition over elements of the subset. When $K=N/2$, we show that the quantum algorithm succeeds with probability $1$, whereas classically $\Theta(N)$ samples are required to succeed with bounded probability of error. This shows that in a sample-to-sample setting, quantum computation can achieve the largest possible separation over classical computation. Moreover, we show that the same bound can be lifted to prove average-case hardness. It follows that under the assumption of the existence of one-way functions, complement sampling gives provable, verifiable and NISQable quantum advantage in a sample complexity setting.</description>

      <title>On the role of symmetry and geometry in global quantum sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global quantum sensing enables parameter estimation across arbitrary ranges with a finite number of measurements. Among the various existing formulations, the Bayesian paradigm stands as a flexible approach for optimal protocol design under minimal assumptions. Within this paradigm, however, there are two fundamentally different ways to capture prior ignorance and uninformed estimation; namely, requiring invariance of the prior distribution under specific parameter transformations, or adhering to the geometry of a state space. In this paper we carefully examine the practical consequences of both the invariance-based and the geometry-based approaches, and show how to apply them in relevant examples of rate and coherence estimation in noisy settings. We find that, while the invariance-based approach often leads to simpler priors and estimators and is more broadly applicable in adaptive scenarios, the geometry-based one can lead to faster posterior convergence in a well-defined measurement setting. Crucially, by employing the notion of location-isomorphic parameters, we are able to unify the two formulations into a single practical and versatile framework for optimal global quantum sensing, detailing when and how each set of assumptions should be employed to tackle any given estimation task. We thus provide a blueprint for the design of novel high-precision quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>A Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem for Bistochastic Ergodic Quantum Processes with Applications to Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a multiplicative ergodic theorem for bistochastic completely positive (bcp) linear cocycles acting on finite-dimensional matrix algebras, giving an invariant splitting described explicitly in terms of the multiplicative domains of the underlying bcp maps. As an application of our theorem, we classify when compositions of random bcp maps are asymptotically entanglement breaking, and use this classification to show that occasionally PPT bcp maps are asymptotically entanglement breaking. We conclude by demonstrating a certain class of bcp linear cocycles are almost surely entanglement breaking in finite time.</description>

      <title>A perturbation theory for multi-time correlation functions in open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical maps are the principal subject of the open system theory. Formally, the dynamical map of a given open quantum system is a density matrix transformation that takes any initial state and sends it to the state at a later time. Physically, it encapsulates the system's evolution due to coupling with its environment. Hence, the theory provides a flexible and accurate framework for computing expectation values of open system observables. However, expectation values -- or more generally, single-time correlation functions -- capture only the simplest aspects of a quantum system's dynamics. A complete characterization of the dynamics requires access to multi-time correlation functions as well: phenomena like detailed balance, linear and non-linear response, non-equilibrium transport in general, or even sequential measurements of system observables are all described in terms of multi-time correlations. For closed systems, such correlations are well-defined, even though knowledge of the system's state alone is insufficient to determine them fully. In contrast, the standard dynamical map formalism for open systems does not account for multi-time correlations, as it is fundamentally limited to describing state evolution. Here, we extend the scope of open quantum system theory by developing a systematic perturbation theory for computing multi-time correlation functions.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Transformer Architecture with a Quantized Self-Attention Mechanism Applied to Molecular Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of the self-attention mechanism in classical machine learning models has inspired the development of quantum analogs aimed at reducing computational overhead. Self-attention integrates learnable query and key matrices to calculate attention scores between all pairs of tokens in a sequence. These scores are then multiplied by a learnable value matrix to obtain the output self-attention matrix, enabling the model to effectively capture long-range dependencies within the input sequence. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical self-attention mechanism as part of a transformer decoder, the architecture underlying large language models (LLMs). To demonstrate its utility in chemistry, we train this model on the QM9 dataset for conditional generation, using SMILES strings as input, each labeled with a set of physicochemical properties that serve as conditions during inference. Our theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of the query-key dot product is reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^2 d)$ in a classical model to $\mathcal{O}(n^2\log d)$ in our quantum model, where $n$ and $d$ represent the sequence length and embedding dimension, respectively. We perform simulations using NVIDIA's CUDA-Q platform, which is designed for efficient GPU scalability. This work provides a promising avenue for quantum-enhanced natural language processing (NLP).</description>

      <title>Parallel Logical Measurements via Quantum Code Surgery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum code surgery is a flexible and low overhead technique for performing logical measurements on quantum error-correcting codes, which generalises lattice surgery. In this work, we present a code surgery scheme, applicable to any qubit stabiliser low-density parity check (LDPC) code, that fault-tolerantly measures many logical Pauli operators in parallel. For a collection of logically disjoint Pauli product measurements supported on $t$ logical qubits, our scheme uses $O\big(t \omega (\log t + \log^3\omega)\big)$ ancilla qubits, where $\omega \geq d$ is the maximum weight of the single logical Pauli representatives involved in the measurements, and $d$ is the code distance. This is all done in time $O(d)$ independent of $t$. Our proposed scheme preserves both the LDPC property and the fault-distance of the original code, without requiring ancillary logical codeblocks which may be costly to prepare. This addresses a shortcoming of several recently introduced surgery schemes which can only be applied to measure a limited number of logical operators in parallel if they overlap on data qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum metrology aims to maximize measurement precision on quantum systems, with a wide range of applications in quantum sensing. Achieving the Heisenberg limit (HL) - the fundamental precision bound set by quantum mechanics - is often hindered by noise-induced decoherence, which typically reduces achievable precision to the standard quantum limit (SQL). While quantum error correction (QEC) can recover the HL under Markovian noise, its applicability to non-Markovian noise remains less explored. In this work, we analyze a hidden Markov model in which a quantum probe, coupled to an inaccessible environment, undergoes joint evolution described by Lindbladian dynamics, with the inaccessible degrees of freedom serving as a memory. We derive generalized Knill-Laflamme conditions for the hidden Markov model and establish three types of sufficient conditions for achieving the HL under non-Markovian noise using QEC. Additionally, we demonstrate the attainability of the SQL when these sufficient conditions are violated, by analytical solutions for special cases and numerical methods for general scenarios. Our results not only extend prior QEC frameworks for metrology but also provide new insights into precision limits under realistic noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Critical Scaling of a Squeezing Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate phase transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of power-law interacting spin-1/2 bilayer XXZ models, which have recently been shown to allow generation of entanglement in the form of two-mode squeezing. We find a transition between a collective phase characterized by Heisenberg limited squeezing and a partially collective phase with scalable squeezing. We identify universal scaling of the squeezing dynamics in terms of system parameters and a divergent time-scale, establishing these as distinct dynamical phases within the framework of non-equilibrium critical phenomena. Our work demonstrates a novel dynamical phase transition with potential applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation in cold-atomic, molecular or Rydberg platforms.</description>

Abstract: We propose the variational quantum singular value decomposition based on encoding the elements of the considered { $N\times N$} matrix into the state of a quantum system of appropriate dimension. This method doesn't use the expansion of this matrix in terms of the unitary matrices. Controlled measurement is involved to avoid small success probability in ancilla measurement. The objective function for maximization algorithm can be obtained probabilistically via measurement of the states of { two} one-qubit subsystems. The circuit requires $O(\log N)$ qubits for realization of this algorithm { whose depths is proportional to $ \log N/\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ is the precision required for calculation of singular values.</description>

Abstract: Ergotropy serves as a key indicator for assessing the performance of quantum batteries(QBs). Using the Redfield master equation, we investigate ergotropy dynamics in a non-Markovian QB composed of an N-spin chain embedded in a microcavity. Distinct from Markovian charging process, the thermal charging process exhibits a distinct oscillatory behavior in the extracted ergotropy. We show these oscillations are suppressible via synergistic control of coherent driving, cavity parameters, and spin-spin couplings. In addition, we analyze the influence of various system and environmental parameters on the time evolution of ergotropy, revealing rich dynamical features. Our results offer new insights into the control of energy extraction in QBs and may inform future designs of practical battery architectures.</description>

      <title>Time-of-Flow Distributions in Discrete Quantum Systems: From Operational Protocols to Quantum Speed Limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general and experimentally accessible framework to quantify transition timing in discrete quantum systems via the time-of-flow (TF) distribution. Defined from the rate of population change in a target state, the TF distribution can be reconstructed through repeated projective measurements at discrete times on independently prepared systems, thus avoiding Zeno inhibition. In monotonic regimes, it admits a clear interpretation as a time-of-arrival (TOA) or time-of-departure (TOD) distribution. We apply this approach to optimize time-dependent Hamiltonians, analyze shortcut-to-adiabaticity (STA) protocols, and derive a transition-based quantum speed limit (TF-QSL) for both closed and open quantum systems. We also establish a lower bound on temporal uncertainty and examine decoherence effects, demonstrating the versatility of the TF framework for quantum control and diagnostics. This method provides both a conceptual tool and an experimental protocol for probing and engineering quantum dynamics in discrete-state platforms.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis and Noise Impact of a Novel Quantum KNN Algorithm for Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel quantum K-nearest neighbors (QKNN) algorithm, which offers improved performance over the classical k-NN technique by incorporating quantum computing (QC) techniques to enhance classification accuracy, scalability, and robustness. The proposed modifications focus on optimizing quantum data encoding using Hadamard and rotation gates, ensuring more effective rendering of classical data in quantum states. In addition, the quantum feature extraction process is significantly enhanced by the use of entangled gates such as IsingXY and CNOT, which enables better feature interactions and class separability. A novel quantum distance metric, based on the swap test, is introduced to calculate similarity measures between various quantum states, offering superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional Euclidean distance metrics. We assess the achievement of the proposed QKNN algorithm on three benchmark datasets: Wisconsin Breast Cancer, Iris, and Bank Note Authentication, and have noted its superior performance relative to both classical k-NN (CKNN) and Quantum Neural Network (QNN). The proposed QKNN algorithm is found to achieve prediction accuracies of 98.25%, 100%, and 99.27% ,respectively, for the three datasets, while the customized QNN shows prediction accuracies of only 97.17%, 83.33%, and 86.18%, respectively. Furthermore, we address the challenges of quantum noise by incorporating a repetition encoding-based error mitigation strategy, which ensures the stability and resilience of the algorithm in noisy quantum environments. The results highlight the potential of the proposed QKNN as a scalable, efficient and robust quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithm, especially in high-dimensional and complex datasets, when traditional approaches frequently fail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many current and near-future applications of quantum computing utilise parametric families of quantum circuits and variational methods to find optimal values for these parameters. Solving a quantum computational problem with such variational methods relies on minimising some cost function, e.g., the energy of a physical system. As such, this is similar to the training process in machine learning and variational quantum simulations can therefore suffer from similar problems encountered in machine learning training. This includes non-convergence to the global minimum due to local minima as well as critical slowing down. In this article, we analyse the imaginary time evolution as a means of compiling parametric quantum circuits and finding optimal parameters, and show that it guarantees convergence to the global minimum without critical slowing down. We also show that the compilation process, including the task of finding optimal parameters, can be performed efficiently up to an arbitrary error threshold if the underlying physical system is of bounded order. This includes many relevant computational problems, e.g., local physical theories and combinatorial optimisation problems such as the flight-to-gate assignment problem. In particular, we show a priori estimates on the success probability for these combinatorial optimisation problems. There seem to be no known classical methods with similar efficiency and convergence guarantees. Meanwhile the imaginary time evolution method can be implemented on current quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Anomalous flow in correlated quantum systems: No-go result and multiple-charge scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlated quantum systems can exhibit thermodynamic behaviors that defy classical expectations, with anomalous energy flow (AEF) against temperature gradients serving as a paradigmatic example. While AEF has been shown to arise from the consumption of initial quantum correlations, little is known about whether AEF can occur without correlation depletion, or if analogous anomalous transport exists for conserved quantities--dubbed charges--other than energy. Here, we develop a general global-local thermodynamic approach to describe charge exchange between arbitrary correlated quantum systems. For energy-conserving systems, we analytically rule out AEF in initially uncorrelated states, even with the involvement of quantum catalysts, thereby complementing existing studies. In contrast, in systems with multiple conserved charges, we uncover a mechanism for AEF that requires no initial correlations but is instead induced by a drag effect from normal flows of non-energy charges. Furthermore, by treating all conserved charges on equal footing, we generalize AEF to a broader concept of anomalous charge flow, applicable to any conserved charge. We confirm theoretical expectations with numerical examples. These findings deepen our understanding of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics and open new avenues for controlling transport phenomena in correlated quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: According to the Landauer principle, any logically irreversible process accompanies entropy production, which results in heat dissipation in the environment. Erasing of information, one of the primary logically irreversible processes, has a lower bound on heat dissipated into the environment, called the Landauer bound (LB). However, the practical erasure processes dissipate much more heat than the LB. Recently, there have been a few experimental investigations to reach this bound both in the classical and quantum domains. There has also been a spate of activities to enquire about this LB in finite time, with finite-size heat baths, non-Markovian and nonequilibrium environments in the quantum regime, where the effects of fluctuations and correlation of the systems with the bath can no longer be ignored. This article provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the Landauer bound, which serves as a fundamental principle in the thermodynamics of computation. We also provide a perspective for future endeavors in these directions.
  Furthermore, we review the recent explorations toward establishing energetic bounds of a computational process. We also discuss the thermodynamic aspects of error correction, which is an indispensable part of information processing and computations. In doing so, we briefly discuss the basics of these fields to provide a complete picture.</description>

Abstract: Microwave drives are essential for implementing control and readout operations in superconducting quantum circuits. However, increasing the drive strength eventually leads to unwanted state transitions which limit the speed and fidelity of such operations. In this work, we systematically investigate such transitions in a fixed-frequency qubit subjected to microwave drives spanning a 9 GHz frequency range. We identify the physical origins of these transitions and classify them into three categories. (1) Resonant energy exchange with parasitic two-level systems, activated by drive-induced ac-Stark shifts, (2) multi-photon transitions to non-computational states, intrinsic to the circuit Hamiltonian, and (3) inelastic scattering processes in which the drive causes a state transition in the superconducting circuit, while transferring excess energy to a spurious electromagnetic mode or two-level system (TLS) material defect. We show that the Floquet steady-state simulation, complemented by an electromagnetic simulation of the physical device, accurately predicts the observed transitions that do not involve TLS. Our results provide a comprehensive classification of these transitions and offer mitigation strategies through informed choices of drive frequency as well as improved circuit design.</description>

Abstract: Quantum neural networks combine quantum computing with advanced data-driven methods, offering promising applications in quantum machine learning. However, the optimal paradigm for balancing trainability and expressivity in QNNs remains an open question. To address this, we introduce the Linear Combination of Quantum Neural Networks (LCQNN) framework, which uses the linear combination of unitaries concept to create a tunable design that mitigates vanishing gradients without incurring excessive classical simulability. We show how specific structural choices, such as adopting $k$-local control unitaries or restricting the model to certain group-theoretic subspaces, prevent gradients from collapsing while maintaining sufficient expressivity for complex tasks. We further employ the LCQNN model to handle supervised learning tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness on real datasets. In group action scenarios, we show that by exploiting symmetry and excluding exponentially large irreducible subspaces, the model circumvents barren plateaus. Overall, LCQNN provides a novel framework for focusing quantum resources into architectures that are practically trainable yet expressive enough to tackle challenging machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Security of the BB84 protocol with receiver's passive biased basis choice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bennett-Brassard 1984 protocol (BB84 protocol) is one of the simplest protocols for implementing quantum key distribution (QKD). In the protocol, the sender and the receiver iteratively choose one of two complementary measurement bases. Regarding the basis choice by the receiver, a passive setup has been adopted in a number of its implementations including satellite QKD and time-bin encoding one. However, conventional theoretical techniques to prove the security of BB84 protocol are not applicable if the receiver chooses his measurement basis passively, rather than actively, with a biased probability, followed by the measurement with threshold detectors. Here we present a fully analytical security proof for such a decoy-state BB84 protocol with receiver's passive basis choice and measurement with threshold detectors. Thanks to the analytic nature, our security proof can straightforwardly be lifted up to the one over coherent attacks. The numerical simulations under practical situations show that the difference in secure key rate between the active and the passive implementations of the protocol is negligible except for long communication distances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a collection of results on the structure of permutations in the Clifford Hierarchy. First, we leverage results from the cryptography literature on affine equivalence classes of 4-bit permutations which we use to find all 4-qubit permutations in the Clifford Hierarchy. We then use the classification of 4-qubit permutations and previous results on the structure of diagonal gates in the Clifford Hierarchy to prove that all 4-qubit gates in the third level of the Clifford Hierarchy are semi-Clifford. Finally, we introduce the formalism of cycle structures to permutations in the Clifford Hierarchy and prove a general structure theorem about them. We also classify many small cycle structures up to affine equivalence. Interestingly, this classification is independent of the number of qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In statistics and causal modeling it is common for a selection process to induce correlations in a subset of an uncorrelated ensemble. We propose that EPR and Bell correlations are selection artefacts of this kind. The selection process is preparation of the initial state of the relevant experiments. Choice of initial state amounts to preselection of a subensemble of a larger, uncorrelated, virtual ensemble of possible histories. Because it is preselection rather than postselection, the resulting correlations support the intuitive counterfactuals of the EPR argument and Bell nonlocality. In this respect, and in its temporal orientation, the case differs from familiar forms of selection bias. Given the ubiquity of quantum entanglement, the result may thus be of independent interest to students of causal modeling. The paper concludes with a discussion of its novel implications in that field.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Predictor for Optimal Quantum Hardware Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing variety of quantum hardware technologies, each with unique peculiarities such as connectivity and native gate sets, creates challenges when selecting the best platform for executing a specific quantum circuit. This selection process usually involves a brute-force approach: compiling the circuit on various devices and evaluating performance based on factors such as circuit depth and gate fidelity. However, this method is computationally expensive and does not scale well as the number of available quantum processors increases. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based predictor that automates hardware selection by analyzing the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit. Our study evaluates 498 quantum circuits (up to 27 qubits) from the MQT Bench dataset, compiled using Qiskit on four devices: three superconducting quantum processors (IBM-Kyiv, IBM-Brisbane, IBM-Sherbrooke) and one trapped-ion processor (IONQ-Forte). Performance is estimated using a metric that integrates circuit depth and gate fidelity, resulting in a dataset where 93 circuits are optimally compiled on the trapped-ion device, while the remaining circuits prefer superconducting platforms. By exploiting graph-based machine learning, our approach avoids extracting the circuit features for the model evaluation but directly embeds it as a graph, significantly accelerating the optimal target decision-making process and maintaining all the information. Experimental results prove 94.4% accuracy and an 85.5% F1 score for the minority class, effectively predicting the best compilation target. The developed code is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/antotu/GNN-Model-Quantum-Predictor).</description>

      <title>On the Simulation of Conical Intersections in Water and Methanimine Molecules Via Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of methanimine (CH2NH) and water (H2O) molecules in an effort to locate conical intersections (CIs) using variational quantum algorithms. Our approach implements and compares a range of hybrid quantum-classical methods, including the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), VQE with Automatically-Adjusted Constraints (VQE-AC), and we explore molecular configurations of interest using a State-Average (SA) approach. Exact Diagonalization is employed as the classical benchmark to evaluate the accuracy of the quantum algorithms. We perform simulations across a range of molecular geometries, basis sets, and active spaces to compare each algorithm's performance and accuracy, and to enhance the detectability of CIs. This work confirms the quantum variational algorithms' capability of describing conical intersections in both molecules, as long as appropriate active spaces and geometries of the molecule are chosen. We also compare the accuracy and reliability of VQE-based methods for computing excited states with classical benchmark methods, and we demonstrate good agreement within desired regions.</description>

Abstract: We show an explicit $N$-qubit protocol involving one-axis-twisted spin squeezed states, that allows for simultaneous phase and dephasing strength estimation with precision that asymptotically matches fundamental quantum metrological bounds. The relevance of the protocol goes beyond this particular model, since any uncorrelated noise quantum metrological model, that allows for at most constant asymptotic quantum enhancement, can be reduced to this problem via an appropriately tailored quantum error-correction procedure.</description>

      <title>Sandwich test for Quantum Phase Estimation</title>

Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) has potential for a scientific revolution through numerous practical applications like finding better medicines, batteries, materials, catalysts etc. Many QPE algorithms use the Hadamard test to estimate $\langle \psi|U^{k}|\psi\rangle$ for a large integer $k$ for an efficiently preparable initial state $|\psi\rangle$ and an efficiently implementable unitary operator $U$. The Hadamard test is hard to implement because it requires controlled applications of $U^{k}$. Recently, a Sequential Hadamard test (SHT) was proposed (arXiv:2506.18765) which requires controlled application of $U$ only but its total run time $T_{\rm tot}$ scales as $\mathcal{O}(k^{3}/\epsilon^{2}r_{\rm min}^{2})$ where $r_{\rm min}$ is the minimum value of $|\langle \psi|U^{k'}|\psi\rangle|$ among all integers $k' \leq k$. Typically $r_{\rm min}$ is exponentially low and SHT becomes too slow. We present a new algorithm, the SANDWICH test to address this bottleneck. Our algorithm uses efficient preparation of the initial state $|\psi\rangle$ to efficiently implement the SPROTIS operator $R_{\psi}^{\phi}$ where SPROTIS stands for the Selective Phase Rotation of the Initial State. It sandwiches the SPROTIS operator between $U^{a}$ and $U^{b}$ for integers $\{a,b\} \leq k$ to estimate $\langle \psi|U^{k}|\psi\rangle$. The total run time $T_{\rm tot}$ is $\mathcal{O}(k^{2}\ln k/ \epsilon^{2} s_{\rm min}^{6})$. Here $s_{\rm min}$ is the minimum value of $|\langle \psi|U^{\hat{k}}|\psi\rangle$ among all integers $\hat{k}$ which are values of the nodes of a random binary sum tree whose root node value is $k$ and leaf nodes' values are $1$ or $0$. It can be reasonably expected that $s_{\rm min} \not\ll 1$ in typical cases because there is wide freedom in choosing the random binary sum tree.</description>

Abstract: We study a family of structure-preserving deterministic numerical schemes for Lindblad equations. This family of schemes has a simple form and can systemically achieve arbitrary high-order accuracy in theory. Moreover, these schemes can also overcome the non-physical issues that arise from many traditional numerical schemes. Due to their preservation of physical nature, these schemes can be straightforwardly used as backbones for further developing randomized and quantum algorithms in simulating Lindblad equations. In this work, we systematically study this family of structure-preserving deterministic schemes and perform a detailed error analysis, which is validated through numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: We provide two extensions of a dense subspace of Fock space, such that Bogoliubov transformations become implementable on them, even though they violate the Shale-Stinespring condition, so they are not implementable on Fock space. Both the bosonic and fermionic case are covered. Conditions for implementability in the extended sense are stated and proved. From these, we derive conditions for a quadratic Hamiltonian to be diagonalizable by a Bogoliubov transformation that is implementable in the extended sense. Three examples illustrate situations, in which an implementation in the extended sense is possible although the Shale-Stinespring condition fails to hold.</description>

      <title>Entanglement patterns of quantum chaotic Hamiltonians with a scalar U(1) charge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our current understanding of quantum chaos in many-body quantum systems hinges on the random matrix theory(RMT) behavior of eigenstates and their energy level statistics. Although RMT has been remarkably successful in describing `coarse' features of many-body quantum Hamiltonians in chaotic regimes, such as the Wigner-Dyson level spacing statistics or the volume-law behavior of eigenstate entanglement entropy, it remains a challenge to describe their `finer' features, particularly those arising from spatial locality. Here, we show that we can accurately describe the statistical behavior of eigenstate ensembles in many-body Hamiltonians by using pure random states with physical constraints that capture the essential features of the Hamiltonian, specifically spatial locality and symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on local spin Hamiltonians with a scalar U(1) charge. By constructing ensembles of constrained random states that account for two commuting scalar charges playing the role of energy and magnetization, we describe the patterns of entanglement of mid-spectrum eigenstates beyond their average volume-law behavior, including $O(1)$ corrections and fluctuations, analytically and numerically. When defining the correspondence between quantum chaotic eigenstates in many-body Hamiltonians and RMT ensembles, our work highlights the important role played by spatial locality in describing universal features beyond the volume-law behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamical trajectory of a dissipative Rydberg many-body system could be flipped under a microwave field driving, displaying an enhanced sensitivity. This is because the intersection of the folded hysteresis trajectories exhibits a sharp peak near the phase transition, amplifying the response to small changes in the microwave field. Here, we demonstrate an experiment of enhanced metrology through flipping the hysteresis trajectory in a cold atomic system, displaying an approach to improve sensitivity near the gap-closing points. By measuring the intersection points of hysteresis trajectories versus Rabi frequency of the microwave field, we quantify the equivalent sensitivity to be 1.6(5) nV cm-1 Hz-1/2. The measurement is also dependent on the interaction time, optical depth and principal quantum number since the long-range interaction between Rydberg atoms could dramatically change the shape of hysteresis trajectories. The reported results suggest that flipping trajectory features in cold Rydberg many-body systems could advance sensing and metrology applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Evans-Searles, respectively Gallavotti-Cohen, fluctuation theorem concerns certain universal statistical features of the entropy production rate of a classical system in a transient, respectively steady, state. In this paper, we consider and compare several possible extensions of these fluctuation theorems to quantum systems. In addition to the direct two-time measurement approach whose discussion is based on (LMP 114:32 (2024)), we discuss a variant where measurements are performed indirectly on an auxiliary system called ancilla, and which allows to retrieve non-trivial statistical information using ancilla state tomography. We also show that modular theory provides a way to extend the classical notion of phase space contraction rate to the quantum domain, which leads to a third extension of the fluctuation theorems. We further discuss the quantum version of the principle of regular entropic fluctuations, introduced in the classical context in (Nonlinearity 24, 699 (2011)). Finally, we relate the statistical properties of these various notions of entropy production to spectral resonances of quantum transfer operators. The obtained results shed a new light on the nature of entropic fluctuations in quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>More on the Operator Space Entanglement (OSE): R\'enyi OSE, revivals, and integrability breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the R\'enyi Operator Space Entanglement ($OSE$) entropies $S_n$ across several one-dimensional integrable and chaotic models. As a paradigmatic integrable system, we first consider the so-called rule $54$ chain. Our numerical results reveal that the R\'enyi $OSE$ entropies of diagonal operators with nonzero trace saturate at long times, in contrast with the behavior of von Neumann entropy. Oppositely, the R\'enyi entropies of traceless operators exhibit logarithmic growth with time, with the prefactor of this growth depending in a nontrivial manner on $n$. Notably, at long times, the complete operator entanglement spectrum ($ES$) of an operator can be reconstructed from the spectrum of its traceless part. We observe a similar pattern in the $XXZ$ chain, suggesting universal behavior. Additionally, we consider dynamics in nonintegrable deformations of the $XXZ$ chain. Finite-time corrections do not allow to access the long-time behavior of the von Neumann entropy. On the other hand, for $n&gt;1$ the growth of the entropies is milder, and it is compatible with a sublinear growth, at least for operators associated with global conserved quantities. Finally, we show that in finite-size integrable systems, $S_n$ exhibit strong revivals, which are washed out when integrability is broken.</description>

      <title>Rainbow chains and numerical renormalisation group for accurate chiral conformal spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Fermi Velocity Dependent Critical Current in Ballistic Bilayer Graphene Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform transport measurements on proximitized, ballistic, bilayer graphene Josephson junctions (BGJJs) in the intermediate-to-long junction regime ($L&gt;\xi$). We measure the device's differential resistance as a function of bias current and gate voltage for a range of different temperatures. The extracted critical current $I_{C}$ follows an exponential trend with temperature: $ \exp(-k_{B} T/ \delta E)$. Here $\delta E = \hbar \nu_F /2\pi L $: an expected trend for intermediate-to-long junctions. From $\delta E$, we determine the Fermi velocity of the bilayer graphene, which is found to increase with gate voltage. Simultaneously, we show the carrier density dependence of $\delta E$, which is attributed to the quadratic dispersion of bilayer graphene. This is in contrast to single layer graphene Josephson junctions, where $\delta E$ and the Fermi velocity are independent of the carrier density. The carrier density dependence in BGJJs allows for additional tuning parameters in graphene-based Josephson Junction devices.</description>

      <title>Crystalline superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junctions for compact superconducting qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The narrow bandgap of semiconductors allows for thick, uniform Josephson junction barriers, potentially enabling reproducible, stable, and compact superconducting qubits. We study vertically stacked van der Waals Josephson junctions with semiconducting weak links, whose crystalline structures and clean interfaces offer a promising platform for quantum devices. We observe robust Josephson coupling across 2--12 nm (3--18 atomic layers) of semiconducting WSe$_2$ and, notably, a crossover from proximity- to tunneling-type behavior with increasing weak link thickness. Building on these results, we fabricate a prototype all-crystalline merged-element transmon qubit with transmon frequency and anharmonicity closely matching design parameters. We demonstrate dispersive coupling between this transmon and a microwave resonator, highlighting the potential of crystalline superconductor-semiconductor structures for compact, tailored superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Transitions between Symmetry-Enriched Fracton Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topologically ordered phases exhibit further complexity in the presence of global symmetries: Their anyonic excitations may exhibit different transformation patterns under these symmetries, leading to a classification in terms of symmetry-enriched topological orders. We develop a generic scheme to study an analogous situation for three-dimensional fracton phases by means of isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) with finite bond dimension, which allow us to tune phase transitions between different symmetry fractionalization patterns. We focus on the X-Cube model, a paradigmatic fracton model hosting two types of excitations: lineons, which are mobile in a single direction only, and fractons that are immobile on their own. By deforming the local tensors of the fixed point ground state, we find a family of exact wavefunctions for which the symmetry fractionalization under an anti-unitary symmetry on both types of excitations is directly visible. These wavefunctions are non-stabilizer states and have non-vanishing correlation lengths. They even exhibit power-law correlations at criticality between two symmetry-enriched topological orders. Furthermore, the isoTNS description allows for the explicit construction of a linear-depth quantum circuit to sequentially realize these exotic 3D states on a quantum processor, including a holographic scheme using only a pair of two-dimensional qubit arrays alongside measurements. Our approach provides a construction to enrich phases with exotic topological or fracton order and to study 3D quantum phase transition with exact wavefunctions, and offers a tractable route to implement and characterize fracton order on quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation on axially-symmetric surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation in ideal bosonic gases confined to axially-symmetric surfaces of revolution. The single-particle Schr\"odinger equation is formulated on a general surface and then explicitly solved in the ellipsoidal and toroidal geometries to determine the one-body energy spectrum. We discuss how the curved geometry impacts the quantum statistical properties of ideal Bose gases confined on these surfaces. Specifically, we observe that Bose-Einstein condensation is suppressed when the surface aspect ratio is increased and, correspondingly, it becomes highly elongated and acquires a one-dimensional character. We also evaluate the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum, providing insights into the collective excitations of the condensate. Our results establish the conditions to achieve quantum degeneracy in curved manifolds, thus guiding forthcoming experiments with thin shells, and set the basis for solving the few-to-many body problem in general surfaces of revolution.</description>

Abstract: We consider an equidistant array of disjoint potential wells in $\mathbb{R}^\nu,\: \nu\ge 2$, built over a straight line, and show that, under a restriction on the potential support aspect ratio, a perturbation consisting of longitudinal shifts of a finite number of them preserving the disjointness gives rise to a nonempty discrete spectrum below the threshold of the lowest spectral band.</description>

      <title>Rovibrational computation of H$_3^+$ with permutationally invariant Pekeris coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pekeris coordinates provide a permutationally invariant set of coordinates for H$_3^+$. They are defined as linear combinations of the three internuclear distances that automatically fulfil the triangle inequality for all non-negative coordinate values. In this work, we test three discrete variable representations (DVR) for tightly converging the rovibrational energies up to and beyond the barrier to linearity using the Pekeris coordinates. The best performing representation is a cot-DVR-type approach adapted to the Pekeris problem. The two- and three-proton near coalescence region, which is also part of the direct product Pekeris grid but dynamically not relevant, is avoided by coordinate mapping and regulator functions.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum dynamics of methanol: full-dimensional ab initio potential energy surface of spectroscopic quality and variational vibrational states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The methanol molecule is a sensitive probe of astrochemistry, astrophysics, and fundamental physics. The first-principles elucidation and prediction of its rotation-torsional-vibrational motions are enabled in this work by the computation of a full-dimensional, \emph{ab initio} potential energy surface (PES) and numerically exact quantum dynamics. An active-learning approach is used to sample explicitly correlated coupled-cluster electronic energies, and the datapoints are fitted with permutationally invariant polynomials to obtain a spectroscopic-quality PES representation. Variational vibrational energies and corresponding tunnelling splittings are computed up to the first overtone of the C-O stretching mode by direct numerical solution of the vibrational Schr\"odinger equation with optimal internal coordinates and efficient basis and grid truncation techniques. As a result, the computed vibrational band origins finally agree with experiment within 5 cm$^{-1}$, allowing for the exploration of the large-amplitude quantum mechanical motion and tunnelling splittings coupled with the small-amplitude vibrational dynamics. These developments open the route towards simulating rovibrational spectra used to probe methanol in outer space and in precision science laboratories, as well as for probing interactions with external magnetic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have great potential in solving the ground state of various many-body problems. However, several key challenges remain to be overcome before NNs can tackle problems and system sizes inaccessible with more established tools. Here, we present a general and efficient method for learning the NN representation of an arbitrary many-body complex wave function from its $N$-particle probability density and probability current density. Having reached overlaps as large as $99.9\%$, we employ our neural wave function for pre-training to effortlessly solve the fractional quantum Hall problem with Coulomb interactions and realistic Landau-level mixing for as many as $25$ particles. Our work demonstrates efficient, accurate simulation of highly-entangled quantum matter using general-purpose deep NNs enhanced with physics-informed initialization.</description>

      <title>Lattice tuning of charge and spin transport in $\beta_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\beta_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons (BNRs) exhibit magnetic zigzag edges, while other edge configurations are nonmagnetic. However, when the source, central, and drain regions of a logic device are all composed of zigzag BNRs (ZBNRs), the resulting spin polarization remains weak, unless a high voltage is applied. In this work, we demonstrate that lattice vibrations-introduced for example, via a thermal bath coupled to the central BNR-can enhance spin polarization in ZBNRs. This enhancement manifests as marked changes in the current-voltage characteristics, enabling direct experimental probing. In contrast, nonmagnetic edge configurations exhibit phonon-enhanced charge transport. We employ a tight-binding approach augmented with local electron-phonon interactions described by the Holstein model, and compute the phonon-renormalized Green's functions and transport currents using the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism. The mechanism is supported by analyzing both spinless and spinful electronic dispersions and the corresponding density of states. Compared to the phonon-free edges, structural distortions lead to anisotropic electron-phonon couplings, which significantly modify both charge and spin transport. These results position phonon as an effective tuning parameter for optimizing borophene-based logic devices via engineered edge configurations.</description>

      <title>Squeezed gravitons from superradiant axion fields around rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose, in (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, a novel astrophysical source of squeezed graviton states, due to superradiant axionic clouds surrounding rotating (Kerr-type) black holes (BH). The microscopic origin of these axions is diverse, ranging from the Kalb-Ramond (model-independent) axions and compactification axions in string theory, to \cm contorted geometries exemplified by a totally antisymmetric component of torsion in Einstein-Cartan theory. The axion fields couple to chiral gauge and gravitational Chern-Simons (CS) anomaly terms in the effective gravitational actions. In the presence of a Kerr BH background, such axions lead, upon acquiring a mass, to superradiance and the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a squeezed state. The specific microscopic origin of the axions is not important, provided they are massive. This multimode squeezed-graviton state is examined through a Takagi-like decomposition, used in quantum optics. In the effective action it is shown that squeezing effects associated with conventional general relativity (GR) dominate, by many orders of magnitude, the corresponding effects due to the CS gravitational anomaly terms. For a sufficiently long lifetime of the axionic cloud of the BH, we find that significant squeezing (quantified through the average number of gravitons with respect to the appropriate vacuum) can be produced from the GR effects. It is also demonstrated explicitly that the structure of the entangled states (when the latter are expressed in a left-right polarization basis) depends highly on whether the GR or the anomalous CS effects produce the entanglement.</description>

      <title>Double descent: When do neural quantum states generalize?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) provide flexible wavefunction parameterizations for numerical studies of quantum many-body physics. While inspired by deep learning, it remains unclear to what extent NQS share characteristics with neural networks used for standard machine learning tasks. We demonstrate that NQS exhibit the double descent phenomenon, a key feature of modern deep learning, where generalization worsens as network size increases before improving again in an overparameterized regime. Notably, we find the second descent to occur only for network sizes much larger than the Hilbert space dimension, indicating that NQS typically operate in an underparameterized regime, where increasing network size can degrade generalization. Our analysis reveals that the optimal network size in this regime depends on the number of unique training samples, highlighting the importance of sampling strategies. These findings suggest the need for symmetry-aware, physics-informed architecture design, rather than directly adopting machine learning heuristics.</description>
