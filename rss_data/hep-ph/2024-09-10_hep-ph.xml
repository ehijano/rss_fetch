      <title>Antisymmetric tensor portals to dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both freeze-in of very weakly coupled dark matter and freeze-out of initially thermalized dark matter from the primordial heat bath provide interesting possibilities for dark matter creation in the early universe. Both scenarios allow for a calculation of baryon-dark matter coupling constants as a function of dark matter mass due to the constraint that freeze-in or freeze-out produce the observed dark matter abundance. Here we compare the resulting coupling constants in the two scenarios if dark matter couples to baryons through an antisymmetric tensor portal. The freeze-in scenario predicts much smaller coupling in agreement with the nonthermalization postulate. We find that the couplings as a function of mass behave very differently in the two scenarios.</description>

      <title>Unitarity Bound on Extended Higgs Sector with Higher Dimensional Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the perturbative unitarity bound given by higher dimensional bosonic operators up to dim-6 for the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM). They lead to new physics beyond the Standard Model. We point out that such operators can lead to a larger cross-section in the vector boson fusion channels for the scalars, compared to the tree-level 2HDM. We have obtained limits on a few bosonic operators up to dim-6 for 2HDM, by ensuring unitarity of the S-matrix.</description>

      <title>Effect of inelastic scattering on cosmic-ray-boosted dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-GeV dark matter particles evade standard direct detection studies since their typical energies in the galactic halo do not allow for detectable recoil of the heavy nuclei in the detectors. However, it was noted that if the dark matter particles have sizable couplings to nucleons, they can be boosted by interactions with galactic cosmic rays and probed by experiments like Xenon-1T. We revisit the resulting bounds on DM-nucleon interaction and improve on previous works by considering the DM-nucleus inelastic cross sections provided by the GENIE interaction event generator. Including inelastic scattering in the process of dark matter boosting increases the flux of high-energy dark matter coming to Earth. Additionally, allowing for inelastic scattering with nuclei is important for a realistic description of the dark matter interacting in the Earth's crust. We demonstrate these effects on a benchmark model where dark matter interactions are mediated by a dark U(1) vector boson.</description>

      <title>Polarizabilities from kaon Compton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarizabilities of light pseudoscalar mesons can be extracted from differential cross sections for Compton scattering near threshold. While this has been accomplished for charged pions employing Primakoff reactions, a corresponding measurement for kaons will be affected by the presence of the $K^*(892)$ resonance not too far from threshold. We propose a method to extend the energy range serviceable for this purpose by reconstructing the $K^*(892)$ contribution model-independently from its $K\pi$ intermediate state, using dispersion theory. We point out that, in contrast to the charged-pion analog, there is likely no strong hierarchy between sum and difference of electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities; we discuss the sensitivity to disentangling both by improved experimental angular coverage.</description>

      <title>Factorization for jet production in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an Effective Field Theory approach for jet observables in heavy-ion collisions, where the jet is treated as an open quantum system interacting with a hot and dense QCD medium. Within this framework, we derive a novel factorization formula for inclusive jet production, expressed as a series expansion with an increasing number of radiating subjet functions that encode forward scattering with the Quark-Gluon Plasma, convolved with perturbative matching coefficients. This work provides a systematic framework for computing jet observables at higher order and understanding their non-perturbative aspects, paving the way for future applications in heavy-ion phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Third-order correction to top-quark pair production near threshold II. Potential contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a detailed account of the methods and calculations for the third-order corrections to the S-wave Green function from heavy-quark potentials other than the Coulomb potential. The results of this paper are relevant to the top-antitop threshold production process in next-to-next-to-next-to-leading (NNNLO) order and to the determination of the bottom-quark mass from high-moment sum rules, and have been employed in corresponding previous publications. Further to the third-order calculation, we discuss in detail three refinements necessary to obtain reliable third-order results for the top threshold: finite-width effects, pole resummation, and the implementation of the potential-subtracted mass scheme. A detailed numerical analysis of residual scale dependence and the size of various contributions to the top production cross section is provided. The S-wave energy levels and wave functions at the origin for heavy quarkonium states of arbitrary principal quantum number $n$ are collected in an appendix.</description>

      <title>Charged scalars at finite electric field and temperature in the optimized perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the symmetry breaking and restoration behavior of a self-interacting charged scalar field theory under the influence of a constant electric field and finite temperature. Our study is performed in the context of the optimized perturbation theory. The dependence of the effective potential with constant electric fields is established by means of the bosonic propagators in the Schwinger proper-time method. Explicit analytical expressions for the electric and thermal contributions are found. Our results show a decreasing behavior for the vacuum expectation value as a function of the electric fields, which is strengthened by the temperature effect. A first-order phase transition that occurs at zero /weak electric fields changes to a second-order phase transition under strong electric fields. The critical temperature for the phase transition exhibited a very weak dependence on the electric field. Additionally, we computed the vacuum persistence probability rate for the interacting theory, finding a peak at the critical point. The maximum value of this rate at the critical point is found to be independent of the coupling constant but depended solely on the magnitude of the electric field.</description>

      <title>Axion Icebergs: Clockwork ALPs at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional ultralight QCD axion is typically rendered invisible at collider experiments by its large decay constant. What could also hint at its possible existence is the observation of other (heavy) particles that are characteristically related to the light axion. One such scenario is afforded within the framework of the clockwork mechanism where the axion can have suppressed couplings with the gluons or photons while its companion axion-like particles (ALPs) have relatively unsuppressed couplings. We study a minimal clockwork model for the QCD axion invoking a KSVZ-like setup and examine the visibility of the ALPs $(a_n)$ at the LHC through the process $p p \to a_n \, (+ \,{\rm additional \, jets})$, $a_n \to \gamma \gamma$. The model contains $N$ ALPs with a decay constant $f$ and masses defined by a scale $m$ characteristic of the nearest-neighbour interactions of the scalar fields. For $10\lesssim m \lesssim 100$ GeV, $f \sim 1$ TeV and $N \sim \mathcal{O}(10)$, the full spectrum of ALPs is accessible and the corresponding diphoton invariant mass distribution comprises a unique signature of a wide band of resonances. For the case of light ALPs $(m \sim \mathcal{O}(10 \,{\rm GeV}))$ with the axion being a dark matter candidate, the mass-splittings among the former are so small that the signal profile mimics that of a single broad resonance, or an $\textit{axion iceberg}$. The effect subsides for heavier ALPs, albeit still exhibiting undulating peaks. For light ALPs, the scenario is imminently testable by the end of LHC's Run 3 phase, with the estimated cumulative significance reaching the discovery threshold for an integrated luminosity of $\sim 300 {\rm \,fb^{-1}}$. While the signals for the heavier ALPs in this minimal setup may not be as prominent within the ongoing LHC operation, one could expect to probe a wider parameter space of the model at the forthcoming HL-LHC.</description>

      <title>Tridiagonal scalar mass matrix in the CP4 3HDM and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When parametrizing multi-Higgs potentials, it is desirable to express its coefficients via observables. This is routinely done for the 2HDM, but this approach often fails in more elaborate models. Here, we show that the scalar sector of the CP4 3HDM, an intriguing model based on an order-4 $CP$ symmetry, can also be parametrized in an observable-driven manner. The key feature that makes it work is the very special tridiagonal form of the $5\times 5$ neutral Higgs mass matrix. We propose a set of input observables and present an algorithm to reconstruct the coefficients of the potential through linear relations. Equipped with this procedure, we explore the scalar sector of the CP4 3HDM beyond the limitations of previous studies. In particular, we identify a viable and testable regime in which all additional Higgses lie in the 300--600~GeV range. This work offers a key ingredient for a future full phenomenological scan of this model.</description>

      <title>First Radial Excitations of Baryons in a Contact Interaction: Mass Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute masses of twenty positive parity first radial excitations of spin-$1/2$ and $3/2$ baryons composed of u,d,s,c and b quarks in a quark-diquark picture within a contact interaction model. These excitations comprise of two elements: one characterized by a zero in the Faddeev amplitude, representing a radial excitation of the quark-diquark system and the other marked by a zero in the diquark's Bethe-Salpeter amplitude, corresponding to an intrinsic excitation of the diquark correlation. Wherever possible, we compare our results with other models and/or experiment. We verify that the masses obtained through our model conform to the spacing rules for all the baryons studied, whether light or heavy and whether of spin 1/2 or 3/2. The computed masses do not just offer a guide to the future experimental searches but also compare well with the existing candidates for the possible radial excitations of some heavy baryons.</description>

      <title>Testing CP properties of the Higgs boson coupling to $\tau$ leptons with heterogeneous graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of measuring the CP properties of the Higgs boson coupling to $\tau$ leptons at the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). Employing detailed Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze the reconstruction of the angle between $\tau$ lepton planes at the detector level, accounting for various hadronic $\tau$ decay modes. Considering standard model backgrounds and detector resolution effects, we employ three Deep Learning (DL) networks, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Graph Convolution Network (GCN), and Graph Transformer Network (GTN) to enhance signal-to-background separation. To incorporate CP-sensitive observables into Graph networks, we construct Heterogeneous graphs capable of integrating nodes and edges with different structures within the same framework. Our analysis demonstrates that GTN exhibits superior efficiency compared to GCN and MLP. Under a simplified detector simulation analysis, MLP can exclude CP mixing angle larger than $20^\circ$ at $68\%$ confidence level (CL), while GCN and GTN can achieve exclusions at $90\%$ CL and $95\%$ CL, respectively with $\sqrt{s}=14$~TeV and $\mathcal{L}$$=100\rm { fb}^{-1}$. Furthermore, the DL networks can achieve a significance of approximately $3\sigma$ in excluding the pure CP-odd state.</description>

      <title>Proton Lifetime in Minimal Supersymmetric SU(5) with Gauge Mediation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the predicted proton lifetimes in minimal supersymmetric (SUSY) $SU(5)$ grand unified theory (GUT) with gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB). We focus on the case of $\mathbf{5} + \mathbf{\bar{5}}$ messengers and determine the low-scale mass spectrum of the scalar particles and gauginos using the renormalization group equations. With the obtained mass spectrum, we calculate the dominant proton decay mode for SUSY $SU(5)$ GUT, $p \to K^+ \bar{\nu}$. In our setup, we assume the messenger scale to be $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ TeV in order to obtain a proper Higgs mass in GMSB scenario. For this messenger scale, we find the proton lifetime is consistent with current experimental limits and can be tested by future proton decay experiments.</description>

      <title>Scoto-seesaw model implied by flavor-dependent Abelian gauge charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming fundamental fermions possess a new Abelian gauge charge that depends on flavors of both quark and lepton, we obtain a simple extension of the Standard Model, which reveals some new physics insights. The new gauge charge anomaly cancellation not only explains the existence of just three fermion generations as observed but also requires the presence of a unique right-handed neutrino $\nu_R$ with a non-zero new gauge charge. Further, the new gauge charge breaking supplies a residual matter parity, under which the fundamental fermions and $\nu_R$ are even, whereas a right-handed neutrino $N_R$ without the new charge is odd. Consequently, light neutrino masses in our model are generated from the tree-level type-I seesaw mechanism induced by $\nu_R$ and from the one-loop scotogenic contribution accommodated by potential dark matter candidates, $N_R$ and dark scalars, odd under the matter parity. We examine new physics phenomena related to the additional gauge boson, which could be observed at colliders. We analyze the constraints imposed on our model by current experimental limits on neutrino masses, neutral meson oscillations, $B$-meson decays, and charged lepton flavor violating processes. We also investigate the potential dark matter candidates by considering relic density and direct detection.</description>

      <title>Polarized $W^+W^-$ pairs at the LHC: Effects from bottom-quark induced processes at NLO QCD+EW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of the bottom-quark induced processes on the doubly polarized cross sections of $W^+W^-$ pair production at the LHC. The method to extract the on-shell single-top contribution is provided. Results for phenomenological and experimental analyses are given at next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD+EW accuracy, with the leading contribution from the gluon-gluon and photon-photon fusion included. We found that the contribution of the bottom-quark induced processes, after the subtraction of the on-shell $tW$ channel, is largest for the doubly longitudinal polarization, being at the level of $9\%$ and $13\%$ (compared to the NLO value of the light-quark contribution, for integrated cross section) for two cut setups, with and without a jet veto, respectively. A bound of the $tW$ interference is calculated for various kinematic distributions, showing that this interference effect is, in general, smaller for the no jet veto case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an analysis of a number of approximations and methods used in numerical simulations of real-time Kadanoff-Baym equations based on truncations of the 2PI effective action. We compare the loop expansion to the 1/N expansion and compare their classical limit to classical-statistical simulations. We also compare implementations based on a space-time lattice discretization at the level of the action to an ad hoc momentum discretization at the level of the equations of motions. We extract some rules of thumb for performing 2PI-simulations of out-of-equilibrium systems.</description>

Abstract: A recent analysis of the LHCb data [Phys. Rev. D 105 (2022) L031503] obtained a sizable negative effective range for the $X(3872)$. This has attracted intensive discussions on whether $X(3872)$ can be deemed as a $D\bar{D}^*$ molecular state. This work explicitly demonstrates that the negative effective range of the $X(3872)$ does not contradict the molecular picture, adopting an effective field theory formulation of the $D\bar{D}^*$ interaction that can simultaneously reproduce the binding energy and effective range of the $X(3872)$. We elaborate on the implications of the large negative effective range of $X(3872)$ and the small binding energy on the underlying $D\bar{D}^*$ interaction. Such results are relevant for a better understanding of hadronic molecules and their binding mechanism.</description>

      <title>Structure of near-threshold resonances with new interpretation scheme of complex compositeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of near-threshold resonances is quantitatively studied with a new interpretation scheme using the complex compositeness. A difficulty was known in the understanding of the internal structure of unstable resonances because their complex compositeness is not an interpretable measure. To overcome this problem, we develop a new interpretation scheme respecting the ambiguous aspects of the identification of the internal structure of resonances. We then apply the interpretation scheme to the near-threshold resonances slightly above the threshold, described by the effective range expansion. With the new interpretation scheme, we show that near-threshold resonances are dominated by the non-molecular component. Namely, even in the near-threshold region, the nature of resonances is sharply contrasted with bound states whose internal structure is usually molecular dominant.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of charm mixing parameters and determination of the CKM angle $\gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated global analysis of beauty decays sensitive to the angle $\gamma$ of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix and of $D$-meson mixing data in the framework of approximate universality for charm mixing. We extract the fundamental theoretical parameters determining absorptive and dispersive contributions to $D$ meson mixing and CP violation, together with the angle $\gamma$. The results for the charm mixing parameters are $x_{12} \simeq x = (0.402 \pm 0.034)\%$ and $y_{12} \simeq y = (0.629 \pm 0.021)\%$, while the two CP-violating phases are given by $\varphi_2^M = (2.4 \pm 1.6)^{\Large \circ}$ and $\varphi_2^{\Gamma} = (2.6 \pm 1.2)^{\Large \circ}$. The angle $\gamma$ is found to be $\gamma = (68.4 \pm 2.6)^{\Large \circ}$.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Haloscopes as Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that dielectric haloscopes like MADMAX, originally designed for detecting axion dark matter, are also very promising gravitational wave detectors. Operated in resonant mode at frequencies around $\mathcal{O}(10\,\text{GHz})$, these detectors benefit from enhanced gravitational wave to photon conversion at the surfaces of a stack of thin dielectric disks. Since the gravitational wave is relativistic, there is an additional enhancement of the signal compared to the axion case due to increased conversion probability of gravitational waves to photons in the vacuum between the disks. A gravitational wave search using a dielectric haloscope imposes stringent requirements on the disk thickness and placement, but relaxed requirements on the disk smoothness. An advantage is the possibility of a broadband or hybrid resonant/broadband operation mode, which extends the frequency range down to $\mathcal{O}(100\,\text{MHz})$. We show that strain sensitivities down to $10^{-21} \text{Hz}^{-1/2} \times (10\,\text{GHz}/f)$ will be possible in the coming years for the broadband setup, while a resonant setup optimized for gravitational waves could even reach $3\times 10^{-23} \text{Hz}^{-1/2} \times (10\,\text{GHz}/f)$ with current technology.</description>

      <title>Exploring the nature of $Y(4230)$ and $Y(4360)$ in B decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vector charmonium states can be directly produced at the $e^+e^{-}$ annihilation process. Among them, $Y(4230)$ and $Y(4360)$ splitting from the previously discovered $Y(4260)$ are not easily arranged into the conventional charmonium spectrum, while the recent studies indicated that they have strong couplings to $D\bar{D}_1$ and $D^*\bar{D}_1$. In this work, we investigate the productions of $Y(4230)$ and $Y(4360)$ as the heavy quark spin symmetry doublet hadronic molecules of $D\bar{D}_1$ and $D^*\bar{D}_1$ in $B$ decays via the triangle diagram mechanism. In particular, we propose that the decay constants of $Y(4230)$ and $Y(4360)$ extracted in $B$ decays are helpful to clarify their nature.</description>

      <title>Cogenesis of visible and dark matter in a scotogenic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within a scotogenic neutrino mass model we explore the cogenesis of matter from the CP violating decay of a heavy $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd right handed neutrino that simultaneously populates the visible and a multipartite dark sector. The quantum of CP violation sets the baryon asymmetry in the visible sector driven by leptogenesis. The relic density of a sub-GeV scale freeze-in dark matter is generated by the late time decay of the next to lightest dark particle dynamically regulated by its interplay with the thermal scattering processes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenological analyses involve sequentially adding kaon physics observables at the projected final precision of their respective measurements to the global fit.
  More specifically, we consider three different scenarios with different sets of observables assumed at their final precisions. Beginning with \mbox{BR($K^+\rightarrow\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$)} and BR($K_L\rightarrow\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$), we sequentially add BR($K_L\rightarrow\pi^0 e\bar e$) and BR($K_L\rightarrow\pi^0 \mu\bar\mu$) to the global fit. The evolution of the result from one scenario to the next makes a strong case for the consideration of future measurement of BR($K_L\rightarrow\pi^0\ell\bar\ell$).</description>

      <title>Self-consistent prediction of gravitational waves from cosmological phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from cosmological phase transitions are novel probes of fundamental physics, making their precise calculation essential for revealing various mysteries of the early Universe. In this work we propose a framework that enables the consistent calculation of such gravitational waves sourced by sound waves. Starting from the Lagrangian, this framework integrates the calculation of the dynamics of first-order phase transitions in a self-consistent manner, eliminating various approximations typically introduced by conventional methods. At the heart of our approach is the congruous evaluation of the phase transition hydrodynamics that, at every step, is consistently informed by the Lagrangian. We demonstrate the application of our framework using the SM+$|H|^6$ model, deriving the corresponding gravitational wave spectrum. Our framework establishes a robust foundation for the precise prediction of gravitational waves from phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Interference effects in resonant di-Higgs production at the LHC in the Higgs singlet extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interference effects are well founded from the quantum mechanical viewpoint and in principle cannot be ignored in realistic studies of New Physics scenarios. In this work, we investigate the size of interference effects between resonant and non-resonant contributions to di-Higgs production in the singlet extension of the Standard Model where the additional heavy scalar provides a resonant channel of on-shell and off-shell di-Higgs production. We find these interference contributions to have a non-negligible effect on the cross-sections and differential distributions. In order to allow for an computationally efficient treatment of these effects via reweighting, we introduce a new tool utilizing a matrix-element reweighting method: HHReweighter. In addition to the broadly used invariant di-Higgs mass $m_{hh}$, we analyze the sensitivity of other kinematic variables to the interference term and propose to also use differential distributions in the Higgs transverse momentum $p_T^h$. Furthermore, we provide updates on the latest experimental and theoretical limits on the parameter space of the real singlet extension of the Standard Model Higgs sector.</description>

      <title>Predictions for photon-jet correlations at forward rapidities in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study for the first time jet-medium interactions in heavy-ion collisions with introduction of saturation and Sudakov effects with parameters tuned for upcoming forward calorimeter acceptances in experiments, in particular the ALICE FoCal detector. We focus on $\gamma +$jet correlations by taking into account in-medium parton evolution using the BDIM equation that describes jet interactions with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) combined with vacuum-like emissions (VLE). We systematically introduce the early time gluon saturation dynamics through the small-$x$ Improved Transverse Momentum Dependent factorization (ITMD). For our purpose, we use Monte Carlo programs KATIE and TMDICE to generate hard events and in-medium parton evolution, respectively. We present results of azimuthal correlations and nuclear modification ratios to gauge the impact of the gluon saturation effects at early time for the in-medium jet energy loss.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics from the S-matrix reloaded, with applications to QCD and the confining Flux Tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade and more, S-matrix-based calculational methods have experienced a resurgence, proving to be both an elegant and powerful tool for extracting physical quantities without the need for an underlying Lagrangian formulation. In this work, we critically review and further develop the formalism introduced by Dashen, Ma, and Bernstein, which connects the thermodynamics of relativistic systems to the information contained in their scattering amplitudes. As a demonstration, we revisit the computation of the QCD equation of state to leading order in the strong coupling, showcasing the advantages of this method over traditional Thermal Field Theory techniques. Additionally, we apply these tools to the effective theory of a long confining Flux Tube in D dimensions, analyzing thermal effects up to and including NNLO contributions. Our results are compared with those obtained using the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz method. We also discuss how these techniques enable the inclusion of non-universal effects in the study of Flux Tubes, while relying solely on the S-matrix as input.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we revisit $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation, also know as $E$-model, in the light of current CMB and LSS observations. The inflaton potential in the Einstein frame for this model contains a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential, which alters the predictions for the scalar and tensor power spectra of Starobinsky inflation. We obtain these power spectra numerically without using slow-roll approximation and perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on parameters $M$ and $\alpha$ from Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18) and other LSS observations. We consider general reheating scenario by varying the number of e-foldings during inflation, $N_{pivot}$, along with the other parameters. We find $\log_{10}\alpha = 0.0^{+1.6}_{-5.6}$, $\log_{10}M= -4.91^{+0.69}_{-2.7}$ and $N_{pivot} = 53.2^{+3.9}_{-5}$ with $95\%$ C. L.. This implies that the present CMB and LSS observations are insufficient to constrain the parameter $\alpha$. We also find that there is no correlation between $N_{pivot}$ and $\alpha$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss how to extract numerically the expected lowest quasi-normal mode (QNM) associated with the pressure anisotropy for a Bjorken flux evolution to equilibrium. This QNM was easily decoded subtracting the hydrodynamical attractors and was compared with other authors calculations. After evolutions with transients close to the expected lowest QNM the system goes to a tail (pure imaginary frequency) for late times. We analyze the relevance of Navier-Stokes, second order and Borel attractors at each stage of the evolution, which begins far-from-equilibrium and ends close to equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the factorization of the Sudakov form factor on the Coulomb branch of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in the near mass-shell limit. We unravel all pinch singularities of this observable making use of the Method of Regions. We find their operator content in terms of matrix elements of Wilson lines on semi-infinite and finite intervals for the jet and ultrasoft functions, respectively. However, naive factorization into these incoherent momentum components is broken at two-loop order by effects subleading in the parameter of dimensional regularization. To save the day, we perform an appropriate twisting of the functions involved as well as simultaneous finite scheme transformation of the 't Hooft coupling. Infrared physics of twisted jet and ultrasoft functions is governed by the octagon anomalous dimension, while the untwisted ultrasoft function possesses infrared evolution driven by an anomalous dimension different from the ubiquitous cusp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of memory burden on the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum arising from the Hawking evaporation of light primordial black holes (PBHs). By considering both rotating (Kerr) and non-rotating (Schwarzschild) PBHs, we demonstrate that the overproduction of primordial GWs from burdened PBHs could impose stringent constraints on the parameters governing backreaction effects. These constraints, derived from $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ measurements by Planck and prospective experiments such as CMB-S4 and CMB-HD, offer novel insights into the impact of memory burden on PBH dynamics.</description>

      <title>Induced Gravitational Waves probing Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter with Memory Burden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum evaporation of a black hole is conventionally studied semiclassically by assuming self-similarity of the black hole throughout the evaporation process. However, its validity was recently questioned, and the lifetime of a black hole is conjectured to be much extended by the memory burden effect. It gives rise to the possibility that the primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $10^{10}$ grams are the dark matter in the Universe. To probe such PBH dark matter, we study gravitational waves (GWs) induced by primordial curvature perturbations that produced the PBHs. We find $\Omega_\text{GW}(f_\text{peak})h^2 = 7 \times 10^{-9}$ with the peak frequency $f_\text{peak} = 1\times 10^{3} \, (M_\text{PBH}/(10^{10}\,\mathrm{g}))^{-1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}$, and the induced GWs associated with the PBH dark matter whose initial mass is greater than about $10^7$ grams can be tested by future observations such as Cosmic Explorer. Furthermore, the scenario can be in principle confirmed by detecting another GW signal from the mergers of PBHs, which leads to high-frequency GWs with $f_\text{peak} = 2 \times 10^{27}\, (M_\text{PBH, ini}/(10^{10}\, \mathrm{g}))^{-1} \, \mathrm{Hz} $. On the other hand, the induced GW signals stronger than expected would contradict the dark matter abundance and exclude the memory burden effect.</description>

      <title>Robust semi-parametric signal detection in particle physics with classifiers decorrelated via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searches of new signals in particle physics are usually done by training a supervised classifier to separate a signal model from the known Standard Model physics (also called the background model). However, even when the signal model is correct, systematic errors in the background model can influence supervised classifiers and might adversely affect the signal detection procedure. To tackle this problem, one approach is to use the (possibly misspecified) classifier only to perform a preliminary signal-enrichment step and then to carry out a bump hunt on the signal-rich sample using only the real experimental data. For this procedure to work, we need a classifier constrained to be decorrelated with one or more protected variables used for the signal detection step. We do this by considering an optimal transport map of the classifier output that makes it independent of the protected variable(s) for the background. We then fit a semi-parametric mixture model to the distribution of the protected variable after making cuts on the transformed classifier to detect the presence of a signal. We compare and contrast this decorrelation method with previous approaches, show that the decorrelation procedure is robust to moderate background misspecification, and analyse the power of the signal detection test as a function of the cut on the classifier.</description>

      <title>Towards few-body QCD on a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers are promising tools for the simulation of many-body systems, and among those, QCD stands out by its rich phenomenology. Every simulation starts with a codification, and here we succently review a newly developed compact encoding based on the identification between registers and particles; the quantum memory is divided into registers, and to each we associate a Hilbert space of dimension the number of degrees of freedom of the codified particles. In this way we gain an exponential compression over direct encodings for a low number of particles with many degrees of freedom. As an example we apply this encoding on a two-register memory and implement antisymmetrization and exponentiation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Dual Gravitational Wave Signatures of Instant Preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the instant preheating scenario efficient particle production occurs immediately following the period of inflationary expansion in the early Universe. We demonstrate that instant preheating predicts unique gravitational wave (GW) signals arising from two distinct origins. One source is the bremsstrahlung GWs produced through the decay of superheavy particles, an inevitable consequence of instant preheating. The other is GWs generated from the nonlinear dynamics of the inflaton and coupled scalar fields. Using numerical simulations, we show that the peak of the GW spectrum shifts depending on the coupling constants of the theory. The detection of these dual GW signatures, characteristic of instant preheating, provides novel opportunities for probing the dynamics of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Spin of Primordial Black Holes from Broad Power Spectrum: Radiation Dominated Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a study to obtain the initial spin or the nondimensional Kerr parameter $a_{*}$ of primordial black holes (PBHs) created during the radiation dominated phase of the universe from not only nearly monochromatic but also broad curvature power spectra. Motivated by inflation and first-order phase transitions, we consider a power law shape for the curvature perturbation. Although we can naturally neglect the contribution from the length scales smaller than the scale of interest, that from the larger scales may potentially be significant for a broad power spectrum, for which the spin is sensitive to the width of the power spectrum. So, we introduce a width parameter $r_{k}$, the ratio of the largest scale to the length of interest. We find that the root mean square of $a_{*}$ is largest for PBHs created from locally nearly scale invariant curvature power spectra with $r_{k} \sim 3.5$. The upper limit is $\sim 1\times 10^{-4}$ for $M=10^{17}-10^{23}$ g,
  $\sim 1.7\times 10^{-4}$ for $M=1-100 M_{\odot}$ and $\sim 2.5\times 10^{-3}$ even for an incredibly large mass of $M=10^{50}$ g.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1312.4791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first in a series of papers, in which we compute the third-order QCD corrections to top-antitop production near threshold in e+ e- collisions. The present paper provides a detailed outline of the strategy of computation in the framework of non-relativistic effective theory and the threshold expansion, applicable more generally to heavy-quark pair production near threshold. It summarizes matching coefficients and potentials relevant to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order and ends with the master formula for the computation of the third-order Green function. The master formula is evaluated in part II of the series.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the electron and muon neutrino and antineutrino double differential cross sections on carbon in the quasielastic as well as in the multinucleon and one pion production channels. By projecting them in the transferred momentum - transferred energy plane and in the neutrino energy - lepton scattering angle plane, as well as by performing simple considerations on the position of the quasielastic and Delta peaks and on their broadening, we explain the surprising dominance of the muon neutrino and antineutrino cross sections over the electron ones in particular kinematical conditions.</description>

      <title>Perturbative analysis of the three gluon vertex in different gauges at one-loop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a perturbative analysis of the three-gluon vertex for a kinematical symmetric configuration in dimension $n=4-2\epsilon$ and different covariant gauges.Our study can describe the form factors of the three gluon vertex in a wide range of momentum. We employ a momentum subtraction (MOM) scheme to define the renormalized vertex. We give an in-depth review of three commonly used vector basis for the vertex, and explicitly show the expressions to change from one basis to the other. Although our estimates are valid only in the perturbative regime, we extend our numerical predictions to the infrared domain and show that in $n=4$ some nonperturbative properties are qualitatively present already at perturbation theory. In particular, we find a critical gauge above which the leading form factor displays the so-called zero crossing. We contrast our findings to those of other models and observe a fairly good agreement.</description>

      <title>Symmetries for the 4HDM. II. Extensions by rephasing groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue classification of finite groups which can be used as symmetry group of the scalar sector of the four-Higgs-doublet model (4HDM). Our objective is to systematically construct non-abelian groups via the group extension procedure, starting from the abelian groups $A$ and their automorphism groups $\mathrm{Aut}(A)$. Previously, we considered all cyclic groups $A$ available for the 4HDM scalar sector. Here, we further develop the method and apply it to extensions by the remaining rephasing groups $A$, namely $A = \mathbb{Z_2}\times\mathbb{Z_2}$, $\mathbb{Z_4}\times \mathbb{Z_2}$, and $\mathbb{Z_2}\times \mathbb{Z_2}\times \mathbb{Z_2}$. As $\mathrm{Aut}(A)$ grows, the procedure becomes more laborious, but we prove an isomorphism theorem which helps classify all the options. We also comment on what remains to be done to complete the classification of all finite non-abelian groups realizable in the 4HDM scalar sector without accidental continuous symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to measure the energy correlator in quarkonium production, which tracks the energy deposited in the calorimeter $\chi$-angular distance away from the identified quarkonium. The observable eliminates the need for jets while sustaining the perturbative predictive power. Analyzing the power correction to the energy correlator, we demonstrate the novel observable supplies a unique gateway to probing the hadronization, especially when $\cos\chi\gtrsim 0$ in the quarkonium rest frame where the perturbative emissions are depleted due to the dead-cone effects. We expect the quarkonium energy correlator to add a new dimension to quarkonium studies.</description>

      <title>Pionic transitions of the spin-2 partner of $X(3872)$ to $\chi_{cJ}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the pionic transitions between the $X_2$ [spin-2 partner of the $X(3872)$] and $\chi_{c1,2}$ using a nonrelativistic effective field theory. The $X_2$ is assumed to be a bound state of the $D^{*}$ and $\bar{D}^*$ mesons and to decay through several kinds of loops, including the bubble, triangle and box loops. Within the present model, the widths for the single-pion decays $X_2\to\pi^0\chi_{cJ}$ are predicted to be about $3$--$30$ keV. For the dipion decays, the widths are a few keVs. These widths yield a branching fraction of $10^{-3}$--$10^{-2}$. The ratio $R_{\mathrm{c}0}=\Gamma (X_2\to\pi^+\pi^-\chi_{cJ})/\Gamma (X_2\to\pi^0\pi^0\chi_{cJ}) \simeq 1.6$, which is a bit smaller than the expected value of $2$, and $R_{21}=\Gamma (X_2\to\pi\pi\chi_{c2})/\Gamma (X_2\to\pi\pi\chi_{c1}) \simeq 0.85$. These ratios are nearly independent of the $X_2$ mass and the coupling constants, which might be a good quantity for the experiments. Moreover, the invariant mass spectra of the $\pi^0\chi_{cJ}$ final state for the dipion processes are presented, showing a cusp structure at the $D {\bar D}^*$ threshold enhanced and narrowed by the nearby triangle singularity.</description>

Abstract: Using the one-boson-exchange model, we investigate the interactions between the doubly charmed baryon $\Xi_{cc}(3621)$ and the $S-$wave (anti-)kaon accounting for the $S-D$ wave mixing and coupled-channel effects. We find the coupled $\Xi_{cc}K/\Xi_{cc}K^*$ state with $I(J^P)=0(1/2^-)$, the $\Xi_{cc}K^*$ state with $0(1/2^-)$, the $\Xi_{cc}\bar{K}$ state with $0(1/2^-)$, and the $\Xi_{cc}\bar{K}^*$ states with $0(1/2^-,3/2^-)$ can be recommended as good doubly charmed molecular candidates with strangeness $|S|=1$. We further examine their M1 radiative decay behaviors and magnetic moments within the constituent quark model framework. This information can enhance our understanding of their inner structures, including the distribution of electric charge and the orientation of the constituent quarks' spins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy lepton singlets $N$ slightly mixed with a standard neutrino $\nu_\ell$ are usually searched for at the LHC in the trilepton plus $p_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}$ channel: $pp \to W^+ \to \ell^+ N$ with $N\to \ell^- W^+ \to \ell^- \ell'^+ \nu$. We show that, although the longitudinal momentum of the final $\nu$ escapes detection, the mass of the heavy lepton can be reconstructed. This possibility has been overlooked in recent LHC searches. For $m_N\approx 90$--$130$ GeV and the current luminosity (138 fb$^{-1}$ at 13 TeV), we estimate that the reconstruction could set bounds on $|V_{\ell N}|^2$ around $4\times 10^{-4}$, versus the $2\times 10^{-3}$ limit obtained at CMS or $|V_{\ell N}|^2&lt; 10^{-3}$ from flavor and electroweak precision data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the dense environment, neutron stars (NSs) can serve as an ideal laboratory for studying the interactions between dark matter (DM) and ordinary matter. In the process of DM capture, deep inelastic scattering may dominate over elastic scattering, especially for the DM with a large momentum transfer. In this work, we calculate DM-nucleon deep inelastic scattering via a vector mediator and estimate its contribution to the capture rate. Using the surface temperature of the NSs, we derive the exclusion limits for the DM-nucleon scattering cross section in the mass range, $1~{\rm GeV}&lt;m_{\chi}&lt; 10^{5}~{\rm GeV}$. We find the bounds for DM with the mass $\gtrsim$ 1 GeV can be changed several times after including the deep inelastic scattering contribution.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper [1], we proposed that the quantum states of black hole responsible for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy are given by Bell states of Fermi quanta in the interior of black hole. In this paper, we include the effect of tunneling on these entangled states and show that partial tunneling of these Bell states of Fermi quanta give rises to the Page curve of Hawking radiation. We also show that the entirety of information initially stored in the black hole is returned to the outside via the Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Vertex Reconstruction with MaskFormers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-energy particle collisions, the reconstruction of secondary vertices from heavy-flavour hadron decays is crucial for identifying and studying jets initiated by $b$- or $c$-quarks. Traditional methods, while effective, require extensive manual optimisation and struggle to perform consistently across wide regions of phase space. Meanwhile, recent advancements in machine learning have improved performance but are unable to fully reconstruct multiple vertices. In this work we propose a novel approach to secondary vertex reconstruction based on recent advancements in object detection and computer vision. Our method directly predicts the presence and properties of an arbitrary number of vertices in a single model. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing techniques. Applied to simulated proton-proton collision events, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in vertex finding efficiency, achieving a 10% improvement over an existing state-of-the-art method. Moreover, it enables vertex fitting, providing accurate estimates of key vertex properties such as transverse momentum, radial flight distance, and angular displacement from the jet axis. When integrated into a flavour tagging pipeline, our method yields a 50% improvement in light-jet rejection and a 15% improvement in $c$-jet rejection at a $b$-jet selection efficiency of 70%. These results demonstrate the potential of adapting advanced object detection techniques for particle physics, and pave the way for more powerful and flexible reconstruction tools in high-energy physics experiments.</description>

Abstract: We study the decoherence of a system of $N$ non-interacting heavy particles (atoms) due to coherent scattering with a background gas. We introduce a framework for computing the induced phase shift and loss of contrast for arbitrary preparations of $N$-particle quantum states. We find phase shifts that are inherently $(N\geq 2)$-body effects and may be searched for in future experiments. We analyze simple setups, including a two-mode approximation of an interferometer. We study fully entangled $N00N$ states, which resemble the correlated positions in a matter interferometer, as well as totally uncorrelated product states that are representative of a typical state in an atom interferometer. We find that the extent to which coherent enhancements increase the rate of decoherence depends on the observable of interest, state preparation, and details of the experimental design. In the context of future ultralow-recoil (e.g., light dark matter) searches with atom interferometers we conclude that: {\it i}) there exists a coherently enhanced scattering phase which can be searched for using standard (i.e., contrast/visibility and phase) interferometer observables; {\it ii}) although decoherence rates of one-body observables are {\it not} coherently enhanced, a coherently enhanced loss of contrast can still arise from dephasing; and {\it iii}) higher statistical moments (which are immediately accessible in a counting experiment) {\it are} coherently enhanced and may offer a new tool with which to probe the soft scattering of otherwise undetectable particles in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors: constraints on single field inflation from BOSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbative, or effective field theory (EFT)-based, full-shape analyses of galaxy clustering data involve ``nuisance parameters'' to capture various observational effects such as the galaxy-dark matter connection (galaxy bias). We present an efficient approach to set informative physically motivated priors on these parameters. We extract these priors from simulated galaxy catalogs based on halo occupation distribution (HOD) models. First, we build a joint distribution between EFT galaxy bias and HOD parameters from a set of 10,500 HOD mock catalogs. We use the field level EFT technique that allows for cosmic variance cancellation, enabling a precision calibration of EFT parameters from computationally inexpensive small-volume simulations. Second, we use neural density estimators -- normalizing flows -- to model the marginal probability density of the EFT parameters, which can be used as a prior distribution in full shape analyses. As a first application, we use our HOD-based priors in a new analysis of galaxy power spectra and bispectra from the BOSS survey in the context of single field primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that our priors lead to a reduction of the posterior volume of bias parameters by an order of magnitude. We also find $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil} = 320\pm 300$ and $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm ortho} = 100\pm 130$ (at 68\% CL) in a combined two-template analysis, representing a $\approx 40\%$ improvement in constraints on single field primordial non-Gaussianity, equivalent to doubling the survey volume.</description>

      <title>The radiative decay of scalar glueball from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01564v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform the first lattice QCD study on the radiative decay of the scalar glueball to the vector meson $\phi$ in the quenched approximation. The calculations are carried out on three gauge ensembles with different lattice spacings, which enable us to do the continuum extrapolation. We first revisit the radiative $J/\psi$ decay into the scalar glueball $G$ and obtain the partial decay width $\Gamma(J/\psi \to \gamma G)=0.578(86)~\text{keV}$ and the branching fraction $\text{Br}(J/\psi \to \gamma G) = 6.2(9)\times 10^{-3}$. We then extend the similar calculation to the process $G\to \gamma \phi$ and get the partial decay width $\Gamma(G \to \gamma \phi)= 0.074(47)~\text{keV}$, which implies that the combined branching fraction of $J/\psi\to\gamma G\to \gamma\gamma\phi$ is as small as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-9})$ such that this process is hardly detected by the BESIII experiment even with the large $J/\psi$ sample of $\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$. With the vector meson dominance model, the two-photon decay width of the scalar glueball is estimated to be $\Gamma(G\to\gamma\gamma)=0.53(46)~\text{eV}$, which results in a large stickiness $S(G)\sim \mathcal{O}(10^4)$ of the scalar glueball by assuming the stickiness of $f_2(1270)$ to be one.</description>

      <title>Exploring Dark Forces with Multimessenger Studies of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exploration of dark sector interactions via gravitational waves (GWs) from binary inspirals has been a subject of recent interest. We study dark forces using extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), pointing out two issues of interest. Firstly, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the EMRI, which sets the characteristic length scale of the system and hence the dark force range to which it exhibits enhanced sensitivity, probes force mediator masses that complement those studied with supermassive black hole (SMBH) or neutron star binaries. The LISA mission (the proposed $\mu$Ares detector) will probe mediators with masses $m_V \sim 10^{-16}~{\rm eV}$ ($m_V \sim 10^{-18}~{\rm eV}$), corresponding to ISCOs of $10^6 M_\odot$ ($10^8 M_\odot$) central SMBHs. Secondly, while the sensitivity to dark couplings is typically limited by the uncertainty in the binary component masses, independent mass measurements of the central SMBH through reverberation mapping campaigns or the motion of dynamical tracers enable one to break this degeneracy. Our results, therefore, highlight the necessity for coordinated studies, loosely referred to as "multimessenger", between future $\mu{\rm Hz}-{\rm mHz}$ GW observatories and ongoing and forthcoming SMBH mass measurement campaigns, including OzDES-RM, SDSS-RM, and SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper.</description>
