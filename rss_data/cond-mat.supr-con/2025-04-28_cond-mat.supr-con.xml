      <title>Eliashberg theory prediction of critical currents in superconducting thin films under DC electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting thin metallic films, functioning as supercurrent gate-tunable transistors, have considerable potential for future quantum electronic devices. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive microscopic quantitative mechanism that elucidates the control or suppression of supercurrents in thin films remains elusive. Focusing on NbN, a prototypical material, and starting from a phenomenological ansatz that links the critical electric field with the kinetic energy parameter needed to break Cooper pairs, we provide a quantitative analysis of the critical current using Eliashberg theory in the dirty limit without adjustable parameters. The critical kinetic energy value is identified, corresponding to the maximum supercurrent that can flow in the thin film. The peak in supercurrent density as a function of the Cooper pairs' kinetic energy arises from the interplay between the increase in supercurrent due to increased kinetic energy and the depairing effect when the kinetic energy becomes sufficiently large. The critical value of the pair's kinetic energy is subsequently employed to estimate the critical value of an external electric field required to suppress superconductivity in the sample. This estimation is in parameter-free agreement with the experimental observations. Although the disorder reduces the temperature dependence of the gating effect on the critical current, at the same time, it increases the unscreened critical electric field needed to suppress superconductivity. This enables the proposal of methods to control and reduce the critical field value necessary to suppress superconductivity in superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Stability and Response of Vortex Solid Formed in Second Landau Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical properties of the vortex solid phase formed in the second Landau level (2LL), which may be stabilized by strong paramagnetic pairbreaking (PPB), are examined in type II limit with no magnetic screening. First, it is shown that the spectrum of the low energy mode of this vortex solid has the same form as that of the conventional vortex solid in the first (i.e., the lowest) Landau level. Using this result, the melting line of the 2LL vortex solid is examined according to the Lindemann criterion. In contrast to the properties in equlibrium, the electromagnetic response of this vortex solid is quite unusual: Reflecting the presence of antivortices supporting the stability of the lattice structure, the superfluid stiffness measuring the response for a current perpendicular to the magnetic field is found to be nonvanishing, and its sign depends upon the applied current direction. Consequences of this response property are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnetic RGaGe (R = Nd, Gd) single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetallic candidate family RTX (R = rare-earth element, T= poor metal, X = Si and Ge) has recently attracted significant attention due to its exotic quantum states and potential applications in quantum devices. In this study, our comprehensive investigations of high-quality NdGaGe and GdGaGe single crystals reveal distinct magnetic and electrical responses. Both compounds exhibit antiferromagnetic transitions with TN - 7.6 K and 22.4 K for NdGaGe and GdGaGe, respectively. NdGaGe exhibits strong magnetic anisotropy (\c{hi}c /\c{hi}a - 70). In contrast, GdGaGe displays weak magnetic anisotropic behavior (\c{hi}c /\c{hi}a - 1) with a distinctive spin-flop transition. Below TN, NdGaGe shows significant negative magnetoresistance due to the reduced spin-disorder scattering arising from the field-induced spin alignment. GdGaGe exhibits more complex magnetoresistance behavior: positive values at low fields transitioning to negative values attributed to the reduced spin-flop scattering. Specially, NdGaGe demonstrates a large anomalous Hall conductance (AHC) of approximately 368 {\Omega}-1 cm-1, which is dominated by the intrinsic mechanism. These reveal the pivotal role of rare-earth elements in modulating the electronic structure, magnetic properties, and transport characteristics of the RGaGe system, thereby providing valuable insights for developing next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>The possible frustrated superconductivity in the kagome superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric frustration has long been a subject of enduring interest in condensed matter physics. While geometric frustration traditionally focuses on magnetic systems, little attention is paid to the "frustrated superconductivity" which could arise when the superconducting interaction conflicts with the crystal symmetry. The recently discovered kagome superconductors provide a particular opportunity for studying this due to the fact that the frustrated lattice structure and the interference effect between the three sublattices can facilitate the frustrated superconducting interaction. Here, we propose a theory that supports the frustrated superconducting state, derived from the on-site $s$-wave superconducting pairing in conjunction with the nearest-neighbor pairings hoping and the unique geometrical frustrated lattice structure. In this state, whereas the mutual $2\pi/3$ difference of the superconducting pairing phase causes the six-fold modulation of the amplitude and breaks the time-reversal symmetry with $4\pi$ phase changes of the superconducting pairing as one following it around the Fermi surface, it is immune to the impurities without the impurity-induced in-gap states and produces the pronounced Hebel-Slichter peak of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate below $T_{c}$. Notably, the theory also reveals a disorder-induced superconducting pairing transition from the frustrated superconducting state to an isotropic $s$-wave superconducting state without traversing the nodal points, recovering and explaining the behavior found in experiment. This study not only serves as a promising proposal to mediate the divergent or seemingly contradictory experimental outcomes regarding superconducting pairing symmetry, but may also pave the way for advancing investigations into the frustrated superconducting state.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Superconductivity and Mott Physics in Organic Charge Transfer Materials"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Menke et al. recently claimed that superconductivity (SC) in the $\kappa$-phase organic charge-transfer solids (CTS) can be understood within the two-dimensional half-filled anisotropic triangular-lattice Hubbard model. Experimentally, $\kappa$-CTS are mostly but not always antiferromagnetic (AFM) at ambient pressure and SC appears under pressure. In apparent agreement with this observation, Menke et al. found AFM ground states for small $t/U$ and SC over a small region at the interface of AFM and Fermi liquid ground states with increasing $t/U$ at fixed $t'/t$, where $U$ is the Hubbard repulsion. Menke et al's computational results directly contradict those obtained using exact diagonalization and Path Integral Renormalization Group approaches. It is clearly of interest to determine the origin of this discrepancy, especially in view of the facts that (a) related arguments continue to persist in the context of cuprate SC superconductivity (which however involves doping), and (b) there exist CTS in which SC is not proximate to AFM, but is separated by an intermediate charge-disproportionated phase. Here we show that Menke et al's conclusion regarding SC is incorrect and originates from a flawed assumption.</description>

      <title>Orientation- and pressure-dependence of the vibrational response of a monolayer crystal on a vicinal diamond surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate polarization-dependent Raman spectra of a monolayer crystal of WS2 on the (100) and (230) surfaces of diamond. At ambient pressure, identical polarization dependence of the Raman spectra is observed on the different surfaces, independent of the orientation of the monolayer crystal relative to the diamond crystal. However, when monolayer WS2 is compressed to about 4 GPa, an abrupt drop of the intensity of the 2LA mode relative to the A' mode occurs on the (100) surface and the (230) surface with the zigzag direction along the atomic step edges of the (230) surface. In contrast, no such drop is observed when the armchair direction is along or at 15{\deg} to the atomic steps of the (230) surface. We also observe a shift of the polarization angle of the intensity maxima of the 2LA and A' modes on (230) surface during compression. These results demonstrate that the atomic steps of a vicinal surface strongly modify the vibrational response under high pressure.</description>

Abstract: We report on a study of the interplay between the supercurrent and spin-polarization in a two-dimensional superconducting system in the presence of a d-wave symmetric antiferromagnetic exchange interaction (altermagnetism). It is demonstrated that the supercurrent exhibits a transverse contribution in the presence of both constant and momentum-dependent exchange interactions. We also discuss the analog of the Edelstein effect for such magnetic material, showing that the induced spin polarization is quadratic in the supercurrent and d-wave symmetric.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics in itinerant antiferromagnet SrCr$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SrCr$_2$As$_2$ is an itinerant antiferromagnet in the same structural family as the SrFe$_2$As$_2$ high-temperature superconductors. We report our calculations of exchange-coupling parameters $J_{ij}$ for SrCr$_2$As$_2$ using a static linear-response method based on first-principles electronic-structure calculations. We find that the dominant nearest-neighbor exchange coupling $J_{\rm{1}} &gt; 0$ is antiferromagnetic whereas the next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_{\rm{2}} &lt; 0$ is ferromagnetic with $J_{\rm{2}}$/$J_{\rm{1}}$~=~$-0.68$, reinforcing the checkerboard in-plane magnetic structure. Thus, unlike other transition-metal arsenides based on Mn, Fe, or Co, we find no competing magnetic interactions in SrCr$_2$As$_2$, which aligns with experimental findings. Moreover, the orbital resolution of exchange interactions shows that $J_1$ and $J_2$ are dominated by direct exchange mediated by the Cr $d$ orbitals. To validate the calculations we conduct inelastic neutron-scattering measurements on powder samples that show steeply dispersive magnetic excitations arising from the magnetic $\Gamma$ points and persisting up to energies of at least 175 meV. The spin-wave spectra are then modeled using the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with the theoretically-calculated exchange couplings. The calculated neutron-scattering spectra are in good agreement with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent flow in inhomogeneous superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how the supercurrent flow pattern is altered by inhomogeneities in superconducting films. Working in the vicinity of the critical temperature and assuming a model of short-range disorder in the quadratic term of the Ginzburg-Landau functional, we develop a perturbation theory in the inhomogeneity strength. Absorbing the ultraviolet divergences into the renormalization of the critical temperature, we arrive at a well-defined theory governed by large-scale physics. In the presence of inhomogeneities, the correlation functions of the order parameter and supercurrent exhibit a long-range power-law behavior, which can be attributed to the mixing of the amplitude and phase modes. The fluctuation magnitude grows with increasing the average current, and the system becomes strongly inhomogeneous near the critical current. An inhomogeneous superflow will generate a random magnetic field, whose magnitude in thin NbN films can be comparable to Earth's magnetic field. We discuss the feasibility of detecting it using the SQUID-on-tip technique.</description>

      <title>Effect of 2$^\text{nd}$ harmonic current--phase relation on a behavior of a Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the behavior of a Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier assuming a current-phase relation with a second--harmonic contribution. We find that varying the weight of harmonic terms in the Josephson current affects the gain profile. The analysis of gain characteristics, phase-space portraits, Poincar\'e sections, and Fourier spectra demonstrates that the nonsinusoidal contribution influences the operating mode and stability of the device. In particular, we identify the optimal weighting of harmonic contributions that maximizes amplification, achieving gains up to $\sim 13\;\text{dB}$ in a device without dispersion engineering.</description>

      <title>In-plane Ising superconductivity revealed by exchange interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19599v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing states and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We observed an unusual in-plane Ising like uniaxial anisotropy in the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic. This anisotropy is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. The interactions between the uniaxial spin texture and the magnetic overlayer offer new ways to explore the interplay between magnetism and 2D superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Fluctuated lattice-driven charge density wave far above the condensation temperature in kagome superconductor KV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kagome material AV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits multiple exotic orders, including an unconventional charge density wave (CDW). Elucidating the underlying mechanism behind the CDW transition is crucial for unraveling the complex interactions among these phases. However, the driving force of the CDW remains a topic of debate due to the intertwined interactions among the system's various excitations. Here we investigated the CDW transition in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by isolating the ultrafast electronic phase transition using time- and angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. An ultrafast electronic phase transition was observed at a critical photoexcitation fluence, F$_c$, without reduction in CDW lattice-distortion-induced band folding. This folded band persisted up to 150 K under equilibrium heating, well above the CDW condensation temperature of T$_c$ = 78 K. Notably, the pump-induced band shifts at F$_c$ were comparable to those caused by thermal effects at T$_c$. These findings suggest that in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, a fluctuating lattice-driven in-plane CDW emerges above 150 K, with out-of-plane electronic correlations leading to the $2\times2 \times 2$ CDW near T$_c$, offering key insights into the interplay between the electronic and structural dynamics in AV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>
