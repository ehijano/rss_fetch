      <title>Average-Case Hardness of Parity Problems: Orthogonal Vectors, k-SUM and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes conditional lower bounds for average-case {\em parity}-counting versions of the problems $k$-XOR, $k$-SUM, and $k$-OV. The main contribution is a set of self-reductions for the problems, providing the first specific distributions, for which:
  $\mathsf{parity}\text{-}k\text{-}OV$ is $n^{\Omega(\sqrt{k})}$ average-case hard, under the $k$-OV hypothesis (and hence under SETH),
  $\mathsf{parity}\text{-}k\text{-}SUM$ is $n^{\Omega(\sqrt{k})}$ average-case hard, under the $k$-SUM hypothesis, and
  $\mathsf{parity}\text{-}k\text{-}XOR$ is $n^{\Omega(\sqrt{k})}$ average-case hard, under the $k$-XOR hypothesis.
  Under the very believable hypothesis that at least one of the $k$-OV, $k$-SUM, $k$-XOR or $k$-Clique hypotheses is true, we show that parity-$k$-XOR, parity-$k$-SUM, and parity-$k$-OV all require at least $n^{\Omega(k^{1/3})}$ (and sometimes even more) time on average (for specific distributions).
  To achieve these results, we present a novel and improved framework for worst-case to average-case fine-grained reductions, building on the work of Dalirooyfard, Lincoln, and Vassilevska Williams, FOCS 2020.</description>

      <title>The moment polytope of matrix multiplication is not maximal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moment polytopes of tensors, the study of which is deeply rooted in invariant theory, representation theory and symplectic geometry, have found relevance in numerous places, from quantum information (entanglement polytopes) and algebraic complexity theory (GCT program and the complexity of matrix multiplication) to optimization (scaling algorithms). Towards an open problem in algebraic complexity theory, we prove separations between the moment polytopes of matrix multiplication tensors and unit tensors. As a consequence, we find that matrix multiplication moment polytopes are not maximal, i.e. are strictly contained in the corresponding Kronecker polytope. As another consequence, we obtain a no-go result for a natural operational characterization of moment polytope inclusion in terms of asymptotic restriction. We generalize the separation and non-maximality to moment polytopes of iterated matrix multiplication tensors. Our result implies that tensor networks where multipartite entanglement structures beyond two-party entanglement are allowed can go beyond projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) in terms of expressivity.
  Our proof characterizes membership of uniform points in moment polytopes of tensors, and establishes a connection to polynomial multiplication tensors via the minrank of matrix subspaces. As a result of independent interest, we extend these techniques to obtain a new proof of the optimal border subrank bound for matrix multiplication.</description>

      <title>Randomized $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ Bellman-Ford from Fineman and the Boilermakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical algorithm by Bellman and Ford from the 1950's computes shortest paths in weighted graphs on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges with possibly negative weights in $O(mn)$ time. Indeed, this algorithm is taught regularly in undergraduate Algorithms courses.
  In 2023, after nearly 70 years, Fineman \cite{fineman2024single} developed an $\tilde{O}(m n^{8/9})$ expected time algorithm for this problem. Huang, Jin and Quanrud improved on Fineman's startling breakthrough by providing an $\tilde{O}(m n^{4/5} )$ time algorithm.
  This paper builds on ideas from those results to produce an $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ expected time algorithm. The simple observation that distances can be updated with respect to the reduced costs for a price function in linear time is key to the improvement. This almost immediately improves the previous work. To produce the final bound, this paper provides recursive versions of Fineman's structures.</description>

      <title>Explicit non-free tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free tensors are tensors which, after a change of bases, have free support: any two distinct elements of its support differ in at least two coordinates. They play a distinguished role in the theory of bilinear complexity, in particular in Strassen's duality theory for asymptotic rank. Within the context of quantum information theory, where tensors are interpreted as multiparticle quantum states, freeness corresponds to a type of multiparticle Schmidt decomposition. In particular, if a state is free in a given basis, the reduced density matrices are diagonal. Although generic tensors in $\mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n$ are non-free for $n \geq 4$ by parameter counting, no explicit non-free tensors were known until now. We solve this hay in a haystack problem by constructing explicit tensors that are non-free for every $n \geq 3$. In particular, this establishes that non-free tensors exist in $\mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n$, where they are not generic.
  To establish non-freeness, we use results from geometric invariant theory and the theory of moment polytopes. In particular, we show that if a tensor $T$ is free, then there is a tensor $S$ in the GL-orbit closure of $T$, whose support is free and whose moment map image is the minimum-norm point of the moment polytope of $T$. This implies a reduction for checking non-freeness from arbitrary basis changes of $T$ to unitary basis changes of $S$. The unitary equivariance of the moment map can then be combined with the fact that tensors with free support have diagonal moment map image, in order to further restrict the set of relevant basis changes.</description>

      <title>Query-Efficient Fixpoints of $\ell_p$-Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that an $\epsilon$-approximate fixpoint of a map $f:[0,1]^d\rightarrow [0,1]^d$ can be found with $\mathcal{O}(d^2(\log\frac{1}{\epsilon} + \log\frac{1}{1-\lambda}))$ queries to $f$ if $f$ is $\lambda$-contracting with respect to an $\ell_p$-metric for some $p\in [1,\infty)\cup\{\infty\}$. This generalizes a recent result of Chen, Li, and Yannakakis [STOC'24] from the $\ell_\infty$-case to all $\ell_p$-metrics. Previously, all query upper bounds for $p\in [1,\infty) \setminus \{2\}$ were either exponential in $d$, $\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}$, or $\log\frac{1}{1-\lambda}$.
  Chen, Li, and Yannakakis also show how to ensure that all queries to $f$ lie on a discrete grid of limited granularity in the $\ell_\infty$-case. We provide such a rounding for the $\ell_1$-case, placing an appropriately defined version of the $\ell_1$-case in $\textsf{FP}^{dt}$.
  To prove our results, we introduce the notion of $\ell_p$-halfspaces and generalize the classical centerpoint theorem from discrete geometry: for any $p \in [1, \infty) \cup \{\infty\}$ and any mass distribution (or point set), we prove that there exists a centerpoint $c$ such that every $\ell_p$-halfspace defined by $c$ and a normal vector contains at least a $\frac{1}{d+1}$-fraction of the mass (or points).</description>

      <title>Optimal Trickle-Down Theorems for Path Complexes via C-Lorentzian Polynomials with Applications to Sampling and Log-Concave Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a $d$-partite $d$-dimensional simplicial complex with parts $T_1,\dots,T_d$ and let $\mu$ be a distribution on the facets of $X$. Informally, we say $(X,\mu)$ is a path complex if for any $i&lt;j&lt;k$ and $F \in T_i,G \in T_j, K\in T_k$, we have $\mathbb{P}_\mu[F,K | G]=\mathbb{P}_\mu[F|G]\cdot\mathbb{P}_\mu[K|G].$ We develop a new machinery with $\mathcal{C}$-Lorentzian polynomials to show that if all links of $X$ of co-dimension 2 have spectral expansion at most $1/2$, then $X$ is a $1/2$-local spectral expander. We then prove that one can derive fast-mixing results and log-concavity statements for top-link spectral expanders.
  We use our machinery to prove fast mixing results for sampling maximal flags of flats of distributive lattices (a.k.a. linear extensions of posets) subject to external fields, and to sample maximal flags of flats of "typical" modular lattices. We also use it to re-prove the Heron-Rota-Welsh conjecture and to prove a conjecture of Chan and Pak which gives a generalization of Stanley's log-concavity theorem. Lastly, we use it to prove near optimal trickle-down theorems for "sparse complexes" such as constructions by Lubotzky-Samuels-Vishne, Kaufman-Oppenheim, and O'Donnell-Pratt.</description>
