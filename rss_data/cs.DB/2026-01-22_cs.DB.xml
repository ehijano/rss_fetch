      <title>Trajectory-Driven Multi-Product Influence Maximization in Billboard Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Billboard Advertising has emerged as an effective out-of-home advertising technique, where the goal is to select a limited number of slots and play advertisement content there, with the hope that it will be observed by many people and, effectively, a significant number of them will be influenced towards the brand. Given a trajectory and a billboard database and a positive integer $k$, how can we select $k$ highly influential slots to maximize influence? In this paper, we study a variant of this problem where a commercial house wants to make a promotion of multiple products, and there is an influence demand for each product. We have studied two variants of the problem. In the first variant, our goal is to select $k$ slots such that the respective influence demand of each product is satisfied. In the other variant of the problem, we are given with $\ell$ integers $k_1,k_2, \ldots, k_{\ell}$, the goal here is to search for $\ell$ many set of slots $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_{\ell}$ such that for all $i \in [\ell]$, $|S_{i}| \leq k_i$ and for all $i \neq j$, $S_i \cap S_j=\emptyset$ and the influence demand of each of the products gets satisfied. We model the first variant of the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and the second variant as its generalization. To solve the common-slot variant, we formulate the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and design a bi-criteria approximation algorithm based on the continuous greedy framework and randomized rounding. For the disjoint-slot variant, we proposed a sampling-based approximation approach along with an efficient primal-dual greedy algorithm that enforces disjointness naturally. Extensive experiments with real-world trajectory and billboard datasets highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution approaches.</description>

      <title>Arguing conformance with data protection principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how conformance arguments can be used by organisations to substantiate claims of conformance to data protection principles. Use of conformance arguments can improve the rigour and consistency with which these organisations, supervisory authorities, certification bodies and data subjects can assess the truth of these claims.</description>

      <title>P-MOSS: Scheduling Main-Memory Indexes Over NUMA Servers Using Next Token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ever since the Dennard scaling broke down in the early 2000s and the frequency of the CPUs stalled, vendors have started to increase the core count in each CPU chip at the expense of introducing heterogeneity, thus ushering the era of NUMA and Chiplet processors. Since then, the heterogeneity in the design space of hardware has only increased to the point that DBMS performance may vary significantly up to an order of magnitude in modern servers. An important factor that affects performance includes the location of the logical cores where the DBMS queries execute, and the location where the data resides. This paper introduces P-MOSS, a learned spatial scheduling framework that schedules query execution to specific logical cores, and co-locates data on the corresponding NUMA node. For cross-hardware and workload adaptability, P-MOSS leverages core principles from Large Language Models, such as Next Token prediction, Generative Pre-training, and Fine-tuning. In the spirit of hardware-software synergy, P-MOSS guides its scheduling decision solely based on the low-level hardware statistics collected from the hardware Performance Monitoring Unit with the aid of a Decision Transformer. Experimental evaluation is performed in the context of the B$^+$-Tree index. Performance results demonstrate that P-MOSS offers an improvement of up to $6\times$ over traditional schedules in terms of query throughput.</description>

      <title>Language-Native Materials Processing Design by Lightly Structured Text Database and Reasoning Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials synthesis procedures are predominantly documented as narrative text in protocols and lab notebooks, rendering them inaccessible to conventional structured data optimization. This language-native nature poses a critical challenge for complex, multistage processes--such as the preparation of boron nitride nanosheet (BNNS)--where outcomes depend on path-dependent choices in exfoliation and functionalization. Here, we recast synthesis planning as a text reasoning task enabled by a lightly structured text database, which preserves the conditional logic and causal contexts essential for expert-like decision-making. Building on a heterogeneous schema that indexes both narrative excerpts and computable entities (e.g., reaction conditions), our system implements a hybrid retrieval engine to combine semantic context with precise parameter filtering. On top of this, the framework operates in two modes, i.e. retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which grounds recommendations in retrieved evidence modules, and experience-augmented reasoning (EAR), which uses iteratively refined text guides distilled from multi-source narrative data. Instead of suggesting single "optimal" settings, the system produces interpretable guidance aligned with expert reasoning patterns--hypotheses, parameter ranges, and citation-backed standard operating procedures--that support iterative planning and failure diagnosis. We validated this framework on the targeted exfoliation of BNNS, a process highly sensitive to multivariate constraints. The system successfully identified optimal combinations of grinding aids, milling configurations, and separation strategies from a wide range of literature-reported methods, which were experimentally verified to yield high-quality nanosheets, illustrating the potential of language-native reasoning to streamline critical operations in materials processing.</description>

      <title>SAQ: Pushing the Limits of Vector Quantization through Code Adjustment and Dimension Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) plays a critical role in applications such as search engines, recommender systems, and RAG for LLMs. Vector quantization (VQ), a crucial technique for ANNS, is commonly used to reduce space overhead and accelerate distance computations. However, despite significant research advances, state-of-the-art VQ methods still face challenges in balancing encoding efficiency and quantization accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VQ method called SAQ. To improve accuracy, SAQ employs a new dimension segmentation technique to strategically partition PCA-projected vectors into segments along their dimensions. By prioritizing leading dimension segments with larger magnitudes, SAQ allocates more bits to high-impact segments, optimizing the use of the available space quota. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm is developed to optimize dimension segmentation and bit allocation, ensuring minimal quantization error. To speed up vector encoding, SAQ devises a code adjustment technique to first quantize each dimension independently and then progressively refine quantized vectors using a coordinate-descent-like approach to avoid exhaustive enumeration. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAQ's superiority over classical methods (e.g., PQ, PCA) and recent state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., LVQ, Extended RabitQ). SAQ achieves up to 80% reduction in quantization error and accelerates encoding speed by over 80x compared to Extended RabitQ.</description>

      <title>A Tool for Semantic-Aware Spatial Corpus Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial natural language interface to database systems provide non-expert users with convenient access to spatial data through natural language queries. However, the scarcity of high-quality spatial natural language query corpora limits the performance of such systems. Existing methods rely on manual knowledge base construction and template-based dynamic generation, which suffer from low construction efficiency and unstable corpus quality. This paper presents semantic-aware spatial corpus construction (SSCC), a tool designed for constructing high-quality spatial natural language query and executable language query pair corpora. SSCC consists of two core modules: (i) a knowledge base construction module based on spatial relations, which extracts and determines spatial relations from datasets, and (ii) a template-augmented query pair corpus generation module, which produces query pairs via template matching and parameter substitution. The tool ensures geometric consistency and adherence to spatial logic in the generated spatial relations. Experimental results demonstrate that SSCC achieves (i) a 53x efficiency improvement for knowledge base construction and (ii) a 2.5x effectiveness improvement for query pair corpus. SSCC provides high-quality corpus support for spatial natural language interface training, substantially reducing both time and labor costs in corpus construction.</description>
