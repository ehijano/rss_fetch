      <title>Gapped Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) to study and classify gapped phases in (2+1)d for a class of categorical symmetries, referred to as being of bosonic type. The SymTFTs for these symmetries are given by twisted and untwisted (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories for finite groups G. A finite set of boundary conditions (BCs) of these DW theories is well-known: these simply involve imposing Dirichlet and Neumann conditions on the (3+1)d gauge fields. We refer to these as minimal BCs. The key new observation here is that for each DW theory, there exists an infinite number of other BCs, that we call non-minimal BCs. These non-minimal BCs are all obtained by a 'theta construction', which involves stacking the Dirichlet BC with 3d TFTs having G 0-form symmetry, and gauging the diagonal G symmetry. On the one hand, using the non-minimal BCs as symmetry BCs gives rise to an infinite number of non-invertible symmetries having the same SymTFT, while on the other hand, using the non-minimal BCs as physical BCs in the sandwich construction gives rise to an infinite number of (2+1)d gapped phases for each such non-invertible symmetry. Our analysis is thoroughly exemplified for G = $\mathbb{Z_2}$ and more generally any finite abelian group, for which the resulting non-invertible symmetries and their gapped phases already reveal an immensely rich structure.</description>

      <title>Minimal Areas from Entangled Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a relational notion of a subsystem in theories of matrix quantum mechanics and show how the corresponding entanglement entropy can be given as a minimisation, exhibiting many similarities to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. Our construction brings together the physics of entanglement edge modes, noncommutative geometry and quantum internal reference frames, to define a subsystem whose reduced state is (approximately) an incoherent sum of density matrices, corresponding to distinct spatial subregions. We show that in states where geometry emerges from semiclassical matrices, this sum is dominated by the subregion with minimal boundary area. As in the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, it is the computation of the entanglement that determines the subregion. We find that coarse-graining is essential in our microscopic derivation, in order to control the proliferation of highly curved and disconnected non-geometric subregions in the sum.</description>

      <title>3D Stress Tensor for Gravity in 4D Flat Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three dimensional (3d) Carrollian CFTs are potential co-dimension one holographic duals of 4d asymptotically flat spacetimes that live on the whole of the null boundary. In this paper, we show that the local stress tensor of the 3d Carrollian conformal theory (without any additional sources) constructed in terms of the geometric structure at asymptotic null infinity naturally encodes both the leading and subleading soft graviton theorems. We relate the 3d Carroll stress tensor to the 2d Celestial one and show how the 3d version naturally localises the non-local 2d Celestial stress tensor. We also comment on the relation with stress tensors in relativistic 3d CFTs and connections to the flat limit of AdS/CFT.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of Purification as a Measure of Non-Conformality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the entanglement of purification $E_p$ in a non-conformal holographic model which is a 5- dimensional Einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field $\phi$ with a non-trivial potential $V(\phi)$. The dual 4-dimensional gauge theory is not conformal and exhibits a FG flow between two different fixed points. There are three parameters including energy scale $\Lambda$, model parameter $\phi_M$ and temperature $T$ which control the behavior of the model. Interestingly, we have found that $E_p$ can be used as a measure to probe the non-conformal behavior of the theory at both zero and finite temperature. Furthermore, we have found that if one considers two different mixed states characterized by distinct values of $\frac{\Lambda}{T}$, then the correlation between the subsystems of these states can be the same independent of $\frac{\Lambda}{T}$.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Primordial Magnetic Blackhole: Cosmic Production and Physical Implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electroweak monopole, when coupled to gravity, turns to the Reissner-Nordstrom type primordial magnetic blackhole whose mass is bounded below, with the lower bound $M_P \sqrt \alpha$. This changes the overall picture of the monopole production mechanism in the early universe drastically and has deep implications in cosmolpgy. In particular, this enhances the possibility that the electroweak monopoles turned to the primordial magnetic blackholes could become the seed of stellar objects and galaxies, and account for the dark matter of the universe. Moreover, this tells that we have a new type of primordial blackhole different from the popular primordial blackhole in cosmology, the electroweak primordial magnetic blackhole based on a totally different production mechanism. We discuss the physical implications of the electroweak primordial magntic blackhole.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Extremal Black Holes and the UV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been noted that deformations of extremal AdS black holes in four and higher dimensions are generically non-smooth or singular on the horizon. Further, it was found that certain deformations of asymptotically flat extremal black holes are marginal, causing the nature of the horizon to be strongly sensitive to UV corrections -- in particular, Wilson coefficients associated with consistent UV completions generically lead to worse behaviour on the horizon. In this work, we extend the discussion of deformed horizons in the presence of UV corrections to extremal charged black holes in AdS where we find a tower of marginal perturbations for different black hole masses. We argue that the apparent UV sensitivity of marginal modes is, in fact, a feature of the UV theory which is correctly reproduced by the EFT, and illustrate this with explicit UV completions confirming the validity of the EFT. We demonstrate that the same holds for a scalar-Maxwell EFT with known UV completion. In the gravitational case, the sign of EFT corrections to marginal perturbations is generally connected with the signs implied by positivity bounds, with UV completions generically lead to worse behaviour on the horizon. We conjecture that this result is more generic, and use this to derive more general positivity bound motivated by the weak gravity conjecture, which we illustrate with further evidence.</description>

      <title>SymTFT for (3+1)d Gapless SPTs and Obstructions to Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study gapless phases in (3+1)d in the presence of 1-form and non-invertible duality symmetries. Using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach, we classify the gapless symmetry-protected (gSPT) phases in these setups, with particular focus on intrinsically gSPTs (igSPTs). These are symmetry protected critical points which cannot be deformed to a trivially gapped phase without spontaneously breaking the symmetry. Although these are by now well-known in (1+1)d, we demonstrate their existence in (3+1)d gauge theories. Here, they have a clear physical interpretation in terms of an obstruction to confinement, even though the full 1-form symmetry does not suffer from 't Hooft anomalies. These igSPT phases provide a new way to realize 1-form symmetries in CFTs, that has no analog for gapped phases.The SymTFT approach allows for a direct generalization from invertible symmetries to non-invertible duality symmetries, for which we study gSPT and igSPT phases as well. We accompany these theoretical results with concrete physical examples realizing such phases and explain how obstruction to confinement is detected at the level of symmetric deformations.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic limit of QFT in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formalism of nonrelativistic quantum physics was originally considered in the context of inertial frames. Here, we report on a more general framework that includes noninertial frames and arbitrarily strong gravitational fields. We derive from first principles the nonrelativistic limit of quantum fields in curved spacetime. Unique features and subtleties of the fully covariant theory in curved spacetime affect nonrelativistic quantum systems in accelerated frames when the acceleration is sufficiently high. This includes the frame dependent notion of particles, energies, vacuum states and nonrelativistic conditions. By using the algebraic approach to quantum field theory, we detail these effects in the noninertial nonrelativistic regime. The theoretical framework developed here gives predictions about the phenomenology of nonrelativistic quantum systems that are put in noninertial motion. As an application, we derive the realistic model of accelerated nonrelativistic atoms by using Dirac field theory in Rindler spacetime. We report on the experimental constraints for the indirect observation of the Unruh effect by means of atomic detectors via hyperfine structure. Then, we address the problem of localization of quantum states and observables in inertial and accelerated frames. We show how the Born probabilistic notion emerges in both cases as a consequence of the respective nonrelativistic limit. As a result, we find that nonrelativistic states can be described in terms of wave functions that quantify the probability to find particles in each space position. Also, we report on nonlocal effects that originate from the frame dependent nature of vacuum states and nonrelativistic conditions in the quantum field theory in curved spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze thermal correlators in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model away from the maximally chaotic limit. Despite the absence of a weakly curved black hole dual, the two point function decomposes into a sum over a discrete set of quasinormal modes. To compute the spectrum of modes, we analytically solve the Schwinger-Dyson equations to a high order in perturbation theory, and then numerically fit to a sum of exponentials using a technique analogous to the double cone construction. The resulting spectrum has a tree-like structure which is reminiscent of AdS black holes with curvature singularities. We present a simple toy model of stringy black holes that qualitatively reproduces some aspects of this structure.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric brick wall diagrams and the dynamical fishnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the double scaling limit of $\beta$-deformed planar N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM), which has been argued to be conformal and integrable. It is a special point in the three-parameter space of double-scaled $\gamma_i$-deformed N = 4 SYM, preserving N = 1 supersymmetry. The Feynman diagrams of the general three-parameter models form a "dynamical fishnet" that is much harder to analyze than the original one-parameter fishnet, where major progress in uncovering the model's integrable structure has been made in recent years. Here we show that by applying N = 1 superspace techniques to the $\beta$-deformed model the dynamical nature of its Feynman graph expansion disappears, and we recover a regular lattice structure of brick wall (honeycomb) type. As a first application, we compute the zero-mode-fixed thermodynamic free energy of this model by applying Zamolodchikov's method of inversion to the supersymmetric brick wall diagrams.</description>

      <title>Riemann Surfaces and Winding Numbers of R\'enyi Phase Structure of Charged-Flat Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It's widely recognized that the free energy landscape captures the essentials of thermodynamic phase transitions. In this work, we extend the findings of [1] by incorporating the nonextensive nature of black hole entropy. Specifically, the connection between black hole phase transitions and the winding number of Riemann surfaces derived through complex analysis is extended to the R\'enyi entropy framework. This new geometrical and non-extensive formalism is employed to predict the phase portraits of charged-flat black holes within both the canonical and grand canonical ensembles.
  Furthermore, we elucidate novel relations between the number of sheets comprising the Riemann surface of the Hawking-Page and Van der Waals transitions and the dimensionality of black hole spacetimes. Notably, these new numbers are consistent with those found for charged-AdS black holes in Gibbs-Boltzmann statistics, providing another significant example of the potential connection between the cosmological constant and the nonextensive R\'enyi parameter.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dimensional reduction of N=(2,0) conformal supergravity in six dimensions on a two-torus to N=4 conformal supergravity in four dimensions. At the level of kinematics, the six-dimensional Weyl multiplet is shown to reduce to a mixture of the N=4 Weyl and vector multiplets, which can be reinterpreted as a new off-shell multiplet of N=4 conformal supergravity. Similar multiplets have been constructed in other settings and are referred to as dilaton Weyl multiplets. We derive it here for the first time in a maximally supersymmetric context in four dimensions. Furthermore, we present the non-linear relations between all the six- and four-dimensional bosonic and fermionic fields, that are obtained by comparing the off-shell supersymmetry transformation rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews and extends the recently discovered connections between marginal and irrelevant stress-energy tensor deformations and gravity theories in arbitrary space-time dimensions. We start by discussing how $T\bar{T}$ and Root-$T\bar{T}$ deformations of two-dimensional field theories can be equivalently interpreted as the coupling of the undeformed matter sector to a gravity theory. We then extend this duality to higher-dimensional scenarios by using an approach that relies on the non-trivial eigenvalue degeneracy characterising the energy-momentum tensor of specific physical theories. We also explore incorporating dynamical degrees of freedom in the gravity sector, and show that the deformed space-time geometry induced by the $T\bar{T}$-like deformations defines a Ricci-Bourguignon flow of the metric tensor, which reduces to a Ricci flow in four dimensions. Finally, exploiting a dressing-type mechanism for the action functional characterizing a broad class of $T\bar{T}$-like deformations we study explicit examples, such as Einstein-Ricci solitons, $(d-1)$-form field theories, and spherically symmetric electrovacuum solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ holography to calculate the quantum complexity of $T\bar{T}$-deformation, utilizing the complexity equals volume (CV) and the complexity equals action (CA) proposals within the bulk spacetime with a finite radius cutoff. We find that the complexity of the deformed theory differs from the renormalized complexity of the original theory by a geometric functional: the bending (Willmore) energy of the time-constant slice of the base manifold. We use this result to propose an unambiguous scheme for calculating holographic quantum complexity through the CA proposal.</description>

      <title>Symmetry topological field theory and non-abelian Kramers-Wannier dualities of generalised Ising models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a class of two-dimensional Euclidean lattice field theories admitting topological lines encoded into a spherical fusion category, we explore aspects of their realisations as boundary theories of a three-dimensional topological quantum field theory. After providing a general framework for explicitly constructing such realisations, we specialise to non-abelian generalisations of the Ising model and consider two operations: gauging an arbitrary subsymmetry and performing Fourier transforms of the local weights encoding the dynamics of the theory. These are carried out both in a traditional way and in terms of the three-dimensional topological quantum field theory. Whenever the whole symmetry is gauged, combining both operations recovers the non-abelian Kramers-Wannier duals \`a la Freed and Teleman of the generalised Ising models. Moreover, we discuss the interplay between renormalisation group fixed points of gapped symmetric phases and these generalised Kramers-Wannier dualities.</description>

      <title>Massive fields in AdS from Constructive Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective field theory offers a constructive framework for exploring the AdS/CFT duality. In this article, we focus on constructing rotations within the light-front quantized collective field theory for the full set of spatial coordinates in the dual bulk AdS spacetime. Two intricate aspects require attention: how rotations involving the emergent holographic coordinate are implemented, and how rotations that involve the spatial coordinates participating in the construction of the light-cone coordinates $X^{\pm}$ are realized. Our construction is in agreement with Metsaev's construction directly in the gravity theory. Additionally, we derive the eigenfunctions of the AdS mass operator, which dictate the GKPW rule for the emergent higher-dimensional theory.</description>

      <title>One loop determinant in the extremal black hole from quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the one loop partition function of a scalar field in the near horizon geometry of the extremal Reissner Nordstr\"{o}m black hole from an infinite product over quasinormal modes using the Denef-Hartnoll-Sachdev (DHS) formula. We show that, the logarithmic divergent term of the one loop partition function computed using the DHS formula agrees with the heat kernel method. Using the same formula, we also evaluate the one loop partition function of scalar field in the near extremal Kerr Newman black hole and observe that it reduces to the same in the near horizon $AdS_2\times S^2$ geometry of the extremal Reissner Nordstr\"{o}m black hole when the angular velocity at the horizon is tuned to $2\pi T_{BH}$ value. We observe that, for higher spin fields, the mode functions become irregular at the horizon for certain quasinormal frequencies and therefore we remove them to obtain the one loop determinant.</description>

Abstract: We study the quasinormal modes of a holographic model of a Weyl semimetal. The model features quantum phase transition between a topological phase and a trivial phase. We put particular emphasis on the hydrodynamic modes and show that a hydrodynamic mode is present only in the topological Weyl semimetal phase.</description>

      <title>Theory of metastable states in many-body quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a mathematical theory of metastable pure states in closed many-body quantum systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Given a Hamiltonian, a pure state is defined to be metastable when all sufficiently local operators either stabilize the state, or raise its average energy. We prove that short-range entangled metastable states are necessarily eigenstates (scars) of a perturbatively close Hamiltonian. Given any metastable eigenstate of a Hamiltonian, in the presence of perturbations, we prove the presence of prethermal behavior: local correlation functions decay at a rate bounded by a time scale nonperturbatively long in the inverse metastability radius, rather than Fermi's Golden Rule. Inspired by this general theory, we prove that the lifetime of the false vacuum in certain $d$-dimensional quantum models grows at least as fast as $\exp(\epsilon^{-d} \log^{-3} \epsilon^{-1} )$, where $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$ is the relative energy density of the false vacuum; up to logarithms, this lower bound matches, for the first time, explicit calculations using quantum field theory. We identify metastable states at finite energy density in the PXP model, along with exponentially many metastable states in "helical" spin chains and the two-dimensional Ising model. Our inherently quantum formalism reveals precise connections between many problems, including prethermalization, robust quantum scars, and quantum nucleation theory, and applies to systems without known semiclassical and/or field theoretic limits.</description>

      <title>postmerger: A flexible mapping of ringdown amplitudes for non-precessing binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remnant black hole from a binary coalescence emits ringdown gravitational waves characterized by quasi-normal modes, which depend solely on the remnant's mass and spin. In contrast, the ringdown amplitudes and phases are determined by the properties of the merging progenitors. Accurately modeling these amplitudes and phases reduces systematic biases in parameter estimation and enables the development and performance of rigorous tests of general relativity. We present a state-of-the-art, data-driven surrogate model for ringdown amplitudes and phases, leveraging Gaussian Process Regression trained against SXS numerical-relativity simulations. Focusing on non-precessing, quasi-circular binary black holes, our model offers the most comprehensive fit that includes 16 emission modes, incorporating overtones and quadratic contributions. Our surrogate model achieves reconstruction errors that are approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the typical measurement errors of current gravitational-wave interferometers. An additional benefit of our approach is its flexibility, which allows for future extensions to include features such as eccentricity and precession, broadening the scope of its applicability to more generic astrophysical scenarios. Finally, we are releasing our model in a ready-to-use package called postmerger.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Magnetar Fields: Chiral Magnetic Instability in Neutron Star Crusts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the chiral magnetic instability in the crust of a neutron star as a potential mechanism for amplifying magnetic fields. This instability may become active when small deviations from chemical equilibrium are sustained over decades, driven by the star's gradual spin-down or residual heat loss. Our findings suggest that this mechanism can produce strong, large-scale magnetic fields consistent with models that align with observational data. Additionally, this instability naturally generates magnetic helicity in the star's crust, which is crucial for forming and maintaining strong dipolar toroidal fields, often invoked to explain magnetar observational phenomena. Our results offer a microphysically-based alternative to classical hydrodynamical dynamos for the origin of magnetar magnetic fields, addressing a long-standing debate in the field.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of the absorption cross section of static regular black holes for electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we report our study on the absorption cross section for the electromagnetic field due to static spherically symmetric regular black holes of two distinct categories: the Fan-Wang generic class and the Simpson-Visser class. Existing studies on these two categories have relied on the WKB method, which applies to the low-frequency regime. In our analysis, we have numerically evaluated the absorption cross section for the electromagnetic field across all frequency ranges. To compute the absorption cross section, we followed a gauge-invariant approach, which avoids the need for gauge fixing for the electromagnetic field, thereby simplifying the methodology further. To emphasize the usefulness of this gauge invariant approach we have performed the same analysis for Simpson-Visser class black holes, which is more general in terms of the structure of the metric. For both types of regular black holes, the influence of regularity parameters on the absorption cross section reveals fundamental properties of their spacetime and their interactions with the surrounding astrophysical environment. Moreover, certain similarities observed between the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and regular black holes of the Fan-Wang generic class indicate potential scenarios of correspondence between linear and nonlinear electrodynamics when coupled with gravity.</description>

      <title>Realization and Stability of Non-Abelian Chiral Quantum Spin Liquids via Dimensional Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the realization and stability of a non-Abelian chiral quantum spin liquid phase. To do so, we cast the problem in a quantum wires framework, which is a dimensional deconstruction framework that allows us to study the (2+1) dimensional spin liquids phase from a series of coupled (1+1) dimensional theories. The lower dimension grants us the ability to perform a bosonization procedure, which yields two different partition functions connected by a strong-weak duality transformation. This bosonization procedure is illuminating in that it makes the fixed point structure of the model unequivocal. Then, we proceed by studying the RG flow through the $ \beta $-functions, which we use to determine the phase structure. We find that the quantum spin liquid phase is realized and stable in the deep IR limit.</description>

      <title>Flatness of $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections and commutativity of Frobenius algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tensor functor called $\alpha$-induction produces a new unitary fusion category from a Frobenius algebra, or a $Q$-system, in a braided unitary fusion category. A bi-unitary connection, which is a finite family of complex number subject to some axioms, realizes an object in any unitary fusion category. It also gives a characterization of a finite-dimensional nondegenerate commuting square in subfactor theory of Jones and realizes a certain $4$-tensor appearing in recent studies of $2$-dimensional topological order. We study $\alpha$-induction for bi-unitary connections, and show that flatness of the resulting $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections implies commutativity of the original Frobenius algebra. This gives a converse of our previous result and answers a question raised by R. Longo. We furthermore give finer correspondence between the flat parts of the $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections and the commutative Frobenius subalgebras studied by B\"ockenhauer-Evans.</description>

      <title>Light rings and shadows of static black holes in effective quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, two types of static black hole models that retain general covariance have been proposed within the Hamiltonian constraint approach to effective quantum gravity (EQG). We have studied the light rings and shadows of these black holes using the topological method and the backward ray-tracing method, respectively. We demonstrate that these light rings in both types of static black holes are standard and unstable according to the classification of light rings. Subsequently, we checked the position of the light rings using the photon trajectory equation. We found that although the quantum parameters do not affect the light rings of these two types of black holes, they do reduce the size of the first type of static black hole in EQG, making it smaller. However, for the second type of static black hole in EQG, we cannot distinguish it from a Schwarzschild black hole based on the shadow alone. Fortunately, the quantum parameters shrink the lensing rings of both types of black holes in EQG, causing the black hole shadow to occupy a larger proportion within the ring. This can serve as a basis for distinguishing whether the black hole is in EQG or general relativity (GR).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assume $X$ is a variety for which the elliptic stable envelope exists. In this note we construct natural $q$-difference equations from the elliptic stable envelope of $X$. In examples, these equations coincide with the quantum difference equations, which give a natural $q$-deformation of the Dubrovin connection of $X$. Solutions of the quantum difference equations provide generating functions counting curves in $X$. In this way, our construction connects curve counting and equivariant elliptic cohomology.
  This is an overview paper based on the author's talk at the workshop The 16th MSJ-SI: Elliptic Integrable Systems, Representation Theory and Hypergeometric Functions, Tokyo 2023.</description>

      <title>Improving Mimetic Gravity with Non-trivial Scalar Potential: Cosmology, Black Holes, Shadow and Photon Sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is not easy to treat the spacetime with horizon(s) in the standard mimetic gravity. The solution to this problem has been presented in Phys.~Lett.~B 830 (2022), 137140, where it was suggested to modify the Lagrange multiplier constraint.
  In this paper, by using the improved formulation, we investigate the cosmology and black holes in mimetic gravity with scalar potential and in the scalar mimetic $F(R)$ gravity. The inflationary era and dark energy epoch for the above theories are presented as specific examples from the general reconstruction scheme which permits to realise any universe expansion history via the choice of the corresponding scalar potential or function $F(R)$. Two black hole solutions including the Schwarzschild and Hayward ones are constructed. The shadow and the radius of the photon sphere for the above black holes are found. The explicit confrontation of the black hole shadow radius with the observational bounds from M87$^*$ and Sgr A$^*$ objects is done. It is demonstrated that they do not conflict with Event Horizon Telescope observations.</description>

      <title>String condensation and topological holography for 2+1D gapless SPT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of anyon condensation is the foundation of the bulk-boundary relation and topological holography in 2+1D/1+1D. It is believed string condensation should replace anyon condensation in the 3+1D/2+1D topological holography theory. In this work we study string condensations in 3+1D topological orders and their relations to 2+1D phases. We find that a class of non-Lagrangian condensable algebras in 3+1D are exactly dual to a class of 2+1D symmetry enriched gapless phases known as gapless SPTs(gSPT). We show how topological properties of a gSPT can be fully extracted from the dual string condensation. We give an algebraic classification of this class of condensable algebras in 3+1D $G$-gauge theories that we call magnetic and simple. Through the topological holography dictionary, this maps to the classification of 2+1D $G$-symmetric phases with no topological order, including gapped and gapless SPTs. Utilizing the classification, we identify three classes of gSPTs and study their properties and gauging. Along the way, we reveal physical structures of string condensations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Chronology Protection Conjecture in The Dyonic Kerr-Sen Black Hole Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chronology Protection Conjecture (CPC) was first introduced by Hawking after his semi-classical investigation to the behaviour of a spacetime with closed timelike curves (CTCs) in response to scalar perturbation. It is argued that there would be instabilities leading to amplification of the perturbation and finally causing collapse of the region with CTCs. In this work, we investigate the CPC by exactly solve the Klein-Gordon equation in the region inside the inner horizon of the non-extremal Dyonic Kerr-Sen~(KS) black hole, where closed timelike curves exist. Successfully find the exact radial solution, we apply the polynomial condition that turns into rule of the energy quantization. The quasiresonance frequencies of the scalar fields in the region inside the inner horizon of the rotating black hole with nonzero energy have only positive imaginary part describing states that grow in time. The exponentially growing modes will backreact and deform the spacetime region where CTC exists. The CPC is proven to be valid in the Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole spacetime. Moreover, since the Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole is the most general axisymmetric black hole solution of the string inspired Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) theory, the semiclassical proof in this work is also valid for all simpler rotating black holes of the EMDA theory. The structure of the Dyonic KS spacetime distinctive from the Kerr-Newman counterpart is also explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the internal dynamics of hairy black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell-vector theory. The development of the charged vector hair necessarily removes the inner Cauchy horizon and results in an anisotropic black hole ending at a spacelike singularity. The far interior evolution is characterized by the chaotic alternations among different Kasner epochs. We show that those late interior time dynamics of bounces and epochs can be captured analytically. In particular, we obtain three distinct types of transformation laws for the alternation of Kasner epochs analytically, including the Kasner inversion, Kasner transition, and Kasner reflection. Our analytical approach is corroborated by numerical solutions to the full equations of motion. Moreover, we provide a clear explanation of the alternation of Kasner epochs found numerically in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a nonperturbative study of the form factor associated with the projection of the full four-gluon vertex on its classical tensor, for a set of kinematics with one vanishing and three arbitrary external momenta. The treatment is based on the Schwinger-Dyson equation governing this vertex, and a large-volume lattice simulation, involving ten thousand gauge field configurations. The key hypothesis employed in both approaches is the ``planar degeneracy'', which classifies diverse configurations by means of a single variable, thus enabling their meaningful ``averaging''. The results of both approaches show notable agreement, revealing a considerable suppression of the averaged form factor in the infrared. The deviations from the exact planar degeneracy are discussed in detail, and a supplementary variable is used to achieve a more accurate description. The effective charge defined through this special form factor is computed within both approaches, and the results obtained are in excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the Zero-Rate Hashing Bound with Holographic Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several recent techniques for modifying topological codes with single-qubit Clifford operators have shown high resilience against pure Pauli noise. Paramount to these findings has been the demonstration that several variants exhibit error thresholds often attaining or exceeding the zero-rate hashing bound, a known benchmark for code-capacity noise channels, for biased noise. Additionally, direct comparison with the hashing bound has shown that several topological codes outperform the hashing bound at points of finite Pauli noise biases. Motivated by these observations, we study zero-rate holographic quantum error correction codes, discovering very high threshold values under diverse and finitely-biased noise channels using a tensor-network decoding approach. Our results establish that all codes tested achieve or surpass the hashing bound at various points, ranging from pure 2-Pauli noise ($\eta = 0$) to pure 1-Pauli noise ($\eta = +\infty$), thereby demonstrating that holographic codes exhibit excellent error tolerance in the code-capacity picture. Such findings imply the existence of a structured and systematic method for constructing high-threshold codes suitable for realistically motivated noise channels. To our knowledge, this work is also the first instance of such remarkable threshold behavior in stabilizer quantum codes for the pure 2-Pauli noise regime, as well as for finitely-biased noise channels.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent, spherically symmetric background in Kaluza-Klein compactified Horndeski theory and the speed of gravity waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the models recently derived from a Kaluza-Klein compactification of higher dimensional Horndeski theory, where the resulting electromagnetic sector features non-trivial couplings to Horndeski scalar. In particular, this class of theories admits the electromagnetic waves propagating at non-unit speed, which in turn allows to relax the constraints on Horndeski theories following from multi-messenger speed test. In this work we prove that both gravitational wave and its electromagnetic counterpart propagate at the same, although non-unit, speed above an arbitrarily time-dependent, spherically symmetric background within the theories in question. Hence, we support the statement that several subclasses of Horndeski theories are not necessarily ruled out after the GW170817 event provided the photon-Galileon couplings are allowed. We also formulate the set stability conditions for an arbitraty solution within the discussed theoretical setting.</description>

      <title>Prediction of non-SUSY AdS conjecture on the lightest neutrino mass revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the constraint of the non-SUSY AdS conjecture on the three-dimensional vacua obtained from the compactification of the Standard Model coupled to Einstein gravity on a circle where the three-dimensional components of the four-dimensional metric are general functions of both non-compact and compact coordinates. From studying the wavefunction profile of the three-dimensional metric in the compactified dimension, we find that the radius of the compactified dimension must be quantized. Consequently, the three-dimensional vacua are constrained by not only the non-SUSY AdS conjecture but also the quantization rule of the circle radius, leading to both upper and lower bounds for the mass of the lightest neutrino as $\sqrt{2}\leq m_\nu/\sqrt{\Lambda_4}&lt;\sqrt{3}$ where $\Lambda_4\simeq5.06\times10^{-84}$ GeV$^2$ is the observed cosmological constant. This means that the lightest neutrino should have a mass around $10^{-32}$ eV or it would be approximately massless. With this prediction, we reconstruct the light neutrino mass matrix that is fixed by the neutrino oscillation data and in terms of three new mixing angles and six new phases for both the normal ordering and inverted ordering. In the situation that the light neutrino mass matrix is Hermitian, we calculate its numerical value in the $3\sigma$ range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the effective field theory (EFT) bootstrap by formulating it as an infinite-dimensional semidefinite program (SDP), built from the crossing symmetric sum rules and the S-matrix primal ansatz. We apply the program to study the large-$N$ chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT) and observe excellent convergence of EFT bounds between the dual (rule-out) and primal (rule-in) methods. This convergence aligns with the predictions of duality theory in SDP, enabling us to analyze the bound states and resonances in the ultra-violet (UV) spectrum. Furthermore, we incorporate the upper bound of unitarity to uniformly constrain the EFT space from the UV scale $M$ using the primal method, thereby confirming the consistency of the large-$N$ expansion. In the end, we translate the large-$N$ $\chi$PT bounds to constrain the higher derivative corrections of holographic QCD models.</description>

      <title>Loop correction and resummation of vertex functions for a self interacting scalar field in the de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a massless and minimally coupled self interacting quantum scalar field theory in the inflationary de Sitter background of dimension four. The self interaction potential is taken to be either quartic, $\lambda \phi^4/4!$, or quartic plus cubic, $\lambda \phi^4/4!+\beta \phi^3/3!$ ($\lambda \,{\ensuremath &gt;}\,0$). We compute the four and three point vertex functions up to two loop. The purely local or partly local part of these renormalised loop corrected vertex functions grow unboundedly after sufficient number of de Sitter $e$-foldings, due to the appearances of secular logarithms. We focus on the purely local part of the vertex functions and attempt a resummation of them in terms of the dynamically generated mass of the scalar field at late times. Such local logarithms have sub-leading powers compared to the non-local leading ones which can be resummed via the stochastic formalism. The variation of these vertex functions are investigated with respect to the tree level couplings numerically. Since neither the secular effect, nor the dynamical generation of field mass is possible in the Minkowski spacetime, the above phenomenon has no flat spacetime analogue. We have also compared our result with the ones that could be found via the recently proposed renormalisation group techniques. All these results suggest that at late times the value of the non-perturbative vertex function should be less than the tree level coupling.</description>

Abstract: The superconformal index of $\frac12$-BPS states of $N=4$ U(N) super Yang-Mills theory has a known infinite $q$-series expression with successive terms suppressed by $q^N$. We derive a holographic bulk interpretation of this series by evaluating the corresponding functional integral in the dual $AdS_5 \times S^5$. The integral localizes to a product of small fluctuations of the vacuum and of the collective modes of an arbitrary number of giant-gravitons wrapping an $S^3$ of maximal size inside the $S^5$. The quantum mechanics of the small fluctuations of one maximal giant is described by a supersymmetric version of the Landau problem. The quadratic fluctuation determinant reduces to a sum over the supersymmetric ground states, and precisely reproduces the first non-trivial term in the infinite series. Further, we show that the terms corresponding to multiple giants are obtained precisely by the matrix versions of the above super-quantum-mechanics.</description>

Abstract: We show that the non-supersymmetric AdS instability conjecture can point to how quantum gravity removes the initial Big Bang singularity, leading to a potential resolution for the past-incomplete inflationary universe. From the constraints on the dynamics of the universe realized as the nucleation of a thin-wall bubble mediating the decay of the non-supersymmetric AdS vacuum, we find the critical temperature $T_c$ and the critical scale factor $a_c$ for which the universe exists. These critical quantities are all finite and determined in terms of the parameters specifying the stringy 10D AdS vacuum solutions. Additionally, we derive the prediction of quantum gravity for $T_c$ and $a_c$ relying on the inflationary observations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement inside a black hole before the Page time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of entanglement within an open, strongly coupled system interacting with a heat bath as its environment, in the frameworks of both the doubly holographic model and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Generally, the entanglement within the system initially increases due to internal interactions; however, it eventually dissipates into the environment. In the doubly holographic setup, we consider an end-of-the-world brane in the bulk to represent an eternal black hole coupled with its radiation and the evolution of the global thermofield double (TFD) state. For small black holes, the reflected entropy between the bipartition exhibits a ramp-plateau-slump behavior, where the plateau arises due to the phase transition of the entanglement wedge cross-section before the Page time. Similarly, the mutual information between the bipartition displays a ramp-slop-stabilizing behavior. In quantum mechanics, we consider a double copy of the SYK-plus-bath system in a global TFD state, resembling an eternal black hole interacting with an environment. The R\'enyi mutual information within the double-copied SYK clusters exhibits a ramp-plateau-slope-stabilizing behavior. The dynamic behaviors of the entanglement quantities observed in these two models are attributable to the competition between the internal interaction of the system and the external interaction with the baths. Our study provides a fine-grained picture of the entanglement dynamics inside black holes before their Page time.</description>

Abstract: In analogy to null electromagnetic fields we define null YM fields. We show that the null non-abelian $SU(N)$ gauge fields admit a set of $2 N^2$ conserved "helicities". We derive null YM solutions that carry finite helicities by uplifting the abelian Hopfion solution and their generalizations. Another method that we implement is to deform YM solutions which do not carry helicities into ones that have nontrivial helicities. A nontrivial non-Abelian solution with helicities is found as a wave of infinite energy. We also discuss non-abelian generalizations of the Bateman parameterization for null abelian gauge fields.</description>

Abstract: The present work delves into examining the thermodynamic properties of the four-dimensional Kerr-Newmann-AdS black hole, employing the recently proposed framework of restricted phase space thermodynamics (RPST). This approach introduces a novel set of paired thermodynamic variables: the central charge $C$ of the corresponding dual conformal field theory (CFT) and the chemical potential $\mu$. Through simple analysis, we establish fundamental relationships such as the Euler relation, Gibbs-Duhem relation, and the zeroth order homogeneity of intensive variables. Employing numerical techniques, we explore the thermodynamic processes between these conjugate variables. Our investigation reveals the first-order and second-order phase transitions across various macroscopic processes. Despite the absence of complete analytical expressions, our findings unveil striking similarities in behavior between RN-AdS and Kerr-AdS, underscoring the presence of underlying universality within the RPST formalism.</description>

Abstract: We continue the series of articles on the application of Landau-Ginzburg mean-field theory to unveil the basic phase structure of tensorial field theories which are characterized by combinatorially non-local interactions. Among others, this class covers tensor field theories (TFT) which lead to a new class of conformal field theories highly relevant for investigations on the AdS/CFT conjecture. Moreover, it also encompasses models within the tensorial group field theory (TGFT) approach to quantum gravity. Crucially, in the infrared we find that the effective mass of the modes relevant for the critical behavior vanishes not only at criticality but also throughout the entire phase of non-vanishing vacuum expectation value due to the non-locality of the interactions. As a consequence, one encounters there the emergence of scale invariance on configuration space which is potentially enhanced to conformal invariance thereon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08346v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find an exact time-dependent instanton solution on a vacuum Kerr-like warped spacetime in conformal dilaton gravity. Remarkably, the metric solution results from a first-order PDE, allowing the connection with self-duality. The antipodal boundary condition on the hypersurface of a Klein bottle $\sim \mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1$ is applied to describe the Hawking particles. We used the Hopf fibration to get $S^2$ as the black hole horizon, where the centrix is not in a torus but in the Klein bottle. The twist fits very well with the antipodal identification of the point on the horizon. No "cut and past" is necessary, so the Hawing particles remain pure without instantaneous information transport. A local observer passing the horizon will not notice a central singularity in suitable coordinates. The black hole paradoxes are also revisited in our new black hole model. A connection is made with the geomeric quantization of $\mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1\sim S^3$, by considering the symplectic 2-form. The model can be easily extended to the non-vacuum situation by including a scalar field. Both the dilaton and the scalar field can be treated as quantum fields when approaching the Planck area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the asymptotic safety landscape stemming from ultraviolet-complete photon-graviton flows in a field theoretic setup, and we confront it with the weak gravity conjecture and, for the first time, with positivity bounds. At fourth order in derivatives, we find two gravitational fixed points providing viable ultraviolet completions for the theory. One of them comes with a single relevant direction, which sets the scale of quantum gravity. The corresponding sub-landscape is a single point. The second fixed point yields a richer sub-landscape of effective theories, most of which is described by an approximately straight line in the space of dimensionless Wilson coefficients. We additionally discover that: (i) the two sub-landscapes are continuously connected via a small "candy cane" regime, and the whole asymptotic safety landscape falls onto a plane; this is consistent with earlier findings and could be a universal feature in Asymptotic Safety; (ii) in such a field-theoretic setup, the Euler coupling plays a special role, as it is unconstrained by quantum scale invariance, but can enter off-shell bounds such as entropy-based positivity constraints; (iii) Planck-scale-suppressed violations of both weak gravity and positivity bounds occur across the landscape. The latter result resonates with expectations grounded on effective field theory arguments.</description>

Abstract: Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) terms are typically neglected when performing dimensional reductions of gravitational theories. We consider the reduction of such terms for both two-derivative and four-derivative theories in general dimensions. We demonstrate a robust consistency wherein the GHY term in the original, higher-dimensional theory translates directly to the appropriate GHY term in the dimensionally reduced theory. In particular, this gives a novel way of generating such terms for higher-derivative corrections. We carry out this procedure for Gauss-Bonnet, Chern-Simons modified, and $f(R)$ gravities to derive novel boundary terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymptotic observables in quantum field theory beyond the familiar $S$-matrix have recently attracted much interest, for instance in the context of gravity waveforms. Such observables can be understood in terms of Schwinger-Keldysh-type 'amplitudes' computed by a set of modified Feynman rules involving cut internal legs and external legs labelled by time-folds.
  In parallel, a homotopy-algebraic understanding of perturbative quantum field theory has emerged in recent years. In particular, passing through homotopy transfer, the $S$-matrix of a perturbative quantum field theory can be understood as the minimal model of an associated (quantum) $L_\infty$-algebra.
  Here we bring these two developments together. In particular, we show that Schwinger-Keldysh amplitudes are naturally encoded in an $L_\infty$-algebra, similar to ordinary scattering amplitudes. As before, they are computed via homotopy transfer, but using deformation-retract data that are not canonical (in contrast to the conventional $S$-matrix). We further show that the $L_\infty$-algebras encoding Schwinger-Keldysh amplitudes and ordinary amplitudes are quasi-isomorphic (meaning, in a suitable sense, equivalent). This entails a set of recursion relations that enable one to compute Schwinger-Keldysh amplitudes in terms of ordinary amplitudes or vice versa.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal field theories that exhibit spontaneous breaking of conformal symmetry (a moduli space of vacua) must satisfy a set of bootstrap constraints, involving the usual data (scaling dimensions and OPE coefficients) as well as new data such as the spectrum of asymptotic states in the broken vacuum and form factors. The simplest bootstrap equation arises by expanding a two-point function of local operators in two channels, at short distance using the OPE and at large distance using the EFT in the broken vacuum. We illustrate this equation in what is arguably the simplest perturbative model that exhibits conformal symmetry breaking, namely the real $ABC$ model in $d = 4 -\epsilon$ dimensions. We investigate the convergence properties of the bootstrap equation and check explicitly many of the non-trivial relations that it imposes on theory data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive study of holographic stress tensor correlators on general Riemann surfaces, extending beyond the previously well-studied torus cases to explore higher genus conformal field theories (CFTs) within the framework of the Anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. We develop a methodological approach to compute holographic stress tensor correlators, employing the Schottky uniformization technique to address the handlebody solutions for higher genus Riemann surfaces. Through rigorous calculations, we derive four-point stress tensor correlators, alongside recurrence relations for higher-point correlators, within the $\mathrm{AdS}_3/\mathrm{CFT}_2$ context. Additionally, our research delves into the holography of cutoff $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ spaces, offering novel insights into the lower-point correlators of the $T\bar{T}$-deformed theories on higher genus Riemann surfaces up to the first deformation order.</description>

      <title>Nicolai maps for super Yang-Mills on the light cone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct Nicolai maps for supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four and ten spacetime dimensions in the light-cone gauge, where the elimination of non-propagating degrees of freedom causes nonlocal and four-fermi interactions in the Lagrangian. The presence of the latter used to be an obstruction to the Nicolai map, which has recently been overcome at the price of quantum corrections to the map. No gauge-fixing or ghost terms arise in this formulation, since only physical transverse degrees of freedom occur. We present an explicit form of the Nicolai map to second order in the gauge coupling. In four dimensions, a `chiral' choice of the map leaves one of the two transverse gauge-field modes invariant, which forces the classical part of the map (on the other mode) to become a polynomial (quadratic in the gauge coupling, cubic in the gauge field)! In the power series expansion for the ten-dimensional map however, cancellations at each order in the coupling are systematic but incomplete, still leaving an infinite power series for the Nicolai map (on all eight transverse modes). Nevertheless, the existence of a polynomial variant is conceivable, also for the maximal ${\cal N}{=}\,4$ theory in four dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We connect the indications of 2D CFT for branes in non-supersymmetric strings to actual spacetime profiles, taking the bulk tadpole potentials into account. We find exact solutions for the uncharged branes that spread in the internal intervals of Dudas-Mourad vacua for non-tachyonic orientifolds and heterotic strings. These solutions involve suitable dressings of the uncharged branes of the nine-dimensional tadpole-free theory. Similar exact results for uncharged branes that are transverse to the internal space, or for charged branes, appear more challenging. Nevertheless, we identify their large-distance behavior, which is determined by linearized equations, and show that it is compatible with the CFT analysis in all expected cases. We also provide some hints on the leading back-reaction of the form-fields.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Harvesting and Quantum Discord of Alpha Vacua in de Sitter Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CPT invariant vacuum states of a scalar field in de Sitter space, called $\alpha$-vacua, are not unique. We explore the $\alpha$-vacua from the quantum information perspective by a pair of Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors coupled to a scalar field with either monopole or dipole coupling, which are in time-like zero separation or space-like antipodal separation. The analytical form of the reduced final state of the UDW detector is derived. We study the entanglement harvesting and quantum discord of the reduced state, which characterize the quantum entanglement and quantum correlation of the underlying $\alpha$-vacua, respectively. Our results imply that the quantum entanglement gravitated by de Sitter gravity behaves quite differently for time-like and space-like separations. It experiences "sudden death" for the former and grows for the latter as the measuring time or the value of $\alpha$ increases. This demonstrates the nonlocal nature of quantum entanglement. For the quantum discord, we find no "sudden death" behavior, and it experiences superhorizon suppression, which explains the superhorizon decoherence in the inflationary universe scenario. Overall, the time-like or space-like quantum entanglement and correlation behave differently on their dependence of $\alpha$, measuring time and spectral gaps, with details discussed in this work.</description>

      <title>A note on the large-$c$ conformal block asymptotics and $\alpha$-heavy operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $\alpha$-heavy conformal operators in CFT$_2$ which dimensions grow as $h = O(c^\alpha)$ with $\alpha$ being non-negative rational number and conjecture that the large-$c$ asymptotics of the respective 4-point Virasoro conformal block is exponentiated similar to the standard case of $\alpha=1$. It is shown that the leading exponent is given by a Puiseux polynomial which is a linear combination of power functions in the central charge with fractional powers decreasing from $\alpha$ to $0$ according to some pattern. Our analysis is limited by considering the first six explicit coefficients of the Virasoro block function in the coordinate. For simplicity, external primary operators are chosen to be of equal conformal dimensions that, therefore, includes the case of the vacuum conformal block. The consideration is also extended to the 4-point ${\cal W}_3$ conformal block of four semi-degenerate operators, in which case the exponentiation hypothesis works the same way. Here, only the first three block coefficients can be treated analytically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct new supersymmetric Janus solutions from four-dimensional $N=3$ gauged supergravity coupled to eight vector multiplets with $SO(3)\times SU(3)$ gauge group. This gauged supergravity admits a supersymmetric $N=3$ $AdS_4$ vacuum with the full $SO(3)\times SU(3)$ symmetry unbroken and a family of supersymmetric $N=1,2,3$ and non-supersymmetric $AdS_4$ vacua with different residual symmetries. These are expected to be dual to supersymmetric Chern-Simons-Matter (CSM) theories in three dimensions via the AdS/CFT correspondence. By considering a truncation to three complex scalar fields, we find a number of Janus solutions preserving $N=1$ supersymmetry that describes conformal interfaces within $N=3$ CSM theories with $SO(3)\times SU(3)$ and $SU(2)_{\textrm{diag}}\times U(1)$ symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.01792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define compactness of a gravitational lens as the scaled closest distance of approach (i.e., $r_0/M$) of the null geodesic giving rise to an image. We model forty supermassive dark objects as Schwarzschild lenses and compute compactness of lenses (determined by the formation of the first order relativistic image). We then obtain a novel formula for the compactness of a lens as a function of mass to the distance ratio ($M/D_d$) and the ratio of lens-source to the observer-source distances ($D_{ds}/D_s$). This formula yields a very important result: Just an observation of a relativistic image would give an incredibly accurate upper bound to the physical compactness (the ratio of the radius to mass) of the lens without having any knowledge of mass of the lens, angular source position, and observer-source and lens-source distances. Similarly, we show that the observation of the second order relativistic image would give a lower value of upper bound to the physical compactness. These results, though obtained for supermassive dark objects at galactic centers, are valid for any object compact enough to give rise to relativistic images.</description>

Abstract: Random tensor networks are a powerful toy model for understanding the entanglement structure of holographic quantum gravity. However, unlike holographic quantum gravity, their entanglement spectra are flat. It has therefore been argued that a better model consists of random tensor networks with link states that are not maximally entangled, i.e., have nontrivial spectra. In this work, we initiate a systematic study of the entanglement properties of these networks. We employ tools from free probability, random matrix theory, and one-shot quantum information theory to study random tensor networks with bounded and unbounded variation in link spectra, and in cases where a subsystem has one or multiple minimal cuts. If the link states have bounded spectral variation, the limiting entanglement spectrum of a subsystem with two minimal cuts can be expressed as a free product of the entanglement spectra of each cut, along with a Marchenko-Pastur distribution. For a class of states with unbounded spectral variation, analogous to semiclassical states in quantum gravity, we relate the limiting entanglement spectrum of a subsystem with two minimal cuts to the distribution of the minimal entanglement across the two cuts. In doing so, we draw connections to previous work on split transfer protocols, entanglement negativity in random tensor networks, and Euclidean path integrals in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Classical freeness of orthosymplectic affine vertex superalgebras</title>

Abstract: The question of when a vertex algebra is a quantization of the arc space of its associated scheme has recently received a lot of attention in both the mathematics and physics literature. This property was first studied by Tomoyuki Arakawa and Anne Moreau [Lectures on $\mathcal{W}$-algebras, Australian Representation Theory Workshop 2016, University of Melbourne], and was given the name "classical freeness" by Jethro van Ekeren and Reimundo Heluani in their work on chiral homology [Comm. Math. Phys. 386 (2021), no. 1, 495-550]. Later, it was extended to vertex superalgebras by Hao Li [Eur. J. Math. 7 (2021), 1689-1728]. In this note, we prove the classical freeness of the simple affine vertex superalgebra $L_n(\mathfrak{osp}_{m|2r})$ for all positive integers $m,n,r$ satisfying $-\frac{m}{2} + r +n+1 &gt; 0$. In particular, it holds for the rational vertex superalgebras $L_n(\mathfrak{osp}_{1|2r})$ for all positive integers $r,n$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity signatures in late time Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the cosmological settings, Quantum Gravity effects are typically understood to be limited towards very early phase of the universe, namely in the pre-inflationary era, with limited signatures spilling over into the succeeding inflationary era which gradually fade away as the universe transits into the subsequent radiation and matter driven expansion. In general scenarios as well, the imprints of possible quantum character of gravitons are typically so feeble that they are expected to remain buried under overwhelming noise from other stronger processes. In this work, we demonstrate that quantized gravitational perturbations cause strong observable effects in cosmological settings post the Last Scattering Surface (LSS) more prominently than any other classical or quantum processes. This counter-intuitive effect is facilitated by the fact that the quantum correlators of the gravitons {\it grow divergently large in the matter dominated era} unlike any other background fields leading to an abrupt rise in the processes mediated by correlators of quantum gravitons, which otherwise is way too feeble. The transitions between spherical harmonics states of a hydrogen atom guided by gravitons in a particular phase of the late time era of the universe, provides an example of such a process. Thus the newly formed atoms post LSS are expected to get excited from the vacuum fluctuations of gravitons quite efficiently in this era and also get de-excited to convert the vacuum fluctuations to an additional channel of energy influx into the evolution history. Such unavoidable processes provide an avenue of quantum graviton mediated process becoming important in the late time era, which has many interesting implications.</description>

Abstract: The cosmological tensor perturbation equation with generalized holonomy corrections is derived in the framework of effective loop quantum gravity. This results in a generalized dispersion relation for gravitational waves, encompassing holonomy corrections. Furthermore, we conduct an examination of the constraint algebra concerning vector modes with generalized holonomy corrections. The requirement of anomaly cancellation for vector modes imposes constraints on the possible functional forms of the generalized holonomy corrections. What's more, we estimate the theoretical value of the effective graviton mass and discuss the potential detectability of this effective mass in future observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the modifications induced on scalar field inflation produced by considering a general modification of the Heisenberg algebra. We proceed by modifying the Poisson brackets on the classical theory whenever the corresponding quantum commutator is modified. We do not restrict ourselves to a specific form for such modification, instead we constrain the functions involved by the cosmological behaviour of interest. We present whenever possible the way in which inflation can be realized approximately via three slow roll Hubble parameters that depend on the standard slow roll parameters in a very different form than in the usual case and that can be less restrictive. Furthermore we find a general analytical solution describing an expanding universe with constant Hubble parameter that generalizes the standard cosmological constant case by restricting the form of the modification of the Heisenberg algebra. It is found that even if such modification can be neglected in some limit and the cosmological constant is set to zero in that limit, the exponential expansion is present when the modification is important. Thus an appropriate modification of the Heisenberg algebra is sufficient to produce an exponentially expanding universe without the need of any other source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general relativity, when two black holes merge they produce a rotating (Kerr) black hole remnant. According to perturbation theory, the remnant emits "ringdown" radiation: a superposition of exponentials with characteristic complex frequencies that depend only on the remnant's mass and spin. While the goal of the black hole spectroscopy program is to measure the quasinormal mode frequencies, a knowledge of their amplitudes and phases is equally important to determine which modes are detectable, and possibly to perform additional consistency checks. Unlike the complex frequencies, the amplitudes and phases depend on the properties of the binary progenitors, such as the binary mass ratio and component spins. In this paper we develop a fitting algorithm designed to reliably identify the modes present in numerical simulations and to extract their amplitudes and phases. We apply the algorithm to over 500 binary black hole simulations from the public SXS numerical relativity simulation catalog, and we present fitting formulas for the resulting mode amplitudes and phases as functions of the properties of the progenitors. Crucially, our algorithm allows for the extraction of not only prograde fundamental modes and overtones, but also retrograde modes and second-order modes. We unveil interesting relations for the amplitude ratios of different modes. The fitting code and interactive versions of some of the plots are publicly available. The results presented in this paper can be updated as more and better simulations become available.</description>

      <title>Observable signatures of Hall viscosity in lowest Landau level superfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hall viscosity is a nondissipative viscosity occurring in systems with broken time-reversal symmetry, such as quantum Hall phases and $p+ip$ superfluids. Despite Hall viscosity's expected ubiquity and past observations in: classical soft matter, optical, and graphene systems, it has yet to be measured experimentally in any macroscopic quantum state of matter. Toward this end, we describe the observable effects of Hall viscosity in a simple family of rotating Bose-Einstein condensates of electrically neutral bosons, in which all of the bosons condense into a single lowest Landau level (LLL) orbital. Such phases are accessible to current cold atom experiments, and we dub them LLL superfluids. We demonstrate that LLL superfluids possess a nonuniversal Hall viscosity, leading to a range of observable consequences such as rotation of vortex-antivortex dipoles and wave-vector dependent corrections to the speed of sound. Furthermore, using a coherent state path integral approach, we present a microscopic derivation of the Landau-Ginzburg equations of a LLL superfluid, showing explicitly how Hall viscosity enters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes have gained significant interest due to their potential applications in topological quantum computing and in the realization of exotic quantum phases. These zero-energy quasiparticle excitations localize at the vortex cores of two-dimensional topological superconductors or at the ends of one-dimensional topological superconductors. Here we describe an alternative platform: a two-dimensional topological superconductor with inhomogeneous superconductivity, where Majorana modes localize at the ends of topologically nontrivial one-dimensional stripes induced by the spatial variations of the order parameter phase. In certain regimes, these Majorana modes hybridize into a single highly nonlocal state delocalized over spatially separated points, with exactly zero energy at finite system sizes and with emergent quantum-mechanical supersymmetry. We then present detailed descriptions of braiding and fusion protocols and showcase the versatility of our proposal by suggesting possible setups that can potentially lead to the realization of Yang-Lee anyons and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Effective Field Theory of Stochastic Single Field Inflation at NNNLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL}, g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.</description>

      <title>Graviton mass due to dark energy as a superconducting medium: theoretical and phenomenological aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the cosmological constant term in the Einstein field equations can be interpreted as a stress tensor for dark energy. This stress tensor is formally analogous to an elastic constitutive equation in continuum mechanics. As a result, the cosmological constant leads to a "shear modulus" and "bulk modulus" affecting all gravitational fields in the universe. The form of the constitutive equation is also analogous to the London constitutive equation for a superconductor. Treating dark energy as a type of superconducting medium for gravitational waves leads to a Yukawa-like gravitational potential and a massive graviton within standard General Relativity. We discuss a number of resulting phenomenological aspects such as a screening length scale that can also be used to describe the effects generally attributed to dark matter. In addition, we find a gravitational wave plasma frequency, index of refraction, and impedance. The expansion of the universe is interpreted as a Meissner-like effect as dark energy causes an outward "expulsion" of space-time similar to a superconductor expelling a magnetic field. The fundamental cause of these effects is interpreted as a type of spontaneous symmetry breaking of a scalar field. There is an associated chemical potential, critical temperature, and an Unruh-Hawking effect associated with the formulation.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of vector Horndeski black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Horndeski's vector-tensor (HVT) gravity is described by a Lagrangian in which the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}=\partial_{\mu} A_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu} A_{\mu}$ of a vector field $A_{\mu}$ interacts with a double dual Riemann tensor $L^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta}$ in the form $\beta L^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} F_{\mu \nu} F_{\alpha \beta}$, where $\beta$ is a constant. In Einstein-Maxwell-HVT theory, there are static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solutions with electric or magnetic charges, whose metric components are modified from those in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om geometry. The electric-magnetic duality of solutions is broken even at the background level by the nonvanishing coupling constant $\beta$. We compute a second-order action of BH perturbations containing both the odd- and even-parity modes and show that there are four dynamical perturbations arising from the gravitational and vector-field sectors. We derive all the linear stability conditions associated with the absence of ghosts and radial/angular Laplacian instabilities for both the electric and magnetic BHs. These conditions exhibit the difference between the electrically and magnetically charged cases by reflecting the breaking of electric-magnetic duality at the level of perturbations. In particular, the four angular propagation speeds in the large-multipole limit are different from each other for both the electric and magnetic BHs. This suggests the breaking of eikonal correspondence between the peak position of at least one of the potentials of dynamical perturbations and the radius of photon sphere. For the electrically and magnetically charged cases, we elucidate parameter spaces of the HVT coupling and the BH charge in which the BHs without naked singularities are linearly stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons can condense to form the so-called bosonic clouds around spinning black holes by superradiance instability. When quantum effects are taken into account, the classical black holes were replaced by exotic compact objects including area quantized black holes. In this work, we consider the superradiant instabilities of massive scalar fields around area quantized Kerr black hole. We introduce the reflectivity of area quantized black hole possesses the distinct discrete feature, and the scalar fields have the superradiant modes solution only within the specific mass range. In addition, the area quantization may terminate the superradiance when the black hole spins down, or even suppress the formation of the bosionic cloud.</description>

Abstract: Embedded walls are domain wall solutions which are unstable in the vacuum but stabilized in a plasma of the early Universe. We show how embedded walls in which the electroweak symmetry is restored can lead to an efficient scenario of electroweak baryogenesis. We construct an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics in which embedded walls exist and are stabilized in an electromagnetic plasma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum entanglement in high-energy $2\to 2$ scalar scattering, where the scalars are characterized by an internal flavor quantum number acting like a qubit. Working at the 1-loop order in perturbation theory, we build the final-state density matrix as a function of the scattering amplitudes connecting the initial to the outgoing state. In this construction, the unitarity of the $S$-matrix is guaranteed at the required order by the optical theorem. We consider the post-scattering entanglement between the momentum and flavor degrees of freedom of the final-state particles, as well as the entanglement of the two-qubit flavor subsystem. In each case we identify the couplings of the scalar potential that can generate, destroy, or transfer entanglement between different bipartite subspaces of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00880v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By considering the one loop background field method for a quark-antiquark interaction, mediated by one (non perturbative) gluon exchange, sixth order quark effective interactions are derived and investigated in the limit of zero momentum transfer for large quark and/or gluon effective masses. They extend fourth order quark interactions worked out in previous works of the author. These interactions break $U_A(1)$ symmetry and may be either momentum independent or dependent. Part of these interactions vanish in the limit of massless quarks, and several other -- involving vector and/or axial quark currents -- survive. In the local limit of the resulting interactions, some phenomenological implications are presented, which correspond to corrections to the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. By means of the auxiliary field method, the local interactions give rise to three meson interactions whose values are compared to phenomenological values found in the literature. Contributions for meson-mixing parameters are calculated and compared to available results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have applied thermodynamic stability analysis to derive the stability and causality conditions for conventional relativistic viscous hydrodynamics and spin hydrodynamics. We obtain the thermodynamic stability conditions for second-order relativistic hydrodynamics with shear and bulk viscous tensors, finding them identical to those derived from linear mode analysis. We then derive the thermodynamic stability conditions for minimal causal extended second-order spin hydrodynamics in canonical form, both with and without viscous tensors. Without viscous tensors, the constraints from thermodynamic stability exactly match those from linear mode analysis. In the presence of viscous tensors, the thermodynamic stability imposes more stringent constraints than those obtained from linear mode analysis. Our results suggest that conditions derived from thermodynamic stability analysis can guarantee both causality and stability in linear mode analysis.</description>

      <title>Primordial power spectrum at N3LO in effective theories of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework to compute the primordial power spectrum up to next-to-next-to-next to leading order (N3LO) in the Hubble-flow parameters for a large class of effective theories of inflation. We assume that the quadratic action for perturbations is characterized by two functions of time, the kinetic amplitude and the speed of sound, that are independent of the Fourier mode $k$. Using the Green's function method introduced by Stewart &amp; Gong and developed by Auclair &amp; Ringeval, we determine the primordial power spectrum, including its amplitude, spectral indices, their running and running of their running, starting from a given generic action for perturbations. As a check, we reproduce the state-of-the-art results for scalar and the tensor power spectrum of the simplest "vanilla" models of single-field inflation. The framework applies to Weinberg's effective field theory of inflation (with the condition of no parity violation) and to effective theory of spontaneous de Sitter-symmetry breaking. As a concrete application, we provide the expression for the N3LO power spectrum of $R+R^2$ Starobinsky inflation, without a field redefinition. All expressions are provided in terms of an expansion in one single parameter, the number of inflationary e-foldings $N_\ast$. Surprisingly we find that, compared to previous leading-order calculations, for $N_\ast = 55$ the N3LO correction results in a $7\%$ decrease of the predicted tensor-to-scalar ratio, in addition to a deviation from the consistency relation and a prediction of a negative running $\alpha_\mathrm{s}=-\frac{1}{2}(n_\mathrm{s}-1)^2+\ldots$ of the scalar tilt. These results provide precise theoretical predictions for the next generation of CMB observations.</description>

Abstract: We investigate scalarized black holes in the Einstein-minimally coupled scalar theory with a negative potential $V(\phi)=-\alpha^2\phi^6$. The tachyonic instability is absent from analyzing the linearized scalar equation, which could not allow for spontaneous scalarization. However, we obtain the black hole solutions with scalar hair by solving three full equations because this scalar potential violates the weak energy condition. This shows clearly that scalarized black holes can be obtained without introducing a non-minimal scalar coupling term. We perform the stability analysis for scalarized black holes by adopting radial perturbations, implying that all scalarized black holes belonging to a single branch are unstable.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that gravitational waves undergo no absorption or dissipation when traversing through a perfect fluid. However, in the presence of a viscous fluid, GWs transfer energy to the fluid medium. In this paper, we present a review of our recent series of results regarding the interaction between gravitational waves and surrounding matter. Additionally, we examine the impact of a viscous fluid shell on gravitational wave propagation, focusing particularly on GW damping and GW heating. Furthermore, we explore the significance of these effects in various astrophysical scenarios such as core-collapse Supernovae and primordial gravitational waves.</description>

Abstract: We construct proper moduli algebraic spaces of K-polystable $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano cones (a.k.a. Calabi-Yau cones) or equivalently their links i.e., Sasaki-Einstein manifolds with singularities.
  As a byproduct, it gives alternative algebraic construction of proper K-moduli of $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano varieties. In contrast to the previous algebraic proof of its properness ([BHLLX, LXZ]), we do not use the $\delta$-invariants ([FO, BJ]) nor the $L^2$-normalized Donaldson-Futaki invariants. We use the local normalized volume of [Li] and the higher $\Theta$-stable reduction instead.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties of a relativistic Bose gas under rigid rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of a rigidly rotating relativistic Bose gas. First, we derive the solution of the equation of motion corresponding to a rotating complex Klein-Gordon field and determine the free propagator of this model utilizing the Fock-Schwinger proper-time method. Using this propagator, we then obtain the thermodynamic potential of this model in the zeroth and first perturbative level. In addition, we compute the nonperturbative ring contribution to this potential. Our focus is on the dependence of these expressions on the angular velocity, which effectively acts as a chemical potential. Using this thermodynamic potential, we calculate several quantities, including the pressure, angular momentum and entropy densities, heat capacity, speed of sound, and moment of inertia of this rigidly rotating Bose gas as functions of temperature ($T$), angular velocity ($\Omega$), and the coupling constant ($\alpha$). We show that certain thermodynamic instabilities appear at high temperatures and large couplings. They are manifested as zero and negative values of the above quantities, particularly the moment of inertia and heat capacity. Zero moment of inertia leads to the phenomenon of supervorticity at certain $T$ or $\alpha$. Supervortical temperatures (couplings) decrease with increasing coupling (temperature). We also observe superluminal sound velocities at high $T$ and for large $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting linear stability of black hole odd-parity perturbations in Einstein-Aether gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Einstein-Aether gravity, we revisit the issue of linear stabilities of black holes against odd-parity perturbations on a static and spherically symmetric background. In this theory, superluminal propagation is allowed and there is a preferred timelike direction along the unit Aether vector field. If we choose the usual spherically symmetric background coordinates with respect to the Killing time $t$ and the areal radius $r$, it may not be appropriate for unambiguously determining the black hole stability because the constant $t$ hypersurfaces are not necessarily always spacelike. Unlike past related works of black hole perturbations, we choose an Aether-orthogonal frame in which the timelike Aether field is orthogonal to spacelike hypersurfaces over the whole background spacetime. In the short wavelength limit, we show that no-ghost conditions as well as radial and angular propagation speeds coincide with those of vector and tensor perturbations on the Minkowski background. Thus, the odd-parity linear stability of black holes for large radial and angular momentum modes is solely determined by constant coefficients of the Aether derivative couplings.</description>

      <title>The Exact Relativistic Scalar Quasibound States of The Dyonic Kerr-Sen Black Hole: Quantized Energy, and Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Klein-Gordon equation in the Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole background, which is the charged rotating axially symmetric solution of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory of gravity. The black hole incorporates electric, magnetic, dilatonic and axionic charges and is constructed in 3+1 dimensional spacetime. We begin our investigations with the construction of the scalar field's governing equation, i.e., the covariant Klein-Gordon equation. With the help of the ansatz of separation of variables, we successfully separate the polar part, and find the exact solution in terms of Spheroidal Harmonics, while the radial exact solution is obtained in terms of the Confluent Heun function. The quantization of the quasibound state is done by applying the polynomial condition of the Confluent Heun function that gives rise to discrete complex-valued energy levels for massive scalar fields. The real part is the scalar field relativistic quantized energy, while the imaginary part represents the quasibound states's decay. We present all of the sixteen possible exact energy solutions for both massive and massless scalars. We also present the investigation the Hawking radiation of the Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole's apparent horizon, via the Sigurd-Sannan method by making use of the obtained exact scalar wave functions. The radiation distribution function, and the Hawking temperature are successfully obtained.</description>

      <title>Locating Quark-Antiquark String Breaking in QCD through Chiral Symmetry Restoration and Hawking-Unruh Effect</title>

Abstract: The relationship between QCD and the string model offers a valuable perspective for exploring the interaction potential between quarks. In this study, we investigate the restoration of chiral symmetry in connection with the Unruh effect experienced by accelerating observers. Utilizing the Schwinger model, we analyze the critical point at which the string or chromoelectric flux tube between quark-antiquarks breaks with increasing separation between quarks. In this study, the critical distance for quark-antiquark chromoelectric flux tube or string breaking is determined to be $r_c=1.294\pm0.040$ fm. The acceleration and Unruh temperature corresponding to this critical point signify the transition of the system's chiral symmetry from a broken to a restored state. Our estimates for the critical acceleration ($a_c=1.14\times 10^{34}$ cm/s$^{2}$) and Unruh temperature ($T_c=0.038$ GeV) align with previous studies. This analysis illuminates the interplay between chiral symmetry restoration, the Unruh effect, and the breaking of the string or chromoelectric flux tube within the context of quark interactions.</description>

      <title>Confining modeling of quark propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A confining extension of the quark model with nonlocal currents is proposed. The quark propagator is modified by introducing a cut in {\alpha}-space, which in momentum space corresponds to the subtraction of pole singularities. A two-phase phase structure is proposed for modeling the confinement-deconfinement phase transition. In the confined phase, the quark propagator does not have any pole singularities, while in the deconfined phase, there is a single quark pole.</description>

      <title>Symmetric black-to-white hole solutions with a cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a system with a Hamiltonian constraint, we demonstrate that its dynamics preserves invariant with respect to the choice of the lapse function, regardless of whether the Hamiltonian incorporates quantum corrections. Applying this observation to the interior of black-to-white holes, we analyze its dynamics with different choices of the lapse function. The results explicitly show that the leading-order expansion of both metrics in Refs. [1,2] and Refs. [3,4] exhibits identical behavior near the transition surface,therefore in this sense the black-to-white hole model proposed in Refs. [1,2] may be interpreted as a coarse-grained version of the solution within the framework of loop quantum gravity. The black-to-white hole solutions with exact symmetry between the black hole and white hole regions are constructed by appropriately fixing the quantum parameters in the effective theory of loop quantum gravity. This approach circumvents the issue of amplification of mass, which could arise from a mass difference between the black hole and white hole. Finally, the black-to-white hole solutions with a cosmological constant are constructed. The numerical solutions for the interior of black-to-white hole with a cosmological constant are obtained, and their symmetric behavior is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Fundamental physical constants set the observability and operation of phase and other transitions and increase entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approaching the challenge to understand fundamental physical constants (FPCs) started with understanding the role these constants play in high-energy nuclear physics and astrophysics. Condensed matter physics was relatively unexplored in this regard. More recently, it was realised that FPCs set lower or upper bounds on key condensed matter properties. In this Perspective, we discuss a wider role played by FPCs in condensed matter physics: at given environmental conditions, FPCs set the observability and operation of entire physical effects and phenomena. We discuss first and second-order phase transitions and emerging new states including long-lived metastable states. We also discuss transitions between metastable states, chemical reactions and their products. These examples show that different values of FPCs would disable these transitions, and new phases as a result of these transitions would not emerge. This suggests that the current values of FPCs, by enabling transitions which give rise to new states, act to increase the phase space and entropy.</description>
