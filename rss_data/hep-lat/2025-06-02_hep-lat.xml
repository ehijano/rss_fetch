      <title>Unitarity of 4D Lattice Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unitarity of the 4D lattice theory of gravity in the case of the Minkowski signature is proved. The proof is valid only for lattices that conserve the number of degrees of freedom during time evolution. The Euclidean signature and the Minkowski signature are related by the deformation of the integration contours of dynamic variables in a discrete lattice functional integral. It is important that the result is obtained directly on the lattice. Since the studied lattice theory of gravity in the long-wave limit transforms into the well-known Einstein-Cartan-Palatini theory, the obtained result means that this lattice theory of gravity has the right to be considered as a discrete regularization of the generally accepted continuous physical theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Anomaly of conserved and nonconserved axial charges in Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the axial anomaly in Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. The definition of axial charge operators is ambiguous, especially between conserved and nonconserved axial charges. While these charges appear to differ only by a higher-order term in lattice spacing, they do not coincide in the continuum limit. We demonstrate, through analytical and numerical calculations, that the conserved axial charge correctly reproduces the axial anomaly relation in continuous spacetime. Our finding would provide valuable insights for future studies on quantum computing for lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions IV: Coulomb corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formalism developed in Refs.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal,Guo:2024pvt} that relates the integrated correlation functions for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral is further extended to include Coulomb interaction between charged particles. The original formalism cannot be applied due to different divergent asymptotic behavior resulting from the long-range nature of the Coulomb force. We show that a modified formula in which the difference of integrated correlation functions between particles interacting with Coulomb plus short-range interaction and with Coulomb interaction alone is free of divergence, and has rapid approach to its infinite volume limit. Using an exactly solvable model, we demonstrate that the short-range potential scattering phase shifts can be reliably extracted from the formula in the presence of Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>A New State of Matter between the Hadronic Phase and the Quark-Gluon Plasma?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice-QCD simulations and theoretical arguments hint at the existence of an intermediate phase of strongly interacting matter between a confined hadron gas and a deconfined Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). We qualitatively and semi-quantitatively explore and differentiate the phase structures in the temperature window from the QCD pseudo-critical temperature $T_c\simeq 160\;\text{MeV}$ to the pure-gluonic deconfinement temperature $T_d\simeq 285\;\text{MeV}$. We propose a three-regime picture using a hadron resonance gas (HRG) description augmented with the glueball spectrum based on the analysis of a large number, $N_c$, of colors. We estimate the entropy density from our model to confirm that the lattice-QCD data are bracketed with three regimes, i.e., a hadron gas, a QGP, and a new phase for $T_c \lesssim T \lesssim T_d$. In this new phase that we name a Spaghetti of Quarks with Glueballs (SQGB), thermal degrees of freedom of quarks are deconfined, yet gluons remain confined in glueballs. Since the Hagedorn temperature, $T_H\sim 285\;\text{MeV}$, is universal in the meson and the glueball sectors, in the infinite $N_c$ limit, the phase diagram in the plane of the baryon chemical potential and the temperature is reduced to the one with the confined and deconfined phases and Quarkyonic Matter at high density. At large but finite $N_c$, an SQGB window may open between these phases. We point out that the SQGB has interesting similarities with Quarkyonic Matter and that this matter in the large $N_c$ limit is confined as measured by the interaction between heavy quarks, but behaves in other respects like a quasi-free gas of quarks. As a result of the extrapolation to $N_c=3$, we present a revised phase diagram with the SQGB phase bounded by thermal crossovers. Finally, we give a quantitative analysis of chiral symmetry restoration in the SQGB phase.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Proof of Existence and Mass Gap for Pure SU(3) Yang-Mills in Four-Dimensional Space-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a constructive proof that pure SU(3) Yang-Mills theory on R^4 exists as a nontrivial Wightman quantum field theory and exhibits a strictly positive mass gap. Our approach embeds the four-dimensional gauge theory as the zero-mode sector of a five-dimensional orbifold regulator that preserves gauge invariance and reflection positivity. A convergent joint polymer expansion on the Wilson lattice provides uniform control of the continuum (a-&gt;0) and infinite-volume (L-&gt;inf) limits; an Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction yields a unique-vacuum Wightman theory; a nonperturbative BRST/Nielsen argument ensures gauge-parameter independence; a rigorously controlled operator-product expansion matches one-loop beta-function data; and a Sturm-Liouville analysis of five-dimensional fluctuations, combined with transfer-matrix spectral projections, isolates a strictly positive glueball mass m0. All steps rest on explicit epsilon-delta estimates and combinatorial bounds for SU(3), leaving no remaining gap between heuristic physics and mathematical proof.</description>

      <title>Regularization Prescription for the Mixing Between Nonlocal Gluon and Quark Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that in the study of mixing between nonlocal gluon and quark bilinear operators there exists an ambiguity when relating coordinate space and momentum space results, which can be conveniently resolved through Mellin moments matching in both spaces. In this work, we show that this ambiguity is due to the lack of a proper regularization prescription of the singularity that arises when the separation between the gluon/quark fields approaches zero. We then demonstrate that dimensional regularization resolves this issue and yields consistent results in both coordinate and momentum space. This prescription is also compatible with lattice extractions of parton distributions from nonlocal operators.</description>

      <title>Decays of the vector charmonium and bottomonium hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The full widths of the vector charmonium and bottomonium hybrid mesons $H_{ \mathrm{c}}$ and $H_{\mathrm{b}}$, characterized by the quantum numbers $1^{ \mathrm{--}}$, are determined by analyzing their dominant strong decay modes: $H_{\mathrm{c}} \to D^{+}D^{-}$, $D_{0}\overline{D}_{0}$, $ D_{s}^{+}D_{s}^{-} $ and $H_{\mathrm{b}} \to B^{+}B^{-}$, $B_{0}\overline{B} _{0}$. To evaluate the partial widths of these channels, we employ the QCD three-point sum rule approach, which provides a reliable method for extracting the strong coupling constants at the relevant hybrid-meson-meson interaction vertices. Based on this analysis, the full widths of these hybrid quarkonia are found to be $\Gamma _{H_{\mathrm{c}}} =(234.1\pm 37.4)~ \mathrm{MeV} $ and $\Gamma _{H_{\mathrm{b}}} =(78.8\pm 15.4)~\mathrm{MeV} $ . These results are expected to facilitate the interpretation of future experimental data concerning the spectroscopy and decay patterns of exotic charmonium- and bottomonium-like hybrid mesons.</description>

      <title>Exponential speedup in quantum simulation of Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian via orbifold lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian -- an approach known for its efficiency in simulating SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory and QCD on digital quantum computers -- can reproduce the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian in a controlled limit. While the original Kogut-Susskind approach faces significant implementation challenges on quantum hardware, we show that it emerges naturally as the infinite scalar mass limit of the orbifold lattice formulation, even at finite lattice spacing. Our analysis provides both a general analytical framework applicable to SU($N$) gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions and specific numerical evidence for $(2+1)$-dimensional SU($N$) Yang-Mills theories ($N=2,3$). Using Euclidean path integral methods, we quantify the convergence rate by comparing the standard Wilson action with the orbifold lattice action, matching lattice parameters, and systematically extrapolating results as the bare scalar mass approaches infinity. This reformulation resolves longstanding technical obstacles and offers a straightforward implementation protocol for digital quantum simulation of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian with exponential speedup compared to classical methods and previously known quantum methods.</description>

      <title>The index of lattice Dirac operators and $K$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We mathematically show an equality between the index of a Dirac operator on a flat continuum torus and the $\eta$ invariant of a lattice Dirac operator known as the Wilson Dirac operator with a negative mass when the lattice spacing is sufficiently small. Unlike the standard approach, our formulation using $K$-theory does not require modified chiral symmetry on the lattice. We prove that a one-parameter family of continuum massive Dirac operators and the corresponding Wilson Dirac operators belong to the same equivalence class of the $K^1$ group at a finite lattice spacing. Their indices, which are evaluated by the spectral flow or equivalently by the $\eta$ invariant at a finite mass, are proved to be equal.</description>

      <title>Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\Delta=3\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature QCD crossover at non-zero chemical potential: A Dyson-Schwinger approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study QCD at finite temperature and non-zero chemical potential to derive the critical temperature at the chiral phase transition (crossover). We solve a set of Dyson--Schwinger partial differential equations using the exact solution for the Yang--Mills quantum field theory based on elliptical functions. We derive a Nambu-Jona--Lasino (NJL) model of the quarks and obtain a very good agreement with recent lattice computations regarding the dependence of the critical temperature on the strong coupling scale. The solution depends on a single scale parameter, as typical for the theory and already known from studies about asymptotic freedom. The study is analytically derived from QCD.</description>
