      <title>A New Broadband Spectral State in the Ultraluminous X-ray Source Holmberg IX X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a series of five new broadband X-ray observations of the ultraluminous X-ray source Holmberg IX X-1, performed by $XMM$-$Newton$ and $NuSTAR$ in coordination. The first three of these show high soft X-ray fluxes but a near total collapse of the high-energy ($\gtrsim$15 keV) emission, previously seen to be surprisingly stable across all prior broadband observations of the source. The latter two show a recovery in hard X-rays, remarkably once again respecting the same stable high-energy flux exhibited by all of the archival observations. We also present a joint analysis of all broadband observations of Holmberg IX X-1 to date (encompassing 11 epochs in total) in order to investigate whether it shows the same luminosity-temperature behaviour as NGC 1313 X-1 (which also shows a stable high-energy flux), whereby the hotter disc component in the spectrum exhibits two distinct, positively-correlated tracks in the luminosity-temperature plane. Holmberg IX X-1 may show similar behaviour, but the results depend on whether the highest energy emission is assumed to be an up-scattering corona or an accretion column. The strongest evidence for this behaviour is found in the former case, while in the latter the new 'soft' epochs appear distinct from the other high-flux epochs. We discuss possible explanations for these new 'soft' spectra in the context of the expected structure of super-Eddington accretion flows around black holes and neutron stars, and highlight a potentially interesting analogy with the recent destruction and re-creation of the corona seen in the AGN 1ES 1927+654.</description>

      <title>Self-regulation of high-redshift black hole accretion via jets: challenges for SMBH formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early growth of black holes (BHs) in atomic-cooling halos is likely influenced by feedback on the surrounding gas. While the effects of radiative feedback are well-documented, mechanical feedback, particularly from AGN jets, has been comparatively less explored. Building on our previous work that examined the growth of a 100 ${M_\odot}$ BH in a constant density environment regulated by AGN jets, we expand the initial BH mass range from 1 to $10^4$ ${M_\odot}$ and adopt a more realistic density profile for atomic-cooling halos. We reaffirm the validity of our analytic models for jet cocoon propagation and feedback regulation. We identify several critical radii-namely, the terminal radius of jet cocoon propagation, the isotropization radius of the jet cocoon, and the core radius of the atomic-cooling halo-that are crucial in determining BH growth given specific gas properties and jet feedback parameters. In a significant portion of the parameter space, our findings show that jet feedback substantially disrupts the halo's core during the initial feedback episode, preventing BH growth beyond $10^4$ ${M_\odot}$. Conversely, conditions characterized by low jet velocities and high gas densities enable sustained BH growth over extended periods. We provide a prediction for the black hole mass growth as a function of time and feedback parameters. We found that, to form a supermassive BH ($&gt;10^6 {M_\odot}$) within 1 Gyr entirely by accreting gas from an atomic-cooling halo, the jet energy feedback efficiency must be $\lesssim 10^{-4} \dot{M}_{BH} c^2$ even if the seed BH mass is $10^4 {M_\odot}$.</description>

      <title>On the Gravitational Wave Counterpart to a Gamma-ray Galactic Center Signal from Millisecond Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new tools of gravitational wave and multi-messenger astronomy allow for the study of astrophysical phenomenon in new ways and enables light to be shed on some of the longest-enduring mysteries of high-energy astrophysics. Among the latter stands the Galactic center gamma-ray excess, associated with a source whose nature could be annihilating dark matter or a yet-unresolved population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). MSPs are most likely asymmetric about their axis of rotation, and are thus thought to also source quasi-monochromatic gravitational waves, that dark matter processes would not emit. Using statistical methods, we simulate realistic MSP population samples with differing morphology and moment of inertia, that could give rise to the gamma-ray excess, and we compute the corresponding gravitational wave signal amplitude and frequency. We find that the gravitational wave signal frequency likely ranges between $\sim$200 and 1400 Hz, and that the collective dimensionless strain from the center of the Galaxy has an amplitude between $10^{-26}$ and $10^{-24}$, thus most likely beyond current and near-term detectors, unless the unresolved MSPs are extraordinarily gamma-ray dim.</description>

      <title>Life in the Bubble: How a nearby supernova left ephemeral footprints on the cosmic-ray spectrum and indelible imprints on life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Earth sits inside a 300pc-wide void that was carved by a series of supernova explosions that went off tens of millions of years ago, pushing away interstellar gas and creating a bubble-like structure. The 60Fe peak deposits found in the deep-sea crust have been interpreted by the imprints left by the ejecta of supernova explosions occurring about 2-3 and 5-6 Myr ago. It is likely that the 60Fe peak at about 2-3 Myr originated from a supernova occurring in the Upper Centaurus Lupus association in Scorpius Centaurus (140 pc) or the Tucana Horologium association (70 pc). Whereas, the 5-6 Myr peak is likely attributed to the solar system's entrance into the bubble. In this Letter, we show that the supernova source responsible for synthesizing the 60Fe peak deposits 2-3 Myr ago was also likely a Galactic PeVatron source. We demonstrate that this supernova can consistently explain the "knee" in the cosmic-ray spectrum and the large-scale anisotropy between 100 TeV and 100 PeV. Matching the intensity and shape of the cosmic-ray spectrum allows us to place stringent constraints on the cosmic-ray energy content from the supernova as well as on the cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient. Making use of such constraints we provide a robust estimate of the temporal variation of terrestrial ionizing cosmic radiation levels and discuss their implications in the development of early life on Earth by plausibly influencing the mutation rate and, as such, conceivably assisting in the evolution of complex organisms.</description>

      <title>Parsec-scale jet direction evolution in AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the variability of the parsec-scale jet directions in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our analysis involves 317 AGNs at frequencies ranging from 2 to 43 GHz, and is made possible by developing an automatic inner jet direction measurement procedure. We find strong significant variations in a one quarter of these AGNs; the effect is likely ubiquitous, and not detected in the rest due to a limited sensitivity and observations epoch coverage. Average apparent jet rotation speeds range from 0.21 deg/yr at 2 GHz to 1.04 deg/yr at 43 GHz. This strong frequency dependence indicates that the variability cannot be explained by jet components propagating ballistically without acceleration: more complex jet shapes or patterns are required. Still, we demonstrate that the apparent direction changes are predominantly caused by the jet nozzle rotations, and not by individual components propagating transversely to the jet. In this work, we focus on variability scales much longer than the times of observations, that is &gt; 50 years. Using our measurements, we bound potential periods to less than 1000 years in the source rest frame for 90% AGNs in the sample. This allows us to constrain mechanisms causing these variations if they are periodic, such as instabilities, disk-driven precession, or binary black hole effects.</description>

      <title>General-relativistic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion in a toroidally magnetized medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a black hole traveling through a plasma -- a general relativistic extension of the classic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion problem -- can be related to a variety of astrophysical contexts, including the aftermath of binary black hole mergers in gaseous environments. We perform three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of BHL accretion onto a rotating black hole for an incoming flow with a toroidal (inclined) magnetization with respect to the spin axis of the black hole. Irrespective of inclination but dependent on the wind speed, we find that the accretion flow onto the black hole can become magnetically arrested, launching an intermittent (and sometimes striped) jet. The upstream ram pressure of the wind bends the jet, and confines the angular extent into which the magnetic flux tubes ejected from quasi-periodic eruptions are released. Recoil from magnetic flux eruptions drives strong oscillations in the accretion plane, resulting in jet nutation at the outer radii and occasionally ripping off the inner part of the accretion disk. In addition to dynamical friction, the black hole experiences a perpendicular drag force analogous to the Magnus effect. Qualitative effects of the incoming magnetic field orientation, the strength of the magnetization, and the incoming wind speed are investigated as well.</description>

      <title>The Twisting of Radio Waves in a Randomly Inhomogeneous Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization of electromagnetic waves carries a large amount of information about their astrophysical emitters and the media they passed through, and hence is crucial in various aspects of astronomy. Here we demonstrate an important but long-overlooked depolarization mechanism in astrophysics: when the polarization vector of light travels along a non-planar curve, it experiences an additional rotation, in particular for radio waves. The process leads to depolarization, which we call `geometric' depolarization (GDP). We give a concise theoretical analysis of the GDP effect on the transport of radio waves in a randomly inhomogeneous plasma under the geometrical optics approximation. In the case of isotropic scattering in the coronal plasma, we show that the GDP of the angle-of-arrival of the linearly polarized radio waves propagating through the turbulent plasma cannot be ignored. The GDP effect of linearly polarized radio waves can be generalized to astrophysical phenomena, such as fast radio bursts and stellar radio bursts, etc. Our findings may have a profound impact on the analysis of astrophysical depolarization phenomena.</description>

      <title>Rotation Measure study of FRB 20180916B with the uGMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Fast Radio Burst 20180916B is a repeating FRB whose activity window has a 16.34 day periodicity that also shifts and varies in duration with the observing frequency. Recently, arxiv:2205.09221 reported the FRB has started to show secular Rotation Measure (RM) increasing trend after only showing stochastic variability around a constant value of $-114.6$ rad m$^{-2}$ since its discovery.
  Aims. We aim to further study the RM variability of FRB 20180916B. The data comes from the ongoing campaigns of FRB 20180916B using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). The majority of the observations are in Band 4, which is centered at 650 MHz with 200 MHz bandwidth.
  Methods. We apply a standard single pulse search pipeline to search for bursts. In total, we detect 116 bursts with $\sim$36 hours of on-source time spanning 1200 days, with two bursts detected during simultaneous frequency coverage observations. We develop and apply a polarization calibration strategy suited for our dataset. On the calibrated bursts, we use QU-fitting to measure RM. Lastly, we also measure various other properties such as rate, linear polarization fraction and fluence distribution.
  Results. Of the 116 detected bursts, we could calibrate 79 of them. From which, we observed in our early observations the RM continued to follow linear trend as modeled by arxiv:2205.09221. However, our later observations suggest the source switch from the linear trend to stochastic variations around a constant value of $-58.75$ rad m$^{-2}$. We also study cumulative rate against fluence and note that rate at higher fluences (&gt; 1.2 Jy ms) scales as $\gamma = -1.09(7)$ whereas that at lower fluences (between 0.2 and 1.2 Jy ms) only scales as $\gamma = -0.51(1)$, meaning rate at higher fluence regime is steeper than at lower fluence regime.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: GRB 230812B -- A Three-Second Supernova-Associated Burst Detected by the GRID Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB 230812B, detected by the Gamma-Ray Integrated Detectors (GRID) constellation mission, is an exceptionally bright gamma-ray burst (GRB) with a duration of only 3 seconds. Sitting near the traditional boundary ($\sim$ 2 s) between long and short GRBs, GRB 230812B is notably associated with a supernova (SN), indicating a massive star progenitor. This makes it a rare example of a short-duration GRB resulting from stellar collapse. Our analysis, using a time-evolving synchrotron model, suggests that the burst has an emission radius of approximately $10^{14.5}$~cm. We propose that the short duration of GRB 230812B is due to the combined effects of the central engine's activity time and the time required for the jet to break through the stellar envelope. Our findings provide another case that challenges the conventional view that short-duration GRBs originate exclusively from compact object mergers, demonstrating that a broader range of durations exists for GRBs arising from the collapse of massive stars.</description>

      <title>Analytic insight into the physics of SASI I. Shock instability in a non-rotating stellar core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the core collapse of a massive star just before its supernova explosion, the amplification of asymmetric motions by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) imprints on the neutrino flux and the gravitational waves a frequency signature carrying direct information on the explosion process. The physical interpretation of this multi-messenger signature requires a detailed understanding of the instability mechanism. A perturbative analysis is used to characterize the properties of SASI, and assess the effect of the region of neutronization above the surface of the proto-neutron star. The eigenfrequencies of the most unstable modes are compared to those obtained in an adiabatic approximation where neutrino interactions are neglected above the neutrinosphere. The differential system is solved analytically using a Wronskian method and approximated asymptotically for a large shock radius. The oscillation period of SASI is well fitted with a simple analytic function of the shock radius, the radius of maximum deceleration and the mass of the proto-neutron star. The oscillation period is weakly dependent on the parametrized cooling function which however affects the SASI growth rate. The general properties of SASI eigenmodes are described using an adiabatic model. In this approximation the eigenvalue problem is formulated as a self-forced oscillator. The forcing agent is the radial advection of baroclinic vorticity perturbations and entropy perturbations produced by the shock oscillation. The differential system defining the eigenfrequencies is reduced to a single integral equation. Its analytical approximation sheds light on the radially extended character of the region of advective-acoustic coupling. The simplicity of this adiabatic formalism opens new perspectives to investigate the effect of stellar rotation and non-adiabatic processes on SASI.</description>

      <title>Applying template synthesis to the radio emission from air showers with generic geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying high-energy cosmic-ray air showers through the radio emission produced by their secondary particles is a well-established technique. However, due to the increasing size and density of the radio arrays, analyses are running into computational limits, as these rely on Monte Carlo simulations to model the emission. To address this, we have been developing template synthesis. With this method, we use semi-analytical expressions to describe how the radio emission from an air shower depends on the shower age and the position of the antenna with respect to the shower. These expressions are extracted from a set of microscopic simulations, thus benefiting from their accuracy. Once obtained, we can use these relations to synthesise the emission from an air shower with any longitudinal profile, by using a single Monte Carlo simulation as an input. Previously we have demonstrated that this hybrid approach can synthesise the radio emission from air showers and agrees with results from microscopic simulations within 10%. The method was however limited to a specific geometry. Here we present our first step towards generalising template synthesis across geometries. We found a set of scaling relations which correct for the shower geometry as well as the viewing angle under which the radiation is observed. This allows us to reformulate the semi-analytical relations in a way that does not longer depend on the geometry, significantly reducing the number of parameters that need to be fitted. We apply these scaling relations to a simulation library of CORSIKA showers with a zenith angle of 50 degrees. We then extract the semi-analytical expressions required for template synthesis, and use them to synthesise the emission from air showers with lower zenith angles. We investigate the accuracy by comparing both to microscopic simulations as well as the single geometry version of template synthesis.</description>

      <title>Generalising template synthesis of EAS radio emission to other geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last few decades, radio detection has become one of the standard techniques to study high-energy cosmic-ray air showers. For the purpose of analysing the data, we heavily rely on Monte Carlo simulations. Upcoming dense radio array experiments such as LOFAR2.0 and SKA will, however, reach the limit of what is computationally feasible with these. Other techniques are available, based on macroscopic quantities, but their accuracy has thus far not been adequate to use them in precision analyses. In this contribution we present the latest update on the template synthesis approach, a hybrid model using both micro- and macroscopic inputs to synthesise the radio emission for an air shower with an arbitrary longitudinal profile. The method starts from the emission of a given shower and employs semi-analytical relations which only depend on the atmospheric depth at shower maximum and antenna position in order to transform it. Core to the template synthesis approach is the slicing of the atmosphere. By considering the radio emission from each slice separately, we only need to explicitly account for shower age effects. In previous work it was shown this could be done over a wide range of primary energy and across primary types for vertical air showers, with an accuracy of 10%. Here, we generalise the method to other zenith angles. We investigate the potential to synthesise between different geometries using a data set consisting of several hundreds of CORSIKA showers with primary energies ranging from $10^{17}$ eV to $10^{19}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Template synthesis approach for radio emission from extensive air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel way to synthesise the radio emission from extensive air showers. It is a hybrid approach which uses a single microscopic Monte-Carlo simulation to generate the radio emission from a shower with a different longitudinal evolution, primary particle type and energy. The method employs semi-analytical relations which only depend on the shower parameters to transform the radio signal in the simulated antennas. We apply this method to vertical air showers with energies ranging from $10^{17}$ eV to $10^{19}$ eV and compare the results with CoREAS using two different metrics. In order to gauge the performance over our simulation set, we subsequently use every shower in the set as a template to synthesise the emission from the other showers. Depending on the scoring metric, template synthesis reconstructs the radio emission with an accuracy of 5 to 10%.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength study of extreme high-energy peaked BL Lac (EHBL) source 1ES 0229$+$200 using ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma-ray observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the extreme high-energy peaked BL Lac (EHBL) source, 1ES 0229$+$200. Our study utilizes near-simultaneous data collected at various epochs between September 2017 and August 2021 (MJD: 58119$-$59365) from different instruments, including {\em AstroSat}$-$UVIT, SXT, LAXPC, {\em Swift}$-$UVOT, {\em Fermi}-LAT, and MAGIC. We investigate the one-zone synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, employing diverse particle distributions such as the log parabola, broken power law, power law with a maximum electron energy $\gamma$, energy-dependent diffusion (EDD), and energy-dependent acceleration (EDA) models to fit the broadband SED of the source. Our findings indicate that both peaks in the SED are well described by the one-zone SSC model across all particle distribution models. We estimate the jet power for different particle distributions. The estimated jet power for broken power law particle distributions is found to be on the order of $10^{47}$ ($10^{44}$) erg s$^{-1}$ for a minimum electron energy $\gamma_{min}$ $\sim$10 (10$^4$). However, for intrinsically curved particle energy distributions (e.g., log parabola, EDD, and EDA models), the estimated jet power is $\sim$10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The SED fitting at five epochs enables us to explore the correlation between the derived spectral parameters of various particle distribution models. Notably, the observed correlations are inconsistent with the predictions in the power-law with a maximum $\gamma$ model, although the EDD and EDA models yield the correlations as expected. Moreover, the estimated physical parameter values are consistent with the model assumptions.</description>

      <title>High-temporal-resolution optical spectroscopic observations of the transitional millisecond pulsar PSR J1023+0038</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) represent a dynamic category of celestial sources that establish a crucial connection between low-mass X-ray binaries and millisecond radio pulsars. These systems exhibit transitions from rotation-powered states to accretion-powered ones and vice versa, highlighting the tight evolutionary link expected by the so-called recycling scenario. In their active phase, these sources manifest two distinct emission modes named high and low, occasionally punctuated by sporadic flares. Here, we present high-time-resolution spectroscopic observations of the binary tMSP J1023+0038, in the sub-luminous disc state. This is the first short-timescale (~ 1 min) optical spectroscopic campaign ever conducted on a tMSP. The campaign was carried out over the night of June 10, 2021 using the Gran Telescopio Canarias. The optical continuum shows erratic variability, without clear evidence of high and low modes or of orbital modulation. Besides, the analysis of these high-temporal-cadence spectroscopic observations reveals, for the first time, evidence for a significant (up to a factor of ~ 2) variability in the emission line properties (equivalent width and full width half maximum) over a timescale of minutes. Intriguingly, the variability episodes observed in the optical continuum and in the emission line properties seem uncorrelated, making their origin unclear.</description>

      <title>Hunting Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter in Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A very pressing question in contemporary physics is the identity of Dark Matter (DM), and one that has not been answered affirmatively to any degree so far. Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are one of the most well-motivated DM candidates. Light enough PBHs have been constrained by either the non-detection of their Hawking radiation itself, or by the non-observation of any measurable effects of this radiation on astrophysical and cosmological observables. We constrain the PBH density by their Hawking radiation effect on the intergalactic medium (IGM) temperature evolution. We use the latest deductions of IGM temperature from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations. We put constraints on the fraction of PBH DM with masses $5 \times 10^{15}$ g - $10^{17}$ g separately for spinning and non-spinning BHs. We derive constraints by dealing with the heating effects of the astrophysical reionization of the IGM in two ways. In one way, we completely neglect this heating due to astrophysical sources, thus giving us weaker constraints, but completely robust to the reionization history of the universe. In the second way, we utilise some modelling of the ionization and temperature history, and use it to derive more stringent constraints. We find that for non-spinning PBHs of mass $10^{16}$ g, the current measurements can constrain the PBH-density to be $\lesssim$ 0.1% of the total DM. We find that these constraints from the latest Lyman-$\alpha$ forest temperature measurements are competitive, and hence provide a new observable to probe the nature of PBH DM. The systematics affecting Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements are different from other constraining observations, and thus this is a complementary probe.</description>

      <title>Polarization of active galactic nuclei with significant VLBI-Gaia displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous studies have reported significant displacements in the coordinates of active galactic nuclei between measurements using radio interferometry techniques and those obtained by the Gaia space observatory. There is a consensus that these discrepancies do indeed manifest astrometrically resolved sub-components of AGN rather than random measurement noise. Among other evidence, it has been reported that AGN with VLBI-to-Gaia displacements (VGD) pointing downstream their parsec-scale radio jets exhibit higher optical polarization compared to sources with the opposite VGD orientation. We aim to verify this previously reported connection between optical polarization and VGD-jet angle using a larger dataset of polarimetric measurements and updated Gaia DR3 positions. We also seek additional evidence supporting the disc-jet dichotomy as an explanation of such a connection by using mm-wave polarization and multi-band optical polarization measurements. We performed optical polarimetric observations of 157 AGN using three telescopes. We cross-match public astrometric data from VLBI and Gaia experiments, obtain corresponding positional displacements, and join this catalog with the polarimetric and jet directions data. AGN with downstream VGD are confirmed to have significantly higher optical fractional polarization than the upstream sample. At the same time, the mm-wavelength polarization of the two samples demonstrates very similar distributions. Our results support the hypothesis that the VLBI-to-Gaia displacements pointing down the radio jet are likely caused by a component in the jet emitting highly polarized synchrotron radiation and dominating in the overall optical emission. The upstream-oriented VGD are likely to be produced by the low-polarized emission of the central engine sub-components dominating in the optical.</description>

      <title>Improving constraints on the extended mass distribution in the Galactic Center with stellar orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the orbital motion of stars around Sagittarius A* in the Galactic Center provides a unique opportunity to probe the gravitational potential near the supermassive black hole at the heart of our Galaxy. Interferometric data obtained with the GRAVITY instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) since 2016 has allowed us to achieve unprecedented precision in tracking the orbits of these stars. GRAVITY data have been key to detecting the in-plane, prograde Schwarzschild precession of the orbit of the star S2, as predicted by General Relativity. By combining astrometric and spectroscopic data from multiple stars, including S2, S29, S38, and S55 - for which we have data around their time of pericenter passage with GRAVITY - we can now strengthen the significance of this detection to an approximately $10 \sigma$ confidence level. The prograde precession of S2's orbit provides valuable insights into the potential presence of an extended mass distribution surrounding Sagittarius A*, which could consist of a dynamically relaxed stellar cusp comprised of old stars and stellar remnants, along with a possible dark matter spike. Our analysis, based on two plausible density profiles - a power-law and a Plummer profile - constrains the enclosed mass within the orbit of S2 to be consistent with zero, establishing an upper limit of approximately $1200 \, M_\odot$ with a $1 \sigma$ confidence level. This significantly improves our constraints on the mass distribution in the Galactic Center. Our upper limit is very close to the expected value from numerical simulations for a stellar cusp in the Galactic Center, leaving little room for a significant enhancement of dark matter density near Sagittarius A*.</description>

      <title>Towards a response function for the COSI anticoincidence system: preliminary results from Geant4 simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is an upcoming NASA Small Explorer satellite mission scheduled for launch in 2027 and designed to conduct an all-sky survey in the energy range of 0.2-5 MeV. Its instrument consists of an array of germanium detectors surrounded on four sides and underneath by active shields that work as anticoincidence system (ACS) to reduce the contribution of background events in the detectors. These shields are composed of bismuth germanium oxide (BGO), a scintillator material, coupled with Silicon photomultipliers, aimed to collect optical photons produced from interaction of ionizing particles in the BGO and convert them into an electric signal. The reference simulation framework for COSI is MEGAlib, a set of software tools based on the Geant4 toolkit. The interaction point of the incoming radiation, the design of the ACS modules and the BGO surface treatment change the light collection and the overall shielding accuracy. The use of the Geant4 optical physics library, with the simulation of the scintillation process, is mandatory for a more realistic evaluation of the ACS performances. However, including the optical processes in MEGAlib would dramatically increase the computing time of the COSI simulations. We propose the use of a response function encoding the energy resolution and 3D light yield correction based on a separate Geant4 simulation of the ACS that includes the full optical interaction. We present the verification of the Geant4 optical physics library against analytical computations and available laboratory measurements obtained using PMTs as readout device, as a preparatory phase for the simulation of the COSI ACS response.</description>

      <title>Magnetized neutral 2SC color superconductivity and possible origin of the inner magnetic field of magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper the neutral 2SC phase of color superconductivity is investigated in the presence of a magnetic field and for diquark coupling constants and baryonic densities that are expected to characterize neutron stars. Specifically, the behavior of the charged gluons Meissner masses is investigated in the parameter region of interest taking into account in addition the contribution of a rotated magnetic field. It is found that up to moderately-high diquark coupling constants the mentioned Meissner masses become tachyonic independently of the applied magnetic field amplitude, hence signalizing the chromomagnetic instability of this phase. To remove the instability, it is proposed the restructuring of the system ground state, which now will be formed by vortices of the rotated charged gluons. These vortices boost the applied magnetic field having the most significant increase for relatively low applied magnetic fields. Finally, considering that with the stellar rotational frequency observed for magnetars a field of order $10^8$ G can be generated by dynamo effect. Then, we show that by the boosting effect just described the field can be amplified to $10^{17}$ G that is in the range of inner core fields expected for magnetars. Thus, we conclude that the described mechanism could be the one responsible for the large fields characterizing magnetars if the core of this compact objects are formed by neutral 2SC matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The X-ray Timing Instrument as part of the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer has the potential to examine the time-domain properties of compact objects in regimes not explored by previous timing instruments, due to its combination of high effective area and timing resolution. We consider the effects of instrumental deadtime at a range of effective countrates in a series of observations of the X-ray binary GX 339-4 to determine what effect deadtime has on photometric and Fourier frequency-domain products. We find that there are no significant inconsistencies across the functional detectors in the instrument, and that in the regimes where instrumental deadtime is a limiting factor on observations that previous approaches to dealing with deadtime, as applied to RXTE and other detectors, are still appropriate, and that performing deadtime corrections to lightcurves before creating Fourier products are not necessary at the count rates considered in our analysis.</description>

Abstract: We present a neural network classification model for detecting the presence of hyperonic degrees of freedom in neutron stars. The models take radii and/or tidal deformabilities as input and give the probability for the presence of hyperons in the neutron star composition. Different numbers of observations and different levels of uncertainty in the neutron star properties are tested. The models have been trained on a dataset of well-calibrated microscopic equations of state of neutron star matter based on a relativistic mean-field formalism. Real data and data generated from a different description of hyperonic matter are used to test the performance of the models.</description>

I then consider the central subject of the conference, stellar feedback, and how interactions between stellar winds and the interstellar medium can limit or enhance the effects of feedback compared to models including only supernova explosions. Finally, I review results in other areas covered by the conference, including planet and star formation, nova and supernova remnants, different topics in stellar evolution and interaction with the interstellar medium, star clusters, observational surveys, and observational and numerical techniques.</description>

      <title>Minimally implicit methods for the numerical integration of the neutrino transport equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of many astrophysical systems is dominated by the interaction between matter and radiation such as photons or neutrinos. The dynamics can be described by the evolution equations of radiation hydrodynamics in which reactions between matter particles and radiation quanta couples the hydrodynamic equations to those of radiative transfer (see Munier &amp; Weaver (1986a) and Munier &amp; Weaver (1986b)). The numerical treatment has to account for their potential stiffness (e.g., in optically thick environments). In this article, we will present a new method to numerically integrate these equations in a stable way by using minimally implicit Runge-Kutta methods. With these methods, the inversion of the implicit operator can be done analytically, so the computational cost is equivalent to that of an explicit method. We strongly take into account the physical behavior of the evolved variables in the limit of the stiff regime in the derivation of the methods. We will show the results of applying these methods to the reactions between neutrinos and matter in some tests and also in realistic core-collapse supernovae simulations.</description>

      <title>Circumstellar Interaction in the Ultraviolet Spectra of SN 2023ixf 14-66 Days After Explosion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SN 2023ixf was discovered in M101 within a day of explosion and rapidly classified as a Type II supernova with flash features. Here we present ultraviolet (UV) spectra obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope 14, 19, 24, and 66 days after explosion. Interaction between the supernova ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM) is seen in the UV throughout our observations in the flux of the first three epochs and asymmetric Mg II emission on day 66. We compare our observations to CMFGEN supernova models that include CSM interaction ($\dot{M}&lt;10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) and find that the power from CSM interaction is decreasing with time, from $L_{\rm sh}\approx5\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $L_{\rm sh}\approx1\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ between days 14 and 66. We examine the contribution of individual atomic species to the spectra on days 14 and 19, showing that the majority of the features are dominated by iron, nickel, magnesium, and chromium absorption in the ejecta. The UV spectral energy distribution of SN 2023ixf sits between that of supernovae which show no definitive signs of CSM interaction and those with persistent signatures assuming the same progenitor radius and metallicity. Finally, we show that the evolution and asymmetric shape of the Mg II $\lambda\lambda$ 2796, 2802 emission are not unique to SN 2023ixf. These observations add to the early measurements of dense, confined CSM interaction, tracing the mass-loss history of SN 2023ixf to $\sim33$ yr prior to the explosion and the density profile to a radius of $\sim5.7\times10^{15}$ cm. They show the relatively short evolution from a quiescent red supergiant wind to high mass loss.</description>

      <title>Strange stars admixed with dark matter: equiparticle model in a two fluid approach</title>

Abstract: In this work we explore the possible scenario of strange stars admixed with fermionic or bosonic dark matter. For the description of the ``visible'' sector, we use a specific phenomenological quark model that takes into account in-medium effects for the quark masses through a suitable baryonic density dependence, in which the free parameters are chosen from the analysis of the stellar matter stability window (parametrizations presenting lower energy per baryon than iron nuclei). In the case of the dark sector, we investigate the predictions of fermionic and bosonic models. In the former we consider a spin $1/2$ dark particle, and the latter is described by a dark scalar meson. Both models present a repulsive vector interaction, particularly important for the bosonic model since it helps avoiding the collapse of the star due to the lack of the degeneracy pressure. Our results point out to possible stable strange stars configurations in agreement with data from PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, NICER and HESS J1731-347. As another feature, we find stars with dark matter halo configurations for lower values of the dark particle mass.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength spectroscopic analysis of the ULX Holmberg II X-1 and its nebula suggests the presence of a heavy black hole accreting from a B-type donor</title>

Abstract: Ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are high-mass X-ray binaries with an X-ray luminosity above $10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. These ULXs can be powered by black holes that are more massive than $20M_\odot$, accreting in a standard regime, or lighter compact objects accreting supercritically. There are only a few ULXs with known optical or UV counterparts, and their nature is debated. Determining whether optical/UV radiation is produced by the donor star or by the accretion disc is crucial for understanding ULX physics and testing massive binary evolution. We conduct, for the first time, a fully consistent multi-wavelength spectral analysis of a ULX and its circumstellar nebula. We aim to establish the donor star type and test the presence of strong disc winds in the prototypical ULX Holmberg II X-1 (Ho II X-1). We intent to obtain a realistic spectral energy distribution of the ionising source, which is needed for robust nebula analysis. We acquired new UV spectra of Ho II X-1 with the HST and complemented them with archival optical and X-ray data. We explored the spectral energy distribution of the source and analysed the spectra using the stellar atmosphere code PoWR and the photoionisation code Cloudy. Our analysis of the X-ray, UV, and optical spectra of Ho II X-1 and its nebula consistently explains the observations. We do not find traces of disc wind signatures in the UV and the optical, rejecting previous claims of the ULX being a supercritical accretor. The optical/UV counterpart of HoII X-1 is explained by a B-type supergiant donor star. Thus, the observations are fully compatible with Ho II X-1 being a close binary consisting of an $\gtrsim 66\,M_\odot$ black hole accreting matter from an $\simeq 22 M_\odot$ B-supergiant companion. Also, we propose a possible evolution scenario for the system, suggesting that Ho II X-1 is a potential gravitational wave source progenitor.</description>

      <title>Standard Siren Cosmology with Gravitational Waves from Binary Black Hole Mergers in Active Galaxy Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GW) with an electromagnetic counterpart enabled the first Hubble Constant $H_0$ measurement through the standard siren method. Current constraints suggest that $\sim 20-30\%$ of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) Binary Black Hole (BBH) mergers might occur in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks. The claim for a possible association of several BBH mergers with flaring AGNs suggests that cosmological analyses using BBH and AGNs might be promising. We explore standard siren analyses through a method that takes into account the presence of background flaring AGNs, without requiring a unique host galaxy identification, and apply it to realistic GW simulations. Depending on the fraction of LVK BBHs that induce flares, we expect to constrain $H_0$ at the $\sim 6-7\%$ ($\sim 4-5\%$) precision with $\sim 2-3$ years or $\sim 160-240$ events ($\sim 1$ year or $500$ events) of LVK at design (A+) sensitivity, assuming that systematic BBH follow-up searches are performed. %Assuming a more restrictive $\Omega_{\rm m}$ prior and that at least $20\%$ of BBHs produces detectable flares, we may reach a $3\%$ ($2\%$) precision in $H_0$ after 2 (1) year of LVK at design (A+) sensitivity. We also show that in a scenario where only $\sim 1\%$ of the BBHs induce detectable flares it is possible to achieve an $H_0$ precision from $7.5\%$ to $15\%$ with $\sim 240$ events. In addition, a $\sim 5-27\%$ precision is achievable with complete AGN catalogs and 1 year of LVK run, without the need of any flare identification.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutron star matter from the slope of the mass-radius curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the implications of information about local derivatives from the mass-radius diagram in neutron star matter. It is expected that the next generation of gravitational wave and electromagnetic detectors will allow the determination of the neutron star radius and mass with a small uncertainty. Observations of neutron stars clustered around a given neutron star mass allow the estimation of local derivatives in the $M(R)$ diagram, which can be used to constrain neutron star properties. From a model-independent description of the neutron star equation of state, it is shown that a $M(R)$ curve with a negative slope at 1.4$M_\odot$ predicts a $2M_\odot$ neutron star radius below 12 km. Furthermore, a maximum mass below 2.3$M_\odot$ is obtained if the $M(R)$ slope is negative in the whole range of masses above $1M_\odot$, and a maximum mass above 2.4$M_\odot$ requires the $M(R)$ slope to be positive in some range of masses. Constraints on the mass-radius curve of neutron stars will place strong constraints on microscopic models.</description>
