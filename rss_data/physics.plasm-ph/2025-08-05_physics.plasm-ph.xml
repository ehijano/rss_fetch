      <title>Imposing quasineutrality on electrostatic plasmas via the Dirac theory of constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for imposing quasineutrality and, more generally, charge density conservation in the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) and Vlasov-Amp\`ere (VA) systems, which describe electrostatic plasma dynamics, by applying the Dirac theory of constraints. Leveraging the Hamiltonian field formulations of the VP and VA models, we construct generalized Dirac brackets using the Dirac algorithm. The resulting constrained systems enforce charge density conservation, and consequently quasineutrality, through new advection terms in the Vlasov equations involving generalized-force terms, while the electric field is eliminated from the constrained Vlasov dynamics. To verify charge density conservation we conduct one-dimensional numerical experiments using a semi-Lagrangian method, demonstrating that the enforcement of the quasineutrality constraint significantly modifies the dynamics. This approach enables us to identify the forces required to enforce quasineutrality, offering a systematic way to assess the validity of the quasineutral approximation across different kinetic scales.</description>

      <title>Gyrotropy-Induced Symmetry Breaking of Erosion Hot Spots on Antenna Limiters during High-Power Tokamak RF Operation: Mechanisms and Mitigation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies heating (ICRH) and current drive will be essential for sustaining high-performance plasmas in next-generation fusion devices (e.g. ITER, SPARC). ICRH actuators routinely produce localized hot spots on limiters and nearby components, posing serious risks to antenna reliability, material survivability, and overall plasma performance. Remarkably, these hot spots are often strongly asymmetric, even with nominally symmetric plasma conditions and antenna geometries. We show that such asymmetries exist intrinsically in the wave physics rather than solely being due to misalignment or edge plasma variation. Our results strongly suggest that this asymmetry can be compensated for by using either poloidal phasing control (which e.g. the under construction WEST traveling wave antenna can do) or modified limiter shapes, suppressing peak sputtering by a factor $\sim$3 and reducing total erosion by a factor of $\sim$2 compared to state-of-the-art designs. This capability is essential for sustaining high-power, long-duration ICRH operation in reactor-scale devices and other next-generation fusion systems. By distributing heat and particle fluxes more evenly across antenna surfaces, optimized limiter shaping provides a clear pathway to robust, reliable ICRH performance in existing and planned fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Influence of finite ion Larmor radius on the dynamics of weakly-collisional plasma jets colliding in magnetic arch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of the finite ion Larmor radius on the dynamics of two counterstreaming weakly collisional plasma flows in a magnetic field of an arch configuration is considered. Hybrid numerical simulations show that in a system whose dimensions are close to the ion Larmor radius, more intense interaction dynamics are observed, the magnetic arch experiences a significant expansion with the formation of a region with an irregular character of magnetic lines, in which magnetic reconnection processes occur. In this case, the generation of a surface wave of the ion-cyclotron range is observed at the boundaries of the arch. An increase in the scale of the system compared to the ion Larmor radius leads to a transition to the ideal MHD regime, in which the evolution of the arch occurs much more slowly, and the development of instabilities is not observed.</description>

      <title>EIE calculation and Collisional-Radiative modeling for Na-like Kr and Xe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an extension to our previous work [1], a comprehensive theoretical study for Na-like Krypton and Xenon is carried out. Using MCDHF (Multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartee-Fock) along with RDW (Relativistic distorted wave) theory we calculate key atomic properties, electron-impact excitation (EIE), rate coefficients, and collision strength for these ions. We use these parameters to build a Collisional-Radiative model for Na-like Krypton and Xenon. For Na-like Krypton we compare our computed excitation energy, EIE cross-sections, rate coefficients, emission line intensity with previous work. Additionally we investigate variation of line ratios with temperature. For Na-like Xenon we compared excitation energy for various fine-structure with NIST( [2]) database and then provide our computed results for EIE cross-section,intensity profile, and the temperature dependence of line ratios for Na-like Xenon. Our findings offer atomic data for studies related Na-like ions.</description>

      <title>Counting topological interface modes using simplicial characteristic classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A computational approach for predicting the number of topological interface modes (TIMs) in hermitian systems using the spectral flow - monopole (SFM) correspondence is presented. The number of TIMs is determined by calculating the Chern number of a complex line bundle of local polarisation vectors over a phase space sphere surrounding a Weyl point. The Chern number is computed by constructing the simplicial first Chern class of a discrete vector bundle on a simplicial mesh. This approach is gauge invariant, derivative free, structure preserving, and robust to noise. The algorithm is shown to reproduce the expected number of TIMs for the case of equatorial fluid waves and the topological Langmuir cyclotron wave. The possibility of using this algorithm to analyse experimental measurements of bulk wave polarisations and predict the associated number of TIMs is explored in a synthetic example.</description>

      <title>Plasma Dynamics in Higher-Derivative Electrodynamics: A Renormalised Two-Loop Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a finite-temperature study of Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics, following electron-proton plasmas through one- and two-loop order with dimensional regularisation and hard-thermal-loop resummation. The higher-derivative operator is found to generate no new ultraviolet divergences; all counter-terms reduce to the single photon wave-function factor of ordinary QED. The static inter-particle force acquires a double-Yukawa profile, the familiar Debye term plus an opposite-signed contribution from the heavy Podolsky pole that removes the Coulomb singularity at sub-femtometre distances, providing an intrinsic ultraviolet completion of electrostatics. Gauge symmetry drives the transverse photon self-energy to zero at vanishing momentum, so no magnetic screening mass appears at any perturbative order. In a covariantly constant background the full two-loop sunset diagram yields a single, dimension-eight operator suppressed by T^2/M^2, implying permille-level shifts in thermodynamic quantities for realistic plasmas. The exact Debye mass and a leading-log calculation show the dc electrical conductivity exceeds its QED value by less than 10^-4. Conditions for observable Podolsky plasmons and cosmological constraints are identified, supplying precise benchmarks for future strong-field, collider and lattice investigations.</description>

      <title>Orientational Effects in the Low Pair Continuum of Aluminium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the predictions of the dynamic structure factor (DSF) of ambient polycrystalline aluminium from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) in the pair continuum regime to recent ultrahigh resolution x-ray Thomson scattering measurements, collected at the European XFEL. TDDFT predicts strong anisotropy in the DSF at the wavenumber examined here, even with $q$-blurring accounted for. The experimental spectrum has more than sufficient resolution and signal-to-noise levels to resolve these orientation dependencies, and therefore the orientational averaging of the polycrystalline sample is observed rigorously. Once the orientation averaging is accounted for, TDDFT is able to reproduce the experimental spectrum adequately. Finally, comparisons of predicted DSFs from jellium to experiment demonstrates the importance of accounting for lattice effects in modelling the spectrum from a polycrystal.</description>

      <title>Anomalous pinch in electron-electron beam collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that an anomalous pinch can occur in ultrarelativistic electron-electron or positron-positron beam interaction, caused by the combined interplay of collective beam motion (disruption) and strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SF-QED). The locally created electron-positron pairs, from SF-QED effects, screen the self-fields of the beams and can invert the polarity of the Lorentz force resulting in a pinch of the beams. A theoretical model predicts the pinch condition and is confirmed by first-principles 3-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. This anomalous pinch enhances density compression, increases the collision luminosity, and amplifies the local magnetic fields and the quantum parameter of the beam particles by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Learning Plasma Dynamics and Robust Rampdown Trajectories with Predict-First Experiments at TCV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rampdown phase of a tokamak pulse is difficult to simulate and often exacerbates multiple plasma instabilities. To reduce the risk of disrupting operations, we leverage advances in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) to combine physics with data-driven models, developing a neural state-space model (NSSM) that predicts plasma dynamics during Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) rampdowns. The NSSM efficiently learns dynamics from a modest dataset of 311 pulses with only five pulses in a reactor-relevant high-performance regime. The NSSM is parallelized across uncertainties, and reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to design trajectories that avoid instability limits. High-performance experiments at TCV show statistically significant improvements in relevant metrics. A predict-first experiment, increasing plasma current by 20% from baseline, demonstrates the NSSM's ability to make small extrapolations. The developed approach paves the way for designing tokamak controls with robustness to considerable uncertainty and demonstrates the relevance of SciML for fusion experiments.</description>

      <title>Laguerre-Gaussian pulses for spin-polarized ion beam acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarized particle sources have a plethora of applications, ranging from deep-inelastic scattering to nuclear fusion. One crucial challenge in laser-plasma interaction is maintaining the initial polarization of the target. Here, we propose the acceleration of spin-polarized Helium-3 from near-critical density targets using high-intensity Laguerre-Gaussian laser pulses. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that Magnetic Vortex Acceleration with these modes yields higher polarization on the 90%-level compared to conventional Gaussian laser pulses, while also providing low-divergence beams.</description>

      <title>Scalable Chrysopoeia via $(n, 2n)$ Reactions Driven by Deuterium-Tritium Fusion Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A scalable approach for chrysopoeia - the transmutation of base metals into gold - has been pursued for millennia. While there have been small-scale demonstrations in particle accelerators and proposals involving thermal neutron capture, no economically attractive approach has yet been identified. We show a new scalable method to synthesize stable gold $\left( \mathrm{^{197}Au} \right)$ from the abundant mercury isotope $\mathrm{^{198}Hg}$ using $(n, 2n)$ reactions in a specialized neutron multiplier layer of a fusion blanket. Reactions are driven by fast $14\, \mathrm{MeV}$ neutrons provided by a deuterium-tritium fusion plasma, which are uniquely capable of enabling the desired reaction pathway at scale. Crucially, the scheme identified here does not negatively impact electricity production, and is also compatible with the challenging tritium breeding requirements of fusion power plant design because $(n, 2n)$ reactions of $\mathrm{^{198}Hg}$ drive both transmutation and neutron multiplication. Using neutronics simulations, we demonstrate a tokamak with a blanket configuration that can produce $\mathrm{^{197}Au}$ at a rate of about 2t/$\mathrm{GW_{th}}$/yr. Implementation of this concept allows fusion power plants to double the revenue generated by the system, dramatically enhancing the economic viability of fusion energy.</description>
