      <title>Improved Velocity-Verlet Algorithm for the Discrete Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Discrete Element Method is widely employed for simulating granular flows, but conventional integration techniques may produce unphysical results for simulations with static friction when particle size ratios exceed $R \approx 3$. These inaccuracies arise because some variables in the velocity-Verlet algorithm are calculated at the half-timestep, while others are computed at the full timestep. To correct this, we develop an improved velocity-Verlet integration algorithm to ensure physically accurate outcomes up to the largest size ratios examined ($R=100$). The implementation of this improved integration method within the LAMMPS framework is detailed, and its effectiveness is validated through a simple three-particle test case and a more general example of granular flow in mixtures with large size-ratios, for which we provide general guidelines for selecting simulation parameters and accurately modeling inelasticity in large particle size-ratio simulations.</description>

      <title>Rectangular finite elements for modeling the mechanical behavior of auxetic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the application of rectangular finite elements to model the stress-strain behavior of isotropic and orthotropic materials exhibiting negative Poisson's ratio, known as auxetic materials, under static shear conditions within linear elasticity. By employing the classical compatible shape functions for linear interpolation and the incompatible shape functions for quadratic interpolation within a displacement-based finite element framework, the research assesses the effectiveness of these approaches in capturing the mechanical response of auxetic materials. Additionally, the analytical expression for an incompatible rectangular finite element applicable to orthotropic materials is proposed. Hexachiral and re-entrant honeycomb structures, known for their auxetic behavior, are modeled as continuous media with homogenized properties using analytical expressions for their effective material constants. The findings reveal that while the classical shape functions may suffice for displacement modeling, they fall short in accurately predicting stress distributions in auxetic materials. In contrast, the incompatible shape functions demonstrate superior performance in providing appropriate stress and displacement predictions. This work underscores the relevance of using the incompatible rectangular finite elements in the modeling of advanced materials with a negative Poisson's ratio. It provides computationally efficient approaches for calculating auxetic honeycomb structures and their derived multilayer composites.</description>

      <title>A Transformer Based Generative Chemical Language AI Model for Structural Elucidation of Organic Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For over half a century, computer-aided structural elucidation systems (CASE) for organic compounds have relied on complex expert systems with explicitly programmed algorithms. These systems are often computationally inefficient for complex compounds due to the vast chemical structural space that must be explored and filtered. In this study, we present a transformer based generative chemical language artificial intelligence (AI) model, an innovative end-to-end architecture designed to replace the logic and workflow of the classic CASE framework for ultra-fast and accurate spectroscopic-based structural elucidation. Our model employs an encoder-decoder architecture and self-attention mechanisms, similar to those in large language models, to directly generate the most probable chemical structures that match the input spectroscopic data. This approach demonstrates the potential of transformer based generative AI to accelerate traditional scientific problem-solving processes. The model's ability to iterate quickly based on new data highlights its potential for rapid advancements in structural elucidation.</description>

      <title>Energy-Preserving Coupling of Explicit Particle-In-Cell with Monte Carlo Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Particle-In-Cell (PIC) and Monte Carlo Collisions (MCC) methods are workhorses of many numerical simulations of physical systems. Recently, it was pointed out that, while the two methods can be exactly - or nearly - energy-conserving independently, combining the two is leading to anomalous numerical heating. This paper reviews the standard explicit PIC-MCC algorithm, elucidates the origins of the anomalous numerical heating and explains how to couple the two methods such that the anomalous numerical heating is avoided.</description>

      <title>AutoFLUKA: A Large Language Model Based Framework for Automating Monte Carlo Simulations in FLUKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, particularly using FLUKA, are essential for replicating real-world scenarios across scientific and engineering fields. Despite the robustness and versatility, FLUKA faces significant limitations in automation and integration with external post-processing tools, leading to workflows with a steep learning curve, which are time-consuming and prone to human errors. Traditional methods involving the use of shell and Python scripts, MATLAB, and Microsoft Excel require extensive manual intervention and lack flexibility, adding complexity to evolving scenarios. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents to address these limitations. AI agents, integrate natural language processing with autonomous reasoning for decision-making and adaptive planning, making them ideal for automation. We introduce AutoFLUKA, an AI agent application developed using the LangChain Python Framework to automate typical MC simulation workflows in FLUKA. AutoFLUKA can modify FLUKA input files, execute simulations, and efficiently process results for visualization, significantly reducing human labor and error. Our case studies demonstrate that AutoFLUKA can handle both generalized and domain-specific cases, such as Microdosimetry, with an streamlined automated workflow, showcasing its scalability and flexibility. The study also highlights the potential of Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) tools to act as virtual assistants for FLUKA, further improving user experience, time and efficiency. In conclusion, AutoFLUKA represents a significant advancement in automating MC simulation workflows, offering a robust solution to the inherent limitations. This innovation not only saves time and resources but also opens new paradigms for research and development in high energy physics, medical physics, nuclear engineering space and environmental science.</description>

      <title>Structural, mechanical, and electronic properties of single graphyne layers based on a 2D biphenylene network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene is a promising material for the development of applications in nanoelectronic devices, but the lack of a band gap necessitates the search for ways to tune its electronic properties. In addition to doping, defects, and nanoribbons, a more radical alternative is the development of 2D forms with structures that are in clear departure from the honeycomb lattice, such as graphynes, with the distinctive property of involving carbon atoms with both hybridizations sp and sp2. The density and details of how the acetylenic links are distributed allow for a variety of electronic signatures. Here we propose a graphyne system based on the recently synthesized biphenylene monolayer. We demonstrate that this system features highly localized states with a spin-polarized semiconducting configuration. We study its stability and show that the system's structural details directly influence its highly anisotropic electronic properties. Finally, we show that the symmetry of the frontier states can be further tuned by modulating the size of the acetylenic chains forming the system.</description>

      <title>Programmable entangled qubit states on a linear-optical platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental platform for linear-optical quantum information processing. Our setup utilizes multiphoton generation using a high-quality single-photon source, which is demultiplexed across multiple spatial channels, a custom-designed, programmable, low-loss photonic chip, and paired with high-efficiency single-photon detectors. We demonstrate the platform's capability in producing heralded arbitrary two-qubit dual-rail encoded states, a crucial building block for large-scale photonic quantum computers. The programmable chip was fully characterized through a calibration process that allowed us to create a numerical model accounting for fabrication imperfections and measurement errors. As a result, using on-chip quantum state tomography (QST), we achieved high-fidelity quantum state preparation, with a fidelity of 98.5\% specifically for the Bell state.</description>

      <title>Protein structure classification based on X-ray laser induced Coulomb explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulated the Coulomb explosion dynamics due to the fast ionization induced by high-intensity X-rays in six proteins that share similar atomic content and shape. We followed and projected the trajectory of the fragments onto a virtual detector, providing a unique explosion footprint. After collecting 500 explosion footprints for each protein, we utilized principal component analysis and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding to classify these. The results show that the classification algorithms were able to separate proteins on the basis of explosion footprints from structurally similar proteins into distinct groups. The explosion footprints, therefore, provide a unique identifier for each of the proteins. We envision that method could be used concurrently with single particle coherent imaging experiments to provide additional information on shape, mass, or conformation.</description>

      <title>Automated Workflow for Accurate High-Throughput GW Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The GW approximation represents the state-of-the-art ab-initio method for computing excited-state properties. Its execution requires control over a larger number of (often interdependent) parameters, and therefore its application in high-throughput studies is hindered by the intricate and time-consuming convergence process across a multi-dimensional parameter space. To address these challenges, here we develop a fully-automated open-source workflow for G$_0$W$_0$ calculations within the AiiDA-VASP plugin architecture. The workflow is based on an efficient estimation of the errors on the quasi-particle (QP) energies due to basis-set truncation and the pseudo-potential norm violation, which allows a reduction of the dimensionality of the parameter space and avoids the need for multi-dimensional convergence searches. Protocol validation is conducted through a systematic comparison against established experimental and state-of-the-art GW data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, we construct a database of QP energies for a diverse dataset of over 320 bulk structures. The openly accessible workflow and resulting dataset can serve as a valuable resource and reference for conducting accurate data-driven research.</description>

      <title>Partial Orientation Retrieval of Proteins From Coulomb Explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single Particle Imaging techniques at X-ray lasers have made significant strides, yet the challenge of determining the orientation of freely rotating molecules during delivery remains. In this study, we propose a novel method to partially retrieve the relative orientation of proteins exposed to ultrafast X-ray pulses by analyzing the fragmentation patterns resulting from Coulomb explosions. We simulate these explosions for 45 proteins in the size range 100 -- 4000 atoms using a hybrid Monte Carlo/Molecular Dynamics approach and capture the resulting ion ejection patterns with virtual detectors. Our goal is to exploit information from the explosion to infer orientations of proteins at the time of X-ray exposure. Our results demonstrate that partial orientation information can be extracted, particularly for larger proteins. Our findings can be integrated into existing reconstruction algorithms such as Expand-Maximize-Compress, to improve their efficiency and reduce the need for high-quality diffraction patterns. This method offers a promising avenue for enhancing Single Particle Imaging by leveraging measurable data from the Coulomb explosion to provide valuable insights about orientation.</description>

      <title>Fast Perfekt: Regression-based refinement of fast simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The availability of precise and accurate simulation is a limiting factor for interpreting and forecasting data in many fields of science and engineering. Often, one or more distinct simulation software applications are developed, each with a relative advantage in accuracy or speed. The quality of insights extracted from the data stands to increase if the accuracy of faster, more economical simulation could be improved to parity or near parity with more resource-intensive but accurate simulation. We present Fast Perfekt, a machine-learned regression that employs residual neural networks to refine the output of fast simulations. A deterministic morphing model is trained using a unique schedule that makes use of the ensemble loss function MMD, with the option of an additional pair-based loss function such as the MSE. We explore this methodology in the context of an abstract analytical model and in terms of a realistic particle physics application featuring jet properties in hadron collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The refinement makes maximum use of domain knowledge, and introduces minimal computational overhead to production.</description>

      <title>Deep Multimodal Representation Learning for Stellar Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, contrastive learning (CL), a technique most prominently used in natural language and computer vision, has been used to train informative representation spaces for galaxy spectra and images in a self-supervised manner. Following this idea, we implement CL for stars in the Milky Way, for which recent astronomical surveys have produced a huge amount of heterogeneous data. Specifically, we investigate Gaia XP coefficients and RVS spectra. Thus, the methods presented in this work lay the foundation for aggregating the knowledge implicitly contained in the multimodal data to enable downstream tasks like cross-modal generation or fused stellar parameter estimation. We find that CL results in a highly structured representation space that exhibits explicit physical meaning. Evaluating Using this representation space to perform cross-modal generation and stellar label regression results in excellent performance with high-quality generated samples as well as accurate and precise label predictions.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary photonic environments using FDTD: beyond the semi-classical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical algorithm that integrates quantum two-level systems (TLSs) into the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework for simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary 3D photonic environments. Conventional methods struggle with these systems due to their semi-classical nature and spurious self-interactions that arise when a TLS is driven by its own radiation field. We address these issues by determining the correct electric field for driving the TLS, as well as the current source used in FDTD for modeling photon emission. Our method, focusing on single-excitation states, employs a total field-incident field (TF-IF) technique to eliminate self-interactions, enabling precise simulations of photon emission and scattering. The algorithm also successfully models complex phenomena such as resonant energy transfer, superradiance, and vacuum Rabi splitting. This powerful computational tool is expected to substantially advance research in nanophotonics, quantum physics, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Hyperparameter Optimisation in Deep Learning from Ensemble Methods: Applications to Proton Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models are defined in terms of a large number of hyperparameters, such as network architectures and optimiser settings. These hyperparameters must be determined separately from the model parameters such as network weights, and are often fixed by ad-hoc methods or by manual inspection of the results. An algorithmic, objective determination of hyperparameters demands the introduction of dedicated target metrics, different from those adopted for the model training. Here we present a new approach to the automated determination of hyperparameters in deep learning models based on statistical estimators constructed from an ensemble of models sampling the underlying probability distribution in model space. This strategy requires the simultaneous parallel training of up to several hundreds of models and can be effectively implemented by deploying hardware accelerators such as GPUs. As a proof-of-concept, we apply this method to the determination of the partonic substructure of the proton within the NNPDF framework and demonstrate the robustness of the resultant model uncertainty estimates. The new GPU-optimised NNPDF code results in a speed-up of up to two orders of magnitude, a stabilisation of the memory requirements, and a reduction in energy consumption of up to 90% as compared to sequential CPU-based model training. While focusing on proton structure, our method is fully general and is applicable to any deep learning problem relying on hyperparameter optimisation for an ensemble of models.</description>

      <title>Toward Routing River Water in Land Surface Models with Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14212</link>

Abstract: Machine learning is playing an increasing role in hydrology, supplementing or replacing physics-based models. One notable example is the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for forecasting streamflow given observed precipitation and geographic characteristics. Training of such a model over the continental United States (CONUS) demonstrated that a single set of model parameters can be used across independent catchments, and that RNNs can outperform physics-based models. In this work, we take a next step and study the performance of RNNs for river routing in land surface models (LSMs). Instead of observed precipitation, the LSM-RNN uses instantaneous runoff calculated from physics-based models as an input. We train the model with data from river basins spanning the globe and test using historical streamflow measurements. The model demonstrates skill at generalization across basins (predicting streamflow in catchments not used in training) and across time (predicting streamflow during years not used in training). We compare the predictions from the LSM-RNN to an existing physics-based model calibrated with a similar dataset and find that the LSM-RNN outperforms the physics-based model. Our results show that RNNs are effective for global streamflow prediction from runoff inputs and motivate the development of complete routing models that can capture nested sub-basis connections.</description>

      <title>A single layer representation of the scattered field for multiple scattering problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scattering of scalar waves by a set of scatterers is considered. It is proven that the scattered field can be represented as an integral supported by any smooth surface enclosing the scatterers. This is a generalization of the series expansion over spherical harmonics and spherical Bessel functions for spherical geometries. More precisely, given a set of scatterers, the field scattered by any subset can be expressed as an integral over any smooth surface enclosing the given subset alone. It is then possible to solve the multiple scattering problem by using this integral representation instead of an expansion over spherical harmonics. This result is used to develop an extension of the Fast Multipole Method in order to deal with subsets that are not enclosed within non-intersecting balls.</description>

      <title>Exponential quantum advantages for practical non-Hermitian eigenproblems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While non-Hermitian physics has attracted considerable attention, current studies are limited to small or classically solvable systems. Quantum computing, as a powerful eigensolver, have predominantly been applied to Hermitian domain, leaving their potential for studying non-Hermitian problems largely unexplored. We extend the power of quantum computing to general non-Hermitian eigenproblems. Our approach works for finding eigenvalues without extra constrains, or eigenvalues closest to specified points or lines, thus extending results for ground energy and energy gap problems for Hermitian matrices. Our algorithms have broad applications, and as examples, we consider two central problems in non-Hermitian physics. Firstly, our approach is the first to offer an efficient quantum solution to the witness of spontaneous $PT$-symmetry breaking, and provide provable, exponential quantum advantage. Secondly, our approach enables the estimation of Liouvillian gap, which is crucial for characterizing relaxation times. Our general approach can also find applications in many other areas, such as the study of Markovian stochastic processes. These results underscore the significance of our quantum algorithms for addressing practical eigenproblems across various disciplines.</description>

      <title>A novel direct Helmholtz solver in inhomogeneous media based on the operator Fourier transform functional calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents novel numerical algorithms based on pseudodifferential operators for fast, direct, solution of the Helmholtz equation in 1D, 2D, and 3D inhomogeneous unbounded media. The proposed approach relies on an Operator Fourier Transform (OFT) representation of pseudodifferential operators ({\Psi}DO) which frame the problem of computing the inverse Helmholtz operator with a spatially-dependent wave speed in terms of two sequential applications of an inverse square root {\Psi}DO. The OFT representation of the action of the inverse square root {\Psi}DO, in turn, can be effected as a superposition of solutions of a pseudo-temporal initial-boundary-value problem for a paraxial equation. The OFT framework offers several advantages over traditional direct and iterative approaches for the solution of the Helmholtz equation. The operator integral transform is amenable to standard quadrature methods and the required pseudo-temporal paraxial equation solutions can be obtained using any suitable numerical method. A specialized quadrature is derived to evaluate the OFT efficiently and an alternating direction implicit method, used in conjunction with standard finite differences, is used to solve the requisite component paraxial equation problems. Numerical studies in 1D, 2D, and 3D are presented to confirm the expected OFT-based Helmholtz solver convergence rate. In addition, the efficiency and versatility of our proposed approach is demonstrated by tackling nontrivial wave propagation problems, including two-dimensional plane wave scattering from a geometrically complex inhomogeneity, three-dimensional scattering from turbulent channel flow and plane wave transmission through a spherically-symmetric gradient-index Luneburg lens. All computations, 3D problems which involve solving the Helmholtz equation with more than one billion complex unknowns, are performed in a single workstation.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Design Rules for Tunable Emission in Graphene Quantum Dots: A High-Throughput TDDFT and Machine Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations of fluorescence emission energies for 284 distinct graphene quantum dots (GQDs) of varying shapes (square, hexagonal, and amorphous) and sizes ($\sim$1-2 nm). These GQDs are doped with one or two elements from B, N, O, S, and P at dopant percentages of 1.5%, 3%, 5%, and 7%. Our study systematically investigates the trends and patterns in emission energies as a function of shape, size, dopant type and dopant percentage. Twelve structures are identified to have emission wavelengths in the visible spectrum. The emission energies derived from our calculations can guide the formulation of specific GQD mixtures to achieve desired emission spectra within and beyond the visible range for industrial applications. Furthermore, the extensive dataset, including emission energies along with molecular structures generated in this work, creates a DFT dateset for further machine learning studies.</description>

      <title>Automated High-throughput Organic Crystal Structure Prediction via Population-based Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With advancements in computational molecular modeling and powerful structure search methods, it is now possible to systematically screen crystal structures for small organic molecules. In this context, we introduce the Python package High-throughput Organic Crystal Structure Prediction (HTOCSP), which enables the prediction and screening of crystal packing for small organic molecules in an automated, high-throughput manner. Specifically, we describe the workflow, which encompasses molecular analysis, force field generation, and crystal generation and sampling, all within customized constraints based on user input. We demonstrate the application of \texttt{HTOCSP} by systematically screening organic crystals for 100 molecules using different sampling strategies and force field options. Furthermore, we analyze the benchmark results to understand the underlying factors that influence the complexity of the crystal energy landscape. Finally, we discuss the current limitations of the package and potential future extensions.</description>

      <title>Phonon Dephasing, Entanglement and Exchange-Only Toffoli Gate Sequence in Quantum Dot Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum dot spin chain system is vital for quantum simulation and studying collective electron behaviors, necessitating an understanding of its mechanisms and control protocols. Chapter 1 introduces key concepts, focusing on the extended Hubbard model, double quantum dot systems, and electron-phonon coupling. Chapter 2 explores electron-phonon coupling in multielectron double quantum dots under unbiased and biased scenarios via detuning variations. In the unbiased case, dephasing due to electron-phonon coupling generally increases with more electrons in the right dot; this trend is inconsistent in the biased case, suggesting potential advantages of multielectron quantum dots under certain conditions. Chapter 3 investigates entanglement entropy in a multielectron quantum dot spin chain described by the extended Hubbard model. Local and pairwise entanglement are influenced by Coulomb interactions, tunneling strengths, electronic configurations, and site potential energies. The entanglement diagram reveals phase transitions significantly impacted by coupling strength ratios and potential energy variations; adjusting the potential energy of a specific dot critically influences ground state configurations and entanglement entropy. Chapter 4, inspired by the decoherence-free subspace concept, explores operation sequences in a nine-spin, nine-quantum-dot system defined by the Heisenberg model, with bases determined by total angular momentum quantum numbers. Employing the Krotov method of quantum optimal control, we identify a more efficient pulse-level operation sequence for an exchange-only quantum dot spin chain, offering a superior alternative to conventional quantum gate decomposition and potentially enhancing the development of more concise quantum algorithm representations.</description>
