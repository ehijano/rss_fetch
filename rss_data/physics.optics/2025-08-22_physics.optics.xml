      <title>Attosecond high-harmonic interferometry probes orbital- and band-dependent dipole phase in magnesium oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control over the spatial coherence, wavefront, and focusability of emitted light relies on understanding the intrinsic phase of the emission process, and vice versa, measuring phase can reveal insights about microscopic generation mechanisms. A thorough understanding of the origin of the dipole phase in solid-state high-harmonic generation is currently missing. Here, by employing attosecond interferometry with phase-locked XUV pulses, we directly assess the intensity- and frequency-dependent dipole phases in magnesium oxide (MgO) in solid-state HHG. We also quantify a nonlinear phase shift of the fundamental and disentangle its contribution from the dipole phase. Theoretical models (analytical, two-band, and full-band numerical simulations) support our results. The analytical approach aids future solid-state HHG experiments and simulations, while the full numerical model details orbital- and band-resolved current contributions to the dipole phase. Our research delivers the first combined quantitative measurement and rigorous theoretical description of the harmonic emission phase in solids.</description>

      <title>Phase Matched Plasmonic Transmission Lines for Cascaded Second-Harmonic Generation as a Pathway to Nonlinear Logic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nonlinear nanophotonics, cascaded second-harmonic generation (SHG) in pure plasmonic waveguides for sequential signal transformation and complex on-chip functionality remains a long-standing challenge. Precise phase matching becomes instrumental to achieve efficient SHG and enable true cascading of nonlinear processes. We experimentally demonstrate phase matching in SHG is achievable in a plasmonic system between two orthogonal modes. Accurate tuning of plasmonic two-wire transmission-line (TWTL) design parameters result in SHG from the antisymmetric excitation mode being approximately 15 times stronger than that from the symmetric excitation mode, greatly raising the conversion efficiency to 0.021%. Simultaneously, phase matching extends our TWTL operational length up to 18${\mu}$m. Based on the improved efficiency and operational length, we demonstrate the feasibility of cascading multiple plasmonic waveguides. We further realize a nonlinear AND logic operation using a single 18${\mu}$m long waveguide. These results underscore the potential of phase matched plasmonic TWTLs for compact, efficient, and scalable nonlinear optical circuitry.</description>

      <title>Measurements of Optical Kerr Nonlinearity n2 in Compressed Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-power optical pulses experience self-focusing when propagating in a gaseous medium due to the manifestation of the cubic (Kerr-like) nonlinearity. The magnitude of this effect depends on the Kerr nonlinearity coefficient n2, which in turn may depend on the parameters of laser radiation and the propagation medium. We present experimental data on the coefficient n2 for atomic Ar, molecular N2 and CO2 with a pressure change from 1 to 11 bar and optical pulse duration from 50 to 500 fs of propagating femtosecond near-IR laser radiation (800 nm). Importantly, all three gases under study possess close n2-values in the short pulse limit (50 fs) over the entire pressure range. According to our data, for the first time, as far as we know, the Kerr nonlinearity in CO2 is obtained at atmospheric pressure equal to n2(CO2) = 10.0x1.1x10-24 m2/W. Meanwhile, with increasing gas pressure, effective n2 also increases due to the manifestation of aberrational pulse self-focusing caused by the development of modulation instability. In addition, according to our approximate estimate, the magnitude of the inertial component in the cubic nonlinearity of molecular gases (N2, CO2) is substantial and increases with both pulse duration and gas pressure.</description>

      <title>Real-time imaging through dynamic scattering media enabled by fixed optical modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic scattering remains a significant challenge to the practical deployment of anti-scattering imaging. Existing methods, such as transmission matrix measurements, iterative wavefront shaping, and optical phase conjugation, depend on a quasi-static assumption, requiring the object and scattering medium to remain stable during a single imaging process to enable one-to-one compensation. However, image reconstruction becomes unattainable when this assumption is violated. Here, we propose a novel imaging strategy that counteracts time-dependent scattering perturbations through a fixed modulation module. This one-to-many compensation mechanism is realized via optical diffraction neural networks (ODNNs) trained on simulated datasets. For the first time, we reveal that its feasibility stems from the optical shower-curtain effect, and its effectiveness typically within 1-2 transport mean free paths. Our approach is not only immune to speckle decorrelation but also leverages it to enhance image quality. ODNNs generalize effectively to real-world scattering medium scenarios via multi-simulated scattering media learning and reconstruct images in real time with light-speed processing. We achieve 80 Hz imaging of moving objects in dynamic scattering media with decorrelation times &lt; 1 ms, demonstrating applicability in large-field-of-view imaging and incoherent illumination scenarios. This work lays the foundation for high-speed, intelligent optical imaging, advancing practical anti-dynamic scattering techniques.</description>

      <title>Atomically thin silver films for enhanced nanoscale nonlinear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherently weak nonlinear optical response of bulk materials remains a fundamental limitation in advancing photonic technologies. Nanophotonics addresses this challenge by tailoring the size and morphology of nanostructures to manipulate the optical near field, thus modulating the nonlinear response. Here, we explore a complementary strategy based on engineering the electronic band structure in the mesoscopic regime to enhance optical nonlinearities. Specifically, we demonstrate an increase in second-harmonic generation (SHG) from crystalline silver films as their thickness is reduced down to just a few atomic monolayers. Operating at the boundary between bulk and two-dimensional systems, these ultra-thin films exhibit a pronounced enhancement of SHG with decreasing thickness. This enhancement stems from quantum confinement effects that modify the interaction between electronic states and incident light, which we explain based on quantum-mechanical calculation. Our atomically-thin crystalline silver films provide a new means to overcome the small interaction volumes inherent to nanophotonic platforms, enabling efficient nanoscale nonlinear optics with potential applications in photonics, sensing, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Speckle suppression in digital in-line holographic microscopy through liquid crystal dynamic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate speckle noise reduction in an in-line holographic imaging system using a Zwitterion-doped liquid crystal dynamic scatterer (LCDS) cell diffuser. Integrated into a minimally modified bright-field microscope, the LCDS actively modulates system's spatial coherence. The proposed solution suppresses coherent artifacts without introducing bulky moving parts, while enhancing image resolution and preserving overall system simplicity. Quantitative performance tested on a phase and amplitude test targets, as well as phase-amplitude biological sample, shows significant noise reduction and methods versatility. Though validated in a holographic in-line setup, the approach is applicable to other imaging techniques requiring compact, vibration-free speckle suppression.</description>

      <title>BIC lasing from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main applications of the bound state in the continuum (BIC) is the low-threshold lasing. Ideally, the infinite quality factor of the BIC results in the zero-threshold and zero-linewidth lasing. However, various effects disturb the infinite quality factor. Instead, we have a dense distribution of eigenmodes around a target frequency of ideal systems, giving rise to a complex mode selection under finite pumping. We here study how the lasing modes are selected in finite photonic crystals composed of dielectric spheres with gain media. We employ a semi-classical approach, the so-called steady-state ab-initio laser theory combined with the multiple-scattering method. The theory predicts that the BIC certainly results in the low-threshold lasing in the finite systems. Moreover, the localfield enhancement of the BIC stabilizes the single-mode lasing far beyond the higher lasing threshold in the noninteracting limit.</description>

      <title>Tunable Light Emission from GaAsP and GaInP Islands Grown on Silicon (001) Nanotips Wafer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the monolithic integration of GaAsP and GaInP islands, selectively grown on a CMOS-compatible Si nanotip wafer using gas-source molecular beam epitaxy via a nanoheteroepitaxy approach. These alloys span a wide electronic bandgap range, from infrared to green; making them highly attractive for optoelectronic applications in silicon photonics. In addition, the nanoheteroepitaxy method enables the growth of various alloy combinations without the need for a lattice-matched substrate. We discuss the epitaxial challenges involved, particularly the balance between growth selectivity and alloy miscibility. Despite these challenges, our work demonstrates a promising and scalable route toward tunable light sources and detectors monolithically integrated on silicon, contributing to the development of compact and efficient photonic components for next-generation silicon-based technologies.</description>

      <title>A hybrid-frequency on-chip programmable synthetic-dimension simulator with arbitrary couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-performance photonic chips provide a powerful platform for analog computing, enabling the simulation of high-dimensional physical systems using low-dimensional devices with additional synthetic dimensions. The realization of large-scale complex simulations necessitates an architecture capable of arbitrary coupling configurations (encompassing symmetric, asymmetric and long-range coupling schemes) which is also crucial for scaling up. Previous approaches rely on excessive physical components to introduce asymmetric coupling, however, are restricted in reconfiguring and scaling by the relatively complicated structures. Here, to solve this problem, we propose a hybrid-frequency synthetic-dimension simulator architecture that combines both intra-resonant and inter-resonant frequency-lattice sites, and experimentally demonstrate it using the thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chip. Employing this hybrid programmable architecture, we are able to simulate both the regular and long-range coupled forms of diverse compound-lattice models, such as the Hall ladder, Creutz ladder (symmetric) and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH, asymmetric) model, on a single chip, simultaneously reducing the experimental requirements significantly. As results, the direct readout of the bandstructure of the SSH model is able to be achieved, to be distinguished from all previous works, and important phenomena such as spin-momentum locking, topological flat band and Aharonov-Bohm cage effect are also observed with lower experimental requirements. Furthermore, applications like piecewise-continuous optical frequency shifting can be enabled by cascading our devices. Our results offer promising insights for future large-scale complex on-chip simulators with arbitrary couplings.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised physics-informed generative networks for phase retrieval from a single X-ray hologram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray phase contrast imaging significantly improves the visualization of structures with weak or uniform absorption, broadening its applications across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Propagation-based phase contrast is particularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando (tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity measurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during the measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative methods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may not be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require manual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less adaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning approach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field regime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A physics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both the phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane from a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase retrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated training data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach, as acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due to the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The algorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging conditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality reconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at beamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon. Furthermore, it enables the simultaneous retrieval of both phase and absorption information.</description>

      <title>Continuous coupling of electron beam to a thin dielectric slab waveguide yields monochromatic Cherenkov diffraction radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scheme for generation of monochromatic Cherenkov radiation in a thin dielectric layer is proposed. The electrons travel in vacuum parallel to a dielectric, exciting a single synchronous electromagnetic waveguide mode. The proposed scheme is studied quantitatively for near-infrared radiation in silicon induced by a 100-keV electron beam, using time-domain and frequency-domain numerical simulations, with material absorption and dispersion taken into account. This method of radiation generation can be scaled from ultraviolet to terahertz radiation by changing the thickness of the dielectric layer and choosing a material with low loss at the desired wavelength. Comparison with conventional Cherenkov Radiation and Cherenkov Diffraction Radiation is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable photonics have rapidly become an invaluable tool for information processing. Light-based computing accelerators are promising for boosting neural network learning and inference and optical interconnects are foreseen as a solution to the information transfer bottleneck in high-performance computing. In this study, we demonstrate the successful programming of a transformation implemented using a reconfigurable photonic circuit with a non-conventional architecture. The core of most photonic processors is an MZI-based architecture that establishes an analytical connection between the controllable parameters and circuit transformation. However, several architectures that are substantially more difficult to program have improved robustness to fabrication defects. We use two algorithms that rely on different initial datasets to reconstruct the circuit model of a complex interferometer, and then program the required unitary transformation. Both methods performed accurate circuit programming with an average fidelity above 98\%. Our results provide a strong foundation for the introduction of non-conventional interferometric architectures for photonic information processing.</description>

Abstract: Implementations of quantum key distribution (QKD) need vulnerability assessment against loopholes in their optical scheme. Most of the optical attacks involve injecting or receiving extraneous light via the communication channel. An eavesdropper can choose her attack wavelengths arbitrarily within the quantum channel passband to maximise the attack performance, exploiting spectral transparency windows of system components. Here we propose a wide-spectrum security evaluation methodology to achieve full optical spectrum safety for QKD systems. This technique requires transmittance characterisation in a wide spectral band with a high sensitivity. We report a testbench that characterises insertion loss of fiber-optic components in a wide spectral range of 400 to 2300 nm and up to 70 dB dynamic range. To illustrate practical application of the proposed methodology, we give a full Trojan-horse attack analysis for some typical QKD system configurations and discuss briefly induced-photorefraction and detector-backflash attacks. Our methodology can be used for certification of QKD systems.</description>

Abstract: Attosecond extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy measurements on the Peierls-distorted phase of the semimetal antimony (Sb) are presented. After excitation by an ultrashort, broad band near-infrared (NIR) pulse, the distortion is (partly) lifted causing the well-known coherent phonon motion of the lattice. While the overall observed dynamics generally follow a displacive excitation model, a delayed onset of the pump-induced carrier dynamics due to hot-carrier thermalization is observed, as well as a large spectral phase dependence in the coherent phonon oscillation. This is attributed to significantly different carrier relaxation timescales for carrier energies above and near the Fermi level of the semimetal and corroborated by a simple theoretical model that considers the carrier relaxation timescales in the displacive phonon model to explain the observed dynamics. Our results provide direct experimental evidence about the role of carrier-relaxation in the origin of displacive coherent phonon motion.</description>

      <title>A decomposition for transverse spins in structured vector fields</title>

Abstract: Classical vector waves can possess intricate spin angular momenta (SAM), which are \emph{perpendicular} to the propagation direction, as revealed by the recent recognition of surprisingly transverse SAM in electromagnetic (EM) fields. In this paper, we employ the Hertz potential method to define structured vector fields and analytically decompose the SAM of the wave fields in two parts. Our novel approach of decomposition not only confirms that transverse SAM may originate from the first-order spatial inhomogeneity of the Poynting momentum, but also points out that for \emph{non-planar vector waves with near fields}, an extraordinary spin appears as a distinct part out of transverse spin. By four examples of vector beams, we further demonstrate that the proposed transverse spins prevail universally in both propagating and evanescent waves. This work renews our fundamental understanding of the decomposition of SAM for classical vector waves.</description>

      <title>Achieving precision in measuring birefringence characteristics of a periodically-poled Lithium Niobate waveguide</title>

Abstract: The refraction of light in an optical medium is not only a subject of fundamental interest, but the refractive index also plays a crucial role in applications involving integrated and non-linear optics. One such application is photon-pair generation in waveguides with second-order nonlinearity. The spectral properties of the generated photon pairs are governed by the effective group refractive indices of the interacting modes, which normally are calculated via Sellmeier's equations for bulk crystals. However, in integrated optics, the effective group refractive indices experienced by the propagating modes can differ from those in bulk materials. Therefore, we present an accurate, in-situ measurement technique for determining the birefringence characteristics of a structure with high reflective end facets by performing a Fourier transformation of the light transmission spectrum and apply this method to a periodically-poled Lithium Niobate waveguide resonator in the telecom wavelength range. We directly predict important spectral figures of merit of the photon-pair generation process, which depend on the optical path length difference that can be resolved with a high precision of more than 16 standard deviations.</description>

      <title>Strongly resonant polarization dynamics of pulse trains in a spin-flip model for an excitable microlaser with delayed self-feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental observations concerning the polarization dynamics in an excitable microlaser with saturable absorber coupled to an external feedback mirror reported in [Ruschel et al. (2025) Opt. Lett. 50 (8) 2618], we propose here an in-depth theoretical investigation of the locked dynamics of regenerative vectorial pulse trains that this system produces. We perform a numerical bifurcation analysis of self-sustained pulse trains of a corresponding spin-flip model with delayed feedback. Its focus is on strongly resonant regimes, where the modulation of the peak intensities of polarized regenerative pulse trains locks to 2, 3 and 4 times the pulse regeneration time. Specifically, we identify points of strongly resonant rotation numbers on curves of torus bifurcations in the parameter plane of the amplitude and phase anisotropy parameters, and continue emerging curves of fold and period-doubling bifurcations to identify locking regions. In this way, we clarify where pulse trains show strongly resonant polarization dynamics and highlight that even weak polarization coupling in delay-coupled microlasers creates considerable dynamical richness. These results may have impact on the design of future coupled microlasers systems for neuroinspired on-chip computing, where the polarization of an excitable pulse can be used to encode or process information.</description>

      <title>Imperfect detectors for adversarial tasks with applications to quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Security analyses in quantum key distribution (QKD) and other adversarial quantum tasks often assume perfect device models. However, real-world implementations often deviate from these models. Thus, it is important to develop security proofs that account for such deviations from ideality. In this work, we develop a general framework for analysing imperfect threshold detectors, treating uncharacterised device parameters such as dark counts and detection efficiencies as adversarially controlled within some ranges. This approach enables a rigorous worst-case analysis, ensuring security proofs remain valid under realistic conditions. Our results strengthen the connection between theoretical security and practical implementations by introducing a flexible framework for integrating detector imperfections into adversarial quantum protocols.</description>

      <title>Waveguiding in two-dimensional Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phases characterized by non-Abelian charges have garnered increasing attention recently. Although Floquet (periodic-driving) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in non-Abelian topological insulators with multiple entangled energy gaps remains incompletely understood. In this work, we extend previous research by investigating higher-order topological phases featuring non-Abelian charges through Floquet engineering. Here we construct a model for two-dimensional non-Abelian higher-order topological phases on a square lattice subjected to two-step periodic driving. We find that the corner and edge states emerge and appear in all energy gaps despite the quaternion charge being trivial. Moreover, spatially exchanging the driving generates exotic interface modes-a hallmark of non-Abelian dynamics, namely non-commutativity. Notably, the non-zero composite Chern number demonstrates the non-triviality of the Floquet non-Abelian system with. We further reveal that the configuration of these quaternion-charge edge states is entirely determined by the quadruple degenerate phase-band singularities in the time evolution. Our work provides a platform for studying higher-order topological states and non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.</description>
