      <title>Lost in Transmission: When and Why LLMs Fail to Reason Globally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their many successes, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with tasks that require complex reasoning over large parts of their input. We argue that these failures arise due to capacity limits on the accurate flow of information within LLMs. To formalize this issue, we introduce the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model, a new computational framework that models bandwidth constraints on attention heads, the mechanism for internal communication in LLMs. We show that several important reasoning problems like graph reachability require high communication bandwidth for BAPOs to solve; we call these problems BAPO-hard. Our experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini succeed on BAPO-easy tasks and fail even on relatively small BAPO-hard tasks. BAPOs also reveal another benefit of chain of thought (CoT): we prove that breaking down a task using CoT can turn any BAPO-hard problem into a BAPO-easy one. Our results offer principled explanations for key LLM failures and suggest directions for architectures and inference methods that mitigate bandwidth limits.</description>

      <title>A Close Analysis of the Subset Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09891v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a nondeterministic finite-state automaton (NFA), we aim to estimate the size of an equivalent deterministic finite-state automaton (DFA). We demonstrate that computing the state complexity of an NFA within polynomial precision is PSPACE-hard. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that it is PSPACE-hard to decide whether the classical subset construction will yield an equivalent DFA with an exponential increase in the number of states. This result implies that making any a prior estimate of the running time of the subset construction is inherently difficult. To address this, and to enable forecasting of such exponential blow-up in certain special cases, we introduce the notion of subset complexity, which provides an upper bound on the size of the DFA produced by the subset construction. We show that the subset complexity can be efficiently bounded above using the cyclicity and rank of the transition matrices of the NFA. This yields a sufficient condition for identifying NFAs that can be efficiently determinized via the subset construction.</description>

      <title>Reflexive Composition of Elementary State Machines, with an Application to the Reversal of Cellular Automata Rule 90</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of a one-dimensional lattice of state machines on two states and two symbols sequentially updated via a process of "reflexive composition." The space of 256 machines exhibits a variety of behavior, including substitution, reversible "billiard ball" dynamics, and fractal nesting. We show that one machine generates the Sierpinski Triangle and, for a subset of boundary conditions, is isomorphic to cellular automata Rule 90 in Wolfram's naming scheme. More surprisingly, two other machines follow trajectories that map to Rule 90 in reverse. Whereas previous techniques have been developed to uncover preimages of Rule 90, this is the first study to produce such inverse dynamics naturally from the formalism itself. We argue that the system's symmetric treatment of state and message underlies its expressive power.</description>
