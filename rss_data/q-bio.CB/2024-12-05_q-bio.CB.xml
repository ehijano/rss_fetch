Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) poses a major public health challenge, with it being the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide as of 2024. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) CRC and deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) CRC comprise $15\%$ of all CRC and have shown remarkable response to immunotherapy, especially with PD-1 inhibitors. Mathematical models are a promising avenue for treatment optimisation, and we use delay integro-differential equations to model the interactions and dynamics of various cell types, immune checkpoints, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and cytokines. We note that many of these species are being modelled deterministically for the first time in cancer, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the complex underlying immune dynamics. We consider two compartments: the tumour site and the tumour-draining lymph node (TDLN), taking into account phenomena such as DC migration, T cell proliferation, acquired resistance to pembrolizumab, and CD8+ T cell exhaustion and reinvigoration. The parameter values and initial conditions for the model are estimated from experimental data, incorporating various pharmacokinetic, bioanalytical, and radiographic studies, as well as deconvolution of bulk RNA-sequencing data from the TCGA COADREAD database. We finally optimise CRC treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab $\unicode{x2014}$ one of the most used PD-1 inhibitors. We maximise treatment efficacy and efficiency in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC patients whilst accounting for toxicity, and improve upon currently FDA-approved therapeutic regimens for metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC. We demonstrate that a single medium-to-high dose of pembrolizumab is sufficient for effective tumour eradication, whilst being efficient, safe and practical.</description>
