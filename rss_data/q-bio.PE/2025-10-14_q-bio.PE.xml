      <title>Inhomogeneous continuous-time Markov chains to infer flexible time-varying evolutionary rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing evolutionary histories and estimating the rate of evolution from molecular sequence data is of central importance in evolutionary biology and infectious disease research. We introduce a flexible Bayesian phylogenetic inference framework that accommodates changing evolutionary rates over time by modeling sequence character substitution processes as inhomogeneous continuous-time Markov chains (ICTMCs) acting along the unknown phylogeny, where the rate remains as an unknown, positive and integrable function of time. The integral of the rate function appears in the finite-time transition probabilities of the ICTMCs that must be efficiently computed for all branches of the phylogeny to evaluate the observed data likelihood. Circumventing computational challenges that arise from a fully nonparametric function, we successfully parameterize the rate function as piecewise constant with a large number of epochs that we call the polyepoch clock model. This makes the transition probability computation relatively inexpensive and continues to flexibly capture rate change over time. We employ a Gaussian Markov random field prior to achieve temporal smoothing of the estimated rate function. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling enabled by scalable gradient evaluation under this model makes our framework computationally efficient. We assess the performance of the polyepoch clock model in recovering the true timescales and rates through simulations under two different evolutionary scenarios. We then apply the polyepoch clock model to examine the rates of West Nile virus, Dengue virus and influenza A/H3N2 evolution, and estimate the time-varying rate of SARS-CoV-2 spread in Europe in 2020.</description>

      <title>Modeling Epidemics on Multiplex Networks: Epidemic Threshold and Basic Reproduction Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate epidemic forecasting requires models that account for the layered and heterogeneous nature of real social interactions. The basic reproduction number $\mathcal R_0$ calculated from models that assume homogeneous mixing or single-layer contact structures have limited applicability to complex social systems. Here, we propose an expression of $\mathcal R_0$ in the context of multiplex networks, enabling the analysis of disease transmission across multiple social layers.
  We adapt the Degree-Based Mean-Field (DBMF) SIR model for single-layered complex networks to the multiplex setting, where each layer has its own degree distribution and infection rate. Using the Next Generation Matrix method, we derive an analytical expression for the basic reproduction number $\mathcal R_0$. Numerical integration of the multiplex DBMF equations shows that $\mathcal R_0 = 1$ marks the epidemic threshold and governs the functional dependence of key outbreak indicators. In addition to the exact result for the $\mathcal R_0$, we provide an approximation denoted as $\tau$, which is easier to compute and more straightforward to interpret in terms of the parameters of the system, and shares most of the expected properties of the basic reproduction number.
  Stochastic agent-based simulations confirm these results, demonstrating a direct correspondence between $\tau$ and the average number of secondary infections in the early epidemic phase, in line with the interpretation of $\mathcal R_0$.
  This research provides a robust generalization of $\mathcal R_0$ for layered contact structures, offering a more realistic basis for epidemic forecasting and the design of intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>An "adaptive" approach to control explosive aphid populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical models of aphid population dynamics are unable to explain multi-peak patterns in field populations. We consider the variable carrying capacity model (VCM), which can generate such complex multi-peak dynamics, but is also demonstrated to show finite-time blow-up behavior via a sign switching structural instability. We build an adaptive behavioral model with a density-dependent switch to stabilize growth, effectively eliminating blow-up, and also capable of generating multiple peaks. Furthermore, guided by empirical work on environment drivers for pests, we devise a non-autonomous model with time-dependent host plant fitness, successfully connecting transient population dynamics with abiotic drivers such as flooding. Finally, we discuss the practical significance of the results through the Economic Threshold (ET) and Economic Injury Level (EIL) calculation for all models. Our simulations all clearly show that aphid abundances exceed these threshold levels, and control is required. Our work provides a stable and biologically relevant prediction scheme for pest outbreaks and their management strategy.</description>

      <title>The spatially variable effects of mangroves on flood depths and losses from storm surges in Florida</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mangroves modify storm surges with impacts on property damages, but these effects vary spatially and by storm intensity. We use high-resolution, kilometer-scale flood and loss models to examine variability in mangrove effects on surge losses to properties, spatially and by storm intensity, in Florida. We estimate that mangroves reduce property surge losses by $67 million annually in Collier County in southwestern Florida. More than 50% of this reduction occurs for storms with return periods under 30 years. Mangroves in Florida reduced storm surge damages by 14% during Hurricane Irma (2017) and 30% during Hurricane Ian (2022). We show that mangrove presence always reduces flood losses for properties landward of mangroves. Inside mangroves, their effect is a net reduction in damages, though in some locations, especially for more seaward properties, mangroves can increase storm damages. These findings underline the importance of mangrove presence in determining property damages during hurricanes.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid ABM-PDE Framework for Real-World Infectious Disease Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid modeling approach that couples an Agent-Based Model (ABM) with a partial differential equation (PDE) model in an epidemic setting to simulate the spatial spread of infectious diseases using a compartmental structure with seven health states. The goal is to reduce the computational complexity of a full-ABM by introducing a coupled ABM-PDE model that offers significantly faster simulations while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid model not only reduces the overall simulation runtime (defined as the number of runs required for stable results multiplied by the duration of a single run) but also achieves smaller errors across both 25% and 100% population samples. The coupling mechanism ensures consistency at the model interface: agents crossing from the ABM into the PDE domain are removed and represented as density contributions, while surplus density in the PDE domain is used to generate agents with plausible trajectories derived from mobile phone data. We evaluate the hybrid model using real-world mobility and infection data for the Berlin-Brandenburg region in Germany, showing that it captures the core epidemiological dynamics while enabling efficient large-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Fused Lasso Improves Accuracy of Co-occurrence Network Inference in Grouped Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments (Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in cross-environment (All) scenarios.</description>
