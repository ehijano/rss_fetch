      <title>Knock Out Slow Extraction Using Betatron Sidebands at High Harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency knock out resonant slow extraction is a standard method for extracting stored particle beams from synchrotrons by transverse excitation. Excitation signals comprising many betatron sidebands have shown to reduce intensity fluctuations of the extracted beam spill and are used at several facilities. In this contribution, the effect of individual sidebands at different harmonics on the spill quality is systematically studied. Particle tracking simulations show a clear correlation between the chosen excitation frequency, the spectrum of particle motion shortly before their extraction, and the spill quality. Experiments confirm these observations while highlighting the reduction of pile-up when using higher excitation frequencies. These insights have implications for an optimal design of excitation waveforms and hardware for knock out extraction systems.</description>

      <title>Self-calibration in two dimensional aperture mask optical interferometry: a new method for wavefront sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new methodology in optical aperture masking interferometry involving Fourier analysis of the complex visibilities (real and imaginary, or amplitude and phase), derived from the interferometric images. The analysis includes use of a non-redundant aperture mask, and self-calibration of the hole-based complex voltage gains to correct for non-uniform illumination and phase fluctuations across the mask. The technique is demonstrated using the Synchrotron Radiation Interferometry (SRI) facility at the ALBA synchrotron light source. Application of the technique results in a joint derivation of the Gaussian shape of the electron beam, and of the hole-based voltage gain amplitude and phase distribution over the mask area. The gain phases are linearly related to the photon path-lengths through the optical system for the ray to each hole, and hence represent an accurate wavefront sensor (WFS) determining the path-length distortions across the wavefront. Wavefront sensing is a vital technology in fields ranging from adaptive optics to metrology to optometry. We calculate that the rms precision of this WFS method is better than 1~nm per frame in the current experiment. We compare the technique to the standard Shack-Hartman WFS. We also show that a structure-agnostic imaging and deconvolution process can be used with the visibility data to determine the beam shape without assuming a Gaussian model, and hence the technique is generalizable to more complex source morphologies.</description>

      <title>Optical design for the single crystal neutron diffractometer Pioneer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pioneer is a single-crystal neutron diffractometer optimized for small-volume samples and weak signals at the Second Target Station (STS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This paper presents the preliminary optical design progress, focusing on the rationale behind key design choices. It covers the T$_0$ and bandwidth disk choppers, guide and beam control system, incident-beam polarizer, scattering beam collimators, and additional strategies. The chopper locations are selected to maximize neutron transport while taking advantage of standardized shielding structures. To accommodate the maintenance shield, operational shutter, and polarizing V-cavity, the guide design includes significant gaps. When these optical components are moved out of the beam path, oversized collimators, rather than guides, will be translated in. Pioneer will utilize slit packages to control beam size and divergence, and a translatable polarizing V-cavity. Absorbing panels are strategically placed near the end station to minimize background. An oscillating radial collimator, operating in a shift mode, will be used with the vertical cylindrical detector, while a fixed multi-cone collimator will be used with the bottom flat detector. These collimators will enable the detection of weak signals when complex sample environments are used.</description>

      <title>Application of Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Improved Optics Measurements from s star Movement at sPHENIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current average horizontal beta beat measurements between operating Interaction Regions (IR) in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) are around 15 percent along with significant variation in s star. This threshold to measure the linear optics can be improved by considering preprocessing methods involving data reconstruction such as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), and cross checking between different method variations, model independent and dependent methods, and turn by turn (TBT) datasets. These were then applied to analyze the movement of horizontal s star at the 8 o clock IR at RHIC (IR8). This movement was done using an optics response matrix to determine magnet strengths necessary to move horizontal s star without disturbing other optics. Data preprocessing was found to significantly aid in beat reduction around IP, with DMD demonstrating the least variability between preprocessing methods and between horizontal s star movements. These preprocessing methods will be implemented into RHIC for future linear optics analysis.</description>

      <title>Recent progress in high-temperature superconducting undulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considerable effort has been devoted to the development of superconducting undulators (SCUs) intended for particle accelerator-based light sources, including synchrotrons and free electron laser (FEL) facilities. Recently, a high-temperature superconducting (HTS) undulator prototype, consisting of staggered-array Re-Ba-Cu-O bulks, achieved an on-axis sinusoidal magnetic field profile with a peak amplitude B$_0$ of 2.1 T and a period length of 10 mm, resulting in a deflection parameter K = 1.96. Such a short period HTS undulator not only enables the generation of higher-energy photons, but also supports the construction of economically feasible and compact FELs with shorter linear accelerators (LINACs). This article provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in the staggered-array bulk HTS undulator as well as other types of HTS undulators. Furthermore, it offers insights into the development of engineering HTS undulator prototypes designed for deployment in synchrotron and free electron laser (FEL) facilities. We conclude by discussing opportunities for and the challenges facing the use of HTS undulators in practical applications.</description>

      <title>On the influence of electron velocity spread on Compton FEL operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the field amplitude, a nonlinear integro-differential equation is derived that describes the operation of a Compton FEL in the presence of electron velocity spread typical for modern facilities. Numerical solutions of the equation are in good agreement with particle simulations for the bunching factor less than 0.6, reproduce the frequency detuning spectrum near its maximum, and describe the amplification process up to saturation.</description>
