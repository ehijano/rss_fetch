      <title>Computation of Capacity-Distortion-Cost Functions for Continuous Memoryless Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims at computing the capacity-distortion-cost (CDC) function for continuous memoryless channels, which is defined as the supremum of the mutual information between channel input and output, constrained by an input cost and an expected distortion of estimating channel state. Solving the optimization problem is challenging because the input distribution does not lie in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space and the optimal estimation function has no closed form in general. We propose to adopt the Wasserstein proximal point method and parametric models such as neural networks (NNs) to update the input distribution and estimation function alternately. To implement it in practice, the importance sampling (IS) technique is used to calculate integrals numerically, and the Wasserstein gradient descent is approximated by pushing forward particles. The algorithm is then applied to an integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, validating theoretical results at minimum and maximum distortion as well as the random-deterministic trade-off.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Wireless Data Center: Gaussian Beam or Airy Beam?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication is emerging as a pivotal enabler for 6G and beyond wireless systems owing to its multi-GHz bandwidth. One of its novel applications is in wireless data centers, where it enables ultra-high data rates while enhancing network reconfigurability and scalability. However, due to numerous racks, supporting walls, and densely deployed antennas, the line-of-sight (LoS) path in data centers is often instead of fully obstructed, resulting in quasi-LoS propagation and degradation of spectral efficiency. To address this issue, Airy beam-based hybrid beamforming is investigated in this paper as a promising technique to mitigate quasi-LoS propagation and enhance spectral efficiency in THz wireless data centers. Specifically, a cascaded geometrical and wave-based channel model (CGWCM) is proposed for quasi-LoS scenarios, which accounts for diffraction effects while being more simplified than conventional wave-based model. Then, the characteristics and generation of the Airy beam are analyzed, and beam search methods for quasi-LoS scenarios are proposed, including hierarchical focusing-Airy beam search, and low-complexity beam search. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the CGWCM and demonstrate the superiority of the Airy beam over Gaussian beams in mitigating blockages, verifying its potential for practical THz wireless communication in data centers.</description>

      <title>A Geography-Inspired and Self-Adaptive Clustering Algorithm: A Study in Channel Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon that multi-path components (MPCs) arrive in clusters has been verified by channel measurements, and is widely adopted by cluster-based channel models. As a crucial intermediate processing step, MPC clustering bridges raw data in channel measurement and cluster characteristics for channel modeling. In this paper, a physical-interpretable and self-adaptive MPC clustering algorithm is proposed, which can locate both single-point and wide-spread scatterers without prior knowledge. Inspired by the concept in geography, a novel metaphor that interprets features of MPC attributes in the power-delay-angle profile (PDAP) as topographic concepts is developed. In light of the interpretation, the proposed algorithm disassembles the PDAP by constructing contour lines and identifying characteristic points that indicate the skeleton of MPC clusters, which are fitted by analytical models that associate MPCs with physical scatterer locations. Besides, a new clustering performance index, the power gradient consistency index, is proposed. Calculated as the weighted Spearman correlation coefficient between the power and the distance to the center, the index captures the intrinsic property of MPC clusters that the dominant high-power path is surrounded by lower-power paths. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and compared with the counterparts of conventional clustering algorithms based on the channel measurement conducted in an outdoor scenario. The proposed algorithm performs better in average Silhouette index and weighted Spearman correlation coefficient, and the average root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated scatterer location is 0.1 m.</description>

      <title>Metaheuristic Optimization of Trajectory and Dynamic Time Splitting for UAV Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into wireless communication systems has emerged as a transformative approach, promising cost-efficient connectivity. This paper addresses the optimization of the dynamic time-splitting ratio and flight trajectory for a communication system linking a ground base station to the UAV equipped with backscatter devices (referred to as UB), and from UB to an end user. Given the inherent non-convexity of the problem, we develop two meta-heuristic-based approaches inspired by genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization to enhance the total achievable rate while reducing computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of these meta-heuristic solutions, showcasing significant improvements in the achievable rate and computation time compared to existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Sequence Reconstruction under Channels with Multiple Bursts of Insertions or Deletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sequence reconstruction problem involves a model where a sequence is transmitted over several identical channels. This model investigates the minimum number of channels required for the unique reconstruction of the transmitted sequence. Levenshtein established that this number exceeds the maximum size of the intersection between the error balls of any two distinct transmitted sequences by one. In this paper, we consider channels subject to multiple bursts of insertions and multiple bursts of deletions, respectively, where each burst has an exact length of value b. We provide a complete solution for the insertion case while partially addressing the deletion case.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Binary Search via Overlapping Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20513v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the task of performing binary search under noisy decisions, focusing on the application of target area localization. In the presence of noise, the classical partitioning approach of binary search is prone to error propagation due to the use of strictly disjoint splits. While existing works on noisy binary search propose techniques such as query repetition or probabilistic updates to mitigate errors, they often lack explicit mechanisms to manage the trade-off between error probability and search complexity, with some providing only asymptotic guarantees. To address this gap, we propose a binary search framework with tunable overlapping partitions, which introduces controlled redundancy into the search process to enhance robustness against noise. We analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm in both discrete and continuous domains for the problem of area localization, quantifying how the overlap parameter impacts the trade-off between search tree depth and error probability. Unlike previous methods, this approach allows for direct control over the balance between reliability and efficiency. Our results emphasize the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed method, providing a principled extension to existing noisy search paradigms and enabling new insights into the interplay between partitioning strategies and measurement reliability.</description>

      <title>Identification over Poisson ISI Channels: Feedback and Molecular Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) enables information transfer via molecules, making it ideal for biomedical applications where traditional methods fall short. In many such scenarios, identifying specific events is more critical than decoding full messages, motivating the use of deterministic identification (DI). This paper investigates DI over discrete-time Poisson channels (DTPCs) with inter-symbol interference (ISI), a realistic setting due to channel memory effects. We improve the known upper bound on DI capacity under power constraints from $\frac{3}{2} + \kappa$ to $\frac{1 + \kappa}{2}$. Additionally, we present the first results on deterministic identification with feedback (DIF) in this context, providing a constructive lower bound. These findings enhance the theoretical understanding of MC and support more efficient, feedback-driven biomedical systems.</description>

      <title>SNR-aware Semantic Image Transmission with Deep Learning-based Channel Estimation in Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communications (SCs) play a central role in shaping the future of the sixth generation (6G) wireless systems, which leverage rapid advances in deep learning (DL). In this regard, end-to-end optimized DL-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has been adopted to achieve SCs, particularly in image transmission. Utilizing vision transformers in the encoder/decoder design has enabled significant advancements in image semantic extraction, surpassing traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we propose a new JSCC paradigm for image transmission, namely Swin semantic image transmission (SwinSIT), based on the Swin transformer. The Swin transformer is employed to construct both the semantic encoder and decoder for efficient image semantic extraction and reconstruction. Inspired by the squeezing-and-excitation (SE) network, we introduce a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR)-aware module that utilizes SNR feedback to adaptively perform a double-phase enhancement for the encoder-extracted semantic map and its noisy version at the decoder. Additionally, a CNN-based channel estimator and compensator (CEAC) module repurposes an image-denoising CNN to mitigate fading channel effects. To optimize deployment in resource-constrained IoT devices, a joint pruning and quantization scheme compresses the SwinSIT model. Simulations evaluate the SwinSIT performance against conventional benchmarks demonstrating its effectiveness. Moreover, the model's compressed version substantially reduces its size while maintaining favorable PSNR performance.</description>

      <title>Statistical Channel Based Low-Complexity Rotation and Position Optimization for 6D Movable Antennas Enabled Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is a promising technology to fully exploit spatial variation in wireless channels by allowing flexible adjustment of three-dimensional (3D) positions and rotations of antennas at the transceiver. In this paper, we investigate the practical low-complexity design of 6DMA-enabled communication systems, including transmission protocol, statistical channel information (SCI) acquisition, and joint position and rotation optimization of 6DMA surfaces based on the SCI of users. Specifically, an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based algorithm is proposed for the estimation of SCI of users at all possible position-rotation pairs of 6DMA surfaces based on the channel measurements at a small subset of position-rotation pairs. Then, the average sum logarithmic rate of all users is maximized by jointly designing the positions and rotations of 6DMA surfaces based on their SCI acquired. Different from prior works on 6DMA which adopt alternating optimization to design 6DMA positions/rotations with iterations, we propose a new sequential optimization approach that first determines 6DMA rotations and then finds their feasible positions to realize the optimized rotations subject to practical antenna placement constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed sequential optimization significantly reduces the computational complexity of conventional alternating optimization, while achieving comparable communication performance. It is also shown that the proposed SCI-based 6DMA design can effectively enhance the communication throughput of wireless networks over existing fixed (position and rotation) antenna arrays, yet with a practically appealing low-complexity implementation.</description>

      <title>Multi-Message Secure Aggregation with Demand Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a multi-message secure aggregation with privacy problem, in which a server aims to compute $\sf K_c\geq 1$ linear combinations of local inputs from $\sf K$ distributed users. The problem addresses two tasks: (1) security, ensuring that the server can only obtain the desired linear combinations without any else information about the users' inputs, and (2) privacy, preventing users from learning about the server's computation task. In addition, the effect of user dropouts is considered, where at most $\sf{K-U}$ users can drop out and the identity of these users cannot be predicted in advance. We propose two schemes for $\sf K_c$ is equal to (1) and $\sf 2\leq K_c\leq U-1$, respectively. For $\sf K_c$ is equal to (1), we introduce multiplicative encryption of the server's demand using a random variable, where users share coded keys offline and transmit masked models in the first round, followed by aggregated coded keys in the second round for task recovery. For $\sf{2\leq K_c \leq U-1}$, we use robust symmetric private computation to recover linear combinations of keys in the second round. The objective is to minimize the number of symbols sent by each user during the two rounds. Our proposed schemes have achieved the optimal rate region when $ \sf K_c $ is equal to (1) and the order optimal rate (within 2) when $\sf{2\leq K_c \leq U-1}$.</description>

      <title>On the Optimal Source Key Size of Secure Gradient Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With gradient coding, a user node can efficiently aggregate gradients from server nodes processing local datasets, achieving low communication costs and maintaining resilience against straggling servers. This paper considers a secure gradient coding problem, where a user aims to compute the sum of the gradients from $K$ datasets with the assistance of $N$ distributed servers. The user should recover the sum of gradients by receiving transmissions from any $N_r$ servers, and each dataset is assigned to $N - N_r + m$ servers. The security constraint guarantees that even if the user receives transmissions from all servers, it cannot obtain any additional information about the datasets beyond the sum of gradients.
  It has been shown in the literature that this security constraint does not increase the optimal communication cost of the gradient coding problem, provided enough source keys are shared among the servers. However, the minimum required source key size that ensures security while maintaining this optimal communication cost has only been studied for the special case $m = 1$. In this paper, we focus on the more general case $m \geq 1$ and aim to determine the minimum required source key size for this purpose.
  We propose a new information-theoretic converse bound on the source key size, as well as a new achievable scheme with carefully designed data assignments. Our scheme outperforms the existing optimal scheme based on the widely used cyclic data assignment and coincides with the converse bound under certain system parameters.</description>

      <title>New Capacity Bounds for PIR on Graph and Multigraph-Based Replicated Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of private information retrieval (PIR) in both graph-based and multigraph-based replication systems, where each file is stored on exactly two servers, and any pair of servers shares at most $r$ files. We derive upper bounds on the PIR capacity for such systems and construct PIR schemes that approach these bounds. For graph-based systems, we determine the exact PIR capacity for path graphs and improve upon existing results for complete bipartite graphs and complete graphs. For multigraph-based systems, we propose a PIR scheme that leverages the symmetry of the underlying graph-based construction, yielding a capacity lower bound for such multigraphs. Furthermore, we establish several general upper and lower bounds on the PIR capacity of multigraphs, which are tight in certain cases.</description>

      <title>On the Secrecy-Sensing Optimization of RIS-assisted Full-Duplex Integrated Sensing and Communication Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has recently emerged as a viable technique for establishing sensing and communication using the same resources. Nonetheless, the operation of ISAC networks is often challenged by the absence of a direct link between the sensing node and the targets, and by the risk of disclosing confidential data to malicious targets when using the same signal for both tasks. In this paper, a robust reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided scheme for securing a full-duplex (FD) ISAC network is proposed. The considered network consists of uplink and downlink users served in FD through a multi-antenna dual-functional radar communication base station (BS), which employs co-located multi-antenna communication-radar arrays to detect multiple malicious targets while preserving communication secrecy in their presence. Additionally, the BS utilizes an optimized artificial noise (AN) that serves to disrupt the malicious targets' reception and increase the sensing power. By optimally designing the RIS phase shifts, transmit beamforming, AN covariance, and uplink users' transmit power and combining vectors using an alternating optimization-based algorithm, the network's sensing performance is maximized under secrecy and total power constraints. Numerical results present the proposed scheme's efficacy, particularly when a direct link between the BS and the various nodes/targets is absent.</description>

      <title>Simple Finite-Length Achievability and Converse Bounds for the Deletion Channel and the Insertion Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop upper bounds on code size for independent and identically distributed deletion (insertion) channel for given code length and target frame error probability. The bounds are obtained as a variation of a general converse bound, which, though available for any channel, is inefficient and not easily computable without a good reference distribution over the output alphabet. We obtain a reference output distribution for a general finite-input finite-output channel and provide a simple formula for the converse bound on the capacity employing this distribution. We then evaluate the bound for the deletion channel with a finite block length and show that the resulting upper bound on the code side is tighter than that for a binary erasure channel, which is the only alternative converse bound for this finite-length setting. Also, we provide the similar results for the insertion channel.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hypothesis Testing Lemma for Deterministic Identification over Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work, we presented the Hypothesis Testing Lemma, a key tool that establishes sufficient conditions for the existence of good deterministic identification (DI) codes for memoryless channels with finite output, but arbitrary input alphabets. In this work, we provide a full quantum analogue of this lemma, which shows that the existence of a DI code in the quantum setting follows from a suitable packing in a modified space of output quantum states. Specifically, we demonstrate that such a code can be constructed using product states derived from this packing. This result enables us to tighten the capacity lower bound for DI over quantum channels beyond the simultaneous decoding approach. In particular, we can now express these bounds solely in terms of the Minkowski dimension of a certain state space, giving us new insights to better understand the nature of the protocol, and the separation between simultaneous and non-simultaneous codes. We extend the discussion with a particular channel example for which we can construct an optimum code.</description>

      <title>LZ Penalty: An information-theoretic repetition penalty for autoregressive language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the LZ penalty, a penalty specialized for reducing degenerate repetitions in autoregressive language models without loss of capability. The penalty is based on the codelengths in the LZ77 universal lossless compression algorithm. Through the lens of the prediction-compression duality, decoding the LZ penalty has the interpretation of sampling from the residual distribution after removing the information that is highly compressible. We demonstrate the LZ penalty enables state-of-the-art open-source reasoning models to operate with greedy (temperature zero) decoding without loss of capability and without instances of degenerate repetition. Both the industry-standard frequency penalty and repetition penalty are ineffective, incurring degenerate repetition rates of up to 4%.</description>

      <title>List Decoding Expander-Based Codes up to Capacity in Near-Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new framework based on graph regularity lemmas, for list decoding and list recovery of codes based on spectral expanders. Using existing algorithms for computing regularity decompositions of sparse graphs in (randomized) near-linear time, and appropriate choices for the constant-sized inner/base codes, we prove the following:
  - Expander-based codes constructed using the distance amplification technique of Alon, Edmonds and Luby [FOCS 1995] with rate $\rho$, can be list decoded to a radius $1 - \rho - \epsilon$ in near-linear time. By known results, the output list has size $O(1/\epsilon)$.
  - The above codes of Alon, Edmonds and Luby, with rate $\rho$, can also be list recovered to radius $1 - \rho - \epsilon$ in near-linear time, with constant-sized output lists.
  - The Tanner code construction of Sipser and Spielman [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 1996] with distance $\delta$, can be list decoded to radius $\delta - \epsilon$ in near-linear time, with constant-sized output lists.
  Our results imply novel combinatorial as well as algorithmic bounds for each of the above explicit constructions. All of these bounds are obtained via combinatorial rigidity phenomena, proved using (weak) graph regularity. The regularity framework allows us to lift the list decoding and list recovery properties for the local base codes, to the global codes obtained via the above constructions.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Framework for Dynamic Path Planning in Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel quantum classical hybrid framework is proposed that synergizes quantum with Classical Reinforcement Learning. By leveraging the inherent parallelism of quantum computing, the proposed approach generates robust Q tables and specialized turn cost estimations, which are then integrated with a classical Reinforcement Learning pipeline. The Classical Quantum fusion results in rapid convergence of training, reducing the training time significantly and improved adaptability in scenarios featuring static, dynamic, and moving obstacles. Simulator based evaluations demonstrate significant enhancements in path efficiency, trajectory smoothness, and mission success rates, underscoring the potential of framework for real time, autonomous navigation in complex and unpredictable environments. Furthermore, the proposed framework was tested beyond simulations on practical scenarios, including real world map data such as the IIT Delhi campus, reinforcing its potential for real time, autonomous navigation in complex and unpredictable environments.</description>

      <title>The Limits of AI Explainability: An Algorithmic Information Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding the fundamental limits of AI explainability through algorithmic information theory. We formalize explainability as the approximation of complex models by simpler ones, quantifying both approximation error and explanation complexity using Kolmogorov complexity. Our key theoretical contributions include: (1) a complexity gap theorem proving that any explanation significantly simpler than the original model must differ from it on some inputs; (2) precise bounds showing that explanation complexity grows exponentially with input dimension but polynomially with error tolerance for Lipschitz functions; and (3) a characterization of the gap between local and global explainability, demonstrating that local explanations can be significantly simpler while maintaining accuracy in relevant regions. We further establish a regulatory impossibility theorem proving that no governance framework can simultaneously pursue unrestricted AI capabilities, human-interpretable explanations, and negligible error. These results highlight considerations likely to be relevant to the design, evaluation, and oversight of explainable AI systems.</description>

      <title>The relative entropy of primes in arithmetic progressions is really small</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix a modulus $q$. One would expect the number of primes in each invertible residue class mod $q$ to be multinomially distributed, i.e. for each $p \,\mathrm{mod}\, q$ to behave like an independent random variable uniform on $(\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})^\times$. Using techniques from data science, we discover overwhelming evidence to the contrary: primes are much more uniformly distributed than iid uniform random variables. This phenomenon was previously unknown, and there is no clear theoretical explanation for it.
  To demonstrate that our test statistic of choice, the KL divergence, is indeed extreme, we prove new bounds for the left tail of the relative entropy of the uniform multinomial using the method of types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint message and state transmission under arbitrarily varying jamming is investigated in this paper. The problem is modeled as the transmission over a channel with random states with a fixed distribution and jamming that varies in an unknown manner. We provide lower bounds of the capacity-distortion function of strictly causal and noncausal observations of the states at the encoder under the average error criterion when the jammer is not aware of the transmitted message, as well as the maximal error criterion when the jammer knows the message. Some capacity-achieving cases are also provided. The proposed coding schemes are deterministic, and no randomness is needed to achieve reliable communication and estimation. It turns out that the performance of the system under the average error can strictly outperform the maximal error case, which is in accordance with normal communication over arbitrarily varying channels.</description>

      <title>An Achievable Scheme for the K-user Linear Computation Broadcast Channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new achievable scheme for the K-user Linear Computation Broadcast Channel (K-LCBC). A K-LCBC comprises data stored on a server and K users, each aiming to retrieve a desired linear function of the data by leveraging their prior locally available side information in the form of another linear function of the data. The proposed scheme is based on a subspace decomposition derived from representable polymatroid spaces. This decomposition enables the server to effectively design multicast messages that simultaneously benefit multiple users and allow users to eliminate interference using their available side information. This work extends existing results for the 3-LCBC by introducing a linear programming framework to optimize multicast opportunities across an arbitrary number of users. The proposed approach can be used to derive achievable scheme for the K-user coded caching problem with linear coded placement and scalar linear function retrieval, which was our original motivation to investigate the K-LCBC.</description>

Abstract: We study the capacity of the power-constrained additive Gaussian channel with an entropy constraint at the input. In particular, we characterize this capacity in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime at small entropy. This follows as a corollary of the following general result on a moment matching problem: We show that for any continuous random variable with finite moments, the largest number of initial moments that can be matched by a discrete random variable of sufficiently small but positive entropy is three.</description>

      <title>Model non-collapse: Minimax bounds for recursive discrete distribution estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning discrete distributions from i.i.d. samples is a well-understood problem. However, advances in generative machine learning prompt an interesting new, non-i.i.d. setting: after receiving a certain number of samples, an estimated distribution is fixed, and samples from this estimate are drawn and introduced into the sample corpus, undifferentiated from real samples. Subsequent generations of estimators now face contaminated environments, a scenario referred to in the machine learning literature as self-consumption. Empirically, it has been observed that models in fully synthetic self-consuming loops collapse -- their performance deteriorates with each batch of training -- but accumulating data has been shown to prevent complete degeneration. This, in turn, begs the question: What happens when fresh real samples \textit{are} added at every stage? In this paper, we study the minimax loss of self-consuming discrete distribution estimation in such loops. We show that even when model collapse is consciously averted, the ratios between the minimax losses with and without source information can grow unbounded as the batch size increases. In the data accumulation setting, where all batches of samples are available for estimation, we provide minimax lower bounds and upper bounds that are order-optimal under mild conditions for the expected $\ell_2^2$ and $\ell_1$ losses at every stage. We provide conditions for regimes where there is a strict gap in the convergence rates compared to the corresponding oracle-assisted minimax loss where real and synthetic samples are differentiated, and provide examples where this gap is easily observed. We also provide a lower bound on the minimax loss in the data replacement setting, where only the latest batch of samples is available, and use it to find a lower bound for the worst-case loss for bounded estimate trajectories.</description>

      <title>DLW-CI: A Dynamic Likelihood-Weighted Cooperative Infotaxis Approach for Multi-Source Search in Urban Environments Using Consumer Drone Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consumer-grade drones equipped with low-cost sensors have emerged as a cornerstone of Autonomous Intelligent Systems (AISs) for environmental monitoring and hazardous substance detection in urban environments. However, existing research primarily addresses single-source search problems, overlooking the complexities of real-world urban scenarios where both the location and quantity of hazardous sources remain unknown. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Likelihood-Weighted Cooperative Infotaxis (DLW-CI) approach for consumer drone networks. Our approach enhances multi-drone collaboration in AISs by combining infotaxis (a cognitive search strategy) with optimized source term estimation and an innovative cooperative mechanism. Specifically, we introduce a novel source term estimation method that utilizes multiple parallel particle filters, with each filter dedicated to estimating the parameters of a potentially unknown source within the search scene. Furthermore, we develop a cooperative mechanism based on dynamic likelihood weights to prevent multiple drones from simultaneously estimating and searching for the same source, thus optimizing the energy efficiency and search coverage of the consumer AIS. Experimental results demonstrate that the DLW-CI approach significantly outperforms baseline methods regarding success rate, accuracy, and root mean square error, particularly in scenarios with relatively few sources, regardless of the presence of obstacles. Also, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified in a diffusion scenario generated by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Research findings indicate that our approach could improve source estimation accuracy and search efficiency by consumer drone-based AISs, making a valuable contribution to environmental safety monitoring applications within smart city infrastructure.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we provide a complete characterization of codewords in polar codes with weights less than twice the minimum distance, using the group action of the lower triangular affine (LTA) group. We derive a closed-form formula for the enumeration of such codewords. Furthermore, we introduce an enhanced partial order based on weight contributions, offering refined tools for code design. Our results extend previous work on Type II codewords to a full description of Type I codewords and offer new insights into the algebraic structure underlying decreasing monomial codes, including polar and Reed-Muller codes.</description>

A leaf-centric binary tree source induces for every $n \geq 2$ a probability distribution on the set of binary trees with $n$ leaves. We generalize a result by Flajolet, Gourdon, Martinez and Devroye, according to which the average number of distinct fringe subtrees in a random binary search tree of size $n$ is in $\Theta(n/\log n)$, as well as a result by Flajolet, Sipala and Steayert, according to which the number of distinct fringe subtrees in a uniformly random binary tree of size $n$ is in $\Theta(n/\sqrt{\log n})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The key ingredient to retrieving a signal from its Fourier magnitudes, namely, to solve the phase retrieval problem, is an effective prior on the sought signal. In this paper, we study the phase retrieval problem under the prior that the signal lies in a semi-algebraic set. This is a very general prior as semi-algebraic sets include linear models, sparse models, and ReLU neural network generative models. The latter is the main motivation of this paper, due to the remarkable success of deep generative models in a variety of imaging tasks, including phase retrieval. We prove that almost all signals in R^N can be determined from their Fourier magnitudes, up to a sign, if they lie in a (generic) semi-algebraic set of dimension N/2. The same is true for all signals if the semi-algebraic set is of dimension N/4. We also generalize these results to the problem of signal recovery from the second moment in multi-reference alignment models with multiplicity free representations of compact groups. This general result is then used to derive improved sample complexity bounds for recovering band-limited functions on the sphere from their noisy copies, each acted upon by a random element of SO(3).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The description of the dynamics of complex systems, in particular the capture of the interaction structure and causal relationships between elements of the system, is one of the central questions of interdisciplinary research. While the characterization of pairwise causal interactions is a relatively ripe field with established theoretical concepts and the current focus is on technical issues of their efficient estimation, it turns out that the standard concepts such as Granger causality or transfer entropy may not faithfully reflect possible synergies or interactions of higher orders, phenomena highly relevant for many real-world complex systems. In this paper, we propose a generalization and refinement of the information-theoretic approach to causal inference, enabling the description of truly multivariate, rather than multiple pairwise, causal interactions, and moving thus from causal networks to causal hypernetworks. In particular, while keeping the ability to control for mediating variables or common causes, in case of purely synergetic interactions such as the exclusive disjunction, it ascribes the causal role to the multivariate causal set but \emph{not} to individual inputs, distinguishing it thus from the case of e.g. two additive univariate causes. We demonstrate this concept by application to illustrative theoretical examples as well as a biophysically realistic simulation of biological neuronal dynamics recently reported to employ synergetic computations.</description>

      <title>Geometry and Duality of Alternating Markov Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we realize the half-steps of a general class of Markov chains as alternating projections with respect to the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between convex sets of joint probability distributions. Using this characterization, we provide a geometric proof of an information-theoretic duality between the Markov chains defined by the even and odd half-steps of the alternating projection scheme.</description>

      <title>Double Spending Analysis of Nakamoto Consensus for Time-Varying Mining Rates with Ruin Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical guarantees for double spending probabilities for the Nakamoto consensus under the $k$-deep confirmation rule have been extensively studied for zero/bounded network delays and fixed mining rates. In this paper, we introduce a ruin-theoretical model of double spending for Nakamoto consensus under the $k$-deep confirmation rule when the honest mining rate is allowed to be an arbitrary function of time including the block delivery periods, i.e., time periods during which mined blocks are being delivered to all other participants of the network. Time-varying mining rates are considered to capture the intrinsic characteristics of the peer to peer network delays as well as dynamic participation of miners such as the gap game and switching between different cryptocurrencies. Ruin theory is leveraged to obtain the double spend probabilities and numerical examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical method.</description>

      <title>Empirical Bayes Estimation for Lasso-Type Regularizers: Analysis of Automatic Relevance Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on linear regression models with non-conjugate sparsity-inducing regularizers such as lasso and group lasso. Although the empirical Bayes approach enables us to estimate the regularization parameter, little is known on the properties of the estimators. In particular, many aspects regarding the specific conditions under which the mechanism of automatic relevance determination (ARD) occurs remain unexplained. In this paper, we derive the empirical Bayes estimators for the group lasso regularized linear regression models with limited parameters. It is shown that the estimators diverge under a specific condition, giving rise to the ARD mechanism. We also prove that empirical Bayes methods can produce the ARD mechanism in general regularized linear regression models and clarify the conditions under which models such as ridge, lasso, and group lasso can do so.</description>

      <title>Learnable Residual-based Latent Denoising in Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A latent denoising semantic communication (SemCom) framework is proposed for robust image transmission over noisy channels. By incorporating a learnable latent denoiser into the receiver, the received signals are preprocessed to effectively remove the channel noise and recover the semantic information, thereby enhancing the quality of the decoded images. Specifically, a latent denoising mapping is established by an iterative residual learning approach to improve the denoising efficiency while ensuring stable performance. Moreover, channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is utilized to estimate and predict the latent similarity score (SS) for conditional denoising, where the number of denoising steps is adapted based on the predicted SS sequence, further reducing the communication latency. Finally, simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively and efficiently remove the channel noise at various levels and reconstruct visual-appealing images.</description>
