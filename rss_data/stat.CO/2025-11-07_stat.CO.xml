      <title>Learning Paths for Dynamic Measure Transport: A Control Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We bring a control perspective to the problem of identifying paths of measures for sampling via dynamic measure transport (DMT). We highlight the fact that commonly used paths may be poor choices for DMT and connect existing methods for learning alternate paths to mean-field games. Based on these connections we pose a flexible family of optimization problems for identifying tilted paths of measures for DMT and advocate for the use of objective terms which encourage smoothness of the corresponding velocities. We present a numerical algorithm for solving these problems based on recent Gaussian process methods for solution of partial differential equations and demonstrate the ability of our method to recover more efficient and smooth transport models compared to those which use an untilted reference path.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Modeling of Continuous-Time Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring the infinitesimal rates of continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) is a central challenge in many scientific domains. This task is hindered by three factors: quadratic growth in the number of rates as the CTMC state space expands, strong dependencies among rates, and incomplete information for many transitions. We introduce a new Bayesian framework that flexibly models the CTMC rates by incorporating covariates through Gaussian processes (GPs). This approach improves inference by integrating new information and contributes to the understanding of the CTMC stochastic behavior by shedding light on potential external drivers. Unlike previous approaches limited to linear covariate effects, our method captures complex non-linear relationships, enabling fuller use of covariate information and more accurate characterization of their influence. To perform efficient inference, we employ a scalable Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler. We address the prohibitive cost of computing the exact likelihood gradient by integrating the HMC trajectories with a scalable gradient approximation, reducing the computational complexity from $O(K^5)$ to $O(K^2)$, where $K$ is the number of CTMC states. Finally, we demonstrate our method on Bayesian phylogeography inference -- a domain where CTMCs are central -- showing effectiveness on both synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Online Bayesian Experimental Design for Partially Observed Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled framework for optimizing data collection, but existing approaches do not apply to crucial real-world settings such as dynamical systems with partial observability, where only noisy and incomplete observations are available. These systems are naturally modeled as state-space models (SSMs), where latent states mediate the link between parameters and data, making the likelihood -- and thus information-theoretic objectives like the expected information gain (EIG) -- intractable. In addition, the dynamical nature of the system requires online algorithms that update posterior distributions and select designs sequentially in a computationally efficient manner. We address these challenges by deriving new estimators of the EIG and its gradient that explicitly marginalize latent states, enabling scalable stochastic optimization in nonlinear SSMs. Our approach leverages nested particle filters (NPFs) for efficient online inference with convergence guarantees. Applications to realistic models, such as the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and a moving source location task, show that our framework successfully handles both partial observability and online computation.</description>

      <title>Generative Bayesian Filtering and Parameter Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Bayesian Filtering (GBF) provides a powerful and flexible framework for performing posterior inference in complex nonlinear and non-Gaussian state-space models. Our approach extends Generative Bayesian Computation (GBC) to dynamic settings, enabling recursive posterior inference using simulation-based methods powered by deep neural networks. GBF does not require explicit density evaluations, making it particularly effective when observation or transition distributions are analytically intractable. To address parameter learning, we introduce the Generative-Gibbs sampler, which bypasses explicit density evaluation by iteratively sampling each variable from its implicit full conditional distribution. Such technique is broadly applicable and enables inference in hierarchical Bayesian models with intractable densities, including state-space models. We assess the performance of the proposed methodologies through both simulated and empirical studies, including the estimation of $\alpha$-stable stochastic volatility models. Our findings indicate that GBF significantly outperforms existing likelihood-free approaches in accuracy and robustness when dealing with intractable state-space models.</description>

      <title>Mixing time of the conditional backward sampling particle filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17572v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conditional backward sampling particle filter (CBPF) is a powerful Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler for general state space hidden Markov model (HMM) smoothing. It was proposed as an improvement over the conditional particle filter (CPF), which has an $O(T^2)$ complexity under a general `strong' mixing assumption, where $T$ is the time horizon. Empirical evidence of the superiority of the CBPF over the CPF has never been theoretically quantified. We show that the CBPF has $O(T \log T)$ time complexity under strong mixing: its mixing time is upper bounded by $O(\log T)$, for any sufficiently large number of particles $N$ independent of $T$. This $O(\log T)$ mixing time is optimal. To prove our main result, we introduce a novel coupling of two CBPFs, which employs a maximal coupling of two particle systems at each time instant. The coupling is implementable and we use it to construct unbiased, finite variance, estimates of functionals which have arbitrary dependence on the latent state's path, with a total expected cost of $O(T \log T)$. We use this to construct unbiased estimates of the HMM's score function, and also investigate other couplings which can exhibit improved behaviour. We demonstrate our methods on financial and calcium imaging applications.</description>

      <title>A mirror descent approach to maximum likelihood estimation in latent variable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an approach based on mirror descent and sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to perform joint parameter inference and posterior estimation in latent variable models. This approach is based on minimisation of a functional over the parameter space and the space of probability distributions and, contrary to other popular approaches, can be implemented when the latent variable takes values in discrete spaces. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of both the mirror descent algorithm and its approximation via SMC. We experimentally show that the proposed algorithm outperforms standard expectation maximisation algorithms and is competitive with other popular methods for real-valued latent variables.</description>

      <title>coverforest: Conformal Predictions with Random Forest in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction provides a framework for uncertainty quantification, specifically in the forms of prediction intervals and sets with distribution-free guaranteed coverage. While recent cross-conformal techniques such as CV+ and Jackknife+-after-bootstrap achieve better data efficiency than traditional split conformal methods, they incur substantial computational costs due to required pairwise comparisons between training and test samples' out-of-bag scores. Observing that these methods naturally extend from ensemble models, particularly random forests, we leverage existing optimized random forest implementations to enable efficient cross-conformal predictions.
  We present coverforest, a Python package that implements efficient conformal prediction methods specifically optimized for random forests. coverforest supports both regression and classification tasks through various conformal prediction methods, including split conformal, CV+, Jackknife+-after-bootstrap, and adaptive prediction sets. Our package leverages parallel computing and Cython optimizations to speed up out-of-bag calculations. Our experiments demonstrate that coverforest's predictions achieve the desired level of coverage. In addition, its training and prediction times can be faster than an existing implementation by 2--9 times. The source code for the coverforest is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/donlap/coverforest.</description>
