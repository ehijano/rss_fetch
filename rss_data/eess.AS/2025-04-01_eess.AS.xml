      <title>How Cyclic Acoustic Patterns Influence ASMR Perception: A Signal Processing Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) has been remarkably popular in the recent decade. While its effect has been validated through behavioral studies and neuro-physiological measurements such as electroencephalography (EEG) and related bio-signal analyses, its development and triggers remain a subject of debate. Previous studies suggest that its triggers are highly linked with cyclic patterns: predictable patterns introduce relaxation while variations maintain intrigue. To validate this and further understand the impact of acoustic features on ASMR effects, we designed three distinct cyclic patterns with monophonic and stereophonic variations, while controlling their predictability and randomness, and collected ASMR triggering scores through online surveys. Then, we extracted cyclic features and carried out regression analysis, seeking an explainable mapping of cyclic features and ASMR triggers. We found that relaxing effects accumulate progressively and are independent of spatial orientation. Cyclic patterns significantly influence psychological and physical effects, which remain invariant with time. Regression analysis revealed that smoothly spread and energy-dense cyclic patterns most effectively trigger ASMR responses.</description>

      <title>Expanding and Analyzing ODAQ -- the Open Dataset of Audio Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Open Dataset of Audio Quality (ODAQ) was recently introduced to address the scarcity of openly available audio datasets with corresponding subjective quality scores. The dataset, released under permissive licenses, comprises audio material processed using six different signal processing methods operating at five quality levels, along with corresponding subjective test results. To expand the dataset, we provided listener training to university students to conduct further subjective tests and obtained results consistent with previous expert listeners. We also showed how different training approaches affect the use of absolute scales and anchors. The expanded dataset now comprises results from three international laboratories providing a total of 42 listeners and 10080 subjective scores. This paper provides the details of the expansion and an in-depth analysis. As part of this analysis, we initiate the use of ODAQ as a benchmark to evaluate objective audio quality metrics in their ability to predict subjective scores</description>

      <title>$C^2$AV-TSE: Context and Confidence-aware Audio Visual Target Speaker Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction (AV-TSE) aims to mimic the human ability to enhance auditory perception using visual cues. Although numerous models have been proposed recently, most of them estimate target signals by primarily relying on local dependencies within acoustic features, underutilizing the human-like capacity to infer unclear parts of speech through contextual information. This limitation results in not only suboptimal performance but also inconsistent extraction quality across the utterance, with some segments exhibiting poor quality or inadequate suppression of interfering speakers. To close this gap, we propose a model-agnostic strategy called the Mask-And-Recover (MAR). It integrates both inter- and intra-modality contextual correlations to enable global inference within extraction modules. Additionally, to better target challenging parts within each sample, we introduce a Fine-grained Confidence Score (FCS) model to assess extraction quality and guide extraction modules to emphasize improvement on low-quality segments. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed model-agnostic training paradigm, six popular AV-TSE backbones were adopted for evaluation on the VoxCeleb2 dataset, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various metrics.</description>

      <title>Enabling Auditory Large Language Models for Automatic Speech Quality Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech quality assessment typically requires evaluating audio from multiple aspects, such as mean opinion score (MOS) and speaker similarity (SIM) \etc., which can be challenging to cover using one small model designed for a single task. In this paper, we propose leveraging recently introduced auditory large language models (LLMs) for automatic speech quality assessment. By employing task-specific prompts, auditory LLMs are finetuned to predict MOS, SIM and A/B testing results, which are commonly used for evaluating text-to-speech systems. Additionally, the finetuned auditory LLM is able to generate natural language descriptions assessing aspects like noisiness, distortion, discontinuity, and overall quality, providing more interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments have been performed on the NISQA, BVCC, SOMOS and VoxSim speech quality datasets, using open-source auditory LLMs such as SALMONN, Qwen-Audio, and Qwen2-Audio. For the natural language descriptions task, a commercial model Google Gemini 1.5 Pro is also evaluated. The results demonstrate that auditory LLMs achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art task-specific small models in predicting MOS and SIM, while also delivering promising results in A/B testing and natural language descriptions. Our data processing scripts and finetuned model checkpoints can be found at https://github.com/bytedance/SALMONN.</description>

      <title>QualiSpeech: A Speech Quality Assessment Dataset with Natural Language Reasoning and Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel perspective to speech quality assessment by leveraging natural language descriptions, offering richer, more nuanced insights than traditional numerical scoring methods. Natural language feedback provides instructive recommendations and detailed evaluations, yet existing datasets lack the comprehensive annotations needed for this approach. To bridge this gap, we introduce QualiSpeech, a comprehensive low-level speech quality assessment dataset encompassing 11 key aspects and detailed natural language comments that include reasoning and contextual insights. Additionally, we propose the QualiSpeech Benchmark to evaluate the low-level speech understanding capabilities of auditory large language models (LLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that finetuned auditory LLMs can reliably generate detailed descriptions of noise and distortion, effectively identifying their types and temporal characteristics. The results further highlight the potential for incorporating reasoning to enhance the accuracy and reliability of quality assessments. The dataset will be released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsinghua-ee/QualiSpeech.</description>

      <title>STONE: Self-supervised Tonality Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07408v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although deep neural networks can estimate the key of a musical piece, their supervision incurs a massive annotation effort. Against this shortcoming, we present STONE, the first self-supervised tonality estimator. The architecture behind STONE, named ChromaNet, is a convnet with octave equivalence which outputs a key signature profile (KSP) of 12 structured logits. First, we train ChromaNet to regress artificial pitch transpositions between any two unlabeled musical excerpts from the same audio track, as measured as cross-power spectral density (CPSD) within the circle of fifths (CoF). We observe that this self-supervised pretext task leads KSP to correlate with tonal key signature. Based on this observation, we extend STONE to output a structured KSP of 24 logits, and introduce supervision so as to disambiguate major versus minor keys sharing the same key signature. Applying different amounts of supervision yields semi-supervised and fully supervised tonality estimators: i.e., Semi-TONEs and Sup-TONEs. We evaluate these estimators on FMAK, a new dataset of 5489 real-world musical recordings with expert annotation of 24 major and minor keys. We find that Semi-TONE matches the classification accuracy of Sup-TONE with reduced supervision and outperforms it with equal supervision.</description>

      <title>S-KEY: Self-supervised Learning of Major and Minor Keys from Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: STONE, the current method in self-supervised learning for tonality estimation in music signals, cannot distinguish relative keys, such as C major versus A minor. In this article, we extend the neural network architecture and learning objective of STONE to perform self-supervised learning of major and minor keys (S-KEY). Our main contribution is an auxiliary pretext task to STONE, formulated using transposition-invariant chroma features as a source of pseudo-labels. S-KEY matches the supervised state of the art in tonality estimation on FMAKv2 and GTZAN datasets while requiring no human annotation and having the same parameter budget as STONE. We build upon this result and expand the training set of S-KEY to a million songs, thus showing the potential of large-scale self-supervised learning in music information retrieval.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous bimodal attention fusion for speech emotion recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations is a challenging problem due to the complex and complementary interactions between different modalities. Audio and textual cues are particularly important for understanding emotions from a human perspective. Most existing studies focus on exploring interactions between audio and text modalities at the same representation level. However, a critical issue is often overlooked: the heterogeneous modality gap between low-level audio representations and high-level text representations. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework called Heterogeneous Bimodal Attention Fusion (HBAF) for multi-level multi-modal interaction in conversational emotion recognition. The proposed method comprises three key modules: the uni-modal representation module, the multi-modal fusion module, and the inter-modal contrastive learning module. The uni-modal representation module incorporates contextual content into low-level audio representations to bridge the heterogeneous multi-modal gap, enabling more effective fusion. The multi-modal fusion module uses dynamic bimodal attention and a dynamic gating mechanism to filter incorrect cross-modal relationships and fully exploit both intra-modal and inter-modal interactions. Finally, the inter-modal contrastive learning module captures complex absolute and relative interactions between audio and text modalities. Experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the proposed HBAF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.</description>
