      <title>Concrete Branching Bisimilarity for Processes with Time-outs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an adaptation of branching bisimilarity to reactive systems with time-outs that does not enable eliding of time-out transitions. Multiple equivalent definitions are procured, along with a modal characterisation and a proof of its congruence property for a standard process algebra with recursion. The last section presents a complete axiomatisation for guarded processes without infinite sequences of unobservable actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Classical Logics. Theory and Applications (NCL) is an international conference which aims to present novel results and survey works in widely understood non-classical logics and their applications. This year's edition was also an opportunity to hold a special session devoted to the ERC-funded project "ExtenDD" devoted to complex terms and term-forming operators.</description>

      <title>The Annotated Dependency Pair Framework for Almost-Sure Termination of Probabilistic Term Rewriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dependency pairs are one of the most powerful techniques to analyze termination of term rewrite systems automatically. We adapt dependency pairs to the probabilistic setting and develop an annotated dependency pair framework for automatically proving almost-sure termination of probabilistic term rewrite systems, both for full and innermost rewriting. To evaluate its power, we implemented our framework in the tool AProVE.</description>

      <title>Relative Constructibility via Restricted Abstract State Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We restrict the computational power of Gurevich's abstract state machines to obtain two classes of machine models for generalised computation of sets, namely restricted abstract state machines (RASMs) and restricted abstract state machines with parameters (RASMPs). We derive from each class, a relative computability relation on sets, which is analogous to the Turing reducibility relation on reals. We then prove that the relative computability relation derived from RASMPs is equivalent to relative constructibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover a strong correspondence between Bayesian Networks and (Multiplicative) Linear Logic Proof-Nets, relating the two as a representation of a joint probability distribution and at the level of computation, so yielding a proof-theoretical account of Bayesian Inference.</description>

      <title>A Formal Correctness Proof of Edmonds' Blossom Shrinking Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first formal correctness proof of Edmonds' blossom shrinking algorithm for maximum cardinality matching in general graphs. We focus on formalising the mathematical structures and properties that allow the algorithm to run in worst-case polynomial running time. We formalise Berge's lemma, blossoms and their properties, and a mathematical model of the algorithm, showing that it is totally correct. We provide the first detailed proofs of many of the facts underlying the algorithm's correctness.</description>

      <title>A Qualitative Analysis of Kernel Extension for Higher Order Proof Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the sake of reliability, the kernels of Interactive Theorem Provers (ITPs) are generally kept relatively small. On top of the kernel, additional symbols and inference rules are defined. This paper presents an analysis of how kernel extension reduces the size of proofs and impacts proof checking.</description>

      <title>The Category of Operator Spaces and Complete Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the category OS of operator spaces, with complete contractions as morphisms, is locally countably presentable. This result, together with its symmetric monoidal closed structure with respect to the projective tensor product of operator spaces, implies the existence of cofree (cocommutative) coalgebras with respect to the projective tensor product and therefore provides a mathematical model of Intuitionistic Linear Logic in the sense of Lafont.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Divergence for Nondeterministic Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Branching and weak probabilistic bisimilarities are two well-known notions capturing behavioral equivalence between nondeterministic probabilistic systems. For probabilistic systems, divergence is of major concern. Recently several divergence-sensitive refinements of branching and weak probabilistic bisimilarities have been proposed in the literature. Both the definitions of these equivalences and the techniques to investigate them differ significantly. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study on divergence-sensitive behavioral equivalence relations that refine the branching and weak probabilistic bisimilarities. Additionally, these equivalence relations are shown to have efficient checking algorithms. The techniques of this paper might be of independent interest in a more general setting.</description>

      <title>The Decision Problem for Regular First-Order Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The \emph{Entscheidungsproblem}, or the classical decision problem, asks whether a given formula of first-order logic is satisfiable. In this work, we consider an extension of this problem to regular first-order \emph{theories}, i.e., (infinite) regular sets of formulae. Building on the elegant classification of syntactic classes as decidable or undecidable for the classical decision problem, we show that some classes (specifically, the EPR and Gurevich classes), which are decidable in the classical setting, become undecidable for regular theories. On the other hand, for each of these classes, we identify a subclass that remains decidable in our setting, leaving a complete classification as a challenge for future work. Finally, we observe that our problem generalises prior work on automata-theoretic verification of uninterpreted programs and propose a semantic class of existential formulae for which the problem is decidable.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Formalisms for Representing Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a longstanding dispute over which formalism is the best for representing knowledge in AI. The well-known "declarative vs. procedural controversy" is concerned with the choice of utilizing declarations or procedures as the primary mode of knowledge representation. The ongoing debate between symbolic AI and connectionist AI also revolves around the question of whether knowledge should be represented implicitly (e.g., as parametric knowledge in deep learning and large language models) or explicitly (e.g., as logical theories in traditional knowledge representation and reasoning). To address these issues, we propose a general framework to capture various knowledge representation formalisms in which we are interested. Within the framework, we find a family of universal knowledge representation formalisms, and prove that all universal formalisms are recursively isomorphic. Moreover, we show that all pairwise intertranslatable formalisms that admit the padding property are also recursively isomorphic. These imply that, up to an offline compilation, all universal (or natural and equally expressive) representation formalisms are in fact the same, which thus provides a partial answer to the aforementioned dispute.</description>
