      <title>Emotion Neural Transducer for Fine-Grained Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mainstream paradigm of speech emotion recognition (SER) is identifying the single emotion label of the entire utterance. This line of works neglect the emotion dynamics at fine temporal granularity and mostly fail to leverage linguistic information of speech signal explicitly. In this paper, we propose Emotion Neural Transducer for fine-grained speech emotion recognition with automatic speech recognition (ASR) joint training. We first extend typical neural transducer with emotion joint network to construct emotion lattice for fine-grained SER. Then we propose lattice max pooling on the alignment lattice to facilitate distinguishing emotional and non-emotional frames. To adapt fine-grained SER to transducer inference manner, we further make blank, the special symbol of ASR, serve as underlying emotion indicator as well, yielding Factorized Emotion Neural Transducer. For typical utterance-level SER, our ENT models outperform state-of-the-art methods on IEMOCAP in low word error rate. Experiments on IEMOCAP and the latest speech emotion diarization dataset ZED also demonstrate the superiority of fine-grained emotion modeling.

      <title>A Novel Stochastic Transformer-based Approach for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Detection using Audio Recording of Clinical Interviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder that can be developed after witnessing or experiencing extremely traumatic events. PTSD can affect anyone, regardless of ethnicity, or culture. An estimated one in every eleven people will experience PTSD during their lifetime. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the PTSD Check List for Civilians (PCL-C) interviews are gold standards in the diagnosis of PTSD. These questionnaires can be fooled by the subject's responses. This work proposes a deep learning-based approach that achieves state-of-the-art performances for PTSD detection using audio recordings during clinical interviews. Our approach is based on MFCC low-level features extracted from audio recordings of clinical interviews, followed by deep high-level learning using a Stochastic Transformer. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performances with an RMSE of 2.92 on the eDAIC dataset thanks to the stochastic depth, stochastic deep learning layers, and stochastic activation function.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric and trial-dependent modeling: the contribution of LIA to SdSV Challenge Task 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SdSv challenge Task 2 provided an opportunity to assess efficiency and robustness of modern text-independent speaker verification systems. But it also made it possible to test new approaches, capable of taking into account the main issues of this challenge (duration, language, ...). This paper describes the contributions of our laboratory to the speaker recognition field. These contributions highlight two other challenges in addition to short-duration and language: the mismatch between enrollment and test data and the one between subsets of the evaluation trial dataset. The proposed approaches experimentally show their relevance and efficiency on the SdSv evaluation, and could be of interest in many real-life applications.</description>

      <title>JEP-KD: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture Based Knowledge Distillation for Visual Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) tasks are generally recognized to have a lower theoretical performance ceiling than Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), owing to the inherent limitations of conveying semantic information visually. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces an advanced knowledge distillation approach using a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), named JEP-KD, designed to more effectively utilize audio features during model training. Central to JEP-KD is the inclusion of a generative network within the embedding layer, which enhances the video encoder's capacity for semantic feature extraction and brings it into closer alignment with the audio features from a pre-trained ASR model's encoder. This approach aims to progressively reduce the performance gap between VSR and ASR. Moreover, a comprehensive multimodal, multistage training regimen for the JEP-KD framework is established, bolstering the robustness and efficacy of the training process. Experiment results demonstrate that JEP-KD significantly improves the performance of VSR models and demonstrates versatility across different VSR platforms, indicating its potential for broader application within other multimodal tasks.</description>

      <title>Robust Active Speaker Detection in Noisy Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of active speaker detection (ASD) in noisy environments and formulates a robust active speaker detection (rASD) problem. Existing ASD approaches leverage both audio and visual modalities, but non-speech sounds in the surrounding environment can negatively impact performance. To overcome this, we propose a novel framework that utilizes audio-visual speech separation as guidance to learn noise-free audio features. These features are then utilized in an ASD model, and both tasks are jointly optimized in an end-to-end framework. Our proposed framework mitigates residual noise and audio quality reduction issues that can occur in a naive cascaded two-stage framework that directly uses separated speech for ASD, and enables the two tasks to be optimized simultaneously. To further enhance the robustness of the audio features and handle inherent speech noises, we propose a dynamic weighted loss approach to train the speech separator. We also collected a real-world noise audio dataset to facilitate investigations. Experiments demonstrate that non-speech audio noises significantly impact ASD models, and our proposed approach improves ASD performance in noisy environments. The framework is general and can be applied to different ASD approaches to improve their robustness. Our code, models, and data will be released.</description>

      <title>Phonetic Segmentation of the UCLA Phonetics Lab Archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research in speech technologies and comparative linguistics depends on access to diverse and accessible speech data. The UCLA Phonetics Lab Archive is one of the earliest multilingual speech corpora, with long-form audio recordings and phonetic transcriptions for 314 languages (Ladefoged et al., 2009). Recently, 95 of these languages were time-aligned with word-level phonetic transcriptions (Li et al., 2021). Here we present VoxAngeles, a corpus of audited phonetic transcriptions and phone-level alignments of the UCLA Phonetics Lab Archive, which uses the 95-language CMU re-release as our starting point. VoxAngeles also includes word- and phone-level segmentations from the original UCLA corpus, as well as phonetic measurements of word and phone durations, vowel formants, and vowel f0. This corpus enhances the usability of the original data, particularly for quantitative phonetic typology, as demonstrated through a case study of vowel intrinsic f0. We also discuss the utility of the VoxAngeles corpus for general research and pedagogy in crosslinguistic phonetics, as well as for low-resource and multilingual speech technologies.

      <title>Siamese Vision Transformers are Scalable Audio-visual Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional audio-visual methods rely on independent audio and visual backbones, which is costly and not scalable. In this work, we investigate using an audio-visual siamese network (AVSiam) for efficient and scalable audio-visual pretraining. Our framework uses a single shared vision transformer backbone to process audio and visual inputs, improving its parameter efficiency, reducing the GPU memory footprint, and allowing us to scale our method to larger datasets and model sizes. We pretrain our model using a contrastive audio-visual matching objective with a multi-ratio random masking scheme, which enables our model to process larger audio-visual instance batches, helpful for contrastive learning. Unlike prior audio-visual methods, our method can robustly handle audio, visual, and audio-visual inputs with a single shared ViT backbone. Furthermore, despite using the shared backbone for both modalities, AVSiam achieves competitive or even better results than prior methods on AudioSet and VGGSound for audio-visual classification and retrieval.

      <title>LipVoicer: Generating Speech from Silent Videos Guided by Lip Reading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lip-to-speech involves generating a natural-sounding speech synchronized with a soundless video of a person talking. Despite recent advances, current methods still cannot produce high-quality speech with high levels of intelligibility for challenging and realistic datasets such as LRS3. In this work, we present LipVoicer, a novel method that generates high-quality speech, even for in-the-wild and rich datasets, by incorporating the text modality. Given a silent video, we first predict the spoken text using a pre-trained lip-reading network. We then condition a diffusion model on the video and use the extracted text through a classifier-guidance mechanism where a pre-trained ASR serves as the classifier. LipVoicer outperforms multiple lip-to-speech baselines on LRS2 and LRS3, which are in-the-wild datasets with hundreds of unique speakers in their test set and an unrestricted vocabulary. Moreover, our experiments show that the inclusion of the text modality plays a major role in the intelligibility of the produced speech, readily perceptible while listening, and is empirically reflected in the substantial reduction of the WER metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LipVoicer through human evaluation, which shows that it produces more natural and synchronized speech signals compared to competing methods. Finally, we created a demo showcasing LipVoicer's superiority in producing natural, synchronized, and intelligible speech, providing additional evidence of its effectiveness.
