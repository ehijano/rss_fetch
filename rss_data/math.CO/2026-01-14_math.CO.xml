      <title>Laplacian eigenvalue conditions for edge-disjoint spanning trees and a forest with constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a positive integer and let $G$ be a simple graph of order $n$ with minimum degree $\delta$. A graph $G$ is said to have property $P(k, d)$ if it contains $k$ edge-disjoint spanning trees and an additional forest $F$ with edge number $|E(F)| &gt; \frac{d-1}{d}(|V(G)| - 1)$, such that if $F$ is not a spanning tree, then $F$ has a component with at least $d$ edges. Let $D(G)$ be the degree diagonal matrix of $G$. We denote $\lambda_i$ and $\mu_i$ as the $i$th largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix $A(G)$ of $G$ and the Laplacian matrix $L(G) = D(G) - A(G)$ of $G$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$, respectively. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between Laplacian eigenvalues and property $P(k, \delta)$. Let $t$ be a positive integer, and define $\mathcal{G}_t$ as the set of simple graphs such that each $G \in \mathcal{G}_t$ contains at least $t+1$ non-empty disjoint proper subsets $V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_{t+1}$ satisfying $V(G) \setminus \bigcup_{i=1}^{t+1} V_i \neq \emptyset$ and edge connectivity $\kappa'(G) = e(V_i, V(G) \setminus V_i)$ for any $i = 1, 2, \ldots, t+1$. For the class of graphs $\mathcal{G}_1$ with minimum degree $\delta$, we provide a sufficient condition involving the third smallest Laplacian eigenvalue $\mu_{n-2}(G)$ for a graph $G\in \mathcal{G}_1$ to have property $P(k, \delta)$. Similarly, for the class of graphs $\mathcal{G}_2$ with minimum degree $\delta$, we establish a corresponding sufficient condition involving the fourth smallest Laplacian eigenvalue $\mu_{n-3}(G)$ for a graph $G\in \mathcal{G}_2$ to have property $P(k, \delta)$. Furthermore, we extend the spectral conditions for all the results about $\mu_{n-2}(G)$, $\mu_{n-3}(G)$ and $\lambda_2(G)$ to the general graph matrices $aD(G) + A(G)$ and $aD(G) + bA(G)$.</description>

      <title>Distance spectral radius conditions for edge-disjoint spanning trees and a forest with constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k\ge 2$ be a positive integer and let $G$ be a simple graph of order $n$ with minimum degree $\delta$. A graph $G$ is said to have property $P(k, d)$ if it contains $k$ edge-disjoint spanning trees and an additional forest $F$ with edge number $|E(F)| &gt; \frac{d-1}{d}(n-1)$, such that if $F$ is not a spanning tree, then $F$ has a component with at least $d$ edges. Let $D(G)$ be the distance matrix of $G$. We denote $\rho_D(G)$ as the largest eigenvalue of $D(G)$, which is called the distance spectral radius of $G$. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the distance spectral radius and the property $P(k, \delta)$. We prove that for a connected graph $G$ of order $n \ge 2k+8$ with minimum degree $\delta \ge k+2$, if $\rho_D(G) \le \rho_D(K_{k-1} \vee (K_{n-k} \cup K_1))$, then $G$ possesses property $P(k, \delta)$. Furthermore, for a connected balanced bipartite graph $G$ of order $n \ge 4k+8$ with minimum degree $\delta \ge k+2$, we show that if $\rho_D(G) \le \rho_D(K_{\frac{n}{2}, \frac{n}{2}} \setminus E(K_{1, \frac{n}{2}-k+1}))$, then $G$ also possesses property $P(k, \delta)$. Our results generalize the work of Fan et al. [Discrete Appl. Math. 376 (2025), 31--40] from the existence of $k$ edge-disjoint spanning trees to the more refined structural property $P(k, \delta)$.</description>

      <title>The genesis sequence, tree records and endofunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a series of bijections that reveal the deep connections between the concepts of tree records, the girth of a connected endofunction, and the genesis sequence, the first sequence in the OEIS. We use these results to derive the generating functions for the tree and forest record numbers, expressing them in terms of the Cayley's tree function. Finally, we provide a new proof for Cayley's forest formula.</description>

      <title>The punctured dodecacode is unique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The punctured dodecacode is an additive $4$-ary code of length $11$ and distance $5$ which is uniformly packed. We show that a code with the same weight distribution is equivalent to it. This code is also shown to be nonlinear.
  We also establish the nonexistence of analogues of the dodecacode and the punctured dodecacode in Doob graphs. To that end, we classify two-weight codes of weights $6$ and $8$ in Doob and $4$-ary Hamming graphs of diameter $9$ and the corresponding strongly regular graphs.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum K-theory ring $QK(X)$ of a Grassmannian $X$ and prove a manifestly positive formula for the product of an arbitrary class by a hook class. This generalizes the quantum K-theoretic Pieri rule, a prior result of Buch and Mihalcea. We also present a combinatorial interpretation of this result.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial comparison of general galled trees, time-consistent galled trees, and simplex time-consistent galled trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rooted binary phylogenetic networks are extensions of rooted binary trees, adding reticulation nodes that are designed to represent evolutionary processes that involve hybridization events. Enumerative combinatorics studies have counted leaf-labeled phylogenetic networks in a variety of classes, finding that when the number of reticulations is fixed, the time-consistent galled trees are asymptotically less numerous than each of several network classes that had been previously examined. Here we provide enumerative results on two additional network classes: general galled trees and simplex time-consistent galled trees. We show that for a fixed number of galls, as the number of leaves goes to infinity, the asymptotic count of general galled trees is identical to that of time-consistent galled trees, whereas the count of simplex time-consistent galled trees is smaller. If the number of galls is not restricted, then the asymptotic approximations all differ: simplex time-consistent galled trees are less numerous than time-consistent galled trees, which are in turn less numerous than general galled trees. We also report a variety of additional results: recursions to count the studied networks with small numbers of leaves a fixed number of galls, as well as enumerative results for unlabeled networks in the classes that we investigate.</description>

      <title>Flow cones of graphs with cycles and locally gentle algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow cones of a directed acyclic graph admit a family of unimodular triangulations given by Danilov, Karzanov, and Koshevoy (DKK) whose normal fans are related to (generalizations) of the associahedron and permutahedron. A correspondence between these triangulations for certain graphs and maximal cones of a $g$-vector fan of a gentle quiver associated to the graph was discovered by von Bell, Braun, Bruegge, Hanely, Peterson, Serhiyenko, and Yip in 2022. This correspondence has been fruitful in uncovering lattice structures in the triangulations. We start by showing that this correspondence is actually a linear isomorphism. We then consider flow cones of certain graphs with cycles. For this case, we give a DKK-like triangulation of the cone, and extend the correspondence to the finite $g$-vector fan of a corresponding locally gentle quiver. In addition, we extend to cyclic graphs a mysterious result of Postnikov--Stanley and Baldoni--Vergne, giving the volume of flow polytopes of acyclic graphs as the number of certain integer flows on the same graph.
  We illustrate our results with a two-parameter family of cyclic graphs that includes a cycle graph and nested 2-cycles as special cases. We show that the fans of its DKK-like triangulations are respectively isomorphic to the normal fan of the cyclohedron and of a new polytope with the same $f$-vector but different combinatorial type than the permutahedron.</description>

      <title>On the Mutual-Visibility of Tree Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of mutual visibility in graphs arises from constraining shortest paths by forbidding internal vertices from belonging to a specified subset. Mutual-visibility sets, originally introduced as a tool for studying information flow and structural restrictions in complex networks, have since gained increasing attention due to their theoretical significance and diverse applications. In this paper, a complete characterization of mutual-visibility sets in trees is presented. It is shown that a subset $S$ is a mutual-visibility set of $T$ if and only if it coincides with the set of leaves of the Steiner subtree $T\langle S\rangle$. As a consequence, the mutual-visibility number of a tree is equal to the number of its leaves. For trees containing branch vertices, the notion of legs is introduced and an explicit formula for the number of maximal mutual-visibility sets is derived in terms of the corresponding leg lengths. It is proved that every tree is absolute-clear. It is further established that the mutual-visibility number is preserved under the line graph operation for trees with at least two edges, that is, $\mu(L(T))=\mu(T)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the generalized Temperley trick, we demonstrate the explicit embedding of circular electrical networks into totally non-negative Grassmannians. Building on this result, we show that the effective resistances between boundary nodes of circular electrical networks satisfy the Kalmanson property, and we provide the full characterization of planar electrical Kalmanson metrics. Additionally, we present a graph reconstruction algorithm with applications in phylogenetic network analysis as well as the numerical solution of the Calderon problem.</description>

      <title>On the parameterized complexity of the Maker-Breaker domination game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its introduction as a Maker-Breaker positional game by Duch\^ene et al. in 2020, the Maker-Breaker domination game has become one of the most studied positional games on vertices. In this game, two players, Dominator and Staller, alternately claim an unclaimed vertex of a given graph G. If at some point the set of vertices claimed by Dominator is a dominating set, she wins; otherwise, i.e. if Staller manages to isolate a vertex by claiming all its closed neighborhood, Staller wins.
  Given a graph G and a first player, Dominator or Staller must have a winning strategy. We are interested in the computational complexity of determining which player has such a strategy. This problem is known to be PSPACE-complete on bipartite graphs of bounded degree and split graphs; polynomial on cographs, outerplanar graphs, and block graphs; and in NP for interval graphs.
  In this paper, we consider the parameterized complexity of this game. We start by considering as a parameter the number of moves of both players. We prove that for the general framework of Maker-Breaker positional games in hypergraphs, determining whether Breaker can claim a transversal of the hypergraph in k moves is W[2]-complete, in contrast to the problem of determining whether Maker can claim all the vertices of a hyperedge in k moves, which is known to be W[1]-complete since 2017. These two hardness results are then applied to the Maker-Breaker domination game, proving that it is W[2]-complete to decide if Dominator can dominate the graph in k moves and W[1]-complete to decide if Staller can isolate a vertex in k moves. Next, we provide FPT algorithms for the Maker-Breaker domination game parameterized by the neighborhood diversity, the modular width, the P4-fewness, the distance to cluster, and the feedback edge number.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of the Ising free energy on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ferromagnetic Ising model on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $\mathbb{G}(n,m)$ with bounded average degree $d=2m/n$. Specifically, we determine the limiting distribution of $\log Z_{\mathbb{G}(n,m)}(\beta,B)$, where $Z_{\mathbb{G}(n,m)}(\beta,B)$ is the partition function at inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ and external field $B\geq0$.
  If either $B&gt;0$, or $B=0$, $d&gt;1$ and $\beta&gt;\operatorname{ath}(1/d)$ the limiting distribution is a Gaussian whose variance is of order $\Theta(n)$ and is described by a family of stochastic fixed point problems that encode the root magnetisation of two correlated Galton-Watson trees. By contrast, if $B=0$ and either $d\leq1$ or $\beta&lt;\operatorname{ath}(1/d)$ the limiting distribution is an infinite sum of independent random variables and has bounded variance.</description>

      <title>The signless Laplacian spectral Tur\'an problems for hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}=(V, E)$ be an $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices. The signless Laplacian spectral radius of $\mathcal{H}$ is defined as the maximum modulus of the eigenvalues of the tensor $\mathcal{Q}(\mathcal{H})=\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{H})+\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{H})$, where $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{H})$ and $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{H})$ are the diagonal tensor of degrees and adjacency tensor of $G$, respectively. In this paper, we establish a general theorem that extends the spectral Tur\'an result of Keevash, Lenz and Mubayi [SIAM J. Discrete Math., 28 (4) (2014)]
  to the setting of signless Laplacian spectral Tur\'an problems. We prove that for any family $\mathcal{F}$ of $r$-uniform hypergraphs that is degree-stable with respect to a family $\mathcal{H}_n$ of $r$-uniform hypergraphs and whose extremal constructions satisfy certain natural assumptions, the signless Laplacian spectral Tur\'an problem can be effectively reduced to the corresponding problem restricted to the family $\mathcal{H}_n$. As a concrete application, we completely characterize the signless Laplacian spectral extremal hypergraph for the Fano plane.</description>

      <title>Locally dihedral block designs and primitive groups with dihedral point stabilizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a block design admitting a locally transitive automorphism group $G$. We say $\mathcal{D}$ is $G$-point-locally dihedral if the induced local action $G_x^{\mathcal{D}(x)}$ is dihedral for each point $x$, and say $\mathcal{D}$ is $G$-block-locally dihedral if the induced local action $G_B^B$ is dihedral for each block $B$. The design $\mathcal{D}$ is called $G$-locally dihedral if both conditions hold. We give a classification of primitive permutation groups with dihedral point stabilizers, and apply it to classify point-locally dihedral block designs. For symmetric designs with a dihedral local action, we show that $G_x$ and $G_B$ are conjugate in $G$. Moreover, both local actions are faithful, and $G$ acts imprimitively on both points and blocks.</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound for the Diameter of Cayley Graph of the Symmetric Group $S_n$ Generated by $(12), (12 \dots n), (1n \dots 2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let us denote elements of the symmetric group $S_n$ using square brackets for the one-line notation. Cycles will be represented using parentheses, following the standard cycle notation. Under this convention, the full reversal of the identity element $()$ is the element $s = [n\ n-1 \dots 1]$. In the present work, we obtain a lower bound on the decomposition complexity of elements $s(1n \dots 2)^{i}$ into the generators $(12), (12 \dots n), (1n \dots 2)$, where $i$ ranges over the set $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. As a consequence, we derive the lower bound $n(n-1)/2$ for the diameter of Cayley graph of the group $S_n$ generated by $(12), (12 \dots n), (1n \dots 2)$.</description>

      <title>Cycles with almost linearly many chords</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that constant minimum degree already forces cycles with almost linearly many chords. Specifically, every graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\ge C$ contains a cycle of length $\ell\ge 4$ with $\Omega(\ell/\log^{C}\ell)$ chords for some absolute constant $C&gt;0$. This is the first result showing that a constant-degree condition yields an unbounded -- indeed nearly linear -- number of chords, placing our bound within a polylogarithmic factor of the Chen--Erd\H{o}s--Staton conjecture. It also gives a strong affirmative conclusion in the direction of a recent question of Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Martins, Thomass\'e, and Trotignon asking whether constant-degree graphs must contain cycles whose chord counts grow with their length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For two positive integers $m$ and $M$, we study the Davenport constant of the interval of integers $[\![ -m,M ]\!]$, that is the maximal length of a minimal zero-sum sequence composed of elements from $[\![ -m,M ]\!]$. We prove the conjecture that it is equal to $m+M- r$ where $r$ is the smallest integer which can be decomposed as a sum of two non-negative integers $t_1$ and $t_2$ ($r=t_1+t_2$) having the property that $\gcd (M-t_1, m-t_2)=1$.</description>

      <title>Virtual Hodge numbers of $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$: stability and calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{S}_n$-equivariant motivic invariants of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$ of degree-$d$ maps from $n$-pointed curves of genus $g$ to $\mathbb{P}^r$. In particular, we obtain formulas for the Serre characteristic, which specializes to the Hodge--Deligne polynomial. Fixing $g, r \geq 1$, we prove that an explicit invertible transform of the generating function for the Serre characteristics is rational. We use our formula to prove a stability result for the weight-graded compactly-supported Euler characteristics of $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$ as $d \to \infty$. In genus one and two, we reduce the calculation of the Serre characteristic of $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$ to those of the moduli spaces $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}$ of $n$-pointed curves. Since Getzler has calculated the Serre characteristic of $\mathcal{M}_{1, n}$, our formula in particular determines the Serre characteristic of $\mathcal{M}_{1, n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$ for arbitrary $n$, $r$, and $d$. Our formula also calculates the Serre characteristic of $\mathcal{M}_{2, n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$ whenever those of $\mathcal{M}_{2, n +k}$ are known for $k \leq d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, sharp matrix concentration inequalities~\cite{BBvH23,BvH24} were developed using the theory of free probability. In this work, we design polynomial time deterministic algorithms to construct outcomes that satisfy the guarantees of these inequalities. As direct consequences, we obtain polynomial time deterministic algorithms for the matrix Spencer problem~\cite{BJM23} and for constructing near-Ramanujan graphs. Our proofs show that the concepts and techniques in free probability are useful not only for mathematical analyses but also for efficient computations.</description>

      <title>Cardinality-consistent flag codes with longer type vectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flag codes generalize constant dimension codes by considering sequences of nested subspaces with prescribed dimensions as codewords. A comprehensive construction, which unites cyclic orbit flag codes, yields two families of flag codes on $\mathbb{F}^n_q$ (where $n=sk+h$ with $s\geq 2$ and $0\leq h &lt; k$): optimum distance flag codes of the longest possible type vector $(1, 2, \ldots, k, n-k, \ldots, n-1)$ and flag codes with longer type vectors $(1, 2, \ldots, k+h, 2k+h, \ldots, (s-2)k+h, n-k, \ldots, n-1)$. These flag codes achieve the same cardinality $\sum^{s-1}_{i=1}q^{ik+h}+1$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we define a generating function for buildings of type $\widetilde{A}_1$ (i.e. trees) that are enhanced with a certain filtration structure. We prove that this generating function recovers the zeta function of certain quadratic orders. We do this by studying how the ideals of the orders distribute in the building of $SL(2, K)$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic distribution of the Betti numbers of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic normality is frequently observed in large combinatorial structures, rigorously established for many quantities such as cycles or inversions in random permutations, the number of prime factors of random integers, and various parameters of random graphs. In this paper, we investigate whether this normal limit behavior extends to the topological invariants of geometric spaces. We show that the Betti numbers of the moduli space of rational curves with $n$ marked points $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}$ and the Fulton-MacPherson configuration space $\mathbb{P}^1[n]$ are asymptotically normally distributed. Based on numerical evidence and established log-concavity, we conjecture that the Betti numbers of the quotients of these spaces by the symmetric group $\mathbb{S}_n$ are also asymptotically normally distributed. In contrast, we provide examples of geometric spaces that do not follow this Gaussian law.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the circular coloring of signed graphs. A signed graph is a graph with a signature that assigns a sign to each edge, either positive or negative. This paper studies circular coloring and a circular chromatic number of Type 1 and Type Cartesian products. We shall prove the following results: The circular chromatic number of Cartesian product Type 1 $(G,\sigma)\Box (H,\tau)$ is $\chi_{c}(G \Box H,\sigma\Box\tau)=\max\{\chi_{c}(G,\sigma),\chi_{c}(H,\tau)\}$ and the circular chromatic number of Cartesian product Type 2 $(G,\sigma)\Box' (H,\tau)$ satisfies $\chi_{c}(G \Box' H,\sigma\Box' \tau)\leq 2\max\{\chi_{c}(G),\chi_{c}(H)\}$.</description>

      <title>A refined graph container lemma and applications to the hard-core model on bipartite expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a refined version of a graph container lemma due to Galvin and discuss several applications related to the hard-core model on bipartite expander graphs. Given a graph $G$ and $\lambda&gt;0$, the hard-core model on $G$ at activity $\lambda$ is the probability distribution $\mu_{G,\lambda}$ on independent sets in $G$ given by $\mu_{G,\lambda}(I)\propto \lambda^{|I|}$. As one of our main applications, we show that the hard-core model at activity $\lambda$ on the hypercube $Q_d$ exhibits a `structured phase' for $\lambda= \Omega( \log^2 d/d^{1/2})$ in the following sense: in a typical sample from $\mu_{Q_d,\lambda}$, most vertices are contained in one side of the bipartition of $Q_d$. This improves upon a result of Galvin which establishes the same for $\lambda=\Omega(\log d/ d^{1/3})$. As another application, we establish a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the hard-core model on a $d$-regular bipartite $\alpha$-expander, with $\alpha&gt;0$ fixed, when $\lambda= \Omega( \log^2 d/d^{1/2})$. This improves upon the bound $\lambda=\Omega(\log d/ d^{1/4})$ due to the first author, Perkins and Potukuchi. We discuss similar improvements to results of Galvin-Tetali, Balogh-Garcia-Li and Kronenberg-Spinka.</description>

Abstract: Improved algorithms for computing (partial and full) exterior algebraic shifts of hypergraphs and simplicial complexes are presented. The main benefit is in positive characteristic. Experiments with an implementation in OSCAR with various inputs such as bipartite graphs and triangulations of two and three dimensional manifolds show that the method considerably extends for which simplicial complexes exterior algebraic shifts can be computed in practice.</description>

      <title>Groups with pairings, Hall modules, and Hall-Littlewood polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We relate the combinatorics of Hall-Littlewood polynomials to that of abelian $p$-groups with alternating or Hermitian perfect pairings. Our main result is an analogue of the classical relationship between the Hall algebra of abelian $p$-groups (without pairings) and Hall-Littlewood polynomials. Specifically, we define a module over the classical Hall algebra with basis indexed by groups with pairings, and explicitly relate its structure constants to Hall-Littlewood polynomials at different values of the parameter $t$. We also show certain expectation formulas with respect to Cohen-Lenstra type measures on groups with pairings. In the alternating case this gives a new and simpler proof of previous results of Delaunay-Jouhet.</description>

      <title>Counting tame $SL_3$- and $SL_4$- frieze patterns over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we count tame $ SL_3 $- and $ SL_4 $-frieze patterns with width $ w $ over a finite field $ K $, as well as some tame $ SL_k $-frieze patterns for higher $ k $. Let $ n = w + k + 1 $. We consider the sets $ C_k(n) $ of tuples of $ n $ points in the projective space $ \mathbb{P}^{k-1}(K) $, such that $ k $ consecutive points are always independent (the first and last point in the tuple are considered to be consecutive). First assume $ \gcd(k,n) = 1 $. In this case, we prove that the problem of counting tame $ SL_k $-frieze patterns can be reduced to counting $ C_k(n) $. We also show that $ \lvert C_k(n) \rvert $ is essentially already known as long as $ k $ and $ n $ are coprime, and we derive the number of tame $ SL_k $-frieze-patterns in that case. In the case $ \gcd(k,n) \neq 1 $, we define certain subsets $ C_k^*(n) $ and show that it is sufficient to count these sets. Afterwards, we count $ C_k^*(n)$ in the cases $ k = 3 $ and $ k = 4 $ and thus the number of tame $ SL_3 $- and $ SL_4 $-frieze patterns for any width $ w $.</description>

      <title>Edge densities of drawings of graphs with one forbidden cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A connected topological drawing of a graph divides the plane into a number of cells. The type of a cell $c$ is the cyclic sequence of crossings and vertices along the boundary walk of $c$. For example, all triangular cells with three incident crossings and no incident vertex share the same cell type. When a non-homotopic drawing of an $n$-vertex multigraph $G$ does not contain any such cells, Ackerman and Tardos [JCTA 2007] proved that $G$ has at most $8n-20$ edges, while Kaufmann, Klemz, Knorr, Reddy, Schr\"oder, and Ueckerdt [GD 2024] showed that this bound is tight. In this paper, we initiate the in-depth study of non-homotopic drawings that do not contain one fixed cell type \celltype, and investigate the edge density of the corresponding multigraphs, i.e., the maximum possible number of edges. We consider non-homotopic as well as simple drawings, multigraphs as well as simple graphs, and every possible type of cell. For every combination of drawing style, graph type, and cell type, we give upper and lower bounds on the corresponding edge density. With the exception of the cell type with four incident crossings and no incident vertex, we show for every cell type \celltype that the edge density of $n$-vertex (multi)graphs with \celltype-free drawings is either linear in $n$ or superlinear in $n$. In most cases, our bounds are tight up to an additive constant. We further consider cell types that are not incident to any crossing in more detail and find that all connected simple graphs but a short list of exceptions admit a simple drawing that does not contain any such cells. Additionally, we improve the current lower bound on the edge density of simple graphs that admit a non-homotopic quasiplanar drawing from $7n-28$ to $7.5n-28$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polysymmetric functions, introduced by Asvin G and Andrew O'Desky as a generalization of symmetric functions, have natural connections to algebraic geometry and provide a foundation for further developments. In this paper, we study polysymmetric functions using stack partitions and develop combinatorial descriptions of several polysymmetric bases. We introduce two new signed polysymmetric bases and give explicit transition formulas among the monomial, homogeneous, elementary, power, and signed polysymmetric bases. These results extend many familiar identities from symmetric function theory to the polysymmetric setting.</description>

      <title>On the combinatorics of tableaux -- Classification of lattices underlying Schensted correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Robinson-Schensted algorithm and each of its variants that have attracted substantial attention can be constructed using Fomin's "growth diagram" construction from a modular lattice that is also a weighted-differential poset. We classify all such lattices that meet certain criteria; the main criterion is that the lattice is distributive. Intuitively, these criteria seem excessively strict, but all known Fomin lattices satisfy all of these criteria, with the sole exception of one family that is not even distributive, the Young-Fibonacci lattices and cartesian products involving them. We discover a new class of Fomin lattices, but unfortunately they cannot be used to construct Robinson-Schensted algorithms.</description>

      <title>Distance spectral radius for a graph to be k-critical with respect to [1,b]-odd factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph, and let $b$ and $k$ be two positive integers with $b\equiv1$ (mod 2). A $[1,b]$-odd factor of $G$ is a spanning subgraph $F$ of $G$ with $d_F(v)\equiv1$ (mod 2) and $1\leq d_F(v)\leq b$ for every $v\in V(G)$. A graph $G$ is called $k$-critical with respect to $[1,b]$-odd factor if $G-X$ contains a $[1,b]$-odd factor for every $X\subseteq V(G)$ with $|X|=k$. Let $\mathcal{D}(G)$ denote the distance matrix of $G$. The largest eigenvalue of $\mathcal{D}(G)$, denoted by $\mu(G)$, is called the distance spectral radius of $G$. In this paper, we prove an upper bound for $\mu(G)$ in a connected graph $G$ which guarantees $G$ to be $k$-critical with respect to $[1,b]$-odd factor.</description>

      <title>Harmony in 10-TET: From Parallel Universes to Cousins of Desargues Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 10-tone equal temperament (10-TET) constitutes a distinct harmonic environment with step sizes exceeding the standard semitone, yet it has historically remained on the fringes of music theory. This paper proposes a radical shift in perspective, treating 10-TET not as an imperfect imitation of 12-TET, but as an independent harmonic universe with its own rigorous logic. We classify all possible harmonic systems in 10-TET using a single structural parameter, representing the difference between the harmonic mediants (the major and minor thirds) which sum to the generator (the fifth).
  Our analysis reveals a rich landscape of possibilities. The system defined by the structural parameter equal to 1 (we call it Wide) initially appears to suffer from a fundamental structural flaw: its harmonic space fractures into two disjoint, parallel universes. Conversely, the Wide system (structural parameter equal to 5) emerges as a geometrically superior structure, isomorphic to the Unique Cyclic Configuration in the classification of combinatorial 10_3 configurations, forming a fully connected, vertex-transitive graph. Between these extremes lies the Tritone system (structural parameter equal to 3), which topologically is similar to the Wide system, but it has a significantly larger symmetry group, due to the Tritone modal transformation. We conclude by providing a complete classification of these systems as bipartite circulant graphs, demonstrating that 10-TET is a mathematically complex and musically viable alternative to the standard 12-tone system.</description>

      <title>On symmetric pattern avoidance sets</title>

Abstract: For a set of permutations $S\subseteq S_n$, consider the quasisymmetric generating function
  $$Q(S): = \sum_{w\in S}F_{n, \mathrm{Des}(w)},$$
  where $\mathrm{Des}(w) := \{i\mid w(i)&gt; w(i+1)\}$ is the descent set of $w$ and $F_{n, \mathrm{Des}(w)}$ is Gessel's fundamental quasisymmetric function. A set of permutations is said to be symmetric (respectively, Schur-positive) if its quasisymmetric generating function is symmetric (respectively, Schur-positive). Given a set $\Pi$ of permutations, let $S_n(\Pi)$ denote the set of permutations in $S_n$ that avoid all patterns in $\Pi.$ A set $\Pi$ is said to be symmetrically avoided (respectively, Schur-positively avoided) if $S_n(\Pi)$ is symmetric (respectively, Schur-positive) for all $n.$
  Marmor proved in 2025 that for $n\ge 5$, a symmetric set $S\subseteq S_n$ has size at least $n-1$ unless $S\subseteq \{12\cdots n, n\cdots 21\}$ and asked for a general classification of the possible sizes of symmetric sets not containing the monotone elements $12\cdots n $ and $n\cdots 21$. We give a complete answer to this question for $n\ge 52.$ We also give a classification of symmetric sets of size at most $n-1$, thereby showing that they are actually Schur-positive, resolving a conjecture of Marmor. Finally, we give a classification of symmetrically avoided sets of size at most $n-1$, thereby showing that they are actually Schur-positively avoided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we show that the symbolic Rees algebra of a mixed ladder determinantal ideal is strongly $F$-regular. Furthermore, we prove that the symbolic associated graded algebra of a mixed ladder determinantal ideal is $F$-pure. The latter implies that mixed ladder determinantal rings are $F$-pure. We also show that ideals of the poset of minors of a generic matrix give rise to $F$-pure algebras with straightening law.</description>

      <title>The rank of a random triangular matrix over $\mathbb{F}_q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider uniformly random strictly upper-triangular matrices in $\operatorname{Mat}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$. For such a matrix $A_n$, we show that $n-\operatorname{rank}(A_n) \approx \log_q n$ as $n \to \infty$, and find that the fluctuations around this limit are finite-order and given by explicit $\mathbb{Z}$-valued random variables. More generally, we consider the random partition whose parts are the sizes of the nilpotent Jordan blocks of $A_n$: its $k$ largest parts (rows) were previously shown by Borodin to have jointly Gaussian fluctuations as $N \to \infty$, and its columns correspond to differences $\operatorname{rank}(A_n^{i-1}) - \operatorname{rank}(A_n^i)$. We show the fluctuations of the columns converge jointly to a discrete random point configuration $\mathcal{L}_{t,\chi}$ introduced in arXiv:2310.12275. The proofs use an explicit integral formula for the probabilities at finite $N$, obtained by de-Poissonizing a corresponding one in arXiv:2310.12275, which is amenable to asymptotic analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A toric amplitude is a rational function associated to a simplicial polyhedral fan. The definition is inspired by scattering amplitudes in particle physics. We prove algebraic properties of such amplitudes and study the geometry of their zero loci. These hypersurfaces play the role of Warren's adjoint via a dual volume interpretation. We investigate their Fano schemes and singular loci via the nef cone and toric irrelevant ideal of the fan.</description>

      <title>Intersection cohomology without spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We survey three settings in which dimensions of intersection cohomology groups of algebraic varieties provide deep combinatorial and representation-theoretic information, and computations of the groups themselves have been made using combinatorial sheaves on finite posets. These settings are (1) intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and their realizations via moment graph sheaves and Soergel bimodules; (2) intersection cohomology of toric varieties, the associated g-polynomials of convex polytopes, and their realization via the theory of intersection cohomology of fans; and (3) intersection cohomology of arrangement Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of matroids, and their realization via intersection cohomology of matroids. In all three settings these constructions are valid in more general situations where the variety does not exist, leading to "intersection cohomology without spaces." We give parallel presentations of these three stories, highlighting applications to KLS-polynomials.</description>
