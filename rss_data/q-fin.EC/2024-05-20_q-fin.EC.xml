      <title>Impact Analysis of the Chesa Boudin Administration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Claims of soft-handed prosecutorial policies and increases in crime were precipitating factors in the removal of Chesa Boudin as district attorney of the city and county of San Francisco. However, little research has been conducted to empirically investigate the veracity of these indictments on the former district attorney. Using regression discontinuity design (RDD), I find that the Boudin administration led to a 36\% and 21\% reduction in monthly prosecutions and convictions respectively for all crimes. Moreover, his tenure increased monthly successful case diversions by 58\%. When only looking at violent crimes during this period, the SFDA's office saw a 36\% decrease, 7\% decrease, and 47\% increase in monthly prosecutions, convictions, and successful case diversions respectively. Although, the decrease in monthly convictions was not statistically significant for the violent crimes subset. Additionally, I did identify a potentially causal relationship between lower numbers of prosecutions and higher levels of criminal activity, however, such findings did not meet the standard for statistical significance. Finally, I conclude that using machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks and K-nearest neighbors, in place of ordinary least squares regression for the estimation of the reduced form equation possibly may decrease the size of the standard errors of the parameters in the structural equation. However, future research needs to be conducted in this space to corroborate these initially promising findings.</description>

      <title>Earthquakes and the wealth of nations: The cases of Chile and New Zealand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The consequences of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, are evident: death, coordination problems, destruction of infrastructure, and displacement of population. However, according to empirical research, the impact of a natural disaster on economic activity is mixed. Natural disasters could have significant economic effects, especially in developing economies. This is particularly important for highly seismic countries such as Chile and New Zealand. This paper contributes to the literature on natural disasters and economic development by analyzing the cases of two affected regions within these countries in the wake of major earthquakes experienced during 2010-2011: Maule (Chile) and Canterbury (New Zealand). We examine the impact of natural disasters on GDP per capita by applying the synthetic control method. Using the synthetic approach, we assess the effects of these two earthquakes by building counterfactuals to compare their recovery trajectories. We find that Chile and New Zealand experienced opposite economic effects. The Canterbury region grew 10% more in three years than its synthetic counterfactual without the earthquake, while the Maule region declined by 5%. We build synthetic controls at a regional and economic-sector level, looking at aggregated and sectoral effects. The difference in institutions, such as property rights and the large amount of government spending given for reconstruction after the New Zealand earthquake relative to Chile's, help to explain the difference in outcomes.</description>

      <title>Tiebout sorting in online communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.05608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a stylized, dynamic model to address the issue of sorting online. There are two large homogeneous groups of individuals. Everyone must choose between two online platforms, one of which has superior amenities (akin to having superior local public goods). Each individual enjoys interacting online with those from their own group but dislikes being on the same platform as those in the other group. Unlike a Tiebout model of residential sorting, both platforms have unlimited capacity so there are no constraints on cross-platform migration. It is clear how each group would like to sort themselves but, in the presence of the other type, only the two segregated outcomes are guaranteed to be equilibria. Integration on a platform can be supported in equilibrium as long as the platform is sufficiently desirable. If online integration of the two communities is a desired social outcome then the optimal policy is clear: make the preferred platform even more desirable. Revitalizing the inferior platform will never lead to integration and even increases the likelihood the segregation. Finally, integration is more elastic in response to an increase in platform amenities than to reductions in intolerance.</description>

      <title>Using the Dual-Privacy Framework to Understand Consumers' Perceived Privacy Violations Under Different Firm Practices in Online Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In response to privacy concerns about collecting and using personal data, the online advertising industry has been developing privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), e.g., under Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative. In this research, we use the dual-privacy framework, which postulates that consumers have intrinsic and instrumental preferences for privacy, to understand consumers' perceived privacy violations (PPVs) for current and proposed online advertising practices. The key idea is that different practices differ in whether individual data leaves the consumer's machine or not and in how they track and target consumers; these affect, respectively, the intrinsic and instrumental components of privacy preferences differently, leading to different PPVs for different practices. We conducted online studies focused on consumers in the United States to elicit PPVs for various advertising practices. Our findings confirm the intuition that tracking and targeting consumers under the industry status quo of behavioral targeting leads to high PPV. New technologies or proposals that ensure that data are kept on the consumer's machine lower PPV relative to behavioral targeting but, importantly, this decrease is small. Furthermore, group-level targeting does not differ significantly from individual-level targeting in reducing PPV. Under contextual targeting, where there is no tracking, PPV is significantly reduced. Interestingly, with respect to PPV, consumers are indifferent between seeing untargeted ads and no ads when they are not being tracked. We find that consumer perceptions of privacy violations under different tracking and targeting practices may differ from what technical definitions suggest. Therefore, rather than relying solely on technical perspectives, a consumer-centric approach to privacy is needed, based on, for instance, the dual-privacy framework.</description>

      <title>Large increases in public R&amp;D investment are needed to avoid declines of US agricultural productivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing agricultural productivity is a gradual process with significant time lags between research and development (R&amp;D) investment and the resulting gains. We estimate the response of US agricultural Total Factor Productivity (TFP) to both R&amp;D investment and weather, and quantify the public R&amp;D spending required to offset the emerging impacts of climate change. We find that offsetting the climate-induced productivity slowdown by 2050 alone requires a sustained public R&amp;D spending growth of 5.2-7.8% per year over 2021-2050. This amounts to an additional $208-$434B investment over this period. These are substantial requirements comparable to the public R&amp;D spending growth that followed the two World Wars.</description>
