      <title>Lagrangian subvarieties of hyperspherical varieties related to $G_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two $S$-dual hyperspherical varieties of the group $G_2 \times \text{SL}(2)$: an equivariant slice for $G_2$, and the symplectic representation of $G_2 \times \text{SL}_2$ in the odd part of the basic classical Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{g}(3)$. For these varieties we check the equality of numbers of irreducible components of their Lagrangian subvarieties (zero levels of the moment maps of Borel subgroups' actions) conjectured in arXiv:2310.19770.</description>

      <title>Finite distance problem on the moduli of non-K\"{a}hler Calabi--Yau $\partial\bar{\partial}$-threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the finite distance problem with respect to the period-map metric on the moduli of non-K\"{a}hler Calabi--Yau $\partial\bar{\partial}$-threefolds via Hodge theory. We extended C.-L. Wang's finite distance criterion for one-parameter degenerations to the present setting. As a byproduct, we also obtained a sufficient condition for a non-K\"{a}hler Calabi--Yau to support the $\partial\bar{\partial}$-lemma which generalizes the results by Friedman and Li. We also proved that the non-K\"{a}hler Calabi--Yau threefolds constructed by Hashimoto and Sano support the $\partial\bar{\partial}$-lemma.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of the p-primary torsion of the Brauer group of products of varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let k be a field finitely generated over its prime subfield. We prove that the quotient of the Brauer group of a product of varieties over k by the Brauer groups of factors has finite exponent. The bulk of the proof concerns p-primary torsion in characteristic p. Our approach gives a more direct proof of the boundedness of the p-primary torsion of the Brauer group of an abelian variety, as recently proved by D'Addezio. We show that the transcendental Brauer group of a Kummer surface over k has finite exponent, but can be infinite when k is an infinite field of positive characteristic. This answers a question of Zarhin and the author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the logarithmic algebraic geometry and the theory of Deligne systems, we define an abelian category of $\ell$-adic sheaves with weight filtrations on a logarithmic scheme over a finite field, which is similar to the category of variations of mixed Hodge structure. We consider asymptotic behaviors and simple cases of higher direct images of objects of this category. This category is closely related to the monodromy-weight conjecture.</description>

      <title>On the Hodge Structures of Global Smoothings of Normal Crossing Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f:X \rightarrow \Delta $ be a one-parameter semistable degeneration of $m$-dimensional compact complex manifolds. Assume that each component of the central fiber $X_0$ is K\"ahler. Then, we provide a criterion for a general fiber to satisfy the $\partial\overline{\partial}$-lemma and a formula to compute the Hodge index on the middle cohomology of the general fiber in terms of the topological conditions/invariants on the central fiber.
  We apply our theorem to several examples, including the global smoothing of $m$-fold ODPs, Hashimoto-Sano's non-K\"ahler Calabi-Yau threefolds, and Sano's non-K\"ahler Calabi-Yau $m$-folds.
  To deal with the last example, we also prove a Lefschetz-type theorem for the cohomology of the fiber product of two Lefschetz fibrations over $\mathbb{P}^1$ with disjoint critical locus.</description>

      <title>Characterizing subadjoint varieties among Legendrian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a symplectic vector space $V$, a projective subvariety $Z \subset {\bf P} V$ is a Legendrian variety if its affine cone $\widehat{Z} \subset V$ is Lagrangian. In addition to the classical examples of subadjoint varieties associated to simple Lie algebras, many examples of nonsingular Legendrian varieties have been discovered which have positive-dimensional automorphism groups. We give a characterization of subadjoint varieties among such Legendrian varieties in terms of the isotropy representation. Our proof uses some special features of the projective third fundamental forms of Legendrian varieties and their relation to the lines on the Legendrian varieties.</description>

      <title>Classification of simple 0-dimensional isolated complete intersection singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is the classification of simple 0-dimensional isolated complete intersection singularities in positive characteristic. As usual, a singularity is called simple or 0-modal if there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of singularities into which the given singularity can deform. The notion of simpleness was introduced by V. I. Arnold and the classification of low modality singularities has become a fundamental task in singularity theory. Simple complex analytic isolated complete intersection singularities (ICIS) were classified by M. Giusti. However, the classification in positive characteristic requires different methods and is much more involved. The final result is nevertheless similar to the classification in characteristic 0 with some additional normal forms in low characteristic. The theoretical results in this paper mainly concern families of ICIS that are formal in the fiber and algebraic in the base (formal deformation theory is not sufficient). In particular, we give a definition of modality in this situation and prove its semicontinuity.</description>

      <title>New look at Milnor Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: S. Donaldson disproved the smooth $\mathrm{h}$-cobordism conjecture in dimension $4$ by studying invariants coming from the moduli space of connections on $\mathrm{SO}(3)$-bundles over smooth $4$-dimension manifolds $X$. In this paper, we reverse his point of view in dimension $8$. Namely, we consider fibrations coming from diffeomorphisms classes of homotopy Hopf manifolds $\Sigma^7\times\mathrm{S}^1$, i.e., $\Sigma^7$ is a homotopy sphere, seeing the bases as moduli spaces for additional structures.
  Our overarching objective is to establish a correspondence between the smooth invariants of Kervaire--Milnor and categorical invariants. One interprets pairwise non-diffeomorphic smooth structures on $\Sigma^7\times\mathrm{S}^1$ in terms of non-rationality. This paper's contributions are diverse, each carrying its significance. We believe profound connections exist between the themes addressed, which connect hypersurface singularity theory, Homological Mirror Symmetry, Topological Modular forms ($\mathrm{tmf}$), and Spherical T-duality.</description>

      <title>Character Sheaves on Reductive Lie Algebras in Positive Characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a microlocal characterisation of character sheaves on a reductive Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of sufficiently large positive characteristic: a perverse irreducible G-equivariant sheaf is a character sheaf if and only if it has nilpotent singular support and is quasi-admissible. We also present geometric proofs, in positive characteristic, of the equivalence between being admissible and being a character sheaf, and various characterisations of cuspidal sheaves, following the work of Mirkovi\'c.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our goal is to study $p$-adic local systems on a rigid-analytic variety with semistable formal model. We prove that such a local system is semistable if and only if so are its restrictions to the points corresponding to the irreducible components of the special fiber. For this, the main body of the paper concerns analytic prismatic $F$-crystals on the absolute logarithmic prismatic site of a semistable $p$-adic log formal scheme. Analyzing Breuil-Kisin log prisms, we obtain a prismatic purity theorem and deduce the above purity theorem for semistable local systems.</description>

      <title>Non-semisimple Crane-Yetter theory varying over the character stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a relative version of the Crane-Yetter topological quantum field theory in four dimensions, from non-semisimple data. Our theory is defined relative to the classical $G$-gauge theory in five dimensions -- this latter theory assigns to each manifold $M$ the appropriate linearization of the moduli stack of $G$-local systems, called the character stack. Our main result is to establish a relative invertibility property for our construction. This invertibility echoes -- recovers and greatly generalizes -- the key invertibility property of the original Crane-Yetter theory which allowed it to capture the framing anomaly of the celebrated Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev theory. In particular our invertibilty statement at the level of surfaces implies a categorical, stacky version of the unicity theorem for skein algebras; at the level of 3-manifolds it equips the character stack with a canonical line bundle. Regarded as a topological symmetry defect of classical gauge theory, our work establishes invertibility of this defect by a gauging procedure.</description>

      <title>Slice rank and analytic rank for trilinear forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we present an elementary proof of the fact that the slice rank of a trilinear form over a finite field is bounded above by a linear expression in the analytic rank. The existing proofs by Adiprasito-Kazhdan-Ziegler and Cohen-Moshkovitz both rely on results of Derksen via geometric invariant theory. A novel feature of our proof is that the linear forms appearing in the slice rank decomposition are obtained from the trilinear form by fixing coordinates.</description>

      <title>Wall crossing for K-moduli spaces of plane curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:1909.04576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct proper good moduli spaces parametrizing K-polystable $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein smoothable log Fano pairs $(X, cD)$, where $X$ is a Fano variety and $D$ is a rational multiple of the anti-canonical divisor. We then establish a wall-crossing framework of these K-moduli spaces as $c$ varies. The main application in this paper is the case of plane curves of degree $d \geq 4$ as boundary divisors of $\mathbb{P}^2$. In this case, we show that when the coefficient $c$ is small, the K-moduli space of these pairs is isomorphic to the GIT moduli space. We then show that the first wall crossing of these K-moduli spaces are weighted blow-ups of Kirwan type. We also describe all wall crossings for degree 4,5,6, and relate the final K-moduli spaces to Hacking's compactification and the moduli of K3 surfaces.</description>

Abstract: In the theory of configuration spaces, "splitting" usually refers to the phenomenon that the configuration spaces on a manifold and those on its punctured version are closely related cohomologically. We prove a splitting theorem that is equivariant and mixed-Hodge-theoretic; both are new features in such results. As an application, we determine the generating function for the mixed Hodge numbers of the unordered configuration spaces of a multi-punctured elliptic curve.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers the moduli spaces (stacks) of parabolic bundles (parabolic logarithmic flat bundles with given spectrum, parabolic regular Higgs bundles) with rank 2 and degree 1 over $\mathbb{P}^1$ with five marked points. The foliation and stratification structures on these moduli spaces (stacks) are investigated. In particular, we confirm Simpson's conjecture for moduli space of parabolic logarithmic flat bundles with certain non-special weight system.</description>

      <title>Invariant Grassmannians and a K3 surface with an action of order 192*2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14585v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a complex vector space $V$ of finite dimension, its Grassmannian variety parametrizes all subspaces of $V$ of a given dimension. Similarly, if a finite group $G$ acts on $V$, its invariant Grassmannian parametrizes all the $G$-invariant subspaces of $V$ of a given dimension. Based on this fact, we develop an algorithm for computing $G$-invariant projective varieties arising as an intersection of hypersurfaces of the same degree.
  We apply the algorithm to find a projective model of a polarized K3 surface with a faithful action of $T_{192}\rtimes \mu_2$ and some further symmetric K3 surfaces with a degree 8 polarization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A motivation for studying the following problems comes from applications to Biology; see \cite{cifuentes20233d}. In the $3$-dimensional Euclidean space ${\bf{E}}^3$, fix six pairwise distinct points \begin{equation*} \label{eqA} \begin{array}{ccc} A=(a_1,a_2,a_3), &amp; B=(b_1,b_2,b_3), &amp; C=(c_1,c_2,c_3), \\ D=(d_1,d_2,d_3), &amp; E=(e_1,e_2,e_3), &amp; F=(f_1,f_2,f_3) \end{array} \end{equation*} together with two further points $X^*=(x_1^*,x_2^*,x_3^*)$ and $Y^*=(y_1^*,y_2^*,y_3^*)$ in $\mathbf{E}^3$. We aim to show that System $(*)$ consisting of the following six equations in the unknowns $X=(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ and $Y=(y_1,y_2,y_3)$ \begin{equation} \label{egy} \frac{1}{\|X-T\|^2} +\frac{1}{\|Y-T\|^2}=\frac{1}{\|X^*-T\|^2} +\frac{1}{\|Y^*-T\|^2}, \quad T\in\{A,B,\ldots,F\}. \end{equation} has only finitely many solutions provided that both of the following two conditions are satisfied: (i) no four of the fixed points $A,B,C,D,E,F$ are coplanar; (ii) no four of the six spheres of center $T$ and radius $1/\sqrt{k_T}$ with \begin{equation} \label{kxy} k_T=\frac{1}{\|X^*-T\|^2} +\frac{1}{\|Y^*-T\|^2} \end{equation} share a common point in ${\bf{E}}^3$. Furthermore, we exhibit configurations $ABCDEFX^*Y^*$, showing that (i) is also necessary. This result is an improvement on \cite[Theorem 1]{cifuentes20233d} where the finiteness of solutions of System $(*)$ is only ensured for sufficiently generic choices of the points $A,B,\ldots,F,X^*,Y^*.$ We also show if System $(*)$ has finitely many solutions and System $(*)$ extended with $T\in\{A,B,\ldots,F,G\}$ has some solutions other than $(X^*,Y^*)$ and $(Y^*,X^*)$ then $G$ lies on an explicitly given affine variety $W\subsetneqq \mathbb{R}^3$ only depending on $\{A,B,\ldots,F\}$. This result proves the \cite[Conjecture 1]{cifuentes20233d}.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a quasiprojective scheme. In this expository note we collect a series of useful structural results on the stack $\mathscr{C}oh^n(X)$ parametrising $0$-dimensional coherent sheaves of length $n$ over $X$. For instance, we discuss its functoriality (in particular its behaviour along \'etale maps), the support morphism to $\mathrm{Sym}^n(X)$, and its relationship with the Quot scheme of points $\mathrm{Quot}_X(\mathcal E,n)$ for fixed $\mathcal E\in \mathrm{Coh}(X)$.</description>

      <title>On primitive element of finite k-algebras and applications to commuting matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12168v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the properties of the ideal of the coordinate Hermite interpolation on n-dimensional grid [4], we prove that the extension k in k[x1, x2, ..., xn] / (f1(x1), ..., fn(xn)) has a primitive element if and only if at most one of the univariate polynomials f1, ..., fn is inseparable. This result lead to some Corollaries related to the existence of primitive element of finite k-algebras. Finally, these results are further used to investigate the well known Frobenius question, whether two commuting matrices A and B can be expressed as polynomials in some matrix C. More specifically, we identify certain classes of matrices for which matrix C exists and different classes where no such matrix C exists.</description>

      <title>Uniform approximation of Betti numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05104v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Lefschetz's principle of approximating the cohomology of a possibly singular affine scheme of finite type over a field by the cohomology of a suitable (thickening of a) hyperplane section can be made uniform: in the affine case, we can choose the hyperplane section independently of the cohomology. Using Jouanolou's trick, this gives a new way to bound the Betti numbers of quasi-projective schemes over a field, independently of the cohomology. This is achieved through a motivic version of Deligne's generic base change formula and an axiomatic presentation of the theory of perverse sheaves. These methods produce generating families of Voevodsky motivic sheaves that are realized in perverse sheaves over any base of equal characteristic.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic bigness and a uniform Bogomolov-type result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.05625v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the admissible canonical bundle of the universal family of curves is a big adelic line bundle, and apply it to prove a uniform Bogomolov-type theorem for curves over global fields of all characteristics. This gives a different approach to the uniform Mordell-Lang type of result of Dimitrov-Gao-Habegger and Kuhne. The treatment is based on the recent theory of adelic line bundles of Yuan-Zhang.</description>

      <title>Semi-stable representations as limits of crystalline representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.13676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an explicit sequence $V_{k_n,a_n}$ of crystalline representations of exceptional weights converging to a given irreducible two-dimensional semi-stable representation $V_{k,{\mathcal{L}}}$ of $\mathrm{Gal}({\overline{\mathbb{Q}}}_p/{\mathbb{Q}}_p)$. The convergence takes place in the blow-up space of two-dimensional trianguline representations studied by Colmez and Chenevier. The process of blow-up is described in detail in the rigid analytic setting and may be of independent interest. Also, we recover a formula of Stevens expressing the ${\mathcal{L}}$-invariant as a logarithmic derivative.
  Our result can be used to compute the reduction of $V_{k,{\mathcal{L}}}$ in terms of the reductions of the $V_{k_n,a_n}$. For instance, using the zig-zag conjecture we recover (resp. extend) the work of Breuil-M\'ezard and Guerberoff-Park computing the reductions of the $V_{k,{\mathcal{L}}}$ for weights at most $p-1$ (resp. $p+1$), at least on the inertia subgroup. In the cases where zig-zag is known, we are further able to obtain some new information about the reductions for small odd weights. Finally, we explain some apparent violations to local constancy in the weight of the reductions of crystalline representations of small weight.</description>

      <title>Modular Heights of Quaternionic Shimura Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to prove a formula expressing the modular height of a quaternionic Shimura curve over a totally real number field in terms of the logarithmic derivative of the Dedekind zeta function of the totally real number field. Our proof is based on the work of Yuan-Zhang-Zhang on the Gross-Zagier formula and the work of Yuan-Zhang on the averaged Colmez conjecture. All these works are in turn inspired by the Pioneering work of Gross-Zagier and some philosophies of Kudla's program.</description>

      <title>The integration theory of curved absolute L-infinity algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the notion of a curved absolute $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-algebra, a structure that behaves like a curved $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-algebra where all infinite sums of operations are well-defined by definition. We develop their integration theory by introducing two new methods in integration theory: the complete Bar construction and intrinsic model category structures. They allow us to generalize all essential results of this theory quickly and from a conceptual point of view. We provide applications of our theory to rational homotopy theory, and show that curved absolute $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-algebras provide us with rational models for finite type nilpotent spaces without any pointed or connected assumptions. Furthermore, we show that the homology of rational spaces can be recovered as the homology of the complete Bar construction. We also construct new smaller models for rational mapping spaces without any hypothesis on the source simplicial set. Another source of applications is deformation theory: on the algebraic side, we show that curved absolute $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-algebras are mandatory in order to encode the deformation complexes of $\infty$-morphisms of (co)-algebras. On the geometrical side, we construct a curved absolute $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-algebra from a derived affine stack and show that it encodes the formal geometry of any finite collection of points living in any finite field extension of the base field.</description>

      <title>Singularity categories via McKay quivers with potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2018, Kalck and Yang showed that the singularity categories associated with 3-dimensional Gorenstein quotient singularities are triangle equivalent (up to direct summands) to small cluster categories associated with McKay quivers with potential. We introduce graded McKay quivers with potential and generalize Kalck-Yang's theorem to arbitrary dimensions. The singularity categories we consider occur as stable categories of categories of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules. We refine our description of the singularity categories by showing that these categories of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules are equivalent to Higgs categories in the sense of Wu. Moreover, we describe the singularity categories in the non-Gorenstein case.</description>

      <title>Homology operations for gravity algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1}$ be the moduli space of genus zero Riemann surfaces with $n+1$ marked points. In this paper we compute $H_*^{\Sigma_n}(\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1};\mathbb{F}_p)$ and $H_*^{\Sigma_n}(\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1};\mathbb{F}_p(\pm 1))$ for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and any prime $p$, where $\mathbb{F}_p(\pm 1)$ denotes the sign representation of the symmetric group $\Sigma_n$. The interest in these homology groups is twofold: on the one hand classes in these equivariant homology groups parametrize homology operations for gravity algebras. On the other hand the homotopy quotient $(\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1})_{\Sigma_n}$ is a model for the classifying space for $B_n/Z(B_n)$, the quotient of the braid group $B_n$ by its center.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we describe the $T_{comp}$-equivariant topological $K$-ring of a $T$-{\it cellular} simplicial toric variety. We further show that $K_{T_{comp}}^0(X)$ is isomorphic as an $R(T_{comp})$-algebra to the ring of piecewise Laurent polynomial functions on the associated fan denoted $PLP(\Delta)$. Furthermore, we compute a basis for $K_{T_{comp}}^0(X)$ as a $R(T_{comp})$-module and multiplicative structure constants with respect to this basis.</description>
