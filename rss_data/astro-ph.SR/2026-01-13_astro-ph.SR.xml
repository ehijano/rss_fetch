      <title>Emergent Complexity in Nuclear Reaction Networks: A Study of Stellar Nucleosynthesis through Chemical Organization Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the emergence of complex structures within reaction networks, focusing on nuclear reaction networks relevant to stellar nucleosynthesis. The work presents a theoretical framework rooted in Chemical Organization Theory (COT) to characterize how stable, self-sustaining structures arise from the interactions of basic components. Key theoretical contributions include the formalization of atom sets as fundamental reactive units and the concept of synergy to describe the emergence of new reactions and species from the interaction of these units. The property of separability is defined to distinguish dynamically coupled systems from those that can be decomposed. This framework is then applied to the STARLIB nuclear reaction network database, analyzing how network structure, particularly the formation and properties of atom sets and semi-self-maintaining sets, changes as a function of temperature. Results indicate that increasing temperature generally enhances network cohesion, leading to fewer, larger atom sets. Critical temperatures are identified where significant structural reorganizations occur, such as the merging of distinct clusters of atom sets and the disappearance of small, isolated reactive units. The analysis reveals core clusters - large (containing more that 1000 reactions), semi-self-maintaining structures that appear to form the core of all potentially stable nucleosynthetic configurations at various temperatures. Overall, the paper provides insights into the structural underpinnings of stability and emergence in complex reaction networks, with specific implications for understanding stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Formation of massive multiple-star systems: early migration and mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars are often found in multiple systems, yet how binary-star systems with very close separations ($\lesssim$ au) assemble remains unresolved. We investigate the formation and inward migration of massive-star binaries in Solar-metallicity environments using the star-cluster formation simulation of Chon et al. (2024), which forms a $1200\,M_\odot$ stellar cluster and resolves binaries down to 1 au separation. Our results indicate that stars more massive than $2\,M_{\odot}$ predominantly assemble in binary or triple configurations, in agreement with observations, with member stars forming nearly coevally. In most of these systems, the inner binary hardens by one to three orders of magnitude and reaches a steady-state within the first $0.1\,$Myr. Notably, all binaries whose final separations are below 10 au are hardened with the aid of circumbinary discs, highlighting disc-driven migration as a key to produce tight massive binaries. We further find that binaries form with random inclinations relative to the initial rotation axis of the cloud, and that mutual inclinations in triple systems follow an isotropic distribution, implying that stochastic interactions driven by turbulence and few-body dynamics are crucial during assembly and migration. Finally, stars with $M&gt;2\,M_{\odot}$ often undergo repeated merger events during cluster evolution, yielding extreme mass ratios ($q&lt;0.1$). Some of these products may evolve into compact-object binaries containing a black hole or neutron star, including X-ray binaries and systems detectable by Gaia.</description>

      <title>The Energy-Duration Relationship in Astrophysical Self-Organized Criticality Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling laws in astrophysical systems that involve the energy, the geometry, and the spatio-temporal evolution, provide the theoretical framework for physical models of energy dissipation processes. A leading model is the standard fractal-diffusive self-organized criticality (FD-SOC) model, which is built on four fundamental assumptions: (i) the dimensionality $d=3$, (ii) the fractal dimension $D_V=d-1/2=2.5$, (iii) classical diffusion $L \propto T^{(1/2)}$, and (iv) the proportionality of the dissipated energy to the fractal volume $E \propto V$. Based on these assumptions, the FD-SOC model predicts a scaling law of $T \propto E^k \propto E^{(4/5)} = E^{0.8}$. On the observational side, we find empirical scaling laws of $T \propto E^{0.81\pm0.03}$ by Peng et al.~(2023) and $T \propto E^{0.86\pm0.03}$ by Araujo \&amp; Valio (2021) that are self-consistent with the theoretical prediction of the FD-SOC model. However, cases with a small time range $q_T = \log{(T_{max}/T_{min})} \lapprox 2$ have large statistical uncertainties and systematic errors, which produces smaller scaling law exponents ($k \approx 0.3, ..., 0.6$) as a consequence. The close correlation of the scaling exponent $k$ with the truncation bias $q_T$ implies that the dispersion of k-values is an observational effect, rather than a physical property.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Electron Beam Interactions in Brown Dwarf Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over two decades ago, the first detection of electron cyclotron maser instability (ECMI) radio emission from a brown dwarf confirmed the presence of aurorally precipitating electrons on these objects. This detection established that brown dwarfs can exhibit magnetic activity that is planetary and auroral, rather than stellar in nature. This discovery motivated ongoing observational searches for the corresponding optical, ultraviolet (UV), and infrared (IR) auroral emission expected based on solar system analogs. The continuing nondetection of such auroral emission indicates important differences exist between auroral processes on brown dwarfs and solar system planets. In this work, we implement a Monte Carlo simulation of monoenergetic electron beams interacting with brown dwarf atmospheres, as a step towards understanding the physics of brown dwarf auroral emission. We detail the algorithm and underlying assumptions, and validate against previously published Jovian results (Hiraki et al. 2008). Our results agree well with literature, with some discrepancy from our updated interaction cross sections. We demonstrate the applicability of our simulation across the range of surface gravities and effective temperatures of radio-emitting brown dwarfs. We present an analytic parameterization of interaction rates based on our finding that atmospheric column density governs the interaction profiles. We apply this parameterization to calculate the total volumetric interaction rates and energy deposition rate for representative electron beam energy spectra enabling future predictions for spectra of aurorally emitting brown dwarfs. Simulations of high energy electron interactions with substellar hydrogen-dominated atmospheres will guide observational searches for multi-wavelength auroral features beyond the solar system.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Properties of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections Observed by Solar Orbiter in the Inner Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the turbulent properties of 12 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) observed by Solar Orbiter between 0.29 and 1.0 AU. We analyze fluctuation power, spectral indices, break scales, and correlations between magnetic and velocity fluctuations (v-b) to quantify differences between ICME substructures (sheath and magnetic ejecta (ME)) and the surrounding solar wind. The ICME sheath is consistently the most turbulent region at all distances. In the solar wind, Alfv\'enicity influences inertial-range scaling, resulting in either single power laws near f^-3/2 or f^-5/3, or a coexistence of both, whereas ICME substructures consistently exhibit Kolmogorov-like f^-5/3 spectra. Alfv\'enicity is reduced within ICMEs, particularly in the ejecta, indicating more balanced Alfv\'enic fluctuations than in the solar wind. Spectral breaks shift to higher frequencies in ICME regions, with average break frequencies of 0.53 +/- 0.35 Hz (solar wind), 1.87 +/- 1.46 Hz (sheath), and 1.46 +/- 1.28 Hz (ME), reflecting differences in underlying microphysical scales. Our findings highlight distinct turbulence regimes in ICMEs compared to the solar wind and support the use of fluctuation power, spectral breaks, and v-b correlations as effective diagnostics for identifying ICME boundaries.</description>

      <title>On the 3D time evolution of the dust size distribution in protostellar envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust plays a fundamental role during protostellar collapse, disk and planet formation. Recent observations suggest that efficient dust growth may begin early, in the protostellar envelopes, potentially even before the formation of the disk. Three-dimensional models of protostellar evolution, addressing multi-size dust growth, gas and dust dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics, are required to characterize the dust evolution in the embedded stages of star formation. We aim to establish a new framework for dust evolution models, following in 3D the dust size distribution both in time and space, in MHD models describing the formation and evolution of star-disk systems, at low numerical cost. We present our work coupling the COALA dust evolution module into the code RAMSES, performing the first 3D MHD simulation of protostellar collapse including simultaneously polydisperse dust growth modeled by the Smoluchowski equation as well as dust dynamics in the terminal velocity approximation. Ice-coated micron-sized grains can rapidly grow in the envelope and survive by not entering the fragmentation regime. The evolution of the dust size distribution is highly anisotropic due to the turbulent nature of the collapse and the development of favorable locations such as outflow cavity walls, which enhance locally the dust-to-gas ratio. We analyzed the first 3D non-ideal MHD simulations that self-consistently account for the dust dynamics and growth during the protostellar stage. Very early in the lifetime of a young embedded protostar, micron-sized grains can grow, and locally the dust size distribution deviates significantly from the MRN initial shape. This new numerical method opens the perspective to treat simultaneously gas/dust dynamics and dust growth in 3D simulations at a low numerical cost for several astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Slow White Dwarf Mergers as a New Galactic Source of Trans-Iron Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The astrophysical origins of the heaviest stable elements that we observe today in the Solar System are still not fully understood. Recent studies have demonstrated that H-accreting white dwarfs (WDs) in a binary sys- tem exploding as type Ia supernovae could be an efficient p-process source beyond iron. However, both observational evidence and stellar models challenge the required frequency of these events. In this work, we calculate the evolution and nucleosynthesis in slowly merging carbon-oxygen WDs. As our models approach the Chandrasekhar mass during the merger phase, the 22Ne(a,n)25Mg neutron source reaction is activated in the external layers of the primary WD, where the carbon-rich material accreted from the secondary WD is burned via the 12C+12C reaction, which provides the necessary {\alpha}-particles via the 12C(12C,{\alpha})20Ne channel. The resulting neutron capture abundance distribution closely resembles a weak s-process one and peaks at Zr, which is overpro- duced by a factor of 30 compared to solar. The mass of the most external layers enriched in first-peak s-process elements crucially depends on the 12C+12C re- action rate, ranging between 0.05 Msun and ~0.1 Msun. These results indicate that slow white dwarf mergers can efficiently produce the lightest p-process iso- topes (such as 74Se, 78Kr, 84Sr, 92Mo and 94Mo) via {\gamma}-induced reactions if they explode via a delayed detonation mechanism, or eject the unburned external layers highly enriched in first peak s-process elements in the case of a pure deflagration. In both cases, we propose for the first time that slow WD mergers in binary systems may be a new relevant source for elements heavier than iron.</description>

      <title>The magnetic helicity driven solar-type dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (1)The previous theoretical studies showed that in the presence of the small-scale dynamo the large-scale vorticity can produce the the divergent-type helicity flux breaking the equatorial reflection symmetry of the magnetic fluctuations in the stellar convection zone. This effect was called the new Visniac flux (hereafter the NV flux). Similarly to the $\alpha$ effect, the NV flux is able to maintain the large-scale turbulent dynamo. 2) Methods:Using the mean-field dynamo model we study the effect of the NV flux on the solar type dynamos. We found that the NV flux results to a increase of the dynamo efficiency for the turbulent generation of the large-scale poloidal magnetic field of the Sun. The dynamic effect of the NV flux on the magnetic field evolution results into concentrating the dynamo waves toward the equator. Using the numerical simulations of the mean-field dynamo model we compare the helicity production rates by the turbulent dynamo effects, like the $\alpha$ effect and the NV flux. We found that the new dynamo source can produce the large-scale dynamo even if the kinetic $\alpha$ effect is zero.3) Conclusions:The new findings suggest the crucial role of the large-scale vorticity and fluctuating magnetic field in the large-scale dynamo inside the stellar convection zones.</description>

      <title>Impact of Nuclear Reaction Rates on Calcium Production in Population III Stars: A Global Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of calcium production to nuclear reaction rates of a 40 solar-mass Population III star using 1D multi-zone stellar models. A comprehensive nuclear reaction network was constructed, and all $(p,\gamma)$ and $(p,\alpha)$ reaction rates were individually varied by a factor of 10 up and down, identifying 13 preliminary key reactions for calcium production. To propagate the reaction rate uncertainties on calcium production, two sets of Monte Carlo simulations were performed for these key reactions: one adopting STARLIB reaction rates and the other incorporating updated rates from recent experimental data and evaluations. Our results show that Monte Carlo simulations using the updated rates show good agreement with the observed calcium abundance of the extremely iron-poor star SMSS J031300.36-670839.3 within the 68% confidence interval predicted by the models. In contrast, the observed calcium abundance lies marginally outside the 68% C.I. when using the STARLIB rates. Spearman rank-order correlation analysis and SHAP values show that the $(p,\gamma)$ and $(p,\alpha)$ reactions of F18 and F19 exhibit strong coupled effects on calcium production. These reaction-rate uncertainties need to be reduced to constrain the stellar model predictions. Our study provides insights for future nuclear physics experiments aimed at reducing reaction rate uncertainties in the nucleosynthesis of Population III Stars.
  Additionally, comparisons between 20 solar-mass and 40 solar-mass Population III stellar models confirm that the latter, with updated reaction rates, is more capable of reproducing the observed Ca abundance and [Ca/Mg] ratio.</description>

      <title>VLBI Observations of SN 2012au Reveal a Compact Radio Source a Decade Post Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three leading models have been put forth to justify the observed radio re-brightening associated with stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) years post-explosion: radiation from an emerging pulsar wind nebula (PWN), shock interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM), or emission from off-axis, relativistic jets. SN~2012au is a particularly intriguing SESN in this regard as observations obtained $\gtrsim$ 6 years post-explosion have shown \emph{both} (i) optical emission features consistent with a young PWN and (ii) a radio re-brightening. We present the results of our Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometric (VLBI) observations of SN 2012au performed between 8 to 13 years post core-collapse. Our VLBI observations reveal a luminous, steadily fading radio source that remains compact ($\leq1.4\times10^{17}~\mathrm{cm}$) and stationary ($\leq0.36c$) over the course of our campaign. Overall, we find that our VLBI measurements can be readily explained by a $\sim$decade-old PWN, potentially explained by shock interaction with specific CSM geometries, and are unlikely to be explained by emission from an off-axis, relativistic jet. Assuming a PWN origin, our observations require that the initial spin-down luminosity of the central pulsar be between $10^{36}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}\leq\dot{E}_0\leq10^{42}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$ and radio efficiency factor be $\eta_\mathrm{R}\geq3\times10^{-6}$. These results are consistent with independent inferences obtained using optical spectroscopy of SN~2012au, alongside inferences of known Galactic systems. If a PWN origin is confirmed, SN 2012au would represent the first extragalactic PWN emerging from a modern day SN, providing a novel opportunity to study the formation properties of a decade-old pulsar.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx Re-Observation of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS in December 2025: Detection of Increased Post-Perihelion Activity, Refractory Coma Dust, and New Coma Gas Species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In December-2025, the NASA SPHEREx spacecraft re-observed ISO 3I/ATLAS post-perihelion, finding a much more active object compared to August-2025 SPHEREx pre-perihelion observations, with marked evidence for development into an cometary body fully sublimating all its ices. The new imaging spectrophotometry is dominated by spatially resolved features due to dust scattered-light and thermal emission plus gas-emissions from CN (0.93 um), H2O (2.7 um), organic C-H (3.2 to 3.6 um), CO2 (4.25 to 4.27 um), and CO (4.6 to 4.8 um). The CO2 gas-coma continues to be extended out to a 3 arcmin radius. The continuum spectral signature of H2O-ice absorption has mostly disappeared, replaced by scattered-light plus thermal-emission from organo-silicaceous dust grains while the H2O gas-emission is 20 times brighter. All but the organics-gas comae are circularly symmetric, while a weak pear-shaped solar-pointing dust tail consistent with large dust grains is now present. The new appearance of CN and C-H features suggests that these species are contained either in H2O phases or were trapped under them.</description>

The existence of three different types of configurations: from spheroids to thick tori, hockey puck-like bodies and spheroids surrounded by a torus, separate from or merging with the central body has been proved. It has been shown that the last two types appear only at moderate degrees of rotation differentiality, sigma~2. Rigid-body or weakly differential rotation, as well as strongly differential, have not led to any "exotic" types of configurations. Many calculated configurations have had extremely large values of parameter tau, which has raised the question of their stability with respect to fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Functionalization of Benzene Ices by Atomic Oxygen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small aromatic molecules, including functionalized derivatives of benzene, are known to be present throughout the different stages of star and planet formation. In particular, oxygen-bearing monosubstituted aromatics, likely including phenol, have been identified in the coma of comet 67P. This suggests that, earlier in the star and planet formation evolution, icy grains may act as both reservoirs and sites of functionalization for these small aromatics. We investigate the ice-phase reactivity of singlet oxygen atoms (O($^1$D)) with benzene, using ozone as a precursor that is readily photodissociated by relatively low-energy. Our experiments show that O($^1$D) efficiently reacts with benzene, forming phenol, benzene oxide, and oxepine as the main products. Phenol formation is temperature-independent, consistent with a barrierless insertion mechanism. In contrast, the formation of benzene oxide/oxepine shows a slight temperature dependence, suggesting that additional reaction pathways involving either ground-state or excited-state oxygen atoms may contribute. In H$_2$O and \COO ice matrices we find that dilution does not suppress formation of phenol. We extrapolate an experimental upper limit for the benzene-to-phenol conversion fraction of 27-44$\%$ during the lifetime of an interstellar cloud, assuming O($^1$D) production rates based on CO$_2$ ice abundances and a cosmic-ray induced UV field. We compare these estimates with a new analysis of data from the comet 67P, where the C$_6$H$_6$O/C$_6$H$_6$ ratio is 20$\pm$6$\%$. This value lies within our estimated range, suggesting that O($^1$D)-mediated chemistry is a viable pathway for producing oxygenated aromatics in cold astrophysical ices, potentially enriching icy planetesimals with phenol and other biorelevant compounds.</description>

Abstract: We estimate key parameters for the Galactic globular clusters NGC1904 and NGC4372 and update the parameters for NGC288, NGC362, NGC5904, NGC6205, and NGC6218, which were analysed in our previous papers. We fit various colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the clusters using isochrones from the DSED and BaSTI. The CMDs are constructed from data sets provided by the HST, Gaia, SMSS, a large compilation of Stetson, and other sources, using multiple filters for each cluster. Our cross-identification of almost all the data sets with those from Gaia or HST allows us to use their astrometry to precisely select cluster members in all the data sets. We obtain the following estimates, along with their total uncertainties, for NGC288, NGC362, NGC1904, NGC4372, NGC5904, NGC6205 and NGC6218, respectively: metallicities [Fe/H]$=-1.28$, $-1.26$, $-1.64$, $-2.28$, $-1.33$, $-1.56$, and $-1.27$ dex; ages $12.94$, $10.33$, $13.16$, $12.81$, $11.53$, $12.75$, and $13.03$ Gyr; distances $8.83$, $9.00$, $12.66$, $5.17$, $7.24$, $7.39$, and $4.92$ kpc; reddenings $E(B-V)=0.022$, $0.029$, $0.031$, $0.545$, $0.045$, $0.024$, and $0.210$ mag; extinctions $Av=0.09$, $0.09$, $0.11$, $1.58$, $0.13$, $0.09$, and $0.67$ mag; and extinction-to-reddening ratio $Rv=3.9$, $3.0$, $3.8$, $2.9$, $2.9$, $3.6$, and $3.2$. We confirm that the differences in horizontal branch morphology among the 16 Galactic globular clusters analysed in our studies can be explained by variations in their metallicity, age, mass-loss efficiency, and the loss of low-mass members during cluster evolution. Accordingly, most clusters indicate a relatively high mass-loss efficiency, consistent with the Reimers mass-loss law with $\eta&gt;0.3$.</description>

      <title>A Unified Charge-Dependent Modulation Model for AMS-02 Proton and Antiproton Fluxes during Solar Minimum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified charge-dependent solar modulation model by solving the three-dimensional Parker transport equation, incorporating a realistic wavy heliospheric current sheet to treat drift effects self-consistently. Using a local interstellar spectrum from GALPROP constrained by Voyager data, we fit the model to time-resolved proton and antiproton fluxes measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer - 02 (AMS-02) during the solar-quiet period (May 2011 to June 2022). To enable rapid parameter scans, we employ neural-network-based surrogate models to compute propagation and modulation matrices efficiently. The results demonstrate that the model simultaneously describes the observed proton and antiproton fluxes with physically reasonable parameters, providing a unified account of charge-dependent modulation.</description>

      <title>Multi-Physics Bayesian Analysis of Neutron Star Crust Using Relativistic Mean-Field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of neutron-star crust within a Bayesian framework based on a unified relativistic mean-field (RMF) description of dense matter. The analysis focuses on the posterior distributions of crust properties, constrained by nuclear experimental data, chiral effective field theory, and multimessenger neutron-star observations. In the inference, the outer crust is fixed using the AME2020 nuclear mass table, supplemented by Hartree--Fock--Bogoliubov mass models, while the inner crust is described using a compressible liquid-drop model consistently coupled to the RMF interaction. The same RMF framework is used to describe the uniform core, ensuring a unified treatment across all density regimes. From the resulting posteriors, we extract key crustal observables, including the crust--core transition density and pressure, crust thickness, crust mass, and the fractional crustal moment of inertia. We find that the transition density is primarily governed by the symmetry-energy slope $L$ and curvature $K_{\rm sym}$ evaluated at sub-saturation densities, while the transition pressure plays a central role in determining global crustal properties. The inner-crust equation of state reflects a collective interplay between isovector nuclear-matter properties rather than a dependence on any single parameter. We also assess the impact of using matched crust--core constructions and show that they can introduce systematic differences in predicted neutron-star properties when compared with fully unified treatments.</description>

      <title>Learning the relations between neutron star and nuclear matter properties with symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EOS) of dense matter in neutron stars (NSs) remains uncertain, particularly at supra-nuclear densities where complex nuclear interactions and the potential presence of exotic matter, like hyperons, come into play. The complex relationships existing between nuclear matter and neutron star properties are investigated. The focus is on their nonlinearities and interdependencies. In our analysis, we apply a machine learning algorithm known as symbolic regression, paired with principal component analysis, to datasets generated from Bayesian inference over relativistic mean-field models. A systematic Principal Component Analysis has allowed to break down the percentage contribution of each element or feature in the relationships obtained. This study examines two main models (datasets): the NL model, which includes nucleonic degrees of freedom; and the NL-hyp model, which includes hyperons in addition to nucleons. Our analysis confirms a robust correlation between the tidal deformability of a 1.4 \(M_\odot\) neutron star and $\beta$-equilibrium pressure at twice the nuclear saturation density. This correlation remains once hyperons are included. The contribution of the different nuclear matter properties at saturation to the radius and tidal deformability was calculated. It was shown that the isovector properties have the largest impact, with a contribution of about 90\%. We also studied the relationship between the proton fraction at different densities and various symmetry energy parameters defined at saturation density. For the hyperon data set, we took into account the effects of the negatively charged hyperon $\Xi$ in order to recover the relationships. Our study reveals the individual impact of various symmetry energy parameters on proton fractions at different densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The so-called $I$-Love-$Q$ relations link some normalized versions of the moment of inertia, the Love number, and the quadrupole moment of a star. These relations, in principle, enable the inference of two of the quantities given the third. However, their use has been limited because the normalized versions of the multipole moments rely on the static mass derived from the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, which is not directly observable. In this work, using perturbation theory, we find that the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations can also be formulated in terms of an alternative set of normalized quantities that do not depend on the static mass, but on the actual (observable) mass.</description>

      <title>Time-evolving coronal modelling of the solar maximum around the solar storms in May 2024 by COCONUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-evolving MHD coronal models deliver more realistic results than traditional quasi-steady-state models. The fully implicit time-evolving coronal model COCONUT performs efficiently enough for real-time coronal simulations during solar minimum. However, during solar maxima, the coronal magnetic field is more complex and stronger, and coronal structures evolve more rapidly than during solar minima. Time-evolving MHD coronal modelling of solar maxima often struggles with poor numerical stability and low computational efficiency. We enhanced the numerical stability of the time-evolving coronal model COCONUT to mitigate these issues with the aim to evaluate the differences between the time-evolving and quasi-steady-state coronal simulation results, and to assess the impact of the spatial resolution on global MHD coronal modelling of solar maxima. After enhancing the positivity-preserving property of COCONUT, we employed it to simulate the evolution of coronal structures within 0.1 AU in an inertial coordinate system over two CRs around the solar storms in May 2024. These simulations were performed on unstructured geodesic meshes containing 6.06, 1.52, and 0.38 M cells. We also conducted a quasi-steady-state coronal simulation that treated the solar surface as a rigidly rotating spherical shell. A comparison with observations further validated the reliability of the time-evolving coronal modelling technique. It shows that incorporating the evolution of the magnetic field on the solar surface can significantly improve the fidelity of global MHD coronal simulations around a solar maximum. A simulated magnetic field strength using a mesh with 6.06 M cells can be stronger by more than 40% than that in a mesh with 0.38 M cells. The fully implicit time-evolving model COCONUT shows promise for accurately conducting real-time global coronal simulations of solar maxima.</description>

      <title>COCONUT: A coronal model with an energy decomposition strategy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an energy decomposition method combined with an HLL Riemann solver that includes an additional dissipation term in the energy equation to improve the numerical stability of the fully implicit, time-evolving coronal model COCONUT and extend its applicability to solar-maximum phases. In MHD simulations that evolve conservative variables in time, the thermal pressure is typically computed by subtracting the magnetic and kinetic energies from the total energy. In low-beta (the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure; $&lt; 10^{-3}$) regions, discretization errors of magnetic energy can be comparable to the thermal pressure, potentially leading to negative thermal pressure and causing the simulation to crash. Therefore, we update the decomposed energy, excluding the magnetic energy, at each time step. It avoids subtracting a large magnetic energy from the total energy to obtain a very small thermal pressure in low-$\beta$ regions, thereby improving the numerical stability of MHD models. We validate the algorithm using a time-evolving solar-maximum Carrington rotation simulation in 2025, which the previous code failed to run to completion. We also perform quasi-steady-state coronal simulations and 2D benchmark tests to further assess the algorithm's performance. The simulation results show that the algorithm produces results nearly identical to those obtained using the traditional full energy equation during solar minimum, while significantly improving COCONUT's ability to simulate coronal evolution under strong magnetic fields, even including fields exceeding 100 Gauss with $\beta&lt;10^{-3}$. This method provides a promising approach for performing quasi-realistic coronal simulations during solar maxima.</description>

      <title>Gaia Barium Dwarfs and Their Ostensibly Ordinary Counterparts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently identified Gaia population of main-sequence--white dwarf (MS+WD) binaries at separations of ${\sim}\,1~{\rm AU}$, often with moderate eccentricities, is not readily reproduced by binary population synthesis models. Barium stars represent a closely related population whose enrichment in $s$-process elements both confirms the presence of a WD companion and attests to past binary interaction. It also indicates that mass transfer occurred at least during the late- and post-AGB phases of the WD progenitor, when $s$-process elements are dredged up. In this work, we further explore the connection between the astrometrically identified Gaia MS+WD binaries and the classical barium star population. To achieve this, we used high-resolution FEROS spectroscopy to measure abundances for 30 Gaia DR3 non-single-star binaries, identifying 10 as Ba-enriched. Together with our recent analysis of archival GALAH data, this yields a sample of 38 barium dwarfs with dynamically measured WD masses, compared to only 6 previously known systems with known WD masses at these separations. We find that, in cases where metallicity is sufficiently low to facilitate efficient $s$-process production, barium and yttrium enrichment is often detected. This enrichment is also identified in eccentric systems, suggesting that post-AGB mass transfer mechanisms are capable of pumping eccentricity into the orbit or occur without erasing it. Our results indicate that the Gaia MS+WD binaries trace the population from which barium stars emerge. Treating the large Gaia-discovered population as an extension of known $s$-process enriched dwarfs opens an avenue to empirically constrain their formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>SN 2016iog: A fast declining Type II-L supernova with an ultra-faint tail, persistently interacting with circumstellar material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the rapidly declining Type IIL supernova (SN) 2016iog. SN 2016iog reached its peak $\sim$ 14 days after explosion, with an absolute magnitude in the $V$ band of $-18.64 \pm 0.15$ mag, followed by a steep decline of $8.85 \pm 0.15$~mag~(100\,d)$^{-1}$ post-peak. Such a high decline rate makes SN~2016iog one of the fastest declining Type~IIL SNe observed to date. The rapid rise in the light curve, combined with the nearly featureless continuum observed in the spectrum at +9.3 days, suggests the presence of interaction. In the recombination phase, we observed broad H$\alpha$ lines that persist at all epochs. In addition, the prominent double-peaked H$\alpha$ feature observed in the late-time spectrum (+190.8 days) is likely attributable either to significant dust formation within a cool dense shell or to asymmetric circumstellar material. These features suggest the presence of sustained interaction around SN~2016iog. We propose that the observed characteristics of SN~2016iog can be qualitatively explained by assuming a low-mass H-rich envelope surrounding a red supergiant progenitor star with low-density circumstellar material.</description>

      <title>Pre-supernova O-C shell mergers could produce more $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ than the explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ in massive stars is thought to occur during explosive nucleosynthesis, however recent studies have shown it can be produced during O-C shell mergers prior to core collapse. We investigate how mixing according to 3D macro physics derived from hydrodynamic simulations impacts the pre-supernova O-C shell merger nucleosynthesis and if it can dominate the explosive supernova production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive isotopes. We compare a range of observations and models of explosive $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ yields to pre-explosive multi-zone mixing-burning nucleosynthesis simulations of an O-C shell merger in a $15~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ stellar model with mixing conditions corresponding to different 3D hydro mixing scenarios. Radioactive species produced in the O shell have a spread in their pre-explosive yields predictions across different 3D mixing scenarios of 2.14 dex on average. $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ has the largest spread of 4.78 dex. The pre-explosive production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ can be larger than the production of all massive star models in the NuGrid data set where $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ is dominated by the explosive nucleosynthesis contribution, as well all other massive star and supernova models. We conclude that quantitative predictions of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive species more broadly require an understanding of the 3D hydrodynamic mixing conditions present during the O-C shell merger.</description>

      <title>A global view of post-interaction white dwarf-main sequence binaries</title>

Abstract: Common-envelope evolution (CEE) is among the most uncertain phases in binary evolution. To empirically constrain CEE, we construct a uniformly selected sample of eclipsing post--common-envelope binaries (PCEBs). Starting from an unresolved white dwarf-main-sequence (WDMS) candidate sample within 200 pc selected from the Gaia color-magnitude diagram, we identify 39 detached eclipsing WDMS binaries using ZTF light curves. The binaries contain cool M dwarfs orbiting warm white dwarfs with orbital periods ($P_{\rm orb}$) of 0.1-2 d. The sample's simple selection function allows us to model observational incompleteness and infer intrinsic properties of the PCEB population. We find an orbital-period distribution consistent with being log-uniform over 0.1-2 d, contrary to recent reports of a bimodal distribution. The companion-mass distribution peaks around $0.25~{\rm M_\odot}$ and declines steeply toward larger masses. The estimated local space density is $7.2\times10^{-5}~{\rm pc^{-3}}$, corresponding to a Galaxy-wide birth rate of 0.01 per year. Combining our results with recent Gaia-based constraints on wider WDMS binaries, we construct an empirical period distribution of post-interaction WDMS binaries spanning 0.1-1000 d. The emerging period distribution is roughly log-flat (d$N/{\rm d}\log P_{\rm orb}\propto P_{\rm orb}^0$) at $P_{\rm orb} &lt; 2$ d and log-increasing (d$N/{\rm d}\log P_{\rm orb}\propto P_{\rm orb}^1$) at $P_{\rm orb} = 100-1000$ d. The 10-100 d regime remains poorly constrained, but a few nearby systems suggest it is also well-populated. Short-period PCEBs ($P_{\rm orb}&lt;2$ d) with M dwarf companions are roughly 2-3 times more common than wide ($P_{\rm orb} = 100-1000$ d) WDMS binaries with FGK companions, which likely formed through stable mass transfer. These results provide direct observational constraints on CEE and an empirical benchmark for binary-population models.</description>

      <title>Energetic particles accelerated via turbulent magnetic reconnection in protoplanetary discs -- I. Ionisation rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Ionisation controls the chemistry, thermal balance, and magnetic coupling in protoplanetary discs. However, standard ionisation vectors such as stellar UV, X-rays, Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) might not be efficient enough, as UV/X-rays are attenuated rapidly with depth, while GCRs are modulated. Turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection in disc atmospheric layers offers a physically motivated, in situ source of energetic particles (EPs) that has never been considered. Aims. We quantify the ionisation and heating produced by EPs accelerated by turbulent reconnection, identify where they dominate over X-rays and GCRs, and determine energetic thresholds for their relevance. We provide scalable diagnostics tied to the local energy budget. Methods. We adopt a Fermi-like acceleration model with parameters linked to a turbulent reconnection geometry trigger by the magneto-rotational instability, yielding a steady-state energy distribution of the EP forming a power-law of index $p=2.5$. We propagate electrons and protons through the disc and compute primary and secondary ionisation and associated heating on a fiducial T Tauri disc model background. The non-thermal normalisation is set by the fraction of local viscous accretion energy dissipation channelled to EPs, parametrised by $\kappa$. Results. For $\kappa\gtrsim 0.4\%$, EPs ionisation overpass standard ionisation sources in the disc atmosphere and intermediate/deep layers out to radii of a few tens of astronomical units. Even at $\kappa\sim 0.025\%$, EPs contribute at the few-percent level, thus are chemically and dynamically relevant. These results identify EPs accelerated by turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection as a rather robust, disc-internal ionisation channel that should be included in thermo-chemical models of protoplanetary discs.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent 3D radiative transfer for kilonovae: directional spectra from merger simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17612v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present three-dimensional radiative transfer calculations for the ejecta from a neutron star merger that include line-by-line opacities for tens of millions of bound-bound transitions, composition from an r-process nuclear network, and time-dependent thermalization of decay products from individual $\alpha$ and $\beta^-$ decay reactions. In contrast to expansion opacities and other wavelength-binned treatments, a line-by-line treatment enables us include fluorescence effects and associate spectral features with the emitting and absorbing lines of individual elements. We find variations in the synthetic observables with both the polar and azimuthal viewing angles. The spectra exhibit blended features with strong interactions by Ce III, Sr II, Y II, and Zr II that vary with time and viewing direction. We demonstrate the importance of wavelength-calibration of atomic data using a model with calibrated Sr, Y, and Zr data, and find major differences in the resulting spectra, including a better agreement with AT2017gfo. The synthetic spectra for near-polar inclination show a feature at around 8000 A, similar to AT2017gfo. However, they evolve on a more rapid timescale, likely due to the low ejecta mass (0.005 M$_\odot$) as we take into account only the early ejecta. The comparatively featureless spectra for equatorial observers gives a tentative prediction that future observations of edge-on kilonovae will appear substantially different from AT2017gfo. We also show that 1D models obtained by spherically averaging the 3D ejecta lead to dramatically different direction-integrated luminosities and spectra compared to full 3D calculations.</description>

      <title>Modeling gravitational wave sources in the MillenniumTNG simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Edited) We introduce a flexible framework for building gravitational wave (GW) event catalogs in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation. Our framework couples the state-of-the-art binary population synthesis code SEVN with Arepo-GW -- a module fully integrated into the moving-mesh code Arepo -- to assign merger events of binary compact objects to stellar particles in simulations by stochastically sampling merger tables generated with SEVN. Arepo-GW supports both on-the-fly operation, producing event catalogs during simulations, and post-processing, using snapshots from existing runs. The algorithm is fully parallel and can be adapted to outputs from other simulation codes. To demonstrate the capabilities of our new framework, we applied Arepo-GW in post-processing to simulations from the MillenniumTNG suite, including its flagship box. We investigate key properties of the resulting GW event catalog, built on SEVN predictions, focusing on comoving merger rates, formation efficiencies, delay-time distributions, and progenitor mass and metallicity distributions. We also examine how these properties vary with simulated volume. We find that GW progenitor rates closely track simulated star formation histories and are generally consistent with current observational constraints at low redshift, aside from a factor of $\sim 4.5$ excess in binary black hole mergers. Moreover, our binary black hole merger rates decline more slowly with redshift than current observational estimates for $z \lesssim 1$. Finally, the analysis of progenitor mass functions across different formation channels reveals only mild redshift evolution, while the binary black hole mass function displays features compatible with current observational determinations. These findings highlight the potential of our novel framework to enable detailed predictions for upcoming GW surveys within a full cosmological context.</description>

      <title>New ultralight scalar particles and the mass-radius relation of white dwarfs -- the important role of Sirius B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the equation of state for two classes of new ultralight particles, a scalar field coupling to electrons and a light $\mathbb{Z}_\mathcal{N}$ QCD axion field coupling to nucleons. Both are potential candidates for dark matter. Using the scalar modified equations of state, we calculate models for white dwarf stars and compare their radii and masses with observed mass-radius data. The comparison results in stringent constraints on the masses of the particles and the coupling parameters. For a wide range of particle masses and coupling parameters, constraints from the white dwarf equation of state surpass existing limits, outperforming also dedicated laboratory searches. The remarkable accuracy of modern white-dwarf mass-radius relation data, exemplified by Sirius B, now allows stringent tests of dense-matter physics and constraints on new particle scenarios.</description>

      <title>MESA-QUEST: Tracing the formation of direct collapse black hole seeds via quasi-stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at redshifts $z\geq 9$ remains one of the most challenging open questions in astrophysics. Their rapid emergence suggests that massive ``heavy seeds'' must have formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in the first galaxies. We present MESA-QUEST, a new framework built upon the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, designed to model the structure and evolution of quasi-stars -- massive, radiation-supported envelopes hosting accreting black holes at their cores -- believed to be the progenitors of direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds. Our implementation introduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and saturated-convection regimes, and explores the impact of several stellar wind and mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington radiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central black holes to $\geq 10^3\,M_{\odot}$ under favorable conditions, with saturated-convection models yielding BH-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55$M_*$ -- five times higher than Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can dramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless balanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical limits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds capable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra. Future extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation hydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the quasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Tracks and Spectral Properties of Quasi-stars and Their Correlation with Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a population of red, compact, high-redshift (${z\sim3-10}$) objects referred to as ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs). These objects exhibit unusual spectral features reminiscent of stellar spectra with blackbody-like SEDs, large hydrogen Balmer breaks, Balmer line absorption, and classical stellar absorption features such as calcium H&amp;K and the calcium triplet. Following the recent suggestion that these may be actively accreting direct-collapse black holes in the process of assembly, i.e. quasi-stars, we present evolutionary models of quasi-stars using our recently released, publicly available MESA-QUEST modeling framework. We compute a grid of models spanning a range of black hole masses and predict the luminosities, temperatures, surface gravities, and lifetimes of these objects. We find that these models lie along a Hayashi track once they hit their ``late-stage'' which constitutes the majority of their lives ($\sim 20$~Myr). We present scaling relations for estimating the mass of a quasi-star as a function of the bolometric luminosity, as well as the bolometric luminosity as a function of the effective temperature for the Hayashi track. The short lifetimes in tandem with the observed number density of LRDs imply the possibility that every supermassive black hole was once a quasi-star. We compare synthetic spectra of our quasi-star models to observations of LRDs, and show that these models are broadly capable of reproducing the continuum spectra of observed LRDs. These results indicate that quasi-stars are promising candidates for the origin of supermassive black holes via direct collapse in the early universe.</description>

      <title>The HITRAN2024 methane update</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic parameters of methane from many different studies were gathered to improve the HITRAN database towards its 2024 version. After a validation process using high-resolution FTS and CRDS spectra, about 80,000 lines of the four most abundant isotopologues were replaced from the dyad to the triacontad regions. These changes amount to 51,000 transition wavenumbers, 18,000 line intensities, 33,000 pressure-broadening half-widths, and 3300 assignments. 44,000 new lines were added with 16,000 old lines removed, extending the database from 12,000 cm$^{-1}$ up to 14,000 cm$^{-1}$, and covering some gaps. A greater focus was brought on the pentad, octad, and tetradecad regions, targeted by several remote sensing instruments. In these regions, comparisons of spectral fits from multiple line lists were performed, taking only the parameters that provide best fit for each line. In the $\nu _3$ band, in addition to replacing the previous values, speed-independent pressure broadening parameters of $^{12}$CH$_4$ were gathered and used to fit Pad\'e-approximant functions. These functions then replaced any outdated experimental data in $\nu _3$, missing data in the new lines, as well as the values that were determined to be outside their physical boundaries. The CH$_3$D broadening parameters were replaced in the same manner, for missing and low or high values, using a semi-empirical formula instead.</description>

Abstract: Extensive rovibrational line lists are constructed for 12 isotopologues of carbon dioxide: $^{12}$C$^{16}$O$_2$, $^{13}$C$^{16}$O$_2$, $^{12}$C$^{17}$O$_2$, $^{13}$C$^{17}$O$_2$, $^{12}$C$^{18}$O$_2$, $^{13}$C$^{18}$O$_2$, $^{16}$O$^{12}$C$^{17}$O, $^{16}$O$^{12}$C$^{18}$O, $^{16}$O$^{13}$C$^{17}$O, $^{16}$O$^{13}$C$^{18}$O, $^{17}$O$^{12}$C$^{18}$O, and $^{17}$O$^{13}$C$^{18}$O. The variational program TROVE was employed together with an exact kinetic energy operator, accurate empirical potential energy surface (Ames-2) and the ab initio dipole moment surface Ames-2021-40K. Empirical energy levels from the most recent MARVEL analyses, as well as from the HITRAN and CDSD databases, are used to replace calculated values where available. The line lists are further supplemented by assigning AFGL quantum numbers using machine-learning based estimators. The resulting data were employed to generate opacities with four radiative transfer codes, TauREx, ARCiS, NEMESIS, and petitRADTRANS, both for individual isotopologues and for CO$_2$ at terrestrial isotopic natural abundance. All line lists and associated data are available at www.exomol.com.</description>

      <title>Einstein Probe Discovery of an X-ray Flare from K-type Star PM J23221-0301</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar flares are an intense stellar activity that can significantly impact the atmospheric composition of the surrounding planets and even the possible existence of life. During such events, the radiative energy of the star is primarily concentrated in the optical and X-ray bands, with the X-ray flux potentially increasing by tens or even hundreds of times. Einstein Probe (EP) detected a new X-ray transient EP J2322.1-0301 on 27 September 2024. Its spatial localization shows a high positional coincidence with the nearby high proper motion K-type star PM J23221-0301. Follow-up X-ray observations confirmed the flux enhancement of the source, while optical spectroscopic monitoring revealed time-variable features, particularly the disappearance of the H-alpha emission line. This X-ray flare is consistent with a characteristic fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) light curve, with a rise timescale of 1.4 ks, a decay timescale of 5.7 ks, and a total duration of about 7.1 ks. The peak luminosity in the 0.5-4.0 keV energy band reached about 1.3 x 10^31 erg s^-1, with a total energy release of about 9.1 x 10^34 erg, consistent with the empirical energy correlations observed in magnetic-reconnection-driven stellar flares, as inferred from the multitemperature plasma structure and H-alpha-X-ray energy correlation. This discovery underscores EP's capability in understanding stellar magnetic activity via observing stellar transients.</description>
