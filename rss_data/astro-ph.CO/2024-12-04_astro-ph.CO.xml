      <title>A distance measurement of galaxies from JWST using star formation rate-stellar mass relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the star formation rate-stellar mass relation ($SFR - {M_ * }$) of galaxies to measure their luminosity distances as well as estimate cosmological parameters. We obtain a sample of 341 high-redshift galaxies at $5 &lt; z &lt; 14$, and 51 others at $1.8 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$ from the JWST observations, which can be used to investigate the correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass, and determine their cosmological distance. The relation $SFR \propto {\kern 1pt} {({M_ * }/{M_ \odot })^\gamma }$ can be applied to check the nonlinear correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass ${M_ * }$ of galaxies and give their distance. On the other hand, it also can be used to test if the $SFR - {M_ * }$ relation depends on the absolute UV magnitude ${M_{UV}}$, and the data suggest that the $SFR $ is positively correlated with stellar mass, the $SFR - {M_ * }$ relation of the high-redshift galaxies has an absolute magnitude dependence. Finally, we apply a combination of galaxies and Type Ia supernova (SNIa) Pantheon to test the property of dark energy concerning whether or not its density deviates from the constant, and give the statistical results.</description>

      <title>The Millennium and Astrid galaxies in effective field theory: comparison with galaxy-halo connection models at the field level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological analyses of redshift space clustering data are primarily based on using luminous ``red'' galaxies (LRGs) and ``blue'' emission line galaxies (ELGs) to trace underlying dark matter. Using the large high-fidelity high-resolution MillenniumTNG (MTNG) and Astrid simulations, we study these galaxies with the effective field theory (EFT)-based field level forward model. We confirm that both red and blue galaxies can be accurately modeled with EFT at the field level and their parameters match those of the phenomenological halo-based models. Specifically, we consider the state of the art Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) and High Mass Quenched (HMQ) models for the red and blue galaxies, respectively. Our results explicitly confirm the validity of the halo-based models on large scales beyond the two-point statistics. In addition, we validate the field-level HOD/HMQ-based priors for EFT full-shape analysis. We find that the local bias parameters of the ELGs are in tension with the predictions of the LRG-like HOD models and present a simple analytic argument explaining this phenomenology. We also confirm that ELGs exhibit weaker non-linear redshift-space distortions (``fingers-of-God''), suggesting that a significant fraction of their data should be perturbative. We find that the response of EFT parameters to galaxy selection is sensitive to assumptions about baryonic feedback, suggesting that a detailed understanding of feedback processes is necessary for robust predictions of EFT parameters. Finally, using neural density estimation based on paired HOD-EFT parameter samples, we obtain optimal HOD models that reproduce the clustering of Astrid and MTNG galaxies.</description>

      <title>Clustering and Runaway Merging in a Primordial Black Hole Dominated Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If primordial black holes (PBH) are present in the early universe, their contribution to the energy budget grows relative to that of radiation and generically becomes dominant unless the initial abundance is exponentially small. This black hole domination scenario is largely unconstrained for PBHs with masses $\lesssim 10^9\,\mathrm{g}$, which evaporate prior to Big Bang nucleosynthesis. However, if the era of PBH domination is sufficiently long, the PBHs form clusters and can merge appreciably within these objects. We calculate the population statistics of these clusters within the Press-Schechter formalism and find that, for a wide range of PBH masses and Hubble rates at the onset of PBH domination, the mergers within PBH clusters can exhibit runaway behavior, where the majority of the cluster will eventually form a single black hole with a mass much greater than the original PBH mass. These mergers can dramatically alter the PBH mass distribution and leave behind merged relic black holes that evaporate after Big Bang nucleosynthesis and yield various observational signatures, excluding parameter choices previously thought to be viable</description>

      <title>The ionizing photon budget and effective clumping factor in radiative transfer simulations calibrated to Lyman-alpha forest data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have allowed for the first time to obtain comprehensive measurements of the ionizing photon production efficiency $\xi_\text{ion} $ for a wide range of reionization-epoch galaxies. We explore implications for the inferred UV luminosity functions and escape fractions of ionizing sources in our suite of simulations. These are run with the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON-HE and are calibrated to the XQR-30 Lyman-alpha forest data at $5&lt;z&lt;6.2$. For our fiducial source model, the inferred ionizing escape fractions increase from (6.1, 5.4, 4.9)% at $z=6$ to (14.4, 23.8, 29.4)% at $z=10$ for our (Fiducial, Early, Extremely Early) models in good agreement with extrapolations of lower redshift escape fraction measurements. Extrapolating observed luminosity functions beyond the resolution limit of the simulations to faint sources with $M_\text{UV}=-11$ increases the inferred escape fractions by a factor $\sim 1.5$ at $z=10$. For our oligarchic source model, where no ionizing photons are emitted in faint sources, the inferred escape fractions increase from 10% at $z=6$ to uncomfortably large values $&gt;50$% at $z&gt; 10$, disfavouring the oligarchic source model at very high redshift. The inferred effective clumping factors in our simulations are in the range of $3-6$, suggesting consistency between the observed ionizing properties of reionization-epoch galaxies and the ionizing photon budget in our simulations.</description>

      <title>Measuring the expansion history of the Universe with cosmic chronometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As revealed by Hubble in 1928, our Universe is expanding. This discovery was fundamental to widening our horizons and our conception of space, and since then determining the rate at which our Universe is expanding has become one of the crucial measurements in cosmology. At the beginning of this century, these measurements revealed the unexpected behavior that this expansion is accelerating and allowed us to have a first glimpse of the dark components that constitute $\sim$95\% of our Universe. Cosmic chronometers represent a novel technique to obtain a cosmology-independent determination of the expansion of the Universe, based on the differential age dating of a population of very massive and passively evolving galaxies. Currently, with this new cosmological probe it is possible to constrain the Hubble parameter with an accuracy of around 5\% at $z\sim0.5$ up to 10-20\% at $z\sim2$. In this Chapter, the cosmic chronometers approach is presented, describing the method and how an optimal sample can be selected; it is then discussed how the most recent measurements of the expansion history of the Universe have been obtained with this approach, as well as the cosmological constraints that can be derived. Particular attention will be given to the systematics involved in this approach and the treatment to properly take them into account. We conclude by presenting forecasts that show how future spectroscopic surveys will significantly boost the accuracy of this method and open the possibility to a percent determination of the Hubble constant, making cosmic chronometers a powerful independent tool to derive information on the expansion history of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Searches for signatures of ultra-light axion dark matter in polarimetry data of the European Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-light axion-like particles (ALPs) can be a viable solution to the dark matter problem. The scalar field associated with ALPs, coupled to the electromagnetic field, acts as an active birefringent medium, altering the polarisation properties of light through which it propagates. In particular, oscillations of the axionic field induce monochromatic variations of the plane of linearly polarised radiation of astrophysical signals. The radio emission of millisecond pulsars provides an excellent tool to search for such manifestations, given their high fractional linear polarisation and negligible fluctuations of their polarisation properties. We have searched for the evidence of ALPs in the polarimetry measurements of pulsars collected and preprocessed for the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) campaign. Focusing on the twelve brightest sources in linear polarisation, we searched for an astrophysical signal from axions using both frequentist and Bayesian statistical frameworks. For the frequentist analysis, which uses Lomb-Scargle periodograms at its core, no statistically significant signal has been found. The model used for the Bayesian analysis has been adjusted to accommodate multiple deterministic systematics that may be present in the data. A statistically significant signal has been found in the dataset of multiple pulsars with common frequency between $10^{-8}$ Hz and $2\times10^{-8}$ Hz, which can most likely be explained by the residual Faraday rotation in the terrestrial ionosphere. Strong bounds on the coupling constant $g_{a\gamma}$, in the same ballpark as other searches, have been obtained in the mass range between $6\times10^{-24}$ eV and $5\times10^{-21}$ eV. We conclude by discussing problems that can limit the sensitivity of our search for ultra-light axions in the polarimetry data of pulsars, and possible ways to resolve them.</description>

      <title>A visibility-based angular bispectrum estimator for radio-interferometric data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering radio-interferometric observations, we present a fast and efficient estimator to compute the binned angular bispectrum (ABS) from gridded visibility data. The estimator makes use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques to compute the bispectrum covering all possible triangle shapes and sizes. Here, we present the formalism of the estimator and validate it using simulated visibility data for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) observations at $\nu=154.25$ MHz. We find that our estimator is able to faithfully recover the ABS of the simulated sky signal with $\approx 10-15 \%$ accuracy for a wide variety of triangle shapes and sizes across the range of angular multipoles $46 \le \ell \le 1320$. In future work, we plan to apply this to actual data and also generalize it to estimate the three-dimensional redshifted 21-cm bispectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making inferences about physical properties of the Universe requires knowledge of the data likelihood. A Gaussian distribution is commonly assumed for the uncertainties with a covariance matrix estimated from a set of simulations. The noise in such covariance estimates causes two problems: it distorts the width of the parameter contours, and it adds scatter to the location of those contours which is not captured by the widths themselves. For non-Gaussian likelihoods, an approximation may be derived via Simulation-Based Inference (SBI). It is often implicitly assumed that parameter constraints from SBI analyses, which do not use covariance matrices, are not affected by the same problems as parameter estimation with a covariance matrix estimated from simulations. We investigate whether SBI suffers from effects similar to those of covariance estimation in Gaussian likelihoods. We use Neural Posterior and Likelihood Estimation with continuous and masked autoregressive normalizing flows for density estimation. We fit our approximate posterior models to simulations drawn from a Gaussian linear model, so that the SBI result can be compared to the true posterior. We test linear and neural network based compression, demonstrating that neither methods circumvent the issues of covariance estimation. SBI suffers an inflation of posterior variance that is equal or greater than the analytical result in covariance estimation for Gaussian likelihoods for the same number of simulations. The assumption that SBI requires a smaller number of simulations than covariance estimation for a Gaussian likelihood analysis is inaccurate. The limitations of traditional likelihood analysis with simulation-based covariance remain for SBI with a finite simulation budget. Despite these issues, we show that SBI correctly draws the true posterior contour given enough simulations.</description>

      <title>Study of primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NG}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NG}}$ with the cross-correlations between the scalar-induced gravitational waves and the cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background originating from cosmic sources contains vital information about the early universe. In this work, we comprehensively study the cross-correlations between the energy-density anisotropies in scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) and the temperature anisotropies and polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In our analysis of the angular power spectra for these cross-correlations, we consider all contributions of the local-type primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$ that can lead to large anisotropies. We show that the angular power spectra are highly sensitive to primordial non-Gaussianity. Furthermore, we project the sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors to detect such signals and, consequently, measure the primordial non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Formation of solitons and their transitions in scalar-field dark matter models with a non-polynomial self-interaction potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of solitons inside scalar-field dark matter halos with a non-polynomial self-interaction potential. We consider a self-interaction potential that is quartic in the scalar field in the low-density regime but saturates at large densities. This mimics the behaviour of axion monodromy potentials. We concentrate on the semi-classical regime, where the de Broglie wavelength is much smaller than the size of the system. We find that depending on the strength and scale of the self-interactions, the system can form solitons of the Thomas-Fermi type (dominated by self-interactions) or of the Fuzzy Dark Matter type (dominated by the quantum pressure). The system can also display transitions from a Thomas-Fermi soliton to a Fuzzy Dark Matter soliton as the former becomes unstable. We show that these behaviours can be understood from a simple Gaussian ansatz. We find that even in cases where the self-interactions are always subdominant they can play a critical role, by providing a small density boost that is enough to generate the seed for the formation of a Fuzzy Dark Matter soliton at much later times. We also point out that the intuition derived from a hydrodynamical picture can be misleading in regimes where wave effects are important.</description>

      <title>Testing inflation on all scales: a case study with $\alpha$-attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A plethora of inflationary models can produce interesting small-scale phenomenology, such as enhanced scalar fluctuations leading to primordial black hole (PBH) production and large scalar-induced GW. Nevertheless, good models must simultaneously explain current observations on all scales. In this work, we showcase our methodology to establish the small-scale phenomenology of inflationary models on firm grounds. We consider the case of hybrid $\alpha$-attractors, and focus on a reduced parameter space featuring the two potential parameters which roughly determine the position of the peak in the scalar power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$, and its amplitude. We first constrain the parameter space by comparing the large-scale predictions for $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$ with current CMB anisotropies measurements and upper limits on $\mu$-distortions. We take into account uncertainties due to the reheating phase, and observe that the parameter-space area compatible with large-scale constraints shrinks for extended reheating stages. We then move to smaller scales, where we find that non-Gaussianity at peak scales is of the local type and has amplitude $f_\text{NL}\sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)$. This ensures that non-linear effects are subdominant, motivating us to employ the tree-level $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$ to compute the abundance of PBHs and the spectrum of induced GWs for models consistent with large-scale tests. The former allows us to further constrain the parameter space, by excluding models which over-produce PBHs. We find that a subset of viable models can lead to significant production of PBHs, and a fraction of these is within reach for LISA, having a signal-to-noise ratio larger than that of astrophysical foregrounds. Our first-of-its-kind study systematically combines tests at different scales, and exploits the synergy between cosmological observations and theoretical consistency requirements.</description>

Abstract: The precise measurement of the sky-averaged HI absorption signal between 50 and 200 MHz is the primary goal of global 21-cm cosmology. This measurement has the potential to unravel the underlying physics of cosmic structure formation and evolution during the Cosmic Dawn. It is, however, hindered by various non-smooth, frequency-dependent effects, whose structures resemble those of the signal. One such effect is the leakage of polarised foregrounds into the measured intensity signal: polarised foreground emission undergoes Faraday rotation as it passes through the magnetic fields of the interstellar medium, imprinting a chromatic structure in the relevant frequency range which complicates the extraction of the cosmological HI absorption feature. We investigate the effect of polarised Galactic foregrounds on extracting the global 21-cm signal from simulated data using REACH's data analysis pipeline; the Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen (REACH) is an experiment designed to detect the sky-averaged 21-cm HI signal from the early Universe using physically informed models. Using the REACH pipeline, we successfully recover an injected global 21-cm signal with an amplitude of approximately 0.16 K, centred between 80 and 120 MHz, achieving a low root-mean-square error (less than 30\% of the injected signal strength) in all the tested cases. This includes scenarios with simulated polarised Galactic diffuse emissions and polarised point source emissions, provided the overall polarisation fraction is below $\sim 3\%$. The linear mixing of contamination, caused by the superposition of multiple patches with varying strengths of Faraday rotation, produces patterns that are more distinct from the global signal. This distinction makes global signal recovery easier compared to contamination resulting from a single, slow oscillation pattern.</description>

      <title>Impact of blending on weak lensing measurements with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming deep optical surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will scan the sky to unprecedented depths, detecting billions of galaxies. However, this amount of detections will lead to the apparent superposition of galaxies in the images, a phenomenon known as blending, that can affect the accurate measurement of individual galaxy properties. In particular, galaxy shapes play a crucial role in estimating the masses of large-scale structures, such as galaxy clusters, through weak gravitational lensing. This proceeding introduces a new catalog matching algorithm, friendly, designed for detecting and characterizing blends in simulated LSST data for the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) Data Challenge 2. The aim of this algorithm is to combine several matching procedures, as well as a probabilistic method to quantify blended systems. By removing the resulted 27% of galaxies affected by blending from the dataset, we demonstrate that the amplitude of the excess surface mass density weak lensing profile - potentially biased low due to blending - may be partially corrected.</description>

      <title>Stage IV CMB forecasts for warm inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report forecasted constraints on warm inflation in the light of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys, with data expected to be available in the coming decade. These observations could finally give us the missing information necessary to unveil the production of gravitational waves during inflation, reflected by detecting a non-zero tensor-to-scalar ratio crucial to the B-mode power spectrum of the CMB. We consider the impact of three future surveys, namely the CMB-S4, Simons Observatory, and the space-borne $\textit{LiteBIRD}$, in restricting the parameter space of four typical warm inflationary models in the context of a quartic potential, which is well motivated theoretically. We find that all three surveys significantly improve the models' parameter space, compared to recent results obtained with current $\textit{Planck}$+BICEP/Keck Array data. Moreover, the combination of ground-based and space-borne (CMB-S4+$\textit{LiteBIRD}$) tightens the constraints so that we expect to distinguish even better warm inflation scenarios. This result becomes clear when we compare the models' predictions with a $\Lambda$CDM+$r$ forecast, compatible with $r=0$, in which one of them already becomes excluded by data.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Pre-Big Bang scenario from a cosmological interpretation of the NANOGrav data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a recently proposed interpretation of the signal detected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) as due to a relic stochastic background of primordial gravitons, produced in the context of the string cosmology pre-big bang scenario. We show that such interpretation cannot be reconciled with a phenomenologically viable minimal version of such scenario, while it can be allowed if one considers an equally viable but generalised, non-minimal version of pre-big bang evolution. Maintaining the $S$-duality symmetry throughout the high-curvature string phase is possible although somewhat disfavoured. The implications of this non-minimal scenario for the power spectrum of curvature perturbations are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>A note on loop resummation in de Sitter spacetime with the wavefunction of the universe approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the computation of $n$-point correlation functions in de Sitter spacetime, including loop corrections, using the wavefunction of the universe approach. This method consists of two stages employing distinct Feynman rules. First, one must compute the wavefunction coefficients using interactions as vertices. Then, in the second stage, one computes correlation functions using wavefunction coefficients as vertices. For massless fields, loop corrections in the first stage are free of infrared (IR) divergences, which leads to the question of how this matches the well-known IR behavior of correlators obtained via other methods. By considering a scalar field with an arbitrary potential, we compute $n$-point correlation functions to first order in the potential but to all orders in loops. We find that, although loop integrals in the first stage are indeed IR convergent, the second procedure reintroduces the IR divergence. We discuss how this induces renormalization of the interaction potential such that the final result combining both steps exactly matches the form of $n$-point functions previously calculated with other methods.</description>

      <title>From eccentric binaries to nonstationary gravitational wave backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large population of binary systems in the Universe emitting gravitational waves (GW) would produce a stochastic noise, known as the gravitational wave background (GWB). The properties of the GWB directly depend on the attributes of its constituents. If the binary systems are in eccentric orbits, it is well established that the GW power they radiate strongly depends on their instantaneous orbital phase. Consequently, their power spectrum varies over time, and the resulting GWB can appear nonstationary. In this work, we estimate the amplitude of time-dependent fluctuations in the GWB power spectrum as a function of the eccentricity of the binaries. Specifically, we focus on the GWB produced by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) that should be observable by pulsar timing arrays (PTA). We show that a large population of homogeneously distributed equal SMBHBs produces nonstationary features that are undetectable by current PTA datasets. However, using more realistic and astrophysically motivated populations of SMBHBs, we show that the nonstationarity might become very large and detectable, especially in the case of more massive and eccentric populations. In particular, when one binary is slightly brighter than the GWB, we demonstrate that time fluctuations can become significant. This is also true for individual binary systems with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) relative to the GWB (SNR $\approx$ 1), which standard data analysis methods would struggle to detect. The detection of nonstationary features in the GWB could indicate the presence of some relatively bright GW sources in eccentric orbits, offering new insights into the origins of the signal.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Rapidly Rotating Stars with Chemically Homogeneous Evolution in the First Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed an unexpectedly high abundance of UV luminous galaxies at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$, challenging `standard' galaxy formation models. This study investigates the role of rapidly rotating (massive) stars undergoing chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) in reconciling this potential tension. These stars are more compact, hotter, and exhibit enhanced UV emission. We find that the rest-frame UV luminosity of star-forming galaxies can be significantly enhanced by a factor of $\sim 3-6$ when CHE stars above a minimum initial mass of $m_{\star,\min}^{\rm CHE}\sim 2-10\ \rm M_\odot$ account for more than half of the total stellar mass following a Salpeter initial mass function. As a result, the UV luminosity functions observed at $z\sim 12-16$ can be reproduced with less extreme values of star formation efficiency and UV luminosity stochastic variability. Our results highlight the potential of CHE in explaining the UV-bright galaxy populations detected by JWST and call for future work to explore the broader astrophysical implications of CHE and its associated phenomena in the early universe, such as gamma-ray bursts, compact object binaries, and metal enrichment.</description>

      <title>First Pulsar Polarization Array Limits on Ultralight Axion-like Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct the first-ever Pulsar Polarization Array (PPA) analysis to detect the ultralight Axion-Like Dark Matter (ALDM) using the polarization data of 22 millisecond pulsars from the third data release of Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. As one of the major dark matter candidates, the ultralight ALDM exhibits a pronounced wave nature on astronomical scales and offers a promising solution to small-scale structure issues within local galaxies. While the linearly polarized pulsar light travels through the ALDM galactic halo, its position angle (PA) can be subject to an oscillation induced by the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling with electromagnetic field. The PPA is thus especially suited for detecting the ultralight ALDM by correlating polarization data across the arrayed pulsars. To accomplish this task, we develop an advanced Bayesian analysis framework that allows us to construct pulsar PA residual time series, model noise contributions properly and search for pulsar cross-correlations. We find that for an ALDM density of $\rho_0=0.4\,\textrm{GeV}/\textrm{cm}^3$, the Parkes PPA offers the best global limits on the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling, namely $\lesssim 10^{-13.5}-10^{-12.2}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, for the mass range of $10^{-22} - 10^{-21}~{\rm eV}$. The crucial role of pulsar cross-correlation in recognizing the nature of the derived limits is also highlighted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic dark matter (DM) particles, having non-gravitational interactions with nucleons, can interact with stellar constituents and eventually become captured within stars. Over the lifetime of the celestial body, these non-annihilating, heavy DM particles may accumulate and eventually form a comparable stellar mass black hole (BH), referred to as a Transmuted Black Hole (TBH). We investigate how current gravitational wave (GW) experiments could detect such particle DM through the presence of low-mass TBHs, which cannot form via standard stellar evolution. Different stellar objects (compact and non-compact) provide laboratories across DM-nucleon interaction regimes, offering insight into DM's mass and its non-gravitational properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can decay into two photons with a rest-frame frequency given by half of the ALP mass. This implies that ultra-violet searches can be used to investigate ALPs in the multi-eV mass range. We use archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope between 110 and 170 nm to constrain ALPs with mass between 14.4-22.2 eV. We consider observations of a set of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and galaxy clusters and assume the ALP density in these objects to follow their dark matter density. The derived limit on the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ excludes values above $10^{-12}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ over the whole mass range and surpasses previous limits by over one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>FAST drift scan survey for HI intensity mapping: II. stacking-based primary beam construction for FAST L-band 19 feeds at $1.4$ GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping (IM) presents great promise for future cosmological large-scale structure surveys. However, a major challenge for HIIM cosmological studies is to accurately subtract the foreground contamination. An accurate beam model is crucial for improving foreground subtraction accuracy. In this work, we develop a stacking-based beam reconstruction method utilizing the radio continuum point sources within the drift-scan field. Based on the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we employ two series of drift-scan survey data and merge the measurements to construct the beam patterns of the FAST L-band 19 feeds. To model the beams, we utilize the Zernike polynomial (ZP), which effectively captures % the side lobes and asymmetric features of the side lobes. asymmetric features of the main beam and the different side lobes. Due to the symmetric location of the beams, the main features of the beams are closely related to the distance from the center of the feed array, e.g., as the distance increases, side lobes become more pronounced. This modeling pipeline leverages the stable drift-scan data to extract beam patterns exclude the reflector's changing effects, and provides a more accurate measurement beam and a more precise model beam for FAST HIIM cosmology surveys.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of singlet-doublet dark matter relic: annihilation, co-annihilation, co-scattering, and freeze-in</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The singlet-doublet vector-like fermion dark matter model has been extensively studied in the literature over the past decade. An important parameter in this model is the singlet-doublet mixing angle ($\sin\theta$). All the previous studies have primarily focused on annihilation and co-annihilation processes for obtaining the correct dark matter relic density, assuming that the singlet and doublet components decouple at the same epoch. In this work, we demonstrate that this assumption holds only for larger mixing angles with a dependency on the mass of the dark matter. However, it badly fails for the mixing angle $\sin\theta&lt;0.05$. We present a systematic study of the parameter space of the singlet-doublet dark matter relic, incorporating annihilation, co-annihilation, and, for the first time, co-scattering processes. Additionally, the freeze-in parameter space is also explored. We found that due to the inclusion of co-scattering processes, the correct relic density parameter space is shifted towards the detection sensitivity range of the LHC and MATHUSLA via displaced vertex signatures.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from supercooled phase transitions in conformal Majoron models of neutrino mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study supercooled first-order phase transitions above the QCD scale in a wide class of conformal Majoron-like U(1)' models that explain the totality of active neutrino oscillation data and produce a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at LIGO, LISA and ET. We place constraints on the U(1)' breaking scale and gauge coupling using current LIGO-Virgo-Kagra data. We find that strong supercooling can be ruled out in large regions of parameter space if a SGWB is not detected by these experiments. A null signal at LIGO and ET will disfavor a type-I seesaw scale above $10^{14}$ GeV, while a positive signal is a signature of heavy right-handed neutrinos. On the other hand, LISA will be sensitive to seesaw scales as low as a TeV, and could detect a SGWB even if the right-handed neutrinos are decoupled.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Study of Type Ia Supernova lightcurve fits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology relies on the estimation of lightcurve parameters to derive precision distances that leads to the estimation of cosmological parameters. The empirical SALT2 lightcurve modeling that relies on only two parameters, a stretch x1, and a color c, has been used by the community for almost two decades. In this paper we study the ability of the SALT2 model to fit the nearly 3000 cosmology-grade SN Ia lightcurves from the second release of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) cosmology science working group. While the ZTF data was not used to train SALT2, the algorithm is modeling the ZTF SN Ia optical lightcurves remarkably well, except for lightcurve points prior to -10 d from maximum, where the training critically lacks statistics. We find that the lightcurve fitting is robust against the considered choice of phase-range, but we show the [-10; +40] d range to be optimal in terms of statistics and accuracy. We do not detect any significant features in the lightcurve fit residuals that could be connected to the host environment. Potential systematic population differences related to the SN Ia host properties might thus not be accountable for by the addition of extra lightcurve parameters. However, a small but significant inconsistency between residuals of blue- and red-SN Ia strongly suggests the existence of a phase-dependent color term, with potential implications for the use of SNe Ia in precision cosmology. We thus encourage modellers to explore this avenue and we emphasize the importance that SN Ia cosmology must include a SALT2 retraining to accurately model the lightcurves and avoid biasing the derivation of cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first homogeneous release of several thousand Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), all having spectroscopic classification, and spectroscopic redshifts for half the sample. This release, named the "DR2", contains 3628 nearby (z &lt; 0.3) SNe Ia discovered, followed and classified by the Zwicky Transient Facility survey between March 2018 and December 2020. Of these, 3000 have good-to-excellent sampling and 2667 pass standard cosmology light-curve quality cuts. This release is thus the largest SN Ia release to date, increasing by an order of magnitude the number of well characterized low-redshift objects. With the "DR2", we also provide a volume-limited (z &lt; 0.06) sample of nearly a thousand SNe Ia. With such a large, homogeneous and well controlled dataset, we are studying key current questions on SN cosmology, such as the linearity SNe Ia standardization, the SN and host dependencies, the diversity of the SN Ia population, and the accuracy of the current light-curve modeling. These, and more, are studied in detail in a series of articles associated with this release. Alongside the SN Ia parameters, we publish our force-photometry gri-band light curves, 5138 spectra, local and global host properties, observing logs, and a python tool to ease use and access of these data. The photometric accuracy of the "DR2" is not yet suited for cosmological parameter inference, which will follow as "DR2.5" release. We nonetheless demonstrate that the multi-thousand SN Ia Hubble Diagram has a typical 0.15 mag scatter.</description>

      <title>Structure formation with primordial black holes: collisional dynamics, binaries, and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) could compose the dark matter content of the Universe. We present the first simulations of cosmological structure formation with PBH dark matter that consistently include collisional few-body effects, post-Newtonian orbit corrections, orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission, and black-hole mergers. We carefully construct initial conditions by considering the evolution during radiation domination as well as early-forming binary systems. We identify numerous dynamical effects due to the collisional nature of PBH dark matter, including evolution of the internal structures of PBH halos and the formation of a hot component of PBHs. We also study the properties of the emergent population of PBH binary systems, distinguishing those that form at primordial times from those that form during the nonlinear structure formation process. These results will be crucial to sharpen constraints on the PBH scenario derived from observational constraints on the gravitational wave background. Even under conservative assumptions, the gravitational radiation emitted over the course of the simulation appears to exceed current limits from ground-based experiments, but this depends on the evolution of the gravitational wave spectrum and PBH merger rate toward lower redshifts.</description>

      <title>Testing the robustness of the BAO determination in the presence of massive neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the robustness of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature in galaxy clustering in the presence of massive neutrinos. In the standard BAO analysis pipeline a reference cosmological model is assumed to boost the BAO peak through the so-called reconstruction technique and in the modelling of the BAO feature to extract the cosmological information. State-of-the art spectroscopic BAO measurements, such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument claim an aggregate precision of 0.52$\%$ on the BAO scale, with a systematic error of 0.1$\%$ associated to the assumption of a reference cosmology when measuring and analyzing the BAO feature. While the systematic effect induced by this arbitrary choice of fiducial cosmology has been studied for a wide range of $\Lambda$CDM-like models, it has not yet been tested for reference cosmologies with massive neutrinos with the precision afforded by next generation surveys. In this context, we employ the Quijote high-resolution dark-matter simulations with haloes above a mass of $M\sim 2\times10^{13} h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, with different values for the total sum of neutrinos masses, $\sum m_\nu[{\rm eV}] = 0,\, 0.1,\, 0,2,\, 0.4$ to study and quantify the impact of the pipeline's built-in assumption of massless neutrinos on the measurement of the BAO signal, with a special focus on the BAO reconstruction technique. We determine that any additional systematic bias introduced by the assumption of massless neutrinos is no greater than $0.1\%$ ($0.2\%$) for the isotropic (anisotropic) measurement. We expect these conclusions also hold for galaxies provided that neutrino properties do not alter the galaxy-halo connection.</description>

      <title>Pre-Big-Bang Cosmology Cannot Explain NANOGrav 15-year Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether the Pre-Big Bang (PBB) scenario from string cosmology can explain the stochastic gravitational wave background signal reported in the NANOGrav 15-year dataset. Using Bayesian analysis techniques, we constrain the key parameters of the PBB model by comparing its theoretical predictions with the observed data. Our analysis yields $\beta = -0.12^{+0.06}_{-0.21}$ ($90\%$ credible interval) for the dilaton-dynamics parameter, which lies outside the theoretically allowed range $0 \leq \beta &lt; 3$ with more than $5\sigma$ confidence. Additionally, model comparison strongly favors a simple power-law spectrum over the PBB scenario, with a Bayes factor of approximately $468$. These results demonstrate that the PBB scenario, in its current formulation, cannot adequately explain the NANOGrav observations, highlighting the need for either significant modifications to the model or alternative explanations for the observed signal.</description>

      <title>Constraints on freeze-in dark matter from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and 21-cm signal : single-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report new Lyman-$\alpha$ and 21-cm constraints on freeze-in dark matter (FIDM) which injects energy into the intergalactic medium either through annihilation or decay to photon(s) or electron-positron pair. With respect to Lyman-$\alpha$ we fix the baseline ionization history using low redshift data about astrophysical reionization, whereas for 21-cm signal we adopt the baseline values of 21-cm power spectrum through a standard modeling of star formation developed so far. Using the latest numerical tools, we show that (i) for sterile neutrino FIDM, current Lyman-$\alpha$ data and future sensitivity of SKA-low (1000 hrs) on the 21-cm power spectra excludes the FIDM mass up to $1.8\times 10^{-3}$ GeV at 95$\%$ CL and $5.46\times 10^{-4}$ GeV, respectively, and (ii) for millicharged FIDM, current Lyman-$\alpha$ data only excludes the millicharge down to $10^{-8}$ within the FIDM mass range of $10^{-3}-1$ GeV at 95$\%$ CL, suggesting that the surviving parameter space of millicharged FIDM is still intact.</description>

      <title>Complex structures of boson stars and anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and explore the complex structures of boson stars, drawing inspiration from similar configurations of non-topological solitons in Minkowski space. These "molecular states" of boson stars have a multipolar structure and both positive and negative Noether charges within one star, and the opposite charges swap with time. Thanks to the gravitational attraction, they exist even in the case of a free scalar field. We also explore the effects of scalar self-interactions on these complex structures. We propose to use galactic-scale charge-swapping boson stars as a potential solution to the problem of the observed anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>Polarization of active galactic nuclei with significant VLBI-Gaia displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12226v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous studies have reported significant displacements in the coordinates of active galactic nuclei between measurements using radio interferometry techniques and those obtained by the Gaia space observatory. There is a consensus that these discrepancies do indeed manifest astrometrically resolved sub-components of AGN rather than random measurement noise. Among other evidence, it has been reported that AGN with VLBI-to-Gaia displacements (VGD) pointing downstream their parsec-scale radio jets exhibit higher optical polarization compared to sources with the opposite VGD orientation. We aim to verify this previously reported connection between optical polarization and VGD-jet angle using a larger dataset of polarimetric measurements and updated Gaia DR3 positions. We also seek additional evidence supporting the disc-jet dichotomy as an explanation of such a connection by using mm-wave polarization and multi-band optical polarization measurements. We performed optical polarimetric observations of 152 AGN using three telescopes. We cross-match public astrometric data from VLBI and Gaia experiments, obtain corresponding positional displacements, and join this catalog with the polarimetric and jet directions data. AGN with downstream VGD are confirmed to have significantly higher optical fractional polarization than the upstream sample. At the same time, the mm-wavelength polarization of the two samples demonstrates very similar distributions. Our results support the hypothesis that the VLBI-to-Gaia displacements pointing down the radio jet are likely caused by a component in the jet emitting highly polarized synchrotron radiation and dominating in the overall optical emission. The upstream-oriented VGD are likely to be produced by the low-polarized emission of the central engine sub-components dominating in the optical.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Astronomy With TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The opening of the gravitational wave window has significantly enhanced our capacity to explore the universe's most extreme and dynamic sector. In the mHz frequency range, a diverse range of compact objects, from the most massive black holes at the farthest reaches of the Universe to the lightest white dwarfs in our cosmic backyard, generate a complex and dynamic symphony of gravitational wave signals. Once recorded by gravitational wave detectors, these unique fingerprints have the potential to decipher the birth and growth of cosmic structures over a wide range of scales, from stellar binaries and stellar clusters to galaxies and large-scale structures. The TianQin space-borne gravitational wave mission is scheduled for launch in the 2030s, with an operational lifespan of five years. It will facilitate pivotal insights into the history of our universe. This document presents a concise overview of the detectable sources of TianQin, outlining their characteristics, the challenges they present, and the expected impact of the TianQin observatory on our understanding of them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) utilizing multiple Large Language Model agents with Retrieval Augmented Generation and that can execute code locally may become beneficial in cosmological data analysis. Here, we illustrate a first small step towards AI-assisted analyses and a glimpse of the potential of MAS to automate and optimize scientific workflows in Cosmology. The system architecture of our example package, that builds upon the autogen/ag2 framework, can be applied to MAS in any area of quantitative scientific research. The particular task we apply our methods to is the cosmological parameter analysis of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope lensing power spectrum likelihood using Monte Carlo Markov Chains. Our work-in-progress code is open source and available at https://github.com/CMBAgents/cmbagent.</description>
