      <title>Applying an electrostatic cross-correlation to the CFTR-ATP interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an important membrane protein in vertebrates. The function of CFTR is to transport chloride ions across the cell membrane, which is known to require adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Whereas most conventional wisdom suggests that ATP interacts with CFTR purely through random collisions via diffusion, we investigate electrostatic interactions between CFTR and ATP at the mesoscale (10s of Angstroms). We use molecular dynamics to simulate CFTR-ATP interactions in cases where CFTR is bound/unbound from ATP, and we demonstrate an electrostatic potential gradient towards CFTR when ATP is unbound. We additionally compute electrostatic interactions between ATP and the solvent and membrane, which are simulated explicitly.</description>

      <title>Locuaz: an in-silico platform for antibody fragments optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Engineering high-affinity binders targeting specific antigenic determinants remains a challenging and often daunting task, requiring extensive experimental screening. Computational methods have the potential to accelerate this process, reducing costs and time, but only if they demonstrate broad applicability and efficiency in exploring mutations, evaluating affinity, and pruning unproductive mutation paths. Results: In response to these challenges, we introduce a new computational platform for optimizing protein binders towards their targets. The platform is organized as a series of modules, performing mutation selection and application, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to sample conformations around interaction poses, and mutation prioritization using suitable scoring functions. Notably, the platform supports parallel exploration of different mutation streams, enabling in silico high-throughput screening on HPC systems. Furthermore, the platform is highly customizable, allowing users to implement their own protocols.

      <title>Three epochs of nascent protein translocation through the ribosome exit tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All proteins in living organisms are produced in ribosomes that facilitate the translation of genetic information into a sequence of amino acid residues. During translation, the ribosome undergoes stages of initialization, elongation, termination, and recycling. In fact, peptide bonds are formed only during the elongation stage, which comprises periodic association of transfer RNAs and multiple auxiliary proteins with the ribosome, and the addition of an amino acid to the nascent polypeptide one at a time. The protein spends a considerable amount of time attached to the ribosome. Here, we conceptually divide this portion of the protein lifetime into three epochs. We define the epochs on the basis of the position of the N-terminus of the nascent polypeptide within the ribosome exit tunnel and the context of the catalytic center. We argue that nascent polypeptides experience a variety of forces that determine how they translocate through the tunnel and interact with the tunnel walls. We review current knowledge about translocation and identify several white spots in our understanding of the birth of proteins.</description>

      <title>Prevalence estimation methods for time-dependent antibody kinetics of infected and vaccinated individuals: a graph-theoretic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immune events such as infection, vaccination, and a combination of the two result in distinct time-dependent antibody responses in affected individuals. These responses and event prevalences combine non-trivially to govern antibody levels sampled from a population. Time-dependence and disease prevalence pose considerable modeling challenges that need to be addressed to provide a rigorous mathematical underpinning of the underlying biology. We propose a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain model for event-to-event transitions coupled with a probabilistic framework for anti-body kinetics and demonstrate its use in a setting in which individuals can be infected or vaccinated but not both. We prove the equivalency of this approach to the framework developed in our previous work. Synthetic data are used to demonstrate the modeling process and conduct prevalence estimation via transition probability matrices. This approach is ideal to model sequences of infections and vaccinations, or personal trajectories in a population, making it an important first step towards a mathematical characterization of reinfection, vaccination boosting, and cross-events of infection after vaccination or vice versa.</description>

      <title>Time-Heterogeneity of the F\"orster Radius from Dipole Orientational Dynamics Explains Observed Dynamic Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a quantum mechanical phenomenon involving the non-radiative transfer of energy between coupled electric dipoles. Due to the strong dependence of FRET on the distance between the dipoles, it is frequently used as a ``molecular ruler" in biology, chemistry, and physics. This is done by placing dipolar molecules called dyes on molecules of interest. In time-resolved confocal single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments, the joint distribution of the FRET efficiency and the donor fluorescence lifetime can reveal underlying molecular conformational dynamics via deviation from their theoretical F\"orster relationship. This deviation is referred to as a dynamic shift. Quantifying the dynamic shift caused by the motion of the fluorescent dyes is essential to decoupling the dynamics of the studied molecules and the dyes. We develop novel Langevin models for the dye linker dynamics, including rotational dynamics, based on first physics principles and proper dye linker chemistry to match accessible volumes predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. By simulating the dyes' stochastic translational and rotational dynamics, we show that the observed dynamic shift can largely be attributed to the mutual orientational dynamics of the electric dipole moments associated with the dyes, not their accessible volume.</description>

      <title>The Volume of Healthy Red Blood Cells is Optimal for Advective Oxygen Transport in Arterioles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) are vital for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues through the intricate circulatory system. They achieve this by binding and releasing oxygen molecules to the abundant hemoglobin within their cytosol. The volume of RBCs affects the amount of oxygen they can carry, yet whether this volume is optimal for transporting oxygen through the circulatory system remains an open question. This study explores, through high-fidelity numerical simulations, the impact of RBC volume on advectve oxygen transport efficiency through arterioles which form the area of greatest flow resistance in the circulatory system. The results show that, strikingly, RBCs with volumes similar to those found in vivo are most efficient to transport oxygen through arterioles. The flow resistance is related to the cell-free layer thickness, which is influenced by the shape and the motion of the RBCs: at low volumes RBCs deform and fold while at high volumes RBCs collide and follow more diffuse trajectories. In contrast, RBCs with a healthy volume maximize the cell-free layer thickness, resulting in a more efficient advectve transport of oxygen.</description>

      <title>Dynamic learning of synchronization in nonlinear coupled systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization phenomena are pervasive in nonlinear systems across the natural world and engineering domains. Understanding how to dynamically identify the parameter space (or network structure) of nonlinear systems in a synchronized state is crucial for the study of system synchronization. To address the challenge of achieving stable synchronization in nonlinear coupled systems, we develop a set of mathematical optimization techniques for dynamic learning of synchronization (DLS) inspired by machine learning. This technology captures the state differences between nodes within the system and dynamically adjusts weights, allowing nonlinear coupled systems to maintain a stable state of synchronization after appropriate weight adjustments. We introduce several variants of the DLS technique, including adaptive, supervised, and hybrid methods, effectively promoting synchronization in heterogeneous networks such as small-world, scale-free, and random networks. The efficacy of this technique is validated through its application to simple FitzHugh-Nagumo neural networks and complex Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal networks, examining its impact on both global and local synchronization. The DLS technique proposed in this study offers a new solution to synchronization problems in dynamic network environments, addressing the deficiencies in adaptability and flexibility of existing technologies and providing a fresh perspective for understanding and implementing synchronization phenomena in nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins is modulated by amino acids in vitro and in vivo by regulating protein-protein interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins is an intracellular process that is widely used by cells for many purposes. In living cells (in vivo), LLPS occurs in complex and crowded environments. Amino acids (AAs) are vital components of such environments, occupying a significant fraction of the cellular volume. In this work, we studied the effects of proline and other proteinogenic AAs on the LLPS of proteins, both in test tubes (in vitro) and in cells (in vivo). The effects of proline on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) and LLPS of both bovine serum albumin (BSA, a folded protein) and the low-complexity domain of fused in sarcoma (FUS267, an intrinsically disordered protein) is first established in vitro. Then, the effects of proline and other proteinogenic AAs on the formation of stress granules (SGs) by LLPS in U2OS and HeLa cells are studied. We find that the presence of AAs renders the net interaction between proteins more repulsive (i.e. stabilizes protein solution), thus suppressing protein phase separation in vitro and in vivo. We also show that the formation of SGs is suppressed by AAs using both immunofluorescence and live-cell microscopy. Our study reveals an underappreciated role of cellular AAs in modulating intracellular phase separation. It may find biomedical applications, especially in the treatment of protein aggregation diseases.</description>

      <title>Multiple Modes of Motion for the Effectiveness of Outer Hair Cells at High Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outer hair cells (OHCs) are essential for the sensitivity and frequency specificity of the mammalian ear. To perform this function, OHCs need to amplify the motion of the basilar membrane (BM), which is much stiffer than themselves. If OHCs and the BM are components of a single oscillator, this impedance mismatch seriously limits the effectiveness of OHCs. However, the elaborated structure of the organ of Corti can support multiple modes motion. Here, systems of two coupled oscillators are examined as the simplest models of the system with multiple modes of motion. It is found that some of these model systems have conditions, under which an OHC can function as an effective amplifier, overcoming the impedance mismatch. The present examination suggests that the presence of multiple modes of motion is a key to the exquisite performance of the mammalian ear.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Innovation by Polyploidy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The preferred conditions for evolutionary innovation is a fundamental question, but little is known, in part because the question involves rare events. We focused on the potential role of polyploidy in the evolution of novel traits. There are two hypotheses regarding the effects of polyploidy on evolution: Polyploidy reduces the effect of a single mutation and slows evolution. In contrast, the gene redundancy introduced by polyploidy will promote neofunctionalization and accelerate evolution. Does polyploidy speed up or slow down evolution? In this study, we proposed a simple model of polyploid cells and showed that the evolutionary rate of polyploids is similar to or much slower than that of haploids under neutral selection or during gradual evolution. However, on a fitness landscape where cells should jump over a lethal valley to increase their fitness, the probability of evolution in polyploidy could be drastically increased, and the optimal number of chromosomes was identified. We theoretically discussed the existence of this optimal chromosome number from the large deviation theory. Furthermore, we proposed that the optimization for achieving evolutionary innovation could determine the range of chromosome numbers in polyploid bacteria.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Transport Barriers with Swimming Microorganisms in Chaotic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of bacterial activity on the mixing and transport properties of a passive scalar in time-periodic flows in experiments and in a simple model. We focus on the interactions between swimming E. coli and the Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) of the flow, which are computed from experimentally measured velocity fields. Experiments show that such interactions are non-trivial and can lead to transport barriers through which the scalar flux is significantly reduced. Using the Poincar\'e map, we show that these transport barriers coincide with the outermost members of elliptic LCSs known as Lagrangian vortex boundaries. Numerical simulations further show that elliptic LCSs can repel elongated swimmers and lead to swimmer depletion within Lagrangian coherent vortices. A simple mechanism shows that such depletion is due to the preferential alignment of elongated swimmers with the tangents of elliptic LCSs. Our results provide insights into understanding the transport of microorganisms in complex flows with dynamical topological features from a Lagrangian viewpoint.</description>
