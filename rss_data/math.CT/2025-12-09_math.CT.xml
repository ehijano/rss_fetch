      <title>Symmetric weak multicategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multicategory is what remains of a monoidal category when monoidal product is not available. A weak multicategory means that hom-sets are in fact categories, and in place of usual equations, there are natural isomorphisms, which have to satisfy their own equations. A symmetric weak multicategory implies a weak multicategory with a weak (up to a cocycle) action of symmetric groups.</description>

      <title>String Diagrams for Closed Symmetric Monoidal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a graphical language for closed symmetric monoidal categories based on an extension of string diagrams with special bracket wires representing internal homs. These bracket wires make the structure of the internal hom functor explicit, allowing standard morphism wires to interact with them through a well-defined set of graphical rules.
  We establish the soundness and completeness of the diagrammatic calculus, and illustrate its expressiveness through examples drawn from category theory, logic and programming language semantics.</description>

      <title>Topological lax comma categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the interplay between properties of a topological space $X$, in particular of its natural order, and properties of the lax comma category $\mathsf{Top} \Downarrow X$, where $\mathsf{Top}$ denotes the category of topologicalspaces and continuous maps. Namely, it is shown that, whenever $X$ is a topological $\bigwedge$-semilattice, the canonical forgetful functor $\mathsf{Top} \Downarrow X \to \mathsf{Top}$ is topological, preserves and reflects exponentials, and preserves effective descent morphisms. Moreover, under additional conditions on $X$, a characterisation of effective descent morphisms is obtained.</description>

      <title>Hilbert $*$-categories: Where limits in analysis and category theory meet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17432v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces Hilbert $*$-categories: an abstraction of categories with similar algebraic and analytic properties to the categories of real, complex, and quaternionic Hilbert spaces and bounded linear maps. Other examples include categories of Hilbert W*-modules and of unitary group-representations. Hilbert $*$-categories are "analytically" complete in two ways: every bounded increasing sequence of Hermitian endomorphisms has a supremum, and every suitably bounded orthogonal family of parallel morphisms is summable. These "analytic" completeness properties are not assumed outright; rather, they are derived, respectively, from two new universal constructions: codirected $\ell^2$-limits of contractions and $\ell^2$-products. In turn, these are built from directed colimits in the wide subcategory of isometries.</description>

      <title>Dynamics, data and reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19734v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of data-driven learning of dynamical systems is to interpret time series as a continuous observation of an underlying dynamical system. This task is not well-posed for a variety of reasons - such as multiple co-existing sub-systems, topologically inter-weaving of these sub-systems; and more importantly, the non-injectivity of the correspondence between dynamical systems and time series. We show how these ambiguities are circumvented if one considers dynamical systems and measurement maps collectively. Dynamical systems, observed dynamical systems, and time series data - each of these three collections have an extensive network of relations within them, which gives them the mathematical structure of a category. One of the new concepts proposed is a rigorous definition of time series data as a chain of measurement sequences with decreasing information content. This definition subsumes the familiar notions of sequences, time series and even subshifts. Using these notions it is shown that the entire process of converting an observed dynamical systems into a time series object is functorial, and passes through a number of phases each bearing its own categorical structure. This discovery sheds new light on the nature of reconstruction algorithms. Under mild conditions of consistency, reconstruction itself is shown to be functorial operation. This provides a new category theoretic perspective on the nature and limits of reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Globular subdivisions are dihomotopy equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that any globular subdivision of multipointed $d$-spaces gives rise to a dihomotopy equivalence between the associated flows. As a straightforward application, the flows associated to two multipointed $d$-spaces related by a finite zigzag of globular subdivisions have isomorphic branching and merging homology theories and isomorphic underlying homotopy types.</description>

      <title>Branching space of multipointed d-space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the notion of short directed path, we introduce the branching space of a multipointed $d$-space. We prove that for any q-cofibrant multipointed $d$-space, it is homeomorphic to the branching space of the q-cofibrant flow obtained by applying the categorization functor. As an application, we deduce a purely topological proof of the invariance of the branching space and of the branching homology of cellular multipointed $d$-spaces up to globular subdivision. By reversing the time direction, the same results are obtained for the merging space and the merging homology.</description>

      <title>Branching space of precubical set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the notion of short natural directed path, we introduce the homotopy branching space of a precubical set. It is unique only up to homotopy equivalence. We prove that, for any precubical set, it is homotopy equivalent to the branching space of any q-realization, any m-realization and any h-realization of the precubical set as a flow. As an application, we deduce the invariance of the homotopy branching space and of the branching homology up to cubical subdivision. By reversing the time direction, the same results are obtained for the merging space and the merging homology of a precubical set.</description>
