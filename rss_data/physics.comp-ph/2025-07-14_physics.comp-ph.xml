      <title>Discontinuity-aware KAN-based physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have proved to be a promising method for the rapid solving of partial differential equations (PDEs) in both forward and inverse problems. However, due to the smoothness assumption of functions approximated by general neural networks, PINNs are prone to spectral bias and numerical instability and suffer from reduced accuracy when solving PDEs with sharp spatial transitions or fast temporal evolution. To address this limitation, a discontinuity-aware physics-informed neural network (DPINN) method is proposed. It incorporates an adaptive Fourier-feature embedding layer to mitigate spectral bias and capture sharp changes, a discontinuity-aware Kolmogorov-Arnold network for the modeling of shockwave properties, mesh transformation to accelerate loss function convergence for complex geometries, and learnable local artificial viscosity to stabilize the algorithm near discontinuities. In numerical experiments regarding the inviscid Burgers' equation and transonic and supersonic airfoil flows, DPINN demonstrated superior accuracy when calculating discontinuities compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification of a multi-component Hall thruster model at varying facility pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference is applied to calibrate and quantify prediction uncertainty in a coupled multi-component Hall thruster model at varying facility background pressures. The model, consisting of a cathode model, discharge model, and plume model, is used to simulate two thrusters across a range of background pressures in multiple vacuum test facilities. The model outputs include thruster performance metrics, one-dimensional plasma properties, and the angular distribution of the current density in the plume. The simulated thrusters include a magnetically shielded thruster, the H9, and an unshielded thruster, the SPT-100. After calibration, the model captures several key performance trends with background pressure, including changes in thrust and upstream shifts in the ion acceleration region. Furthermore, the model exhibits predictive accuracy to within 10\% when evaluated on flow rates and pressures not included in the training data, and the model can predict some performance characteristics across test facilities to within the same range. Evaluated on the same data as prior work [Eckels et al. 2024], the model reduced predictive errors in thrust and discharge current by greater than 50%. An extrapolation to on-orbit performance is performed with an error of 9\%, capturing trends in discharge current but not thrust. Possible extensions and improvements are discussed in the context of using data for predictive Hall thruster modeling across vacuum facilities.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time parametrization of neural quantum states for quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08418v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schr\"odinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state ($s$-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using simply a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the parameterization is efficient in the number of parameters and the smooth neural quantum state allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.</description>

      <title>Extending Nonlocal Kinetic Energy Density Functionals to Isolated Systems via a Density-Functional-Dependent Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wang-Teter-like nonlocal kinetic energy density functional (KEDF) in the framework of orbital-free density functional theory, while successful in some bulk systems, exhibits a critical Blanc-Cances instability [J. Chem. Phys. 122, 214106 (2005)] when applied to isolated systems, where the total energy becomes unbounded from below. We trace this instability to the use of an ill-defined average charge density, which causes the functional to simultaneously violate the scaling law and the positivity of the Pauli energy. By rigorously constructing a density-functional-dependent kernel, we resolve these pathologies while preserving the formal exactness of the original framework. By systematically benchmarking single-atom systems of 56 elements, we find the resulting KEDF retains computational efficiency while achieving an order-of-magnitude accuracy enhancement over the WT KEDF. In addition, the new KEDF preserves WT's superior accuracy in bulk metals, outperforming the semilocal functionals in both regimes.</description>

      <title>Nonconserved critical dynamics of the two-dimensional Ising model as a surface kinetic roughening process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have revisited the non-conserved (or model A) critical dynamics of the two-dimensional Ising model through numerical simulations of its lattice and continuum formulations --Glauber dynamics and the timedependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation, respectively--, to analyze them with current tools from surface kinetic roughening. Our study examines two critical quenches, one from an ordered and a different one from a disordered initial state, for both of which we assess the dynamic scaling ansatz, the critical exponent values, and the fluctuation field statistics that occur. Notably, the dynamic scaling ansatz followed by the system strongly depends on the initial condition: a critical quench from the ordered phase follows Family-Vicsek (FV) scaling, while a critical quench from the disordered phase shows an initial overgrowth regime with intrinsic anomalous roughening, followed by relaxation to equilibrium. This behavior is explained in terms of the dynamical instability of the stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation at the critical temperature, whereby the linearly unstable term is eventually stabilized by nonlinear interactions. For both quenches we have determined the occurrence of probability distribution functions for the field fluctuations, which are time-independent along the non-equilibrium dynamics when suitably normalized by the time-dependent fluctuation amplitude. Additionally, we have developed a related interface model for a field which scales as the space integral of the TDGL field (integral GL model). Numerical simulations of this model reveal either FV or faceted anomalous roughening, depending on the critical quenched performed, as well as an emergent symmetry in the fluctuation statistics for a critical quench from the ordered phase.</description>

      <title>Impacts of internal heating on temperature distribution in channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In molten-salt-fuelled reactor systems, the fluid may experience substantial volumetric heat generation in addition to heat removal from surrounding structures. To quantify these effects, we investigate developed channel flow with internal heating using a systematic multi-scale approach comprising Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), Large Eddy Simulation (LES), and a semi-analytical solver (SAS). First, DNS and LES are compared in a turbulent parallel-plate configuration at different Prandtl and Reynolds numbers, demonstrating excellent agreement in flow and thermal fields, with the SAS method showing acceptable accuracy. Building on this benchmarking, the SAS tool is then employed to explore a broad parameter space, offering insights into how internal heat deposition modifies the temperature distribution across Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. Comparisons are also drawn against the canonical wall-heating scenario, revealing that volumetric heating often remains a secondary effect in turbulent regimes but can become more pronounced at lower Reynolds numbers, higher Prandtl numbers, or when nearly all heat is deposited in the fluid. These findings establish guidelines for reduced-order modeling in liquid-fuel reactor analyses and highlight conditions under which internal heating warrants particular attention. The paper concludes by outlining ongoing and future research directions, including refinements for variable fluid properties and complex geometry extensions.</description>

Abstract: The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is a fundamental component of many quantum computing algorithms. In this paper, we present an alternative method for factoring this transformation. Inspired by this approach, we introduce a new quantum circuit for implementing the QFT. We show that this circuit is more efficient than the conventional design. Furthermore, using this circuit, we develop an alternative version of the HHL algorithm, which also demonstrates improved performance compared to the standard implementation.</description>

      <title>Vortices and backflow in hydrodynamic heat transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16580v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments have provided compelling and renewed interest in phonon hydrodynamics. At variance with ordinary diffusive heat transport, this regime is primarily governed by momentum-conserving phonon collisions. At the mesoscopic scale it can be described by the viscous heat equations (VHE), that resemble the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) in the laminar regime. Here, we show that the VHE can be separated and recast as modified biharmonic equations in the velocity potential and stream function$-$solvable analytically. These two can be merged into a complex potential defining the flow streamlines, and give rise to two distinct temperature contributions, ultimately related to thermal compressibility and vorticity. The irrotational and incompressible limits of the phonon VHE are analyzed, showing how the latter mirrors the NSE for the electron fluid. This work also extends to the electron compressible regime that arises when drift velocities can be higher than plasmonic velocities. Finally, by examining thermal flow within a 2D graphite strip device, we explore the boundary conditions and transport coefficients needed to observe thermal vortices and negative thermal resistance, or heat backflow from cooler to warmer regions. This work provides novel analytical tools to design hydrodynamic phonon flow, highlights its generalization for electron hydrodynamics, and promotes additional avenues to explore experimentally such fascinating phenomena.</description>

      <title>Beyond traditional box-covering: Determining the fractal dimension of complex networks using a fixed number of boxes of flexible diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a novel box-covering algorithm for analyzing the fractal properties of complex networks. Unlike traditional algorithms that impose a predetermined box size, our approach assigns nodes to boxes identified by their nearest local hubs without enforcing rigid distance constraints. This flexibility leads to a key methodological shift: instead of fixing the box size in advance, we first determine the number of boxes and then compute their average size. We argue that this procedure is fully consistent with the recently proposed scaling theory of fractal complex networks and closely related to the concept of hidden metric spaces in which network nodes are embedded. We demonstrate that our approach not only significantly reduces computational complexity compared to existing methods, but also (despite relaxing constraints on box diameter) covers networks using boxes of more similar sizes than, for instance, the classical greedy coloring (GC) algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze nine complex networks (three model-based and six real-world) representing a broad spectrum: from networks with confirmed fractality, through those with initially uncertain, but here confirmed, fractal properties (such as the Internet at the level of autonomous systems), to large-scale networks that have so far remained beyond the reach of existing algorithms due to their size.</description>

      <title>High-resolution simulations unravel intensification mechanisms of pyrocumulonimbus clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) firestorms -- wildfire-generated thunderstorms -- can trigger rapid fire spread. However, the multi-physics nature of pyroCb has made their core mechanisms inaccessible to direct observation and previous simulation and prediction efforts. We introduce a new simulation capability with the first high-resolution, fully coupled simulations of a pyroCb, allowing us to unravel its life cycle governed by two opposing mechanisms. We show fuel moisture is an energy sink that attenuates fire intensity rather than fueling clouds, resolving a long-standing debate. Conversely, we identify the driver of rapid intensification: the Self-Amplifying Fire-Induced Recirculation (SAFIR) mechanism, where precipitation-induced downdrafts intensify the parent fire under weak winds. This work provides a new mechanistic framework for pyroCb prediction and demonstrates a transformative computational approach for previously intractable problems in environmental science.</description>
