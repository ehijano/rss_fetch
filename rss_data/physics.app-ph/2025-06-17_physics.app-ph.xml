      <title>Variational phase-field modeling of cohesive fracture with flexibly tunable strength surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational phase-field models of brittle fracture are powerful tools for studying Griffith-type crack propagation in complex scenarios. However, as approximations of Griffith's theory-which does not incorporate a strength criterion-these models lack flexibility in prescribing material-specific strength surfaces. Consequently, they struggle to accurately capture crack nucleation under multiaxial stress conditions. In this paper, inspired by Alessi et al. (2014), we propose a variational phase-field model that approximates cohesive fracture. The model accommodates an arbitrary (convex) strength surface, independent of the regularization length scale, and allows for flexible tuning of the cohesive response. Our formulation results in sharp cohesive cracks and naturally enforces a sharp non-interpenetration condition, thereby eliminating the need for additional energy decomposition strategies. It inherently satisfies stress softening and produces "crack-like" residual stresses by construction. To ensure strain hardening, the ratio of the regularization length to the material's cohesive length must be sufficiently small; however, if crack nucleation is desired, this ratio must also be large enough to make the homogeneous damaged state unstable. We investigate the model in one and three dimensions, establishing first- and second-order stability results. The theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations using the finite element method, employing standard discretization and solution techniques.</description>

      <title>Ion Track Formation via Electric-Field-Enhanced Energy Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy ion irradiation deposits extreme energy in a narrow range (1-10 nm) along ion trajectories in solid through electronic energy loss, producing unique irradiation effects such as ion tracks. However, intrinsic velocity effects impose an upper limit on electronic energy loss that cannot be overcome by adjusting irradiation parameters. We introduce a method using electric fields during irradiation to enhance nanoscale energy deposition by accelerating ion-excited electrons within sub-picosecond timescales.Our extended thermal spike model quantitatively describes this enhancement and predicts a significant reduction in the electronic energy loss required for ion track formation in amorphous SiO2, which is in excellent agreement with experimental observations. This work provides a new approach to control energy deposition during irradiation and boosts the wide application of ion tracks in material modification and nanoengineering to much broader extents.</description>

      <title>C2PO: Coherent Co-packaged Optics using offset-QAM-16 for Beyond PAM-4 Optical I/O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co-packaged optics (CPO) has emerged as a promising solution for achieving the ultra-high bandwidths, shoreline densities, and energy efficiencies required by future GPUs and network switches for AI. Microring modulators (MRMs) are well suited for transmitters due to their compact size, high energy efficiency, and natural compatibility with dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM). However, extending beyond the recently demonstrated 200 Gb/s will require more advanced modulation formats, such as higher-order coherent modulation (e.g., QAM-16).
  In this work, we show how microring resonators (MRMs) can be efficiently used to implement phase-constant amplitude modulators and form the building blocks of a transmitter for offset QAM-16, which has been shown to simplify carrier-phase recovery relative to conventional QAM. We simulate and evaluate the performance of our proposed MRM-based coherent CPO (C2PO) transmitters using a foundry-provided commercial silicon photonics process, demonstrating an input-normalized electric field amplitude contrast of 0.64 per dimension. Through full link-level bit error rate modeling, we show that our design achieves 400 Gb/s using offset QAM-16 at a total optical laser power of 9.65 dBm-comparable to that required by conventional QAM-16 MZI-based links, despite using 10-100x less area. We further conduct a thermal simulation to assess the transmitter's thermal stability at the MRM input optical power required to meet a target BER at the desired data rates. Finally, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate 25 Gb/s MRM-based offset QAM-4 modulation with a chip fabricated in the GlobalFoundries 45 nm monolithic silicon photonics process.</description>

      <title>\beta-Ga2O3-Based Heterojunctions: Exploring Growth Orientations and Alloying Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of alloying and growth orientation on the properties of the ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor \beta-Ga2O3 and pseudomorphic AlGaO alloy heterojunctions. Band offsets are computed from first principles using density functional theory (DFT) with the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional for different Al concentrations and four growth orientations, namely (100)B, (010), (001)B, and ($\bar{2}$01). Significant variations are found and ascribed to the strained pseudomorphic alloys. The values of the band offsets are fed into technology computer-aided design (TCAD) models of Schottky barrier diodes (SBD). I-V and C-V characteristics from the TCAD models show reasonable agreement with recent experimental measurements in the forward bias region. Discrepancies in the negative bias region are expected due to the ideality of the Schottky junctions considered in this study. Our findings underscore the importance of growth orientation and strain in modelling of \beta-Ga2O3-based SBD.</description>

      <title>Prospecting for lunar Helium-3 with a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12386v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mining $^3{\rm He}$ from lunar regolith has attracted significant interest in recent years due to the scarcity of $^3{\rm He}$ on Earth and its diverse applications, from cryogenics and medical imaging, to nuclear physics and future nuclear fusion. Given the stringent technical and economic challenges of mining lunar $^3{\rm He}$, precise prospecting is essential. Here we propose a prospecting methodology based on a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer, which can detect the dipolar magnetic field of thermally polarized $^3{\rm He}$ spins. With a 200 g regolith sample and an rf-magnetometer with sensitivity $1~{\rm fT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ we can detect $^3{\rm He}$ with abundance 5 ppb within a measurement time of just 5 min. The associated apparatus is lightweight and significantly more cost-effective than alternative measurement techniques. The proposed prospecting method is readily deployable and could substantially improve the technical and economic feasibility of mining lunar $^3{\rm He}$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced Band Gap Transmission in Dispersive and Flat Band Photonic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear interactions in photonic non-dispersive (flat) bands remain largely unexplored, despite their potential to yield exotic phenomena. Here, we demonstrate nonlinearity-induced transport of light from a boundary waveguide into photonic lattices with dispersive and flat bands. For the one-dimensional lattice supporting a dispersive band, self-focusing Kerr nonlinearity effectively makes the boundary waveguide phase-matched with the lattice modes, enabling efficient energy transfer above a threshold input power. In contrast, such nonlinear transmission to the flat band modes is inhibited, as demonstrated in a rhombic lattice supporting an isolated flat band. Instead, as the nonlinearity increases, light couples periodically to the lattice edge mode and then gradually spreads into the lattice due to the excitation of the lower dispersive band.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of Activator Solutions for Geopolymer Synthesis: Thermochemical Stability, Sequencing, and Standardisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geopolymers present a sustainable alternative to conventional binders, however, their commercial viability is hindered by a lack of standardised methods for preparing stabile activator solutions; alkaline feedstocks critical to geopolymer synthesis. This study presents a combined experimental and modelling approach to evaluate the thermochemical stability, solubility constraints, and silica speciation behaviour of sodium silicate-based activators. Using quantitative 29Si NMR analysis, thermodynamic stability and three-dimensional solubility modelling, this research identifies optimal preparation conditions that minimise irreversible precipitation risks and optimises mixing periods. Key findings indicate that higher solution temperatures associated with optimised activator solution preparation were found to enhance thermochemical stability and reactivity, while cooling increased viscosity and the likelihood of unstable solution behaviour, which may necessitate discarding. The order in which feedstocks are combined directly affects whether the solution becomes unstable, with an optimal sequence of water, alkali-hydroxide, soluble silicate found to ensure greater process reliability. A predictive model and accompanying visual tools enable practitioners to assess solution viability and define stability windows by quantifying initial and final/unstable periods and temperatures based on feedstock composition and solution temperature. These results contribute to improved reproducibility and quality control in geopolymer research and represent a step toward developing standard operating procedures for activator solution synthesis.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Phonon-Induced Dephasing in Gallium Nitride Defect-Based Quantum Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GaN defect based quantum emitters have recently gained attention as promising single photon sources for quantum information applications. However, dephasing processes, manifested as photoluminescence (PL) linewidth broadening, pose a limitation to photon indistinguishability. In this study, we use a custom built confocal scanning microscope to examine the temperature dependent PL spectra of GaN defect quantum emitters integrated with solid immersion lenses, with the goal of elucidating their dephasing mechanisms. Our experimental findings show that at low temperatures, the PL lineshape exhibits a Gaussian profile with a constant, temperature independent linewidth, consistent with spectral diffusion. As the temperature increases, the PL lineshape evolves into a Lorentzian, and the temperature dependent linewidth deviates from the common T3 law. Considering the Debye temperature of GaN (about 600 K), the experimentally observed temperature dependent linewidth can be modeled by the quadratic Stark effect modulated by acoustic phonons in defect rich crystals. Furthermore, this model exhibits a level of accuracy comparable to that of the defect-E2(low) optical phonon coupling model previously reported in the literature. Our work reveals the mechanism of acoustic phonon induced dephasing in GaN defect emitters and demonstrates that both acoustic and optical phonons can contribute to their dephasing.</description>

Abstract: This work presents an approach to the inverse design of scattering systems by modifying the transmission matrix using reinforcement learning. We utilize Proximal Policy Optimization to navigate the highly non-convex landscape of the object function to achieve three types of transmission matrices: (1) Fixed-ratio power conversion and zero-transmission mode in rank-1 matrices, (2) exceptional points with degenerate eigenvalues and unidirectional mode conversion, and (3) uniform channel participation is enforced when transmission eigenvalues are degenerate.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional velocity gradient statistics in a mesoscale convection laboratory experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present three-dimensional velocity gradient statistics from Rayleigh--B\'enard convection experiments in a horizontally extended cell of aspect ratio 25, a paradigm for mesoscale convection. The Rayleigh number $Ra$ ranges from $3.7 \times 10^5$ to $4.8 \times 10^6$, and the Prandtl number $Pr$ from 5 to 7.1. Spatio-temporally resolved volumetric data are reconstructed from moderately dense Lagrangian particle tracking measurements. All nine components of the velocity gradient tensor from the experiments show good agreement with those from direct numerical simulations, both conducted at $Ra = 1 \times 10^6$ and $Pr = 6.6$. The focus of our analysis is on non-Gaussian velocity gradient statistics. Specifically, we examine the probability density functions (PDFs) of components of the velocity gradient tensor, vorticity components, kinetic energy dissipation, and local enstrophy at different heights in the bottom half of the cell. The probability of high-amplitude derivatives increases from the bulk to the bottom plate. A similar trend is observed with increasing $Ra$ at fixed height. Both indicate enhanced small-scale intermittency of the velocity field. Furthermore, doubly-logarithmic plots of the PDFs of normalized energy dissipation and local enstrophy at all heights show that the left tails follow slopes of $3/2$ and $1/2$, respectively, in agreement with numerical results. In general, the left tails of the dissipation and local enstrophy distributions show higher probability values with increasing proximity towards the plate, compared to those in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Inferring Material Parameters from Current-Voltage Curves in Organic Solar Cells via Neural-Network-Based Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for estimating material parameters in solar cells. Traditional methods for parameter extraction often rely on time-consuming numerical simulations that fail to capture the full complexity of the parameter space and discard valuable information from suboptimal simulations. In this study, we introduce a novel workflow for parameter estimation in organic solar cells based on a combination of numerical simulations and neural networks. The workflow begins with the selection of an appropriate experimental dataset, followed by the definition of a device model that accurately describes the experiment. To reduce computational complexity, the number of variable parameters is carefully selected, and reasonable ranges are set for each parameter. Instead of directly fitting the experimental data using a numerical model, a neural network was trained on a large dataset of simulated results, allowing for efficient exploration of the high-dimensional parameter space. This approach not only accelerates the parameter estimation process but also provides valuable insights into the likelihood and uncertainty of the estimated parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on organic solar cells based on the PBDB-TF-T1:BTP-4F-12 material system, demonstrating the potential of machine learning for rapid and comprehensive characterization of emerging photovoltaic materials.</description>

      <title>Sodium induced beneficial effects in wide bandgap Cu(In,Ga)S2 solar cell with 15.7% efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study underscores the pivotal role of sodium (Na) supply in optimizing the optoelectronic properties of wide bandgap (~1.6 eV) Cu(In,Ga)S2 (CIGS) thin film absorbers for high efficiency solar cells. Our findings demonstrate that the synergistic use of Na from the glass substrate, in conjunction with in-situ sodium fluoride (NaF) co-evaporation, significantly enhances the structural and optoelectronic properties of the CIGS. CIGS grown under either Na-deficient or excess conditions exhibits inferior microstructural and optoelectronic properties, whereas an optimal Na supply leads to enhanced photovoltaic performance. Optimal Na incorporation minimizes vertical gallium fluctuations and improves the grain size and crystallinity. An absolute 1 sun calibrated photoluminescence (PL) measurement reveals a substantial suppression of bulk defects and a reduction in non-radiative losses, resulting in a high quasi-fermi level splitting ({\Delta}EF) of 1.07 eV, 93 meV higher than in Na-deficient CIGS with the same bandgap. Optimal Na supply further increases excited carrier decay time, as revealed from time-resolved PL, and hole doping density. Cross-sectional hyperspectral cathodoluminescence mapping reveals that optimal Na supply significantly reduces defect density near the surface, thereby effectively translating {\Delta}EF to open-circuit voltage (VOC). As a result, a champion wide bandgap CIGS solar cell with a cadmium-free ZnSnO buffer layer achieved an impressive VOC of 971 meV and an active area power conversion efficiency of 15.7%, highlighting its potential for advancing tandem photovoltaic technologies with stable inorganic top cell.</description>

      <title>Artificial Gauge Fields and Dimensions in a Polariton Hofstadter Ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial gauge fields allow uncharged particles to mimic the behavior of charged particles subjected to magnetic fields, providing a powerful platform for exploring topological physics. Neutral particles, like photons, are typically unaffected by real magnetic fields. However, it is possible to introduce artificial gauge fields that control the effective dynamics of these neutral particles. Topological exciton-polariton lasers have attracted considerable interest, in part due to the wide range of tunable system parameters, but often require strong magnetic fields to realise propagating topological edge states. Here we show, that by using an artificial gauge field the topological Hall effect in a micron-scale micropillar chain is experimentally realised, exploiting the circular polarisation of polaritons as an artificial dimension. By careful rotational alignment of elliptical micropillars, we introduce an effective plaquette phase that induces strictly polarisation-dependent edge-state propagation, demonstrating non-reciprocal transport of the polariton pseudospins. Our results demonstrate that the dimensionality limitation of topological interface states as well as requirements for strong external magnetic fields in coupled topological laser arrays can be overcome by utilizing polarisation effects and careful engineering of the potential landscape. Our results open new ways towards the implementation of topological polariton lattices and related optically active devices with additional artificial dimension.</description>

Abstract: We present suspended heater structures fabricated in a standard C- and O-band silicon (Si) photonics platform that can achieve sufficiently high local temperatures to induce effective refractive index trimming of Si and silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides with 30 - 90 mW of applied electrical power. Following thermal trimming at moderate powers ($\leq$ 40 mW), maximum changes in the averaged waveguide effective refractive index of $-5.18 \times 10^{-3}$ and $-7.9 \times 10^{-4}$ are demonstrated in SiN and Si waveguides, respectively, at a wavelength of 1550 nm. At higher powers, SiN waveguides exhibit positive averaged effective index changes up to $\approx$0.02, demonstrating bi-directional index trimming. As an example application, we demonstrate bias point trimming of a carrier injection Mach-Zehnder switch. Through investigations of the origin of the thermal trimming effect, we hypothesize that changes in the silica (SiO$_2$) waveguide cladding may be a primary underlying mechanism at temperatures $\gtrsim$300$^{\circ}$C, with significant trimming of SiN waveguide cores occurring at larger temperatures $\gtrsim$510$^{\circ}$C. As the trimming experiments represent a form of accelerated thermal aging, we estimate the aging behavior of the suspended heaters by fitting and extrapolating the measured datasets to 100 - 200$^{\circ}$C operating temperatures over five years.</description>

      <title>Searching for topological semi-complete bandgap in elastic truss lattices</title>

Abstract: Gapless topological phases have attracted significant interest across both quantum and classical systems owing to their novel physics and promising applications. However, the search for ideal gapless topological nodes inside a clear bandgap is still lacking in elastic systems. The degenerate points are always hidden in the trivial bulk bands due to the intricate elastic modes involved. Here, we find a topological semi-complete bandgap in a three-dimensional elastic truss lattice by tuning a supporting rod, which exhibits a complete bandgap except for the inevitable topological degenerate points. Furthermore, we experimentally map the topological semi-complete bandgap and the inside nontrivial surface state arcs with a scanning laser vibrometer. The introduced scheme provides a systematic approach for the idealization of semi-complete bandgaps and thus may significantly advance the practical utility of topological phases in mechanical engineering domains.</description>

      <title>Significant role of first-principles electron-phonon coupling in the electronic and thermoelectric properties of LiZnAs and ScAgC semiconductors</title>

Abstract: The half-Heusler (hH) compounds are currently considered promising thermoelectric (TE) materials due to their favorable thermopower and electrical conductivity. Accurate estimates of these properties are therefore highly desirable and require a detailed understanding of the microscopic mechanisms that govern transport. To enable such estimations, we carry out comprehensive first-principles computations of one of the primary factors limiting carrier transport, namely the electron-phonon ($e-ph$) interaction, in representative hH semiconductors such as LiZnAs and ScAgC. Our study first investigates the $e-ph$ renormalization of electronic dispersion based on the non-adiabatic Allen-Heine-Cardona theory. We then solve the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under multiple relaxation-time approximations (RTAs) to evaluate the carrier transport properties. Phonon-limited electron and hole mobilities are comparatively assessed using the linearized self-energy and momentum RTAs (SERTA and MRTA), and the exact or iterative BTE (IBTE) solutions within $e-ph$ coupling. Electrical transport coefficients for TE performance are also comparatively analyzed under the constant RTA (CRTA), SERTA, and MRTA schemes. The lattice thermal conductivity, determined from phonon-phonon interaction, is further reduced through nanostructuring techniques. The bulk LiZnAs (ScAgC) compound achieves the highest figure of merit ($zT$) of 1.05 (0.78) at 900 K with an electron doping concentration of 10$^{18}$ (10$^{19}$) cm$^{-3}$ under the MRTA scheme. This value significantly increases to 1.53 (1.0) for a 20 nm nanostructured sample. The remarkably high $zT$ achieved through inherently present phonon-induced electron scattering and the grain-boundary effect in semiconductors opens a promising path for discovering highly efficient and accurate hH materials for TE technology.</description>

      <title>Self-referencing photothermal common-path interferometry to measure absorption of Si3N4 membranes for laser-light sails</title>

Abstract: Laser-light sails are a spacecraft concept wherein lightweight "sails" are propelled by high-intensity lasers. We investigated the near-infrared absorption of free-standing membranes of stoichiometric silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$), a candidate sail material. To resolve the small but non-zero optical loss, we used photothermal common-path interferometry (PCI), for which we developed a self-referencing modality where a PCI measurement is performed twice: once on a bare membrane, and a second time with monolayer graphene deposited on the membrane. The graphene increases the absorption of the sample by orders of magnitude, such that it can be measured by ellipsometry, without significantly affecting the thermal properties. We measured the absorption coefficient of Si$_3$N$_4$ to be (1.5-3) $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ cm$^{-1}$ at 1064 nm, making it a suitable sail material for laser intensities as high as ~10 GW/m$^2$. By comparison, silicon-rich "low stress" SiN$_x$ (x~1), with a measured absorption coefficient of approximately 8 cm$^{-1}$, is unlikely to survive such high laser intensities. Our self-referencing technique enables testing of low-loss membranes of various materials for laser sails and other applications.</description>

      <title>Continuous generation of confined bubbles: viscous effect on the gravito-capillary pinch off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate continuous generation of bubbles from a bath of air in viscous liquid in a confined geometry. In our original setup, bubbles are spontaneously generated by virtue of buoyancy and a gate placed in the cell: the gate acts like an inverted funnel trapping air beneath it before continuously generating bubbles at the tip. The dynamics is characterized by the bubble-formation period and the bubble size as a function of the amount of air under the gate. By analyzing the data obtained for various parameters, we clearly identified that the dynamics of the bubble formation is governed by dissipation in the viscous fluid beneath the trapped air balanced by a gravitational energy change due to buoyancy, after examining numerous possibilities of dissipation, which demonstrates the potential of scaling analysis even in complex cases. Furthermore, we uncover a novel type of pinch-off condition, which convincingly explains the bubble size: in the present case viscosity plays a vital role, different from the conventional mechanism of Tate, in which gravity competes with capillarity, revealing a general mechanism of pinching-off at low Reynolds number. Accordingly, the present study significantly and fundamentally advances our knowledge of generation and pinch-off of bubbles, with the results relevant for a wide variety of applications in many fields. In particular, the present study demonstrates a promising avenue in microfluidics for understanding physical principles by scaling up the system, without losing the characteristics of the flow at low Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Franck-Condon electron emission from polar semiconductor photocathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A presented analytical formulation of (optical)phonon-mediated and momentum-resonant Franck-Condon emission of photoexcited electrons from polar semiconductors is shown to be very consistent with (i) the observed emission properties of a Cesiated GaAs(001) photocathode at 808nm [J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 54, 205301 (2021)] and (ii) the measured spectral emission properties of a GaN(0001) photocathode from just below its bandgap energy to 5eV. The theoretical analysis in the parabolic band approximation predicts the form of both the quantum efficiency and mean transverse energy of photoemission as a function of the photocathode's electron affinity and the electron temperature in the vicinity of its emission face. The good agreement between theory and experimental data also suggests that sub-10nm rms surface roughness effects are not significant for polar semiconductor photocathodes.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Free-Standing Nanostructures from Bulk Diamond over Millimeter Scales for Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum devices based on optically addressable spin qubits in diamond are promising platforms for quantum technologies such as quantum sensing and communication. Nano- and microstructuring of the diamond crystal is essential to enhance device performance, yet fabrication remains challenging and often involves trade-offs in surface quality, aspect ratio, device size, and uniformity. We tackle this hurdle with an approach producing millimeter-scale, thin (down to 70 nm) and highly parallel (&lt; 0.35 nm/$\mathrm{\mu m}$}) membranes from single-crystal diamond. The membranes remain contamination-free and possess atomically smooth surfaces ($\mathrm{R_q}$ &lt; 200 pm) as required by state-of-the-art quantum applications. We demonstrate the benefits and versatility of our method by fabricating large fields of free-standing and homogeneous photonic nano- and microstructures. Leveraging a refined photolithography-based strategy, our method offers enhanced scalability and produces robust structures suitable for direct use, while remaining compatible with heterogeneous integration through pick-and-place transfer techniques.</description>
