      <title>Tellegen responses in metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tellegen medium has long been a topic of debate, with its existence being contested over several decades. It was first proposed by Tellegen in 1948 and is characterized by a real-valued cross coupling between electric and magnetic responses, distinguishing it from the well-known chiral medium that has imaginary coupling coefficients. Significantly, Tellegen responses are closely linked to axion dynamics, an extensively studied subject in condensed matter physics. Here, we report the realization of Tellegen metamaterials in the microwave region through a judicious combination of subwavelength metallic resonators, gyromagnetic materials, and permanent magnet discs. We observe the key signature of the Tellegen response, i.e. a Kerr rotation for reflected wave, while the polarization remains the same in the transmission direction. The retrieved effective Tellegen parameter is several orders of magnitude greater than that of natural materials. Our work opens door to a variety of nonreciprocal photonic devices and may provide a platform for studying axion physics.</description>

      <title>Non-Weyl Behavior Induced by Superradiance: A Microwave Graph Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study experimentally the manifestation of non-Weyl graph behavior in open systems using microwave networks. For this a coupling variation to the network is necessary, which was out of reach till now. The coupling to the environment is changed by indirectly varying the boundary condition at the coupling vertex from Dirichlet to Neumann using a dangling bond with variable length attached the coupling vertex. A transformation of equal length spectra to equal reflection phase spectra of the dangling bond allows to create spectra with different fixed coupling strength. This allows to follow the resonances in the complex plane as a function of the coupling. While going from closed (Dirichlet) to fully open (Neumann) graph we see resonances escaping via a superradiant transition leading to non-Weyl behavior if the coupling to the outside is balanced. The open tetrahedral graph displays a rich parametric dynamic of the resonances in the complex plane presenting loops, regions of connected resonances and resonances approaching infinite imaginary parts.</description>

      <title>A variational model of charged drops in dielectrically matched binary fluids: the effect of charge discreteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the ill-posedness of the classical Rayleigh variational model of conducting charged liquid drops by incorporating the discreteness of the elementary charges. Introducing the model that describes two immiscible fluids with the same dielectric constant, with a drop of one fluid containing a fixed number of elementary charges together with their solvation spheres, we interpret the equilibrium shape of the drop as a global minimizer of the sum of its surface energy and the electrostatic repulsive energy between the charges under fixed drop volume. For all model parameters, we establish existence of generalized minimizers that consist of at most a finite number of components ``at infinity''. We also give several existence and non-existence results for classical minimizers consisting of only a single component. In particular, we identify an asymptotically sharp threshold for the number of charges to yield existence of minimizers in a regime corresponding to macroscopically large drops containing a large number of charges. The obtained non-trivial threshold is significantly below the corresponding threshold for the Rayleigh model, consistently with the ill-posedness of the latter and demonstrating a particular regularizing effect of the charge discreteness. However, when a minimizer does exist in this regime, it approaches a ball with the charge uniformly distributed on the surface as the number of charges goes to infinity, just as in the Rayleigh model. Finally, we provide an explicit solution for the problem with two charges and a macroscopically large drop.</description>
