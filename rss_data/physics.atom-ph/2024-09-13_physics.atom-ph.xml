      <title>Large inverse Faraday effect for Rydberg states of free atoms and isolated donors in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the induction of magnetization in Rydberg systems by means of the inverse Faraday effect, and propose the appearance of the effect in two such systems, Rydberg atoms proper and shallow dopants in semiconductors. Rydberg atoms are characterized by a large orbital radius. This large radius gives such excited states a large angular moment, which when driven with circularly polarized light, translates to a large effective magnetic field. We calculate this effect to generate effective magnetic fields of $O(10\,\text{mT})\times\left( \frac{\omega}{1\,\text{THz}} \right)^{-1} \left( \frac{I}{10\,{W\,cm}^{-2}} \right)$ in Rydberg states of Rb and Cs for a $1\,\text{THz}$ beam of intensity $10\,\text{W}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$. The magnitude of the effective magnetic field scales with the principal quantum number as $n^4$. Additionally, THz spectroscopy of phosphorus doped silicon reveals a large cross-section for excitation of shallow dopants to Rydberg-like states, which even for small $n$ can be driven similarly with circularly polarized light to produce even larger magnetization, with ${B}_{\text{eff}}$ which we estimate as $O(1\,\text{mT})$ for Si:P with the same beam parameters.</description>

      <title>QED Corrections in Unstable Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-energy and vacuum polarization effects in quantum electrodynamics (QED) are calculated for the supercritical Coulomb field, where Dirac energy levels become embedded in the negative-energy continuum. In this regime, the quantum vacuum becomes unstable, resulting in spontaneous electron-positron pair creation. By calculating the imaginary part of the QED correction, we gain access to an unexplored channel of vacuum instability: radiative spontaneous pair creation. Our results show that this radiative channel is greatly enhanced in the vicinity of the threshold of the supercritical regime, providing evidence for nonperturbative effects with respect to the fine-structure constant $\alpha$. We therefore conjecture that the total probability of spontaneous pair creation could differ significantly from the predictions of Dirac theory, especially near the supercritical threshold.</description>

      <title>Acoustic higher-order topological insulator from momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries, stemming from the projective algebra of synthetic gauge fields, can modify the manifold of the Brillouin zone and lead to a variety of topological phenomena. We present an acoustic realization of higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) protected by a pair of anticommutative momentum-space glide reflections. We confirm the presence of momentum-space glide reflection from the measured momentum half translation of edge bands and their momentum-resolved probability distribution using a cylinder geometry made of acoustic resonator arrays. In particular, we observe both intrinsic and extrinsic HOTI features in such a cylinder: hopping strength variation along the open boundary leads to a bulk gap closure, while that along the closed boundary results in an edge gap closure. In addition, we confirm the presence of quadrupole corner modes with transmission and field distribution measurements. Our observation enriches the study of topological physics of momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries.</description>

      <title>Radii of Mirror Nuclei and Isobaric Triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a review of absolute root-mean-square charge radii of stable nuclei up to $Z=32$, which includes a previously overlooked uncertainty in the combined analysis of muonic x-ray and electron scattering experiments. From these \textit{reference radii} and isotope shift measurements, we obtain those of 12 mirror pairs with a traceable and realistic uncertainty budget. The difference in radii between mirror nuclei is found to be proportional to the isospin asymmetry, confirming recent calculations by Novario \emph{et al.} [PRL~130, 032501]. From the fitted proportionality constant and its uncertainty, the radii of 73 previously unknown mirror partners are predicted. These are useful e.g. for benchmarking atomic and nuclear theory, calibrating entire chains, and as an input to nuclear beta-decay calculations. The radii of $(T=1,T_z=0)$ nuclei are interpolated assuming negligible isospin symmetry breaking. This completes a model-independent, high-precision extraction of the charge and weak radii of all nuclei involved in the testing of the unitarity of the CKM matrix.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetry breaking of superradiance in a dipolar BEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the extensive study of matter-wave superradiance in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) using its unique coherence property, the controllability of superradiant process has remained limited in the previous studies exploiting a phase-coherent condensate with isotropic contact interactions. Here, we combine tunable s-wave scattering with dipolar interactions in a BEC of $^{168}$Er atoms wherein the asymmetry and threshold of superradiance are independently controlled. By changing the s-wave scattering length near the Feshbach resonance, we tune the superradiance threshold with increasing phase fluctuations. In contrast to collective light scattering from a condensate only with contact interactions, we observe an asymmetric superradiant peak in a dipolar BEC by changing the direction of external magnetic field. This results from the anisotropic excitation spectrum induced by the dipole-dipole interaction. Our observation is expected to bring forth unprecedented application of matter-wave optics leading to controlled emission of matter wave.</description>
