      <title>On the signature of an image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, the importance of the 1D signature which can be seen as a functional defined along a path, has been pivotal in both path-wise stochastic calculus and the analysis of time series data. By considering an image as a two-parameter function that takes values in a $d$-dimensional space, we introduce an extension of the path signature to images. We address numerous challenges associated with this extension and demonstrate that the 2D signature satisfies a version of Chen's relation in addition to a shuffle-type product. Furthermore, we show that specific variations of the 2D signature can be recursively defined, thereby satisfying an integral-type equation. We analyze the properties of the proposed signature, such as continuity, invariance to stretching, translation and rotation of the underlying image. Additionally, we establish that the proposed 2D signature over an image satisfies a universal approximation property.</description>

      <title>Kernel Smoothing Operators on Thick Open Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the notion of a thick open set $\Omega$ in a Euclidean space and show that a local Hardy-Littlewood inequality holds in $L^p(\Omega)$, $p \in (1, \infty]$. We then establish pointwise and $L^p(\Omega)$ convergence for families of convolution operators with a Markov normalization on $\Omega$. We demonstrate application of such smoothing operators to piecewise-continuous density, velocity, and stress fields from discrete element models of sea ice dynamics.</description>

      <title>Theory on linear L-fractional differential equations and a new Mittag-Leffler-type function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory on linear L-fractional differential equations. The L-fractional derivative ${}^L\! D^\alpha$ is defined as a certain normalization of the well-known Caputo derivative ${}^C\! D^\alpha$, so that alternative properties hold: smoothness and finite slope at the origin for the solution, velocity units for the vector field, and differential form associated to the system. For L-fractional order $0&lt;\alpha\leq 1$, we prove a fundamental theorem of calculus. We deal with linear systems of autonomous homogeneous part, ${}^L\! D^\alpha x(t)=\mathcal{A}x(t)+\vartheta(t)$, which correspond to Caputo linear equations of non-autonomous homogeneous part, of the form ${}^C\! D^\alpha x(t)=t^{1-\alpha} Ax(t)+b(t)$. The associated L-fractional integral operator, which is closely related to the beta function and the beta probability distribution, and the estimates for its norm in the Banach space of continuous functions play a key role in the development. The explicit solution $x$ is built by means of Picard's iterations, from a new Mittag-Leffler-type function that mimics the standard exponential function. Closed-form solutions $x$ are given for some concrete cases, namely when $\vartheta$ is given by fractional powers or ordinary power series. In a second part of the paper, we address autonomous linear equations of sequential type, $({}^L\! D^\alpha-\lambda_1)^{n_1}\circ \cdots \circ ({}^L\! D^\alpha-\lambda_r)^{n_r}x(t)=0$. We start with sequential order two and then move to arbitrary order, by dealing with power series. The classical theory on linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients is generalized, and we establish an analogue of the method of undetermined coefficients. The last part of the paper is concerned with sequential linear equations of analytic coefficients and order two, ${}^L\! D^{2\circ \alpha}x(t)+p(t)\cdot {}^L\! D^\alpha x(t)+q(t)x(t)=c(t)$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Carleson Embeddings of M{\"u}ntz Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes Carleson embeddings of M{\"u}ntz spaces $M^q_{\Lambda}$ into weighted Lebesgue spaces $L^p(\mathrm{d}\mu)$, where $\mu$ is a Borel regular measure on $[0,1]$ satisfying $\mu([1-\varepsilon])\lesssim \varepsilon^{\beta}$. In the case $\beta \geqslant 1$ we show that such measures are exactly the ones for which Carleson embeddings $L^{\frac{p}{\beta}} \hookrightarrow L^p(\mathrm{d}\mu)$ hold. The case $\beta \in (0,1)$ is more intricate but we characterize such measures $\mu$ in terms of a summability condition on their moments. Our proof relies on a generalization of $L^p$ estimates {\`a} la Gurariy-Macaev in the weighted $L^p$ spaces setting, which we think can be of interest in other contexts.</description>

      <title>Haar wavelet characterization of dyadic Lipschitz regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition on the Haar coefficients of a real function $f$ defined on $\mathbb{R}^+$ for the Lipschitz $\alpha$ regularity of $f$ with respect to the ultrametric $\delta(x,y)=\inf \{|I|: x, y\in I; I\in\mathcal{D}\}$, where $\mathcal{D}$ is the family of all dyadic intervals in $\mathbb{R}^+$ and $\alpha$ is positive. Precisely, $f\in \textrm{Lip}_\delta(\alpha)$ if and only if $\left\vert\left&lt;f,h^j_k\right&gt;\right\vert\leq C 2^{-(\alpha + \tfrac{1}{2})j}$, for some constant $C$, every $j\in\mathbb{Z}$ and every $k=0,1,2,\ldots$ Here, as usual $h^j_k(x)= 2^{j/2}h(2^jx-k)$ and $h(x)=\mathcal{X}_{[0,1/2)}(x)-\mathcal{X}_{[1/2,1)}(x)$.</description>

      <title>The P\'olya-Tchebotarev problem with semiclassical external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical P\'olya-Tchebotarev problem, commonly stated as a max-min logarithmic energy problem, asks for finding a compact of minimal capacity in the complex plane which connects a prescribed collection of fixed points. Variants of this problem have found ramifications and applications in the theory of non-hermitian orthogonal polynomials, random matrices, approximation theory, among others. Here we consider an extension of this classical problem, including a semiclassical external field, and enforcing finitely many prescribed collections of points to be connected, possibly also to infinity. Our method is based on Rakhmanov's approach to max-min problems in logarithmic potential theory, utilizes the developed machinery by Mart\'inez-Finkelshtein and Rakhmanov on critical measures, and extends the development of Kuijlaars and the second named author from the context of polynomial external fields to the semiclassical case considered here.</description>

      <title>Quadratic functions as solutions of polynomial equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The so-called polynomial equations play an important role both in algebra and in the theory of functional equations. If the unknown functions in the equation are additive, relatively many results are known. However, even in this case, there are a lot of open questions. In some specific cases, according to classical results, the unknown additive functions are homomorphisms, derivations, or linear combinations of these. The question arises as to whether the solutions can be described even if the unknown functions are not assumed to be additive but to be generalized monomials. As a starting point, we will deal with quadratic functions in this paper. We aim to show that quadratic functions that are solutions to certain polynomial equations necessarily have a `special' form. Further, we also present a method to determine these special forms.</description>

      <title>Two weight L^{p} inequalities for fractional vector Riesz transforms and doubling measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01920v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If T is a fractional vector Riesz transform, 1&lt;p&lt;infinity, and sigma and omega are doubling measures, then the two weight L^{p} norm inequality holds if and only if the quadratic triple testing conditions of Hyt\"onen and Vuorinen hold. We also show that these quadratic triple testing conditions can be relaxed to quadratic local testing conditions, quadratic offset Muckenhoupt conditions, and a quadratic weak boundedness property.</description>
