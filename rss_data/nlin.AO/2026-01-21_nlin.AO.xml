      <title>Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS): A Unified Spectral Topology Framework for Stability in Turbulence, AI, and Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex dynamical systems frequently encounter a recurrent structural instability: the collapse of the spectral gap, driving the system toward a low-dimensional "Zero-Mode Attractor" (e.g., spectral pile-up or over-smoothing). Building upon recent global well-posedness estimates [Hou, arXiv:2601.00638], this work generalizes the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information System (MNCIS) framework. We postulate that global stability requires an active topological operator -- Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) -- functioning as a state-dependent high-pass filter that penalizes entropy accumulation at spectral boundaries. We validate this unified framework via three implementations:(1) Hydrodynamics: In 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence ($N=256^3$), ASNC acts as a global-enstrophy adaptive sub-grid scale (SGS) model, stabilizing the inviscid limit and preserving the Kolmogorov $-5/3$ inertial range without artificial hyper-viscosity.(2) Artificial Intelligence: Addressing Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we implement ASNC as a parameter-free topological constraint. Unlike baselines (e.g., DeepGCNs) relying on dense residual connections to bypass signal decay, our framework enables the training of ultra-deep 64-layer networks without residual connections, maintaining perfectly stationary feature variance ($\sigma^2 \equiv 1.0$) on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark. (3) Biological Physics: In reaction-diffusion morphogenesis, it stabilizes Turing patterns against diffusive washout in high-entropy regimes. Our results suggest that the MNCIS framework provides a base-independent topological condition for distinguishing viable complex systems from those collapsing into thermal equilibrium, bridging physical stability and information persistence.</description>

      <title>Flapping strategies for flying formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long arrays of identical, self-propelling flapping flyers are inherently unstable and thus unlikely to exist without active control mechanisms. One approach to enable long in-line formations is to enforce a constant separation between the group members. The objective then becomes to determine the flapping strategies the flyers should adopt to achieve a certain separation. Using an aerodynamic model of vortex wake production and inter-flyer effects, we explore different flapping strategies for followers given the motion of the leader. The choice of tactic is dependent upon the aerodynamic, kinematic, and physical parameters of the system, and reflects an interplay between efficiency and stability. We find that whether a flyer flaps in or out of phase with its upstream neighbour, together with the target separation, strongly affect the flapping amplitude and, therefore, the energetic cost of group flight. In certain regimes, group flight is energetically favourable compared to isolated flight, while in others, flying in formation becomes less efficient. We also identify "goldilocks zones", ranges of separation in which one of the in- or out-of-phase motions can be simultaneously energetically efficient and dynamically stable. Outside these regions, energetically favourable flight is unstable and therefore unlikely to occur.</description>

      <title>Modelling viable supply networks with cooperative adaptive financing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a financial liquidity policy sharing method for firm-to-firm supply networks, introducing a scalable autonomous control function for viable complex adaptive supply networks. Cooperation and competition in supply chains is reconciled through overlapping collaborative sets, making firms interdependent and enabling distributed risk governance. How cooperative range - visibility - affects viability is studied using dynamic complex adaptive systems modelling. We find that viability needs cooperation; visibility and viability grow together in scale-free supply networks; and distributed control, where firms only have limited partner information, outperforms centralised control. This suggests that policy toward network viability should implement distributed supply chain financial governance, supporting interfirm collaboration, to enable autonomous control.</description>

      <title>Memory-induced long-range order drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that memory, in the form of slow degrees of freedom, can induce a phase of long-range order (LRO) in locally-coupled fast degrees of freedom, producing power-law distributions of avalanches. In fact, such memory-induced LRO (MILRO) arises in a wide range of physical systems. Here, we show that MILRO can be transferred to coupled systems that have no memory of their own. As an example, we consider a stack of layers of spins with local feedforward couplings: only the first layer contains memory, while downstream layers are memory-free and locally interacting. Analytical arguments and simulations reveal that MILRO can indeed drag across the layers, enabling downstream layers to sustain intra-layer LRO despite having neither memory nor long-range interactions. This establishes a simple, yet generic mechanism for propagating collective activity through media without fine tuning to criticality, with testable implications for neuromorphic systems and laminar information flow in the brain cortex.</description>
