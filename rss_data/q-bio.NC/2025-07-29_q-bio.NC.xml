      <title>External light schedules can induce nighttime sleep disruptions in a Homeostat-Circadian-Light Model for sleep in young children</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep disturbances, particularly nighttime waking, are highly prevalent in young children and can significantly disrupt not only the child's well-being but also family functioning. Behavioral and environmental strategies, including the regulation of light exposure, are typically recommended treatments for nighttime waking. Using the Homeostatic-Circadian-Light (HCL) mathematical model for sleep timing based on the interaction of the circadian rhythm, the homeostatic sleep drive and external light, we analyze how external light schedules can influence the occurrence of nighttime waking in young children. We fit the model to data for sleep homeostasis and sleep behavior in 2 - 3.5 year olds and identified subsets of parameter ranges that fit the data but indicated a susceptibility to nighttime waking. This suggests that as children develop they may exhibit more or less propensity to awaken during the night. Notably, parameter sets exhibiting earlier sleep timing were more susceptible to nighttime waking. For a model parameter set susceptible to, but not exhibiting, nighttime waking, we analyze how external light schedules affect sleep patterns. We find that low daytime light levels can induce nighttime sleep disruptions and extended bright-light exposure also promotes nighttime waking. Further results suggest that consistent daily routines are essential; irregular schedules, particularly during weekends, markedly worsen the consolidation of nighttime sleep. Specifically, weekend delays in morning lights-on and evening lights-off times result in nighttime sleep disruptions and can influence sleep timing during the week. These results highlight how external light, daily rhythms, and parenting routines interact to shape childrens' sleep health, providing a useful framework for improving sleep management practices.</description>

      <title>Attractive and Repulsive Perceptual Biases Naturally Emerge in Generative Adversarial Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human perceptual estimates exhibit a striking reversal in bias depending on uncertainty: they shift toward prior expectations under high sensory uncertainty, but away from them when internal noise is dominant. While Bayesian inference combined with efficient coding can explain this dual bias, existing models rely on handcrafted priors or fixed encoders, offering no account of how such representations and inferences could emerge through learning. We introduce a Generative Adversarial Inference (GAI) network that simultaneously learns sensory representations and inference strategies directly from data, without assuming explicit likelihoods or priors. Through joint reconstruction and adversarial training, the model learns a representation that approximates an efficient code consistent with information-theoretic predictions. Trained on Gabor stimuli with varying signal-to-noise ratios, GAI spontaneously reproduces the full transition from prior attraction to repulsion, and recovers the Fisher information profile predicted by efficient coding theory. It also captures the characteristic bias reversal observed in human perception more robustly than supervised or variational alternatives. These results show that a single adversarially trained network can jointly acquire an efficient sensory code and support Bayesian-consistent behavior, providing a neurally plausible, end-to-end account of perceptual bias that unifies normative theory and deep learning.</description>

      <title>Signed Higher-Order Interactions for Brain Disorder Diagnosis via Multi-Channel Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately characterizing higher-order interactions of brain regions and extracting interpretable organizational patterns from Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data is crucial for brain disease diagnosis. Current graph-based deep learning models primarily focus on pairwise or triadic patterns while neglecting signed higher-order interactions, limiting comprehensive understanding of brain-wide communication. We propose HOI-Brain, a novel computational framework leveraging signed higher-order interactions and organizational patterns in fMRI data for brain disease diagnosis. First, we introduce a co-fluctuation measure based on Multiplication of Temporal Derivatives to detect higher-order interactions with temporal resolution. We then distinguish positive and negative synergistic interactions, encoding them in signed weighted simplicial complexes to reveal brain communication insights. Using Persistent Homology theory, we apply two filtration processes to these complexes to extract signed higher-dimensional neural organizations spatiotemporally. Finally, we propose a multi-channel brain Transformer to integrate heterogeneous topological features. Experiments on Alzheimer' s disease, Parkinson' s syndrome, and autism spectrum disorder datasets demonstrate our framework' s superiority, effectiveness, and interpretability. The identified key brain regions and higher-order patterns align with neuroscience literature, providing meaningful biological insights.</description>

      <title>Comparing and Scaling fMRI Features for Brain-Behavior Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting behavioral variables from neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to allow the development of neuroimaging biomarkers of mental and neurological disorders. A crucial processing step to this aim is the extraction of suitable features. These can differ in how well they predict the target of interest, and how this prediction scales with sample size and scan time. Here, we compare nine feature subtypes extracted from resting-state functional MRI recordings for behavior prediction, ranging from regional measures of functional activity to functional connectivity (FC) and metrics derived with graph signal processing (GSP), a principled approach for the extraction of structure-informed functional features. We study 979 subjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset, predicting summary scores for mental health, cognition, processing speed, and substance use, as well as age and sex. The scaling properties of the features are investigated for different combinations of sample size and scan time. FC comes out as the best feature for predicting cognition, age, and sex. Graph power spectral density is the second best for predicting cognition and age, while for sex, variability-based features show potential as well. When predicting sex, the low-pass graph filtered coupled FC slightly outperforms the simple FC variant. None of the other targets were predicted significantly. The scaling results point to higher performance reserves for the better-performing features. They also indicate that it is important to balance sample size and scan time when acquiring data for prediction studies. The results confirm FC as a robust feature for behavior prediction, but also show the potential of GSP and variability-based measures. We discuss the implications for future prediction studies in terms of strategies for acquisition and sample composition.</description>

      <title>Predicting Brain Responses To Natural Movies With Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MedARC's team solution to the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Our pipeline leveraged rich multimodal representations from various state-of-the-art pretrained models across video (V-JEPA2), speech (Whisper), text (Llama 3.2), vision-text (InternVL3), and vision-text-audio (Qwen2.5-Omni). These features extracted from the models were linearly projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to the fMRI time series, and finally mapped to cortical parcels through a lightweight encoder comprising a shared group head plus subject-specific residual heads. We trained hundreds of model variants across hyperparameter settings, validated them on held-out movies and assembled ensembles targeted to each parcel in each subject. Our final submission achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test split of withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing our team in fourth place for the competition. We further discuss a last-minute optimization that would have raised us to second place. Our results highlight how combining features from models trained in different modalities, using a simple architecture consisting of shared-subject and single-subject components, and conducting comprehensive model selection and ensembling improves generalization of encoding models to novel movie stimuli.

      <title>NeuroCLIP: A Multimodal Contrastive Learning Method for rTMS-treated Methamphetamine Addiction Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methamphetamine dependence poses a significant global health challenge, yet its assessment and the evaluation of treatments like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequently depend on subjective self-reports, which may introduce uncertainties. While objective neuroimaging modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offer alternatives, their individual limitations and the reliance on conventional, often hand-crafted, feature extraction can compromise the reliability of derived biomarkers. To overcome these limitations, we propose NeuroCLIP, a novel deep learning framework integrating simultaneously recorded EEG and fNIRS data through a progressive learning strategy. This approach offers a robust and trustworthy biomarker for methamphetamine addiction. Validation experiments show that NeuroCLIP significantly improves discriminative capabilities among the methamphetamine-dependent individuals and healthy controls compared to models using either EEG or only fNIRS alone. Furthermore, the proposed framework facilitates objective, brain-based evaluation of rTMS treatment efficacy, demonstrating measurable shifts in neural patterns towards healthy control profiles after treatment. Critically, we establish the trustworthiness of the multimodal data-driven biomarker by showing its strong correlation with psychometrically validated craving scores. These findings suggest that biomarker derived from EEG-fNIRS data via NeuroCLIP offers enhanced robustness and reliability over single-modality approaches, providing a valuable tool for addiction neuroscience research and potentially improving clinical assessments.</description>

      <title>Predicting Cognition from fMRI:A Comparative Study of Graph, Transformer, and Kernel Models Across Task and Rest Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting cognition from neuroimaging data in healthy individuals offers insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, with potential applications in precision medicine and early detection of neurological and psychiatric conditions. This study systematically benchmarked classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN)) for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset.
  Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data.
  This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.</description>

      <title>Advantageous and disadvantageous inequality aversion can be taught through vicarious learning of others' preferences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While enforcing egalitarian social norms is critical for human society, punishing social norm violators often incurs a cost to the self. This cost looms even larger when one can benefit from an unequal distribution of resources (i.e. advantageous inequity), as in receiving a higher salary than a colleague with the identical role. In the Ultimatum Game, a classic test bed for fairness norm enforcement, individuals rarely reject (punish) such unequal proposed divisions of resources because doing so entails a sacrifice of one's own benefit. Recent work has demonstrated that observing another's punitive responses to unfairness can efficiently alter the punitive preferences of an observer. It remains an open question, however, whether such contagion is powerful enough to impart advantageous inequity aversion to individuals. Using a variant of the Ultimatum Game in which participants are tasked with responding to fairness violations on behalf of another 'Teacher' - whose aversion to advantageous (versus disadvantageous) inequity was systematically manipulated-we probe whether individuals subsequently increase their punishment unfair after experiencing fairness violations on their own behalf. In two experiments, we found individuals can acquire aversion to advantageous inequity 'vicariously' through observing (and implementing) the Teacher's preferences. Computationally, these learning effects were best characterized by a model which learns the latent structure of the Teacher's preferences, rather than a simple Reinforcement Learning account. In summary, our study is the first to demonstrate that people can swiftly and readily acquire another's preferences for advantageous inequity, suggesting in turn that behavioral contagion may be one promising mechanism through which social norm enforcement - which people rarely implement in the case of advantageous inequality - can be enhanced.</description>

      <title>Functional Architecture of the Human Hypothalamus: Cortical Coupling and Subregional Organization Using 7-Tesla fMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hypothalamus plays an important role in the regulation of the bodys metabolic state and behaviors related to survival. Despite its importance however, many questions exist regarding the intrinsic and extrinsic connections of the hypothalamus in humans, especially its relationship with the cortex. As a heterogeneous structure, it is possible that the hypothalamus is composed of different subregions, which have their own distinct relationships with the cortex. Previous work on functional connectivity in the human hypothalamus have either treated it as a unitary structure or relied on methodological approaches that are limited in modeling its intrinsic functional architecture. Here, we used resting state data from ultrahigh field 7 Tesla fMRI and a data driven analytical approach to identify functional subregions of the human hypothalamus. Our approach identified four functional hypothalamic subregions based on intrinsic functional connectivity, which in turn showed distinct patterns of functional connectivity with cortex. Overall, all hypothalamic subregions showed stronger connectivity with a cortical network, Cortical Network 1 composed primarily of frontal, midline, and limbic cortical areas and weaker connectivity with a second cortical network composed largely of posterior sensorimotor regions, Cortical Network 2. Of the hypothalamic subregions, the anterior hypothalamus showed the strongest connection to Cortical Network 1, while a more ventral subregion containing the anterior hypothalamus extending to the tuberal region showed the weakest connectivity. The findings support the use of ultrahigh field, high resolution imaging in providing a more incisive investigation of the human hypothalamus that respects its complex internal structure and extrinsic functional architecture.</description>

      <title>Practitioner forecasts of technological progress in biostasis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biostasis has the potential to extend human lives by offering a bridge to powerful life extension technologies that may be developed in the future. However, key questions in the field remain unresolved, including which biomarkers reliably indicate successful preservation, what technical obstacles pose the greatest barriers, and whether different proposed revival methods are theoretically feasible. To address these gaps, we conducted a collaborative forecasting exercise with 22 practitioners in biostasis, including individuals with expertise in neuroscience, cryobiology, and clinical care. Our results reveal substantial consensus in some areas, for example that synaptic connectivity can serve as a reliable surrogate biomarker for information preservation quality. Practitioners identified three most likely failure modes in contemporary biostasis: inadequate preservation quality even under ideal conditions, geographic barriers preventing timely preservation, and poor procedural execution. Regarding revival strategies, most respondents believe that provably reversible cryopreservation of whole mammalian organisms is most likely decades away, with provably reversible human cryopreservation expected even later, if it is ever achieved. Among revival strategies from contemporary preservation methods, whole brain emulation was considered the most likely to be developed first, though respondents were divided on the metaphysical question of whether it could constitute genuine revival. Molecular nanotechnology was viewed as nearly as likely to be technically feasible, and compatible with both pure cryopreservation and aldehyde-based methods. Taken together, these findings delineate current barriers to high-quality preservation, identify future research priorities, and provide baseline estimates for key areas of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>GASPnet: Global Agreement to Synchronize Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Transformer architectures have revolutionized most fields of artificial intelligence, relying on an attentional mechanism based on the agreement between keys and queries to select and route information in the network. In previous work, we introduced a novel, brain-inspired architecture that leverages a similar implementation to achieve a global 'routing by agreement' mechanism. Such a system modulates the network's activity by matching each neuron's key with a single global query, pooled across the entire network. Acting as a global attentional system, this mechanism improves noise robustness over baseline levels but is insufficient for multi-classification tasks. Here, we improve on this work by proposing a novel mechanism that combines aspects of the Transformer attentional operations with a compelling neuroscience theory, namely, binding by synchrony. This theory proposes that the brain binds together features by synchronizing the temporal activity of neurons encoding those features. This allows the binding of features from the same object while efficiently disentangling those from distinct objects. We drew inspiration from this theory and incorporated angular phases into all layers of a convolutional network. After achieving phase alignment via Kuramoto dynamics, we use this approach to enhance operations between neurons with similar phases and suppresses those with opposite phases. We test the benefits of this mechanism on two datasets: one composed of pairs of digits and one composed of a combination of an MNIST item superimposed on a CIFAR-10 image. Our results reveal better accuracy than CNN networks, proving more robust to noise and with better generalization abilities. Overall, we propose a novel mechanism that addresses the visual binding problem in neural networks by leveraging the synergy between neuroscience and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Technological folie \`a deux: Feedback Loops Between AI Chatbots and Mental Illness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence chatbots have achieved unprecedented adoption, with millions now using these systems for emotional support and companionship in contexts of widespread social isolation and capacity-constrained mental health services. While some users report psychological benefits, concerning edge cases are emerging, including reports of suicide, violence, and delusional thinking linked to perceived emotional relationships with chatbots. To understand this new risk profile we need to consider the interaction between human cognitive and emotional biases, and chatbot behavioural tendencies such as agreeableness (sycophancy) and adaptability (in-context learning). We argue that individuals with mental health conditions face increased risks of chatbot-induced belief destabilization and dependence, owing to altered belief-updating, impaired reality-testing, and social isolation. Current AI safety measures are inadequate to address these interaction-based risks. To address this emerging public health concern, we need coordinated action across clinical practice, AI development, and regulatory frameworks.</description>
