      <title>Raman tensor for two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a valuable characterization tool for two dimensional (2D) materials. Although some of these materials are topological, the Raman signatures of electronic band topology have remained largely unexplored. On a theoretical study of 2D massive Dirac fermions, we report a selection rule and a peculiar phase difference between the Raman tensor elements, which are sensitive to the sign of the Dirac mass. We discuss on the applicability of our results to Chern insulators and to magnetized monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>A new class of higher-order topological insulators that localize energy at arbitrary multiple sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\mathbb{Z}$-classified topological phases lead to larger-than-unity topological states. However, these multiple topological states are only localized at the corners in nonlocal systems. Here, first, we rigorously prove that the multiple topological states of nonlocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains can be inherited and realized by local aperiodic chains with only the nearest couplings. Then, we report a new class of higher-order topological insulators constructed with the local aperiodic chains, which can have any integer number of 0D topological states localized at arbitrary positions in the whole domain of the insulators, including within the bulk. The 0D topological states are protected by the local topological marker in each direction, instead of the bulk multipole chiral numbers in the existing work. Our work provides multiple combinations of localized corner-bulk topological states, which enables programmable lasers and sasers by selecting the excitation sites without altering the structure, and thus opens a new avenue to signal enhancement for computing and sensing.</description>

      <title>Instability of the engineered dark state in two-band fermions under number-conserving dissipative dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlated quantum many-body states can be created and controlled by the dissipative protocols. Among these, particle number-conserving protocols are particularly appealing due to their ability to stabilize topologically nontrivial phases. Is there any fundamental limitation to their performance? We address this question by examining a general class of models involving a two-band fermion system subjected to dissipation designed to transfer fermions from the upper band to the lower band. By construction, these models have a guaranteed steady state -- a dark state -- with a completely filled lower band and an empty upper band. In the limit of weak dissipation, we derive equations governing the dynamics of the fermion densities over long length and time scales. These equations belong to the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov reaction-diffusion universality class. Our analysis reveals that the engineered dark state is generically unstable, giving way to a new steady state with a finite density of particles in the upper band. Our results suggest that number-conserving dissipative protocols may not be a reliable universal tool for stabilizing dark states.</description>

      <title>Dynamic X-ray coherent diffraction analysis: bridging the timescales between imaging and photon correlation spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of diffraction limited sources and developments in detector technology opens up new possibilities for the study of materials in situ and operando. Coherent X-ray diffraction techniques such as coherent X-ray diffractive imaging (CXDI) and X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) are capable for this purpose and provide complimentary information, although due to signal-to-noise requirements, their simultaneous demonstration has been limited. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for the simultaneous use of CXDI and XPCS to study in situ the Brownian motion of colloidal gold nanoparticles of 200 nm diameter suspended in a glycerol-water mixture. We visualise the process of agglomeration, examine the spatiotemporal space accessible with the combination of techniques, and demonstrate CXDI with 22 ms temporal resolution.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Control of Quantum States in Radical Molecules on Superconducting Pb(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic impurities on superconductors present a viable platform for building advanced applications in quantum technologies. However, a controlled manipulation of their quantum states continues to pose a significant challenge, hindering the progress in the field. Here we show the manipulation of magnetic states in the radical molecule 4,5,9,10-tetrabromo-1,3,6,8-tetraazapyrene (TBTAP) on a Pb(111) superconducting surface using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. Tunneling spectra reveal Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states near the Fermi energy in isolated molecules. A quantum phase transition from singlet to doublet ground state is induced by changing the tip-molecule distance. Additionally, the presence of a second TBTAP molecule allows tuning of the YSR state position by altering the relative distance and can induce splitting of the YSR states for certain orientations. The construction of molecular chains up to pentamers shows periodic arrangements of charged and neutral molecules, with even-numbered chains forming a charged dimer structure at one end. Information can be encoded in these chains by switching the dimer position. These findings elucidate interactions between molecular assemblies and superconducting substrates, paving the way for advanced quantum-state engineering.</description>

      <title>Current-induced spin polarisation in Rashba-Dresselhaus systems under different point groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-magnetic materials without inversion symmetry typically exhibit strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), enabling the well-known Rashba Edelstein effect where an external electrical current induces transverse spin polarisation. In this study, we demonstrate that electrically induced spin polarisation in non-magnetic materials, for example, electronic systems within quantum-well geometries, can significantly be influenced by the system's point-group symmetries, such as $C_n$ and $C_{nv}$. These symmetries allow various linear and higher-order momentum, $k-$varying SOC Hamiltonian. Specifically, we show that surfaces having $C_{n}$ point-group symmetry, which permits specific linear and cubic Rashba and Dresselhaus SOC terms, can lead to both orthogonal and non-orthogonal spin polarisations with respect to the applied field. In contrast, surfaces with $C_{nv}$ symmetry exhibit only transverse spin polarisation, regardless of the linear and cubic SOC terms. We further find contrasting spin polarisation for cubic-in-$k$ SOC as compared to the linear-in-$k$ SOC when energy is varied, for example, through doping. Additionally, we show that the surfaces with $C_{n}$ symmetry may exhibit persistent spin current, depending on the relative strength between different momentum-dependent SOC terms. Our finding emphasizes the significance of crystal symmetry in understanding and manipulating induced spin polarisation in noncentrosymmetric materials, especially in surface/interface systems.</description>

      <title>Twisted nanoporous graphene/graphene bilayers: electronic decoupling and chiral currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate bilayers of nanoporous graphene (NPG), laterally bonded carbon nanoribbons, and graphene. The electronic and transport properties are explored as a function of the interlayer twist angle using an atomistic tight-binding model combined with non-equilibrium Green's functions. At small twist angles ($\theta \lesssim 10^\circ$), NPG and graphene are strongly coupled, as revealed by the hybridization of their electronic bands. As a result, when electrons are point-injected in NPG, a substantial interlayer transmission occurs and an electronic Talbot-like interference pattern appears in the current flow on both layers. Besides, the twist-induced mirror-symmetry-breaking leads to chiral features in the injected current. Upon increasing the twist angle, the coupling is weakened and the monolayer electronic properties are restored. Furthermore, we demonstrate the emergence of resonant peaks in the electronic density of states for small twist angles, allowing to probe the twist-dependent interlayer coupling via scanning tunneling microscopy.</description>

      <title>Hidden curved spaces in Bosonic Kitaev model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum matter in curved spaces exhibits remarkable properties unattainable in flat spaces. To access curved spaces in laboratories, the conventional wisdom is that physical distortions need to be implemented into a system. In contrast to this belief, here, we show that two hyperbolic surfaces readily exist in bosonic Kitaev model in the absence of any physical distortions and give rise to a range of intriguing phenomena, such as chiral quantum transport or chiral reaction-diffusion. A finite chemical potential couples these two hyperbolic surfaces, delivering a quantum sensor whose sensitivity grows exponentially with the size of the system. Our results provide experimentalists with an unprecedented opportunity to explore intriguing quantum phenomena in curve spaces without distortion or access non-Hermitian phenomena without dissipation. Our work also suggests a new class of quantum sensors in which geometry amplifies small signals.</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in rhombohedral multilayer graphene with a strong displacement field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RnG) in the presence of a strong applied displacement field. We first introduce the interacting model of RnG, which includes the noninteracting continuum model and the many-body Coulomb interaction. We then discuss the integer quantum anomalous Hall (IQAH) effect in RnG and the role of the Hartree-Fock approach in understanding its appearance. Next, we explore the FQAH effect in RnG for $n=3$--$6$ using a combination of constrained Hartree-Fock and exact diagonalization methods. We characterize the stability of the FQAH phase by the size of the FQAH gap and find that RnG generally has a stable FQAH phase, although the required displacement field varies significantly among different $n$ values. Our work establishes the theoretical universality of both IQAH and FQAH in RnG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis conducted by Rymarz and DiVincenzo (Phys. Rev. X 13, 021017 (2023)) regarding quantization of superconducting circuits is insufficient to justify their general conclusions, most importantly the need to discard Kirchhoff's laws to effect variable reductions. Amongst a variety of reasons, one source of several disagreements with experimental and theoretical results is the long-standing dispute between extended vs compact variables in the presence of Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional spin wave emission by travelling pair of magnetic field profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the spin wave Cherenkov effect can be used to design the unidirectional spin wave emitter with tunable frequency and switchable direction of emission. In our numerical studies, we propose to use a pair of traveling profiles of the magnetic field which generate the spin waves, for sufficiently large velocity of their motion. In the considered system, the spin waves of shorter (longer) wavelengths are induced at the front (back) of the moving profiles and interfere constructively or destructively, depending on the velocity of the profiles. Moreover, we showed that the spin waves can be confined between the pair of traveling profiles of the magnetic field. This work opens the perspectives for the experimental studies in hybrid magnonic-superconducting systems where the magnetic vortices in a superconductor can be used as moving sources of the magnetic field driving the spin waves in the ferromagnetic subsystem.</description>

      <title>Kitaev chain in an alternating quantum dot-Andreev bound state array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to implement a Kitaev chain based on an array of alternating normal and superconductor hybrid quantum dots embedded in semiconductors. In particular, the orbitals in the dot and the Andreev bound states in the hybrid are now on equal footing and both emerge as low-energy degrees of freedom in the Kitaev chain, with the couplings being induced by direct tunneling. Due to the electron and hole components in the Andreev bound state, this coupling is simultaneously of the normal and Andreev types, with their ratio being tunable by varying one or several of the experimentally accessible physical parameters, e.g., strength and direction of the Zeeman field, as well as changing proximity effect on the normal quantum dots. As such, it becomes feasible to realize a two-site Kitaev chain in a simple setup with only one normal quantum dot and one hybrid segment. Interestingly, when scaling up the system to a three-site Kitaev chain, next-nearest-neighbor couplings emerge as a result of high-order tunneling, lifting the Majorana zero energy at the sweet spot. This energy splitting is mitigated in a longer chain, approaching topological protection. Our proposal has two immediate advantages: obtaining a larger energy gap from direct tunneling and creating a Kitaev chain using a reduced number of quantum dots and hybrid segments.</description>

      <title>Localization engineering by resonant driving in dissipative polariton arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arrays of microcavity polaritons are very versatile systems that allow for broad possibilities for the engineering of multi-orbital lattice geometries using different state preparation schemes. One of these schemes, spatially modulated resonant driving, can be used to selectively localize the polariton field on a particular region of the lattice. Both the frequency and the spatial amplitude distribution (module and phase) of the driven laser field are important and serve as a knob to control the extend of the spatial localization. Here, we analyse both the linear and nonlinear regimes using the lattice Green function formalism that is particularly suitable for the case of polariton arrays described in a tight-binding approximation. We identify the conditions for maximum localization on arbitrary lattice's geometries and discuss some experimentally relevant cases. We find that the polariton-polariton interaction leads to a frequency shift of the optimal localization condition that could be used to further control it.</description>

      <title>Robust field-free switching using large unconventional spin-orbit torque in an all-van der Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emerging all-van der Waals (vdW) magnetic heterostructure provides a new platform to control the magnetization by the electric field beyond the traditional spintronics devices. One promising strategy is using unconventional spin-orbit torque (SOT) exerted by the out-of-plane polarized spin current to enable deterministic magnetization switching and enhance the switching efficiency. However, in all-vdW heterostructures, large unconventional SOT remains elusive and the robustness of the field-free switching against external magnetic field hasn't been examined, which hinder further applications. Here we demonstrate the field-free switching in an all-vdW heterostructure combining a type-II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 and above-room-temperature ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. The fully field-free switching can be achieved at 2.56 x 10^10 A per m2 at 300K and a large SOT effective field efficiency of the out-of-plane polarized spin current generated by TaIrTe4 is determined to be 0.37. Moreover, we find that the switching polarity cannot be changed until the external in-plane magnetic field reaches 252mT, indicating a robust switching against the magnetic field. The numerical simulation suggests the large unconventional SOT reduces the switching current density and enhances the robustness of the switching. Our work shows that all-vdW heterostructures are promising candidates for future highly efficient and stable SOT-based devices.</description>

      <title>Electric, thermal, and thermoelectric magnetoconductivity for Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals in planar Hall set-ups induced by the combined effects of topology and strain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations where a three-dimensional Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the combined influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (and/or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $, generalizing the considerations of Phys. Rev. B 108 (2023) 155132 and Physica E 159 (2024) 115914. The electromagnetic fields are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other, thus leading to the possibility of having collinear components, which do not arise in a Hall set-up. The net effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $ consists of two parts -- (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $ applied externally; and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. Using a semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we derive the generic expressions for the response tensors, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the bandstructures. We elucidate the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the longitudinal and transverse (or Hall) components of the electric, thermal, and thermoelectric response tensors. Especially, for the co-planar transverse components of the response tensors, the OMM part acts exclusively in opposition (sync) with the BC-only part for the Weyl (multi-Weyl) semimetals.</description>

Abstract: The standard theoretical framework for fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAH) assumes an isolated flat Chern band in the single particle level. In this paper we challenges this paradigm for the FQAH recently observed in the pentalayer rhombohedral stacked graphene aligned with hexagon boron nitride (hBN). We show that the external moir\'e superlattice potential is simply a perturbation in a model with continuous translation symmetry. Through Hartree Fock calculation, we find that interaction opens a sizable remote band gap, resulting an isolated narrow $C=1$ Chern band at filling $\nu=1$. From exact diagonalization (ED) we identify FQAH phases at various fillings. But they exist also in the calculations without any external moir\'e potential. We suggest that the QAH insulator at $\nu=1$ should be viewed as an interaction driven topological Wigner crystal with QAH effect, which is then pinned by a small moir\'e potential. The $C=1$ QAH crystal is robust with a crystal period around $10\mathrm{nm}$ in 4-layer, 5-layer, 6-layer and 7-layer graphene systems. Our work suggests a new direction to exploring the interplay of topology and FQAH with spontaneous crystal formation in the vanishing moir\'e potential limit. We also propose a new system to generate and control both honeycomb and triangular moir\'e superlattice potential through Coulomb interaction from another control layer, which can stabilize or suppress the QAH crystal depending on the density of the control layer.</description>
