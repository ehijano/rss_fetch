      <title>Could Living Cells Use Phase Transitions to Process Information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To maintain homeostasis, living cells process information with networks of interacting molecules. Traditional models for cellular information processing have focused on networks of chemical reactions between molecules. Here, we describe how networks of physical interactions could contribute to the processing of information inside cells. In particular, we focus on the impact of biomolecular condensation, a structural phase transition found in cells. Biomolecular condensation has recently been implicated in diverse cellular processes. Some of these are essentially computational, including classification and control tasks. We place these findings in the broader context of physical computing, an emerging framework for describing how the native dynamics of nonlinear physical systems can be leveraged to perform complex computations. The synthesis of these ideas raises questions about expressivity (the range of problems that cellular phase transitions might be able to solve) and learning (how these systems could adapt and evolve to solve different problems). This emerging area of research presents diverse opportunities across molecular biophysics, soft matter, and physical computing.</description>

      <title>Sub-surface Skin Deformation in Response to Gentle Brushing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even simple tactile stimuli can lead to remarkably different perceptions among individuals, both in intensity and pleasantness. To understand the physical factors behind this variation, it is important to investigate how mechanical events are transmitted through the skin. In this study, we visualize the internal skin strains in response to soft brushing stimuli using functional Optical Coherence Tomography (fOCT), which provides depth-resolved time-series data of the displacement of the skin. Driven with custom-made software, the system enabled sub-surface imaging at a refresh rate of 10 kHz. Brushing was applied to the back of the hand, and skin displacement was observed at different depths. The results show that each skin layer responds differently to the stimulus, suggesting that internal skin dynamics play a role in tactile perception. This method offers a way to investigate how mechanical events within the skin relate to sensory function.</description>

      <title>Arrested Ostwald Ripening in Non-Equilibrium Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absence of Ostwald ripening has been observed in living cells, which operate out of equilibrium. Using molecular dynamics we study the behaviour of liquid droplets away from equilibrium in a system of particles interacting with each other via several central potential. The system is driven out of equilibrium either by the particles randomly transitioning between two states, or by randomly changing their momenta. In all cases Ostwald ripening is absent only away from equilibrium. This phenomena, might be the mechanism by which droplets in living cells are stabilized.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Cancer Stem Cell Marker Networks: A Hypergraph Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel computational framework leveraging hypergraph theory to analyse cancer stem cell markers (CSCMs) across multiple organs. Hypergraphs provide a robust representation of CSCM co-expression patterns, capturing their complex multi-organ relationships more comprehensively than traditional graph-based methods. By integrating mutual information analysis and Markov models, we identify key markers driving tumour heterogeneity and metastasis, offering detailed insights into their interdependencies. This approach establishes hypergraphs as a computationally powerful tool to model cancer progression and metastatic dynamics, contributing to the understanding of complex biological systems and supporting the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <title>Recovering Hidden Degrees of Freedom Using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction represents a crucial step in extracting meaningful insights from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Conventional approaches, including linear methods such as principal component analysis as well as various autoencoder architectures, typically operate under the assumption of independent and identically distributed data, disregarding the sequential nature of MD simulations. Here, we introduce a physics-informed representation learning framework that leverages Gaussian Processes combined with variational autoencoders to exploit the temporal dependencies inherent in MD data. Time-dependent kernel functions--such as the Mat\'ern kernel--directly impose the temporal correlation structure of the input coordinates onto a low-dimensional space, preserving Markovianity in the reduced representation while faithfully capturing the essential dynamics. Using a three-dimensional toy model, we demonstrate that this approach can successfully identify and separate dynamically distinct states that are geometrically indistinguishable due to hidden degrees of freedom. Applying the framework to a $50\,\mu$s-long MD trajectory of T4 lysozyme, we uncover dynamically distinct conformational substates that previous analyses failed to resolve, revealing functional relationships that become apparent only when temporal correlations are taken into account. This time-aware perspective provides a promising framework for understanding complex biomolecular systems, in which conventional collective variables fail to capture the full dynamical picture.</description>
