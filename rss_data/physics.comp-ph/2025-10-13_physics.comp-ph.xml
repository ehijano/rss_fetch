      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Topotomography Using Small Intragranular Strain Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topo-Tomography (TT) is a synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction imaging technique used to characterize grain shape and crystal orientation in polycrystalline samples. This work aims to provide a decisive and fundamental understanding of 3D grain shape and orientation field reconstruction from TT diffraction data. We derive mathematical expressions for the TT projection geometry, considering grain shape, intragranular lattice rotations, and elastic strains, under the assumption of kinematical diffraction. These expressions are simplified using approximations for small strain variations and grain size. The simplified expressions show that integrated TT projection images correspond to projections of a "pseudo" distorted grain volume. Its Fourier analysis provides insights into the feasibility of orientation field reconstruction from TT scans. We propose methods to expand data coverage, including using opposite scattering vectors and varying detector distance. A lower bound for orientation sampling resolution is derived and validated through simulations.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity Batch Active Learning for Gaussian Process Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many science and engineering problems rely on expensive computational simulations, where a multi-fidelity approach can accelerate the exploration of a parameter space. We study efficient allocation of a simulation budget using a Gaussian Process (GP) model in the binary simulation output case. This paper introduces Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI), a batch active learning algorithm for multi-fidelity GP classifiers. BPMI circumvents the intractability of calculating mutual information in the probability space by employing a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function. We evaluate BPMI against several baselines on two synthetic test cases and a complex, real-world application involving the simulation of a laser-ignited rocket combustor. In all experiments, BPMI demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher predictive accuracy for a fixed computational budget.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic bonding is an essential feature of many soft materials. Molecular simulations have proven to be a powerful tool for modeling bonding kinetics and thermodynamics in these materials, providing insights into their properties that cannot be obtained by experiments alone. Here, we review recent advances in modeling dynamic bonding in soft matter via molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, and hybrid simulation methods, highlighting outstanding challenges and future directions.</description>

      <title>Atomistic origin of low thermal conductivity in quaternary chalcogenides Cu(Cd, Zn)$_2$InTe$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystalline semiconductors with intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity ($\mathcal{K}$) are vital for device applications such as barrier coatings and thermoelectrics. Quaternary chalcogenide semiconductors such as CuCd$_2$InTe$_4$ and CuZn$_2$InTe$_4$ are experimentally shown to exhibit low $\mathcal{K}$, yet its microscopic origin remains poorly understood. Here, we analyse their thermal transport mechanisms using a unified first-principles framework that captures both the Peierls (particle-like propagation, $\mathcal{K}_P$) and coherence (wave-like tunneling, $\mathcal{K}_C$) mechanisms of phonon transport. We show that extended antibonding states below the Fermi level lead to enhanced phonon anharmonicity and strong scattering of heat-carrying phonon modes, suppressing $\mathcal{K}$ in these chalcogenides. We show that $\mathcal{K}_P$ dominates the total thermal conductivity, while $\mathcal{K}_C$ remains negligible even under strong anharmonicity of the phonon modes. The heavier Cd ions in CuCd$_2$InTe$_4$ induce greater acoustic-optical phonon overlap and scattering compared to CuZn$_2$InTe$_4$, further lowering thermal conductivity of the former. Additionally, grain boundary scattering in realistic samples contributes to further suppression of thermal transport. Our findings establish the atomistic origins of low $\mathcal{K}$ in quaternary chalcogenides and offer guiding principles for designing low-thermal-conductivity semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Influence of an external static magnetic field on prebreakdown electron emission and heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High magnetic fields can increase the occurrence of vacuum arcing, suggesting that both electric and magnetic fields can play a role in the vacuum arcing process. The mechanism of vacuum arcing in high magnetic fields is believed to involve both the cathode and the anode, with the cathode serving as the originator of field-emitting nanoprotrusions or tips, while the anode serves a secondary role. Significant heating of the anode surface can be achieved by magnetic focusing of the emitted electron beam, leading to increased heat flux due to greater current density. We simulated the emitted electron beam in different configurations of the electric and magnetic fields using the particle-in-cell (PIC) and finite element methods (FEM). The heating caused by the impacting electron beam was simulated for magnetic fields ranging from 0 T to 30 T. The directions of the electric and magnetic fields were found to play a major role in the focusing of the electron beam. We found that a sufficient temperature increase on the anode surface for evaporation can be reached at magnetic fields on the order of 10-30 T, suggesting the possibility of plasma initiation on the anode side.</description>

      <title>A Decoy-like Protocol for Quantum Key Distribution: Enhancing the Performance with Imperfect Single Photon Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on single photon sources (SPSs), e.g. from solid-state systems, as flying qubits, where security strongly requires sub-Poissonian photon statistics with low second-order correlation values (\$g^{(2)}(0)\$). However, achieving such low \$g^{(2)}(0)\$ remains experimentally challenging. We therefore propose a decoy-like QKD protocol that relaxes this constraint while maintaining security. This enables the use of many SPSs with \$g^{(2)}(0) &gt; \$0.1, routinely achieved in experiments but rarely considered viable for QKD. Monte Carlo simulations and our experiment from defects in hexagonal boron nitride show that, under linear loss, \$g^{(2)}(0)\$ remains constant, whereas photon-number-splitting (PNS) attacks introduce nonlinear effects that modify the measured \$g^{(2)}(0)\$ statistics. Exploiting this \$g^{(2)}(0)\$ variation as a diagnostic tool, our protocol detects PNS attacks analogously to decoy-state methods. Both single- and two-photon pulses consequently securely contribute to the secret key rate. Our protocol outperforms the Gottesman--Lo--Lutkenhaus--Preskill (GLLP) framework under high channel loss across various solid-state SPSs and is applicable to the satellite-based communication. Since \$g^{(2)}(0)\$ can be extracted from standard QKD experiments, no additional hardware is required. The relaxed \$g^{(2)}(0)\$ requirement simplifies the laser system for SPS generation. This establishes a practical route toward high-performance QKD without the need for ultra-pure SPSs.</description>

      <title>Multi-Level Hybrid Monte Carlo / Deterministic Methods for Particle Transport Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents multi-level hybrid transport (MLHT) methods for solving the neutral particle Boltzmann transport equation. The proposed MLHT methods are formulated on a sequence of spatial grids using a multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) approach. The general MLMC algorithm is defined by the recursive estimation of the expected value of a solution functional's correction with respect to a neighboring grid. MLMC theory optimizes the total computational cost for estimating a functional to within a target accuracy. The proposed MLHT algorithms are based on the quasidiffusion (Variable Eddington Factor) and second-moment methods. For these methods, the low-order equations for the angular moments of the high-order transport solution are discretized in space. Monte Carlo techniques compute the closures for the low-order equations; then, the equations are solved, yielding a single realization of the global flux solution. The ensemble average of the realizations yields the level solution. The results for 1-D slab transport problems demonstrates weak convergence of the functionals considered. We observe that the variance of the correction factors decreases faster than the increase in computational costs of generating an MLMC sample. In the problems considered, the variance and costs of the MLMC solution are driven by the coarse grid calculations.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking AI-evolved cosmological structure formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The potential of deep learning-based image-to-image translations has recently attracted significant attention. One possible application of such a framework is as a fast, approximate alternative to cosmological simulations, which would be particularly useful in various contexts, including covariance studies, investigations of systematics, and cosmological parameter inference. To investigate different aspects of learning-based cosmological mappings, we choose two approaches for generating suitable cosmological matter fields as datasets: a simple analytical prescription provided by the Zel'dovich approximation, and a numerical N-body method using the Particle-Mesh approach. The evolution of structure formation is modeled using U-Net, a widely employed convolutional image translation framework. Because of the lack of a controlled methodology, validation of these learned mappings requires multiple benchmarks beyond simple visual comparisons and summary statistics. A comprehensive list of metrics is considered, including higher-order correlation functions, conservation laws, topological indicators, and statistical independence of density fields. We find that the U-Net approach performs well only for some of these physical metrics, and accuracy is worse at increasingly smaller scales, where the dynamic range in density is large. By introducing a custom density-weighted loss function during training, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the U-Net results at smaller scales. This study provides an example of how a family of physically motivated benchmarks can, in turn, be used to fine-tune optimization schemes -- such as the density-weighted loss used here -- to significantly enhance the accuracy of scientific machine learning approaches by focusing attention on relevant features.</description>
