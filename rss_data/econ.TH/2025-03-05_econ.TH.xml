      <title>Function-Coherent Gambles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The desirable gambles framework provides a foundational approach to imprecise probability theory but relies heavily on linear utility assumptions. This paper introduces {\em function-coherent gambles}, a generalization that accommodates non-linear utility while preserving essential rationality properties. We establish core axioms for function-coherence and prove a representation theorem that characterizes acceptable gambles through continuous linear functionals. The framework is then applied to analyze various forms of discounting in intertemporal choice, including hyperbolic, quasi-hyperbolic, scale-dependent, and state-dependent discounting. We demonstrate how these alternatives to constant-rate exponential discounting can be integrated within the function-coherent framework. This unified treatment provides theoretical foundations for modeling sophisticated patterns of time preference within the desirability paradigm, bridging a gap between normative theory and observed behavior in intertemporal decision-making under genuine uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Non-Cooperative Games with Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for finite non-cooperative games where each player faces a globally uncertain parameter with no common prior. Every player chooses both a mixed strategy and projects an emergent subjective prior to the uncertain parameters. We define an "Extended Equilibrium" by requiring that no player can improve her expected utility via a unilateral change of strategy, and the emergent subjective priors are such that they maximize the expected regret of the players. A fixed-point argument -- based on Brouwer's fixed point theorem and mimicking the construction of Nash -- ensures existence. Additionally, the "No Fictional Faith" theorem shows that any subjective equilibrium prior must stay non-concentrated if the parameter truly matters to a player. This approach provides a framework that unifies regret-based statistical decision theory and game theory, yielding a tool for handling strategic decision-making in the presence of deeply uncertain parameters.</description>

      <title>Economic dynamics with differential fertility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the outcomes of a canonical deterministic model for the intergenerational transmission of capital that features differential fertility. A fertility function determines the relationship between parental capital and the number of children, and a transmission function determines the relationship between the capital of a parent and that of their children. Together these functions generate an evolving cross-sectional distribution of capital. We establish easy-to-verify conditions on the fertility and transmission functions that guarantee (a) that the dynamical system has a steady state distribution that is either atomless (exhibiting inequality) or degenerate (not exhibiting inequality), and (b) that the system converges to such states from essentially any initial distribution. Our characterization provides new insights into the link between differential fertility and long-run cross-sectional inequality, and it gives rise to novel comparative statics relating the two. We apply our results to several parametric examples and to a model of economic growth that features endogenous differential fertility.</description>

      <title>Women's Status and Fertility: A Novel Perspective on Low Fertility Issue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This model offers a compelling explanation for the observed decline in fertility rates in developed countries, correlating it with the rising economic status of women, and thereby providing valuable insights for policy-making. In summary, through a game theory model, we identify the rising economic status of women as the underlying cause of low fertility rates in modern developed countries.</description>

      <title>Approximate Equilibria in Nonconvex Markets: Theory and Evidence from European Electricity Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of Walrasian equilibrium is usually not guaranteed when some market participants have nonconvex preferences. This limitation applies to many real-world markets, including day-ahead electricity auctions. Despite this, we observed equilibrium on about 80% of days in several European electricity markets during 2023. Our analysis of commercial microdata suggests that this high frequency of equilibrium is caused by a market primarily composed of divisible (convex) bids compared to indivisible (nonconvex) ones. To explain why predominantly convex markets are more likely to reach equilibrium, we revisit classical results on approximate equilibria. Focusing on the nonconvexity of agents' demand sets rather than their preferences allows us to refine deviation bounds. This shows that better equilibrium approximations are guaranteed than previously thought. Ultimately, we apply these refined bounds to simple random markets with both convex and nonconvex agents to explain our empirical findings.</description>

      <title>On voting rules satisfying false-name-proofness and participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider voting rules in settings where voters' identities are difficult to verify. Voters can manipulate the process by casting multiple votes under different identities or abstaining from voting. Immunities to such manipulations are called false-name-proofness and participation, respectively. For the universal domain of (strict) preferences, these properties together imply anonymity and are incompatible with neutrality. For the domain of preferences defined over all subsets of a given set of objects, both of these properties cannot be met by onto and object neutral rules that also satisfy the tops-only criterion. However, when preferences over subsets of objects are restricted to be separable, all these properties can be satisfied. Furthermore, the domain of separable preferences is maximal for these properties.</description>

      <title>Succinct Ambiguous Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world contracts are often ambiguous. Recent work by D\"utting et al. (EC 2023, Econometrica 2024) models ambiguous contracts as a collection of classic contracts, with the agent choosing an action that maximizes his worst-case utility. In this model, optimal ambiguous contracts have been shown to be ``simple" in that they consist of single-outcome payment (SOP) contracts, and can be computed in polynomial-time. However, this simplicity is challenged by the potential need for many classic contracts. Motivated by this, we explore \emph{succinct} ambiguous contracts, where the ambiguous contract is restricted to consist of at most $k$ classic contracts. Unlike in the unrestricted case, succinct ambiguous contracts are no longer composed solely of SOP contracts, making both their structure and computation more complex.
  We show that, despite this added complexity, optimal succinct ambiguous contracts are governed by a simple divide-and-conquer principle, showing that they consist of ``shifted min-pay contracts" for a suitable partition of the actions. This structural insight implies a characterization of implementability by succinct ambiguous contracts, and can be leveraged to devise an algorithm for the optimal succinct ambiguous contract. While this algorithm is polynomial for $k$ sufficiently close to $n$, for smaller values of $k$, this algorithm is exponential, and we show that this is inevitable (unless P=NP) by establishing NP-hardness for any constant $k$, or $k=\beta n$ for some $\beta\in(0,1)$. Finally, we introduce the succinctness gap measure to quantify the loss incurred due to succinctness, and provide upper and lower bounds on this gap. Interestingly, in the case where we are missing just a single contract from the number sufficient to obtain the utility of the unrestricted case, the principal's utility drops by a factor of $2$, and this is tight.</description>

      <title>The Transfer Performance of Economic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04796v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Economists often estimate models using data from a particular domain, e.g. estimating risk preferences in a particular subject pool or for a specific class of lotteries. Whether a model's predictions extrapolate well across domains depends on whether the estimated model has captured generalizable structure. We provide a tractable formulation for this "out-of-domain" prediction problem and define the transfer error of a model based on how well it performs on data from a new domain. We derive finite-sample forecast intervals that are guaranteed to cover realized transfer errors with a user-selected probability when domains are iid, and use these intervals to compare the transferability of economic models and black box algorithms for predicting certainty equivalents. We find that in this application, the black box algorithms we consider outperform standard economic models when estimated and tested on data from the same domain, but the economic models generalize across domains better than the black-box algorithms do.</description>

      <title>Experiments in the Linear Convex Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06530v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes two rankings of statistical experiments using the linear convex order. These rankings hold in a broader set of scenarios where intuition suggests that one experiment is more informative than another, and provide more tractable characterizations than Blackwell order, which relies on the convex order. We apply these rankings to compare statistical experiments in binary-action decision problems and in decision problems that aggregate payoffs over a collection of binary-action decision problems. Furthermore, these rankings enable comparisons of statistical experiments in moral hazard problems without requiring the validity of the first-order approach, thereby complementing the results in Holmstr\"om (1979) and Kim (1995).</description>

      <title>Approximate Optimality of Linear Contracts Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a hidden-action principal-agent model, in which actions require different amounts of effort, and the agent privately knows his ability that determines his cost of effort. We show that linear contracts admit approximation guarantees that improve with a natural metric that captures the degree of uncertainty in the contracting setting. We thus show that linear contracts are near-optimal whenever there is enough uncertainty. In contrast, other simple contract formats such as debt contracts may suffer from a loss linear in the number of possible actions, even when there is sufficient uncertainty.</description>
