      <title>Acoustic Manipulation of Tangible Janus Icons on Liquid Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfaces that couple digital information with physical matter enable computation to be expressed through tangible motion and touch, yet typically rely on embedded actuators, rigid mechanisms, or enclosed environments. Consequently, contactless manipulation and interaction with centimeter-scale tangible elements in open settings remain difficult to achieve. Here, we present PolygonWave, a solid--fluid acoustic interface that enables transport and tangible interaction by coupling airborne ultrasound with liquid-mediated support. The system employs lightweight Janus icons with asymmetric wettability: a superhydrophobic upper surface permits dry touch interaction, while a hydrophilic lower surface couples to a water droplet resting on a superhydrophobic mesh. Focused acoustic fields generated by a 256-element phased array induce lateral forces, enabling programmable motion without mechanical contact. Systematic characterization demonstrates transport of payloads up to 525 mg across variations in icon size, droplet volume, and applied load. Beyond translation, the liquid layer functions as a reconfigurable mechanical element, enabling button-like input with self-recovery and resonance-driven vibro-visual feedback, exhibiting a peak response near 22 Hz for 200 \textmu L droplets. Liquid-mediated acoustic coupling provides a unified mechanism for mechanically expressive, touch-accessible tangible interfaces bridging acoustics, soft matter physics, and physical human--computer interaction.</description>

      <title>Extremely Low Thermal Resistance Architectures for AlxGaN1-x Semiconductor Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation high-power radio-frequency (RF) devices increasingly demand transistors that operate efficiently with high gain at high frequencies. High-aluminum-content ultra-wide-bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN alloys have shown great potential for enabling such high-frequency RF technologies. However, the widespread adoption of AlGaN-based RF devices is limited by thermal-management challenges arising from the intrinsically low thermal conductivity of AlGaN, which leads to higher device thermal resistance for a given geometry compared to GaN RF devices. As a result, these next-generation devices are highly susceptible to self-heating. This study investigates the thermal behavior of UWBG AlGaN devices, focusing on the effects of AlGaN channel thickness, substrate technology, and high-k material integration on reducing device thermal resistance to enable high-power operation. Experimental results demonstrate a record-low thermal resistance of 3.96 mm$\cdot$K/W when an AlN substrate is employed and the AlGaN channel thickness is reduced to 5 nm. These findings provide valuable insights into mitigating thermal limitations in UWBG devices through device-level engineering and the strategic integration of high-k materials.</description>

      <title>Artificial Neural Network (ANN) -- Oscillatory Neural Network (ONN) Hybrid System Using Domain-Wall Synapse Devices and Nano-Constriction Spin Hall Nano Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coupled spintronic oscillator array has been considered attractive for neuromorphic computing applications. Experimental reports have shown the nano-constriction geometry to be a relatively easier-to-fabricate platform for implementing such spin oscillators, but most prior reports on training and inference algorithms for neuromorphic computing using spin oscillators have been mostly restricted to the nano-pillar geometry. Also, those prior reports involve updating the natural frequency values of the oscillators and moving the synchronization regions on to the data clusters during the offline learning phase, which has associated challenges. In this context, we design and simulate a novel artificial neural network (ANN) - oscillator neural network (ONN) algorithm where in the offline learning phase, the weight parameters of the ANN are updated such that the data clusters are instead moved to the synchronization regions of spin Hall nano oscillators (SHNOs) in the nano-constriction geometry, as obtained through micromagnetic simulations. We further simulate the on-chip inference part of the ANN-ONN algorithm where the ANN is implemented on a crossbar array of domain-wall synapse devices, as simulated here through micromagnetics, and the ONN is implemented on nano-constriction SHNOs. We show successful data classification for both binary and multi-class classification tasks to demonstrate the generalizability of our proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions to Acoustoelectric Interactions in Arbitrary Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustoelectric interactions occur when free carriers in a semiconductor interact with the fields of an acoustic wave in a piezoelectric medium. These interactions can amplify acoustic waves, as well as give rise to extremely large phononic nonlinearities and strong non-reciprocal effects. Despite the tremendous progress in the last ten years, the field is entirely dependent on analytical and perturbative solutions for the two simplest arrangements of piezoelectric-semiconductor materials. While these models have allowed the field to advance substantially, new geometries are arising that do not satisfy assumptions integral to these canonical models. These models rely on simplifying assumptions that remove the tensorial nature of the materials, restricting analysis to plane wave and perturbative solutions. Such restrictions fails to capture the non-perturbative nature of the acoustoelectric effect, illustrating the need for more advanced computational methods to analyze acoustoelectric systems. We develop, for the first time, a finite element method (FEM) model to solve for acoustoelectric interactions in arbitrary geometries. We use the model to verify existing results for amplification, dispersion, and non-reciprocity obtained from the canonical models. We then examine the acoustoelectric effect in two geometries not covered by the canonical models: a thin piezoelectric film placed above a semiconductor substrate and a fully 2D waveguide under a thin semiconductor layer. This work lays the foundation for accurate modeling of arbitrary acoustoelectric geometries such as those currently being developed for all-acoustic radio frequency (RF) signal processing, acoustoelectrically enhanced photonic devices, and quantum acoustoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>AC loss modelling in a 2 MW-class REBCO high temperature superconducting motor for hydrogen-electric aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High temperature superconducting motors are very promising for hydrogen-electric aircraft thanks to their high specific power, specific torque, and efficiency. High temperature superconductor REBCO offer high cryogenic flexibility, but a stator made of REBCO tapes could present high AC loss. Although stacking effect reduce AC loss, it could be compromised by imperfections, such as winding misalignment and tape inhomogeneity. Therefore, it is needed to know whether the AC loss is acceptable in realistic REBCO stators. This article analyses the AC loss in a REBCO propulsion motor for aviation that takes these imperfections into account. For this purpose, we developed our own fast and accurate numerical model, which considers the highly nonlinear screening currents in the superconductor into account. This work studies a motor of around 2 MW power with REBCO stator coils with 27 parallel tapes as conductor and a permanent-magnet rotor. We consider several electric coupling scenarios of the multi-tape conductor. We also analyze the effect of finite tape-to-tape resistances at the terminals. We have found that the AC loss for the whole motor in the most realistic coupling scenario represents less than 0.018 % of the rated power. Misalignments and tape degradation at the edges of up to 100 $\mu$m only increase AC loss by up to around 20 %. Therefore, motors with REBCO superconductors in the stator are feasible for aircraft propulsion.</description>

      <title>Dielectric response in proteins: The proteotronics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dielectric properties of proteins, particularly in their hydrated state, have been extensively studied. Numerous theoretical and experimental investigations have reported values of both the permittivity and the intrinsic dipole moments of specific proteins under well-defined hydration conditions. Since even approximate estimates of these properties are relevant from both fundamental and applied perspectives, we propose a user-friendly method to calculate the relative permittivity that can be readily integrated into proteotronics workflows. To validate the proposed approach, we compare the results with those obtained using a classical macroscopic method. The outcomes are consistent and contribute further insight into this long-debated issue.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional photonic computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapidly increasing demands for computational throughput, bandwidth, and memory capacity fueled by breakthroughs in machine learning pose substantial challenges for conventional electronic computing platforms. For digital scaling to keep pace with the accelerating growth of artificial intelligence (AI) models beyond the trajectory of Moores law, computational power has to double roughly every three months. Historically, advancing compute performance relied on spatial scaling to increase the transistor count on a given chip area and, more recently, the development of parallel and multi-core architectures. Exponential scaling on trajectories much steeper than what can be achieved by such conventional strategies, and in line with the demands of AI, can be achieved with computing platforms that process data using multiple, orthogonal dimensions available to photons. Here we elucidate pivotal developments in the realization of multidimensional computing platforms based on photonic systems. Moving to such architectures holds enormous promise for low-latency, high-bandwidth information processing at reduced energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation for Model-Based Sensing of Magneto-Mechanical Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-mechanical resonators (MMRs) represent a recently proposed type of passive sensor that enables the estimation of its pose as well as sensing other parameters in its environment. The working principle of MMRs entails an excitation of the sensors by oscillating magnetic fields, followed by a readout process facilitated by inductive receiver coils. The sensing technology relies on real-time parameter estimation. This encompasses the solution of a nonlinear inverse problem, with the induced signals and a suitable forward model as inputs. The aim of this paper is twofold: first, to introduce a reference model and simplified models for the MMR dynamics and inductive readout, and second, to provide robust and real-time capable methods to estimate the model parameters. The effectiveness of the presented methods is evaluated in terms of their real-time potential, precision, and accuracy. All presented methods demonstrate the capacity to estimate the measured signal, with the simplified methods reducing the corresponding parameter estimation time by up to two orders of magnitude at the expense of less than 4 % deviation for large maximum deflection angles.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Photonic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic computing excels in approximating combinatorial problems and modelling uncertainty. However, using conventional deterministic hardware for probabilistic models is challenging: (pseudo) random number generation introduces computational overhead and additional data shuffling, which is particularly detrimental for safety-critical applications requiring low latency such as autonomous driving. Therefore, there is a pressing need for innovative probabilistic computing architectures that achieve low latencies with reasonable energy consumption. Physical computing offers a promising solution, as these systems do not rely on an abstract deterministic representation of data but directly encode the information in physical quantities. Therefore, they can be seamlessly integrated with physical entropy sources, enabling inherent probabilistic architectures. Photonic computing is a prominent variant due to the large available bandwidth, several orthogonal degrees of freedom for data encoding and optimal properties for in-memory computing and parallel data transfer. Here, we highlight key developments in physical photonic computing and photonic random number generation. We provide insights into the realization of probabilistic photonic processors and lend our perspective on their impact on AI systems and future challenges.</description>

      <title>Liquid photonic-molecule microlasers for ultrasensitive biosensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplet microlasers, as promising tools for biophotonics and biomedical sciences, have witnessed rapid advances due to their flexible reconfigurability, high sensitivity to stimuli, and label-free biosensing ability. However, designing these biosensors with simultaneously critical properties of low lasing threshold, high spectral purity, and ultimate sensitivity remains challenging. Here, we propose a versatile strategy to build liquid photonic molecules (LPMs) that combine all these features in a single device. We find that through tailoring the spectral Vernier overlap in size-mismatched droplets, this device enables single-mode lasing with a low threshold of ~610 nJ mm-2. The LPM lasers are engineered for dynamic tunability using a molecular isomerization strategy, which induces spectral mode hopping and thus yields a nearly ten-fold enhancement in spectral sensitivity over single droplets. Moreover, by leveraging the self-referenced intensity response of the LPM lasing modes, we demonstrate a three-orders-of-magnitude enhancement in biomolecular sensing, with a detection limit of 30 aM and a dynamic range spanning nine orders of magnitude. Our work offers exciting prospects for bio-integrated liquid sensors in diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Profiling THz Beams With Off-Label Use of Infrared Microbolometric Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19635v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visualizing the spatial profile of light beams is essential for evaluating irradiance, characterizing beam quality, and achieving precise alignment. In the optical spectral range, this is readily performed using silicon-based CCD and CMOS cameras. In the terahertz (THz) range, however, it typically requires specialized detectors with prohibitive costs. Here, we show that an infrared (IR) camera can be used outside of its labeled specifications to achieve similar performance as a dedicated microbolometric THz camera, at under 1% of the THz camera's cost. We compared the cameras by characterizing THz beam profiles from two sources: a pulsed broadband THz beam produced through optical rectification in organic crystals, and a narrowband quasi-continuous-wave (quasi-CW) THz beam emitted by a quantum cascade laser. For the broadband THz radiation, the beam width measured by the two cameras differed by only ~ 6%, well within the pixel resolution limit, and in the narrowband quasi-CW case by just ~ 1.3%. Additionally, both cameras show linear responsivity over a comparable irradiance range. These results expand the applicability of conventional IR cameras to the THz range, suggesting that they will become routine tools for high-fidelity THz beam diagnostics and imaging in scientific and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Particle-like topologies of light in turbulent complex media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19949v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The basic building blocks of many forms of optical topologies are particle-like singularities in phase and polarisation, giving rise to lines of darkness that weave complex threads in 3D space. Although known for half a century since seminal work on dislocations in wave trains, their behaviour in complex media remains under debate, especially with respect to their relative stability. Here we show that polarisation and phase vortices behave identically in one-sided turbulent complex channels. We perform complementary numerical and experimental studies using atmospheric turbulence as a test case, demonstrating agreement and equivalent dynamics. Our work addresses open questions on optical topologies and will be relevant to their harnessing for applications such as sensing, communication, imaging, and information transfer in noisy or complex environments.</description>

      <title>Elastic Lattices Inspired by Ulam-Warburton Cellular Automaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic lattices have been widely explored for decades, owing to their peculiar vibrational behavior. On the other hand, certain types of aperiodic lattices have enabled new phenomena that may not be otherwise attainable in periodic ones. In this paper, a new class of aperiodic lattices inspired by cellular automaton is introduced. Cellular automata were originally developed as a machine replication algorithm and it has been intensively explored in computer science. These algorithms yield structures that are not necessarily periodic, yet follow well-defined rules that lead to interesting patterns. The concept is utilized here to build elastic lattices following such rules, and Ulam-Warburton Cellular Automaton (UWCA) is demonstrated as an example. Starting from a square monatomic lattice, an UWCA lattice is constructed and its vibrational behavior is analyzed, showing unique dynamical properties, including symmetric eigenfrequency spectra, repeated natural frequencies of large multiplicity, and the emergence of strongly localized corner modes. It is envisioned that computer-algorithm-inspired lattices may unlock new wave phenomena that could outperform existing lattice designs.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Analogy of Quantum Baldin Sum Rule for Optimal Causal Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02630</link>

Abstract: The mass law is a cornerstone in predicting sound transmission loss, yet it neglects the constraints of causal dispersion. Current causality-based theories, such as the Rozanov limit, are applicable only to one-port reflective absorbers. Here, we derive a universal sum rule governing causal scattering in acoustic systems, establishing a rigorous analogy to the Baldin sum rule in quantum field theory. This relation reveals that the integral of the extinction cross-section is fundamentally locked by the scatterer's static effective mass and stiffness, which is validated numerically using seminal examples of underwater metamaterials. Furthermore, the proposed sum rule predicts an optimal condition for an anomalously broadened transmission loss bandwidth, as experimentally observed through the spectral shaping effect of an acoustic Fano resonator. Our findings open up an unexplored avenue for enhancing the scattering bandwidth of passive metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Field-material coupled neural network: A novel prior-free and data-free inverse problem solver for extracting complex dielectric constant in terahertz band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate extraction of the complex dielectric constant in the terahertz (THz) band is essential for material characterization and non-destructive evaluation yet remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of electromagnetic inverse problems and the limited availability of reliable reference data. In this work, a field-material couple neural network (FMCNN) is proposed to retrieve the complex dielectric constant directly from THz measurements. The FMCNN consists of a field neural network and a material neural network that are strongly coupled through the frequency-domain Maxwell equations in the form of a Helmholtz equation, with the governing physics enforced by partial differential equation (PDE) and boundary condition constraints. This formulation enables prior-free and data-free inversion, requiring only measured test data as input. The extracted dielectric constants are validated by comparison with results from a one-dimensional normal-incidence model and the Drude-Lorentz model, showing good agreement over a broad frequency range, particularly above 0.2 THz. These results demonstrate that the FMCNN provides a physics-consistent and data-efficient approach for material parameter extraction in the THz band, offering an alternative to conventional model-based methods.</description>

      <title>Soft-Clamped Perimeter Modes of Polygon Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polygon resonators are promising candidates for nanomechanical applications due to their compact architecture and high force sensitivity. Here, we develop an analytical framework to predict the resonance frequencies and dissipation dilution factors $D_Q$ of polygon perimeter modes by extending the Timoshenko-Gere equation to incorporate the tensile stress. The model identifies two dominant dissipation mechanisms: distributed bending in the polygon sides and torsional deformation in the supporting tethers. We reveal that dissipation dilution in these resonators scales as $1/\lambda^2$, distinct from the conventional $1/\lambda$ dependence associated with boundary bending loss. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the torsional loss can be suppressed by tailoring the torsion angle of the supporting tethers. The analytical predictions are validated by finite element simulations, providing a predictive framework for designing high-$Q$ polygon resonators for cavity optomechanics and precision sensing.</description>

      <title>Competition for attention predicts good-to-bad tipping in AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: More than half the global population now carries devices that can run ChatGPT-like language models with no Internet connection and minimal safety oversight -- and hence the potential to promote self-harm, financial losses and extremism among other dangers. Existing safety tools either require cloud connectivity or discover failures only after harm has occurred. Here we show that a large class of potentially dangerous tipping originates at the atomistic scale in such edge AI due to competition for the machinery's attention. This yields a mathematical formula for the dynamical tipping point n*, governed by dot-product competition for attention between the conversation's context and competing output basins, that reveals new control levers. Validated against multiple AI models, the mechanism can be instantiated for different definitions of 'good' and 'bad' and hence in principle applies across domains (e.g. health, law, finance, defense), changing legal landscapes (e.g. EU, UK, US and state level), languages, and cultural settings.</description>

      <title>Optofluidic light routing via analytically configuring streamlines of micro-flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformation optics (TO) is a new method to design metamaterials that can manipulate electromagnetic fields. Inspired by the traditional TO techniques which is mostly based on the solid metamaterials with a limited range of tunability, a novel streamline tracing-based transformation optofluidics (STTOF) method is proposed to manipulate the light path by analytically designating the light-carrying streamlines of the flow in a two-dimensional circular bounded domain. A dipole flow model is built to analytically calculate the streamlines of the flow field inside the domain which allocates the optical/fluidic source and sink pairs at arbitrary positions. Liquid core/liquid cladding (L2) configuration is used in the experiment to trace the light via a specific streamline. Experimental results verify that the light paths agree well with the theoretical predictions, and demonstrate that a good range of tunability can be achieved by adjusting the flow rates and the source-sink positions of optical/fluidic source and sink pairs.</description>
