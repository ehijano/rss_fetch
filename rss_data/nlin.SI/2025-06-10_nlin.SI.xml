      <title>The Lie -Bianchi integrability of the full symmetric Toda system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that the full symmetric Toda system is integrable in the sense of the Lie-Bianchi criterion, i.e. that there exists a solvable Lie algebra of vector fields of dimension $N=\dim M$ on the phase space $M$ of this system such that the system is invariant with respect to the action of these fields. The proof is based on the use of symmetries of the full symmetric system, which we described earlier in \cite{CSS23}, and the appearance of the structure of the stochastic Lie algebra in their description.</description>

      <title>Revisiting B\"acklund-Darboux transformations for KP and BKP integrable hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider B\"acklund-Darboux transformations for integrable hierarchies of nonlinear equations such as KP, BKP and their close relatives referred to as modified KP and Schwarzian KP. We work in the framework of the bilinear formalism based on the bilinear equations for the tau-function. This approach allows one to extend the theory to fully difference (or discrete) versions of the integrable equations and their hierarchies in a natural way. We also show how to construct the B\"acklund-Darboux transformations in the operator approach developed by the Kyoto school, in which the tau-functions are represented as vacuum expectation values of certain operators made of free fermionic fields (charged for KP and neutral for BKP).</description>

      <title>GBDT with nontrivial seeds: explicit solutions of the focusing NLS equations and the corresponding Weyl functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our GBDT (generalised B\"acklund-Darboux transformation) approach is used to construct explicit solutions of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation in the case of the exponential seed $a \exp\{2 i (cx +dt)\}$. The corresponding Baker-Akhiezer functions and evolution of the Weyl functions are obtained as well. In particular, the solutions, which appear in the study of rogue waves, step-like solutions and $N$-modulation solutions of the NLS equation are considered. This work is an essential development of our joint work with Rien Kaashoek and Israel Gohberg, where the seed was trivial, as well as several other of our previous works.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal invariance of the multipotentialisations of the Kupershmidt equation and its higher-order hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The term multipotentialisation of evolution equations in $1+1$ dimensions refers to the process of potentialising a given evolution equation, followed by at least one further potentialisation of the resulting potential equation. For certain equations this process can be applied several times to result in a finite chain of potential equations, where each equation in the chain is a potential equation of the previous equation. By a potentialisation of an equation with dependent variable $u$ to an equation with dependent variable $v$, we mean a differential substitution $v_x=\Phi^t$, where $\Phi^t$ is a conserved current of the equation in $u$. The process of multipotentialisation may lead to interesting nonlocal transformations between the equations. Remarkably, this can, in some cases, result in nonlocal invariance transformations for the equations, which then serve as iteration formulas by which solutions can be generated for all the equations in the chain. In the current paper we give a comprehensive introduction to this subject and report new nonlocal invariance transformations that result from the multipotentialisation of the Kupershmidt equation and its higher-order hierarchies. The recursion operators that define the hierarchies are given explicitly.</description>

      <title>Discrete Painlev\'e equations from pencils of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$ with branching generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the novel approach to discrete Painlev\'e equations initiated in our previous work [2]. A classification scheme for discrete Painlev\'e equations proposed by Sakai interprets them as birational isomorphisms between generalized Halphen surfaces (surfaces obtained from $\mathbb P^1\times\mathbb P^1$ by blowing up at eight points). Sakai's classification is thus based on the classification of generalized Halphen surfaces. In our scheme, the family of generalized Halphen surfaces is replaced by a pencil of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$. A discrete Painlev\'e equation is viewed as an autonomous transformation of $\mathbb P^3$ that preserves the pencil and maps each quadric of the pencil to a different one. Thus, our scheme is based on the classification of pencils of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$. Compared to our previous work, here we consider a technically more demanding case where the characteristic polynomial $\Delta(\lambda)$ of the pencil of quadrics is not a complete square. As a consequence, traversing the pencil via a 3D Painlev\'e map corresponds to a translation on the universal cover of the Riemann surface of $\sqrt{\Delta(\lambda)}$, rather than to a M\"obius transformation of the pencil parameter $\lambda$ as in [2].</description>

      <title>Stability of 2-soliton solutions for the modified Camassa-Holm equation with cubic nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the stability of 2-soliton solutions for the modified Camassa-Holm equation with cubic nonlinearity. By employing conserved quantities in terms of the momentum variable $m$, we show that the 2-soliton, when regarded as a solution to the initial-value problem for the modified Camassa-Holm equation, is nonlinearly stable to perturbations with respect to the momentum variable in the Sobolev space $H^2$.</description>

      <title>Hypergraphs and Lotka-Volterra systems with linear Darboux polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18264v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We associate parametric classes of $n$-component Lotka-Volterra systems which admit $k$ additional linear Darboux polynomials, with admissible loopless hypergraphs of order $n$ and size $k$. We study the equivalence relation on admissible hypergraphs induced by linear transformations of the associated LV-systems, for $n\leq 5$. We present a new 13-parameter 5-component superintegrable Lotka-Volterra system, i.e. one that is not equivalent to a so-called tree-system. We conjecture that tree-systems associated with nonisomorphic trees are not equivalent, which we verified for $n&lt;9$.</description>

      <title>The N-species integrable Volterra system as a maximally superintegrable Hamiltonian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09487v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The results presented in this paper are a natural development of those described in the paper {\it The Volterra Integrable case. Novel analytical and numerical results} (OCNMP Vol.4 (2024) pp 188-211), where the authors reconsidered the integrable case of the Hamiltonian $N$-species Lotka-Volterra system, introduced by Vito Volterra in 1937. There, an alternative approach for constructing the integrals of motion has been proposed, and compared with the old Volterra approach. Here we go beyond, and show that in fact the model introduced by Volterra and studied by us is not just integrable, but is maximally superintegrable and reducible to a system with only one degree of freedom regardless the number of species considered. We present both analytical and numerical results.</description>
