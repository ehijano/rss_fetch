      <title>A Political Spectrograph: High-Resolution Examinations of the United States' Ideological Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of ``ideology" is central to political discourse and dynamics, and is often cast as falling primarily on a one-dimensional scale from ``left-wing/liberal" to ``right-wing/conservative", but the validity of this simple quantitative treatment is uncertain. Here we investigate and compare various high-resolution measures of ideology, both internal (individuals self-identification and policy-stance agreements) and external (estimating the ideological position of political opinion statements). We find strong consistency between internal measures, although policy-stance agreement ideology yields a systematically centralizing and liberalizing portrait relative to subjective measures. More remarkably, we find that external assessments of ideology, while noisy, are largely consistent across observers, even for highly dissonant ideas and regardless of speaker identity markers. This supports the use of these responses as meaningful, comparable quantities, which general members of the public reliably project from the abstract space of political thought onto a shared one-dimensional domain. We end with observation of some broad initial patterns of political opinion acceptance, feelings towards the major political parties, and propensity for extreme thinking, finding mostly ideologically symmetric results strongly stratified by strong/lean/Independent political party identity. We hope these perspectives on quantification of political ideology serve as an invitation for a broader range of quantitative scientists to model and understand this vital societal arena.</description>

      <title>Effects of taxes, redistribution actions and fiscal evasion on wealth inequality: an agent-based model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In capitalist societies, only a single right can be fully exerted without constraints of any kind: the limitless accumulation of wealth. Such imperative or prime axiom is the ultimate cause of the raising waves of inequalities observed today. In this work we extended the agent-based model proposed by Castro de Oliveira arXiv:1711.06164 to study the effects of non-uniform income redistribution policies and tax evasion on the final steady-state wealth distribution of economic agents. Our simulational results strongly support that well designed policies of income redistribution and rigid control of tax planning possibilities are unavoidable instruments to promote the raise of more economically egalitarian and sustainable societies.</description>

      <title>Negative Ties Highlight Hidden Extremes in Social Media Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human interactions in the online world comprise a combination of positive and negative exchanges. These diverse interactions can be captured using signed network representations, where edges take positive or negative weights to indicate the sentiment of the interaction between individuals. Signed networks offer valuable insights into online political polarization by capturing antagonistic interactions and ideological divides on social media platforms. This study analyzes polarization on Men\'eame, a Spanish social media that facilitates engagement with news stories through comments and voting. Using a dual-method approach -- Signed Hamiltonian Eigenvector Embedding for Proximity (SHEEP) for signed networks and Correspondence Analysis (CA) for unsigned networks -- we investigate how including negative ties enhances the understanding of structural polarization levels across different conversation topics on the platform. We find that the unsigned Men\'eame network accurately delineates ideological communities, but negative ties are necessary for detecting extreme users who engage in antagonistic behaviors. We also show that far-left users are more likely to use negative interactions to engage across ideological lines, while far-right users interact primarily with users similar to themselves.</description>

      <title>Towards high resolution, validated and open global wind power assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wind power is expected to play a crucial role in future net-zero energy systems, but wind power simulations to support deployment strategies vary drastically in their results, hindering reliable design decisions. Therefore, we present a transparent, open source, validated and evaluated, global wind power simulation tool ETHOS.RESKit.Wind with high spatial resolution and customizable designs for both onshore and offshore wind turbines. The tool provides a comprehensive validation and calibration procedure using over 16 million global measurements from metrerological masts and wind turbine sites. We achieve a global average capacity factor mean error of 0.006 and Pearson correlation of 0.865. In addition, we evaluate its performance against several aggregated and statistical sources of wind power generation. The release of ETHOS.RESKit.Wind is a step towards a fully open source and open data approach to accurate wind power modeling by incorporating the most comprehensive simulation advances in one model.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Farmland Biodiversity Loss: A Bio-Economic Model of Land Consolidation and Pesticide Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19749v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biodiversity loss driven by agricultural intensification is a pressing global issue, with significant implications for ecosystem stability and human well-being. Existing policy instruments have so far proven insufficient in halting this decline, which raises the need to explore the possible feedback loops that are pivotal to ecosystem degradation. We design a minimal integrated bio-economic agent-based model to qualitatively explore macro-level biodiversity trends, as influenced by individual farmer behavior within simple decision-making processes. Our model predicts further biodiversity decline under a business-as-usual scenario, primarily due to intensified land consolidation. We evaluate two policy options: reducing pesticide use and subsidizing small farmers. While pesticide reduction rapidly benefits biodiversity in the beginning, it eventually leads to increased land consolidation and further biodiversity loss. In contrast, subsidizing small farmers by reallocating a small fraction of existing subsidies, stabilizes farm sizes and enhances biodiversity in the long run. The most effective strategy results from combining both policies, leveraging pesticide reduction alongside targeted subsidies to balance economic pressures and consistently improve biodiversity.</description>

      <title>Removing Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Using Large Land Or Ocean Areas Will Change Earth Albedo And Force Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When large surface areas of the Earth are altered, radiative forcing due to changes in surface reflectance can drive climate change. Yet to achieve the necessary scale to remove the substantial amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere relevant for ameliorating climate change, enhanced rock weathering (ERW) will need to be applied to very large land areas. Likewise, marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) must alter a large fraction of the ocean surface waters to have a significant impact upon climate. We show that surface albedo modification (SAM) associated with ERW or mCDR can easily overwhelm the radiative forcing from the decrease of atmospheric CO2 over years or even decades. A change in albedo as small as parts per thousand has a radiative impact comparable to the removal of 10 tons of carbon per hectare. SAM via ERW can be either cooling or warming. We identify some of the many questions raised by radiative forcing due to these forms of CDR.</description>
