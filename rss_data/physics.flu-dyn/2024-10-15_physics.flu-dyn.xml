      <title>On the competition between rotation and variable viscosity in a Darcy-Brinkman model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, the onset of thermal convection in a uniformly rotating Darcy-Brinkman porous medium saturated by a variable viscosity fluid is investigated and the competing interplay between rotation and temperature-dependent viscosity is then analysed. %It is well-known in literature that rotation inhibits the onset of vertical motions within the fluid, whereas variable viscosity that depends on temperature may facilitate the onset of instability. In literature it has been proved that considering a variable viscosity fluid saturating a porous medium does not produce any additional oscillating motions at the onset of convection. In this direction, similar results have been obtained in [1], where the authors prove the validity of the principle of exchange of stabilities in a rotating porous medium. Here, it is shown numerically that the combined effect of rotation and variable viscosity may lead to the occurrence of oscillatory convection. This result is remarkable and not known in literature, to the best of our knowledge. The stabilising effect of rotation on the onset of convection is recovered, while it is shown that the effect of variable viscosity on the behaviour of the critical Rayleigh number depends on the choice of the Taylor number. Nonlinear analysis is performed via the energy method and sufficient condition for the stability of the basic solution is determined. Proximity of the results from the linear and nonlinear analyses is obtained thanks to numerical techniques, i.e. Chebyshev-tau method and golden section method.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic Effects on the Hydrodynamics of an Active Compound Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the hydrodynamics of microswimmers in viscoelastic fluids and confined environments is crucial for interpreting their behaviour in natural settings and designing synthetic microswimmers for practical applications like cargo transport. In this study, we explore the hydrodynamics of a concentric active compound particle - a model microswimmer (a squirmer) positioned at the centre of a viscoelastic fluid droplet (a model cargo) suspended in another viscoelastic medium. We consider the Oldroyd-B constitutive model to characterize the fluids and employ a perturbative approach in the Deborah number to analyze viscoelastic effects analytically, assuming a small Capillary number so that the droplet remains spherical and does not deform. We examine three cases: (i) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in a Newtonian fluid, (ii) a squirmer confined within a Newtonian fluid droplet suspended in a viscoelastic fluid, and (iii) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in another viscoelastic fluid. Our findings reveal that the swimming speeds of the squirmer and the droplet are determined by the complex interplay of viscoelasticity, the size ratio of the droplet to the squirmer (confinement strength), and the viscosity ratio of the surrounding fluid to the droplet fluid. A critical aspect of this interaction is the positioning of stagnation points within the fluid flow, which governs the distribution of polymeric stress. This distribution, in turn, plays a crucial role in determining the influence of viscoelasticity on the squirmer's dynamics. Our analysis suggests that viscoelastic effects can either enhance or hinder the swimming speed of the squirmer when confined in a droplet, depending on the specific configuration of the system.</description>

      <title>The onset of filamentation on vorticity interfaces in two-dimensional Euler flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional Euler flows, in the plane or on simple surfaces, possess a material invariant, namely the scalar vorticity normal to the surface. Consequently, flows with piecewise-uniform vorticity remain that way, and moreover evolve in a way which is entirely determined by the instantaneous shapes of the contours (interfaces) separating different regions of vorticity -- this is known as `Contour Dynamics'. Unsteady vorticity contours or interfaces often grow in complexity (lengthen and fold), either as a result of vortex interactions (like merger) or `filamentation'. In the latter, wave disturbances riding on a background, equilibrium contour shape appear to inevitably steepen and break, forming filaments, repeatedly -- and perhaps endlessly. Here, we revisit the onset of filamentation. Building upon previous work and using a weakly-nonlinear expansion to third order in wave amplitude, we derive a universal, parameter-free amplitude equation which applies (with a minor change) both to a straight interface and a circular patch in the plane, as well as circular vortex patches on the surface of a sphere. We show that this equation possesses a local, self-similar form describing the finite-time blow up of the wave slope (in a rescaled long time proportional to the inverse square of the initial wave amplitude). We present numerical evidence for this self-similar blow-up solution, and for the conjecture that almost all initial conditions lead to finite-time blow up. In the full Contour Dynamics equations, this corresponds to the onset of filamentation.</description>

      <title>Fokker-Planck Central Moment Lattice Boltzmann Method for Effective Simulations of Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new formulation of the central moment lattice Boltzmann (LB) method based on a continuous Fokker-Planck (FP) kinetic model, originally proposed for stochastic diffusive-drift processes (e.g., Brownian dynamics), by adapting it as a collision model for the continuous Boltzmann equation (CBE) for fluid dynamics. The FP collision model has several desirable properties, including its ability to preserve the quadratic nonlinearity of the CBE, unlike that based on the common Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model. Rather than using an equivalent Langevin equation as a proxy, we construct our approach by directly matching the changes in different discrete central moments independently supported by the lattice under collision to those given by the CBE under the FP-guided collision model. This can be interpreted as a new path for the collision process in terms of the relaxation of the various central moments to 'equilibria', which we term as the Markovian central moment attractors that depend on a diffusion coefficient tensor. The construction of the method using central moments rather than via distribution functions facilitates its numerical implementation and analysis. We show its consistency to the Navier-Stokes equations via a Chapman-Enskog analysis and elucidate the choice of the diffusion coefficient based on the second order moments in accurately representing flows at relatively low viscosities. We will demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our new central moment FP-LB formulation, termed as the FPC-LBM, using the D3Q27 lattice for simulations of a variety of flows, including wall-bounded turbulent flows. We show that the FPC-LBM is more stable than other existing LB schemes based on central moments, while avoiding numerical hyperviscosity effects in flow simulations at relatively very low physical fluid viscosities through a refinement to a model founded on kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Variational data assimilation in wall turbulence: From outer observations to wall stress and pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimation of near-wall turbulence in channel flow from outer observations is investigated using adjoint-variational data assimilation. We first consider fully resolved velocity data, starting at a distance from the wall. By enforcing the estimated flow to exactly satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, we seek a statistically stationary turbulent state that reproduces the instantaneous outer measurements. Such an estimated state provides full access to the unknown near-wall turbulence, including the wall shear stresses and pressure. When the first observation is within fifty viscous units from the wall, the correlation coefficient between the true and estimated state exceeds 95%. As the observations are further separated from the wall, at ninety viscous units, the accuracy of the assimilated wall stresses decreases to 40% at the wall. This trend is nearly independent of the Reynolds number. The Fourier spectrum of the estimation error is qualitatively consistent with the coherence spectrum between the outer and the inner state variables: observed long wavelength structures in the outer flow have deeper coherence into the unobserved near-wall region, and therefore the error is lowest at large scales. Nevertheless, the adjoint-variational approach provides a more rigorous quantification of the capacity to accurately predict the instantaneous near-wall turbulence from outer measurements. Lastly, we demonstrate the robustness of the estimation accuracy using filtered and sub-sampled outer observations.</description>

      <title>On the low drag regime of flatback airfoils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flatback airfoils, characterized by a blunt trailing edge, are used at the root of large wind turbine blades. A low-drag pocket has recently been identified in the flow past these airfoils at high angles of attack, potentially offering opportunities for enhanced energy extraction. This study uses three-dimensional Detached Eddy Simulations (DES) combined with statistical and data-driven modal analysis techniques to explore the aerodynamics and coherent structures of a flatback airfoil in these conditions. Two angles of attack - one inside $\left(12^{\circ}\right)$ and one outside $\left(0^{\circ}\right)$ of the low-drag pocket - are examined more thoroughly. The spanwise correlation length of secondary instability is analyzed in terms of autocorrelation of the $\Gamma_{1}$ vortex identification criterion, while coherent structures were extracted via the multiscale Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (mPOD). The results show increased base pressure, BL thickness, vortex formation length, and more organized wake structures inside the low-drag regime. While the primary instability (B\'enard-von K\'arm\'an vortex street) dominates in both cases, the secondary instability is distinguishable only for the $12^{\circ}$ case and is identified as a Mode S$^{\prime}$ instability.</description>

      <title>Elastocapillary sequential fluid capture in hummingbird-inspired grooved sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive and effective fluid capture and transport at small scale is crucial for industrial and medical applications, especially for the realisation of point-of-care tests. Performing these tests involves several steps including biological fluid capture, aliquoting, reaction with reagents at the fluid-device interface, and reading of the results. Ideally, these tests must be fast and offer a large surface-to-volume ratio to achieve rapid and precise diagnostics with a reduced amount of fluid. Such constraints are often contradictory as a high surface-to-volume ratio implies a high hydraulic resistance and hence a decrease in the flow rate. Inspired by the feeding mechanism of hummingbirds, we propose a frugal fluid capture device that takes advantage of elastocapillary deformations to enable concomitant fast liquid transport, aliquoting, and high confinement in the deformed state. The hierarchical design of the device - that consists in vertical grooves stacked on an elastic sheet - enables a two-step sequential fluid capture. Each unit groove mimics the hummingbird's tongue and closes due to capillary forces when a wetting liquid penetrates, yielding the closure of the whole device in a tubular shape, where additional liquid is captured. Combining elasticity, capillarity, and viscous flow, we rationalise the fluid-structure interaction at play both when liquid is scarce - end dipping and capillary rise - and abundant - full dipping. By functionalising the surface of the grooves such a passive device can concomitantly achieve all the steps of point-of-care tests, opening the way for the design of optimal devices for fluid capture and transport in microfluidics.</description>

      <title>Vortex Modes in Acoustofluidic Cylindrical Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical investigation of vortex modes in acoustofluidic cylindrical resonators with rigid boundaries and viscous fluids. By solving the Helmholtz equation for linear pressure, incorporating boundary conditions that account for no-slip surfaces and vortex and nonvortex excitation at the base, we analyze both single- and dual-eigenfunction modes near system resonance. The results demonstrate that single vortex modes generate spin angular momentum exclusively along the axial direction, while dual modes introduce a transverse spin component due to the nonlinear interaction between axial and transverse ultrasonic waves, even in the absence of vortex excitation. We find that nonlinear acoustic fields, including energy density, radiation force potential, and spin, scale with the square of the shear wave number, defined as the ratio of the cavity radius to the boundary layer depth. Theoretical predictions align closely with finite element simulations based on a thermoviscous model for an acoustofluidic cavity with adiabatic and rigid walls. These findings hold particular significance for acoustofluidic systems, offering potential applications in the precise control of cells and microparticles.</description>

      <title>AutoTurb: Using Large Language Models for Automatic Algebraic Model Discovery of Turbulence Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) methods have been extensively investigated to explore explicit algebraic Reynolds stress models (EARSM) for turbulence closure of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. The deduced EARSM can be readily implemented in existing computational fluid dynamic (CFD) codes and promotes the identification of physically interpretable turbulence models. The existing SR methods, such as genetic programming, sparse regression, or artificial neural networks, require user-defined functional operators, a library of candidates, or complex optimization algorithms. In this work, a novel framework using LLMs to automatically discover algebraic expressions for correcting the RSM is proposed. The direct observation of Reynolds stress and the indirect output of the CFD simulation are both involved in the training process to guarantee data consistency and avoid numerical stiffness. Constraints of functional complexity and convergence are supplementally imposed in the objective function on account of the tremendous flexibility of LLMs. The evolutionary search is employed for global optimization. The proposed method is performed for separated flow over periodic hills at Re = 10,595. The generalizability of the discovered model is verified on a set of 2D turbulent separated flow configurations with different Reynolds numbers and geometries. It is demonstrated that the corrective RANS can improve the prediction for both the Reynolds stress and mean velocity fields. Compared with algebraic models discovered by other works, the discovered model performs better in accuracy and generalization capability. The proposed approach provides a promising paradigm for using LLMs to improve turbulence modeling for a given class of flows.</description>

      <title>Averaged equations for disperse two-phase flow with interfacial transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a derivation of the averaged equations governing the motion of dispersed two-phase flows with interfacial transport. We begin by revisiting the two-fluid formulation, as well as the distributional form of the interfacial transport equation which holds on the entire domain. Following this, a general Lagrangian model is introduced, which accounts for the effects of both internal and interfacial properties of the dispersed inclusions (bubbles, droplets, or particles) within a continuous phase. This is achieved by derivation of conservation laws for particle surface and volume-integrated properties. By summing the internal and interfacial conservation laws, we derive a conservation equation for an arbitrary Lagrangian property associated with the inclusion. Notably, the non-convective flux inside the inclusion does not appear in the conservation law using this formulation. We then proceed by deriving the lesser-known conservation equations for the moments of the volume and surface distribution of an arbitrary Lagrangian property. Next, the averaged equations for the dispersed phase are derived through two distinct approaches: the particle-averaged (or Lagrangian) formalism, and the phase-averaged method. One important conclusion of this work is the demonstration of the relationship between the particle-averaged and phase-averaged equations. We show that the dispersed phase-averaged equations can be interpreted as a series expansion of the particle-averaged moment equations. The paper concludes by presenting a ``hybrid'' set of equations, consisting of phase-averaged equations for the continuous fluid phase, complemented by an arbitrary number of moment conservation equations for the dispersed phase.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Performance of 2D Local Inertial Hydrodynamic Models for Urban Drainage and Dam-Break Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate flood modeling is crucial for effective analysis and forecasting. Full momentum hydrodynamic models often require extensive computational time, sometimes exceeding the forecast horizon. In contrast, low-complexity models, like local-inertial approximations, provide accurate results in subcritical flows but may have limited skillfulness in supercritical conditions. This paper explores two main aspects: (i) the impact of urban infrastructure on 2D hydrodynamic modeling without detailed sewer and drainage data, and (ii) the accuracy of 2D local-inertial modeling using three numerical schemes (original formulation, s-centered, and s-upwind) in a dam-break scenario on complex, flat terrain. The HydroPol2D model is benchmarked against HEC-RAS 2D full momentum solver. We present one numerical case study and three real-world scenarios in S\~ao Paulo, Brazil: a detention pond with a $1$ in $100$-year inflow, a highly urbanized catchment with a $1$ in $50$-year hyetograph, and a dam-break scenario threatening a coastal city of nearly 200,000 residents. Results show that the model accurately simulates internal boundary conditions, achieving peak errors under 5\% compared to HEC-RAS 2D. However, neglecting urban infrastructure can lead to a 17.5\% difference in peak discharges at the outlet and significant mismatches in hydrographs, with computational times nearly doubling. The dam-break scenario demonstrates good predictive performance for maximum flood depths (CSI = $0.95$ for the original model, $0.92$ for s-centered, and $0.89$ for s-upwind), though the model's lack of convective inertia results in faster flood wave propagation than the full momentum solver. Notably, HydroPol2D is 23 times faster than HEC-RAS 2D, making it well-suited for simulating dam collapses in forecasting systems and capable of modeling urban drainage infrastructure such as orifices, weirs, and pumps.</description>

Abstract: Cellular locomotion often involves the motion of thin, elastic filaments, such as cilia and flagella, in viscous environments. The manuscript serves as a general introduction to the topic of modelling microscale elastohydrodynamics. We briefly characterise the specific features of biological filaments that affect their propulsion modes, and discuss the theoretical framework for their description, along with selected biological and artificial examples of active systems.</description>

      <title>A Higher-order Hybridisable Discontinuous Galerkin IMEX method for the incompressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The incompressible Euler equations are an important model system in computational fluid dynamics. Fast high-order methods for the solution of this time-dependent system of partial differential equations are of particular interest: due to their exponential convergence in the polynomial degree they can make efficient use of computational resources. To address this challenge we describe a novel timestepping method which combines a hybridised Discontinuous Galerkin method for the spatial discretisation with IMEX timestepping schemes, thus achieving high-order accuracy in both space and time. The computational bottleneck is the solution of a (block-) sparse linear system to compute updates to pressure and velocity at each stage of the IMEX integrator. Following Chorin's projection approach, this update of the velocity and pressure fields is split into two stages. As a result, the hybridised equation for the implicit pressure-velocity problem is reduced to the well-known system which arises in hybridised mixed formulations of the Poisson- or diffusion problem and for which efficient multigrid preconditioners have been developed. Splitting errors can be reduced systematically by embedding this update into a preconditioned Richardson iteration. The accuracy and efficiency of the new method is demonstrated numerically for two time-dependent testcases that have been previously studied in the literature.</description>

      <title>Drag and torque coefficients of a translating particle with slip at a gas-liquid interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of colloid-size particles trapped at a liquid interface is an extensively studied problem owing to its relevance to a wide range of engineering applications. Here we investigate the impact of interfacial deformations on the hydrodynamic force and torque exerted on a spherical particle with surface slip moving along a gas-liquid interface. Following a two-parameter asymptotic modeling approach, we perturb the interface from its planar state and apply the Lorentz reciprocal theorem to the zeroth and first-order approximations to analytically calculate the drag and torque on the particle. This allows us to explicitly account for the effect of physical parameters like the three-phase contact angle, the Bond number, and the slip coefficient on the particle motion. In addition, we study the interactions between two translating and rotating particles at a large separation. The interaction forces and torques exerted by the flow-induced deformations are calculated via the linear superposition approximation, where the interaction forces are identified as dipolar in terms of the azimuthal angle.</description>

      <title>Effective osmotic pressure of foams in short-term dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foams exhibit absorptive properties and are widely used for cleaning contaminants, oil recovery, and selective mineral extraction via froth flotation. Although foam absorption has historically been linked to equilibrium osmotic pressure, empirical observations show that drainage occurs at levels much lower than theoretical predictions. In this study, we investigate the effective osmotic pressure in foams. The experimental findings indicate that effective osmotic pressure is primarily influenced by short-term dynamics and is governed by the yield stress rather than equilibrium osmotic pressure. Gravity-induced flow drives bubble movement downward, subjecting the lower bubbles to increased pressure. Once the pressure exerted by the solution exceeds the yield stress, internal bubble rearrangement occurs, and drainage is promoted by the relaxation of inter-bubble repulsive forces. In contrast, below the yield stress, these repulsive forces suppress drainage. While foams have traditionally been modeled as immobile porous media, the reality involves kinematic coupling between the solution and the bubbles, which establishes yield stress as the key factor in determining effective osmotic pressure. This framework is also relevant to the dynamics of soft jammed systems, such as blood flow in vessels, emulsions, and biological tissues, offering significant advancements in the understanding of soft jammed system behavior.</description>

      <title>Reducing turbulent transport in tokamaks by combining intrinsic rotation and the low momentum diffusivity regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the analysis of a large number of high-fidelity nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, we propose a novel strategy to improve confinement in tokamak plasmas by combining up-down asymmetric flux surface shaping with the Low Momentum Diffusivity (LMD) regime. We show that the intrinsic momentum flux driven by up-down asymmetry creates strong flow shear in the LMD regime that can significantly reduce energy transport, increasing the critical gradient by up to $25\%$. In contrast to traditional methods for generating flow shear, such as neutral beam injection, this approach requires no external momentum source and is expected to scale well to large fusion devices. The experimental applicability of this strategy in spherical tokamaks is addressed via simulations by considering actual equilibria from MAST and a preliminary equilibrium from SMART.</description>

      <title>Topographic forcing of submesoscale instability in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subpolar frontal zones are characterized by energetic storms, intense seasonal cycles, and close connectivity with surrounding continental shelf topography. At the same time, predicting the ocean state depends on appropriate partition of resolved and parameterized dynamics, the latter of which requires understanding the dynamical processes generating diffusivity throughout the water column. While submesoscale frontal instabilities are shown to produce turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and mixing in the surface boundary layer (SBL) of the global ocean, their development in complex dynamical regimes (e.g., elevated preexisting turbulence, large ageostrophic shear, or in proximity to topographic boundaries) is less understood. This study investigates the development of submesoscale instabilities, i.e. symmetric instability (SI) and centrifugal instability (CI), near topographic boundaries using a hindcast model of the Drake Passage and Scotia Sea region. The model suggests subsurface SI and CI are widespread along the northern continental margins of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) due to topographic shearing of the anticyclonic side of Polar Front jets. Forced instabilities may facilitate persistent mixing along Namuncur\'a - Burwood Bank, as well as in other southern (northern) hemisphere currents with low potential vorticity and a seamount or sloping topography on the left- (right-) downstream side.</description>

      <title>Prograde and meandering wall modes in rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection with conducting walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use direct numerical simulations to study convection in rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection in horizontally confined geometries of a given aspect ratio, with the walls held at fixed temperatures. We show that this arrangement is unconditionally unstable to flow that takes the form of wall-adjacent convection rolls. For wall temperatures close to the temperatures of the upper or lower boundaries, we show that the base state undergoes a Hopf bifurcation to a state comprised of spatio-temporal oscillations--`wall modes'--precessing in a retrograde direction. We study the saturated nonlinear state of these modes, and show that the velocity boundary conditions at the upper and lower boundaries are crucial to the formation and propagation of the wall modes: asymmetric velocity boundary conditions at the upper and lower boundaries can lead to prograde wall modes, while stress-free boundary conditions at both walls can lead to wall modes that have no preferred direction of propagation.</description>

      <title>Immersion freezing in particle-based aerosol-cloud microphysics: a probabilistic perspective on singular and time-dependent models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud droplets containing ice-nucleating particles (INPs) may freeze at temperatures above the homogeneous freezing threshold temperature. This process, referred to as immersion freezing, is one of the modulators of aerosol-cloud interactions in the Earth's atmosphere. In modeling studies, immersion freezing is often described using either so-called "singular" or "time-dependent" parameterizations. Here, we juxtapose both approaches and discuss them in the context of probabilistic particle-based cloud microphysics modeling. First, using a box model, we contrast how both parameterizations respond to different idealized ambient cooling rate profiles and quantify the impact of the polydispersity of the immersed surface spectrum on the frozen fraction evolution. Second, using a prescribed-flow two-dimensional cloud model, we illustrate the implications of applying the singular model in simulations with flow regimes relevant to ambient cloud conditions rather than to the cloud-chamber experiments on which these parameterizations are built upon. We discuss the critical role of the attribute-space sampling strategy for particle-based model simulations in modeling heterogeneous ice nucleation which is contingent on the presence of relatively sparse immersed INPs. The key takeaways include: (i) The singular approach, constituting a time-integrated form of a more general time-dependent approach, is only applicable under a limited range of ambient cooling rates. (ii) The time-dependent approach, especially when based on water-activity, is suitable for integration with particle-based model components of detailed aerosol composition and collisional growth/breakup. (iii) A flow-coupled aerosol-budget-resolving simulation shows the benefits and challenges of modeling cloud condensation nuclei activation and immersion freezing on insoluble ice nuclei with super-particle methods.</description>

      <title>Consistent multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method for the volume averaged Navier-Stokes equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel multi-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for solving the volume averaged Navier-Stokes equations (VANSE). Different from the approach given in [1], this method is rooted in the widely-adopted density equilibrium distribution, which provides possibility for simulating scenarios where fluid compressibility cannot be ignored, e.g., thermal and multiphase flows. The Chapman-Enskog analysis is presented to confirm the consistency of this scheme at macroscopic level. Some numerical experiments further demonstrate that it achieves second-order convergence and exhibits better numerical performance over previous schemes as reported [2-4].</description>

      <title>Rapid aerodynamic prediction of swept wings via physics-embedded transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning-based models provide a promising way to rapidly acquire transonic swept wing flow fields but suffer from large computational costs in establishing training datasets. Here, we propose a physics-embedded transfer learning framework to efficiently train the model by leveraging the idea that a three-dimensional flow field around wings can be analyzed with two-dimensional flow fields around cross-sectional airfoils. An airfoil aerodynamics prediction model is pretrained with airfoil samples. Then, an airfoil-to-wing transfer model is fine-tuned with a few wing samples to predict three-dimensional flow fields based on two-dimensional results on each spanwise cross section. Sweep theory is embedded when determining the corresponding airfoil geometry and operating conditions, and to obtain the sectional airfoil lift coefficient, which is one of the operating conditions, the low-fidelity vortex lattice method and data-driven methods are proposed and evaluated. Compared to a nontransfer model, introducing the pretrained model reduces the error by 30%, while introducing sweep theory further reduces the error by 9%. When reducing the dataset size, less than half of the wing training samples are need to reach the same error level as the nontransfer framework, which makes establishing the model much easier.</description>

      <title>Effect of span size in Scale Resolving Simulations of airfoil stall and post-stall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In aerodynamic design, the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools has long relied on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Unsteady RANS (URANS) turbulence models. However, these methods face limitations in predicting massively separated flow regions. As a result, there is growing emphasis on scale-resolving methods such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES), which have become more feasible due to advancements in computational resources. This study focuses on the LES of airfoil flows, specifically analyzing the influence of the spanwise extent of the computational domain on aerodynamic forces. We examine the NREL S826 airfoil at a chord Reynolds number of $Re_c = 10^5$ under different angles of attack, with simulations performed using the PyFR solver. Our results highlight the importance of adequate spanwise resolution, particularly in post-stall flow conditions, where larger span sizes are necessary to accurately capture three-dimensional flow structures. The findings suggest that for certain flow regimes, traditional two-dimensional statistical representations may not be sufficient, necessitating further investigation into 3D flow phenomena.</description>

      <title>Extending Kolmogorov Theory to Polymeric Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The addition of polymers fundamentally alters the dynamics of turbulent flows in a way that defies Kolmogorov predictions. However, we now present a formalism that reconciles our understanding of polymeric turbulence with the classical Kolmogorov phenomenology. This is achieved by relying on an appropriate form of the K\'{a}rm\'{a}n-Howarth-Monin-Hill relation, which motivates the definition of extended velocity increments and the associated structure functions, by accounting for the influence of the polymers on the flow. We show, both analytically and numerically, that the ${\rm p}$th-order extended structure functions exhibit a power-law behaviour in the elasto-inertial range of scales, with exponents deviating from the analytically predicted value of ${\rm p}/3$. These deviations are readily accounted for by considering local averages of the total dissipation, rather than global averages, in analogy with the refined similarity hypotheses of Kolmogorov for classical Newtonian turbulence. We also demonstrate the scale-invariance of multiplier statistics of extended velocity increments, whose distributions collapse well for a wide range of scales.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for Rayleigh-B\'enard convection between Navier-slip boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Rayeigh-B\'enard convection problem between Navier-slip fixed-temperature boundary conditions and present a new upper bound for the Nusselt number. The result, based on a localization principle for the Nusselt number and an interpolation bound, exploits the regularity of the flow. On one hand our method yields a shorter proof of the celebrated result in Whitehead &amp; Doering (2011) in the case of free-slip boundary conditions. On the other hand, its combination with a new, refined estimate for the pressure gives a substantial improvement of the interpolation bounds in Drivas et al. (2022) for slippery boundaries. A rich description of the scaling behaviour arises from our result: depending on the magnitude of the Prandtl number and slip-length, our upper bounds indicate five possible scaling laws: $\textit{Nu} \sim (L_s^{-1}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{3}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim (L_s^{-\frac{2}{5}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{5}{13}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Ra}^{\frac{5}{12}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Pr}^{-\frac{1}{6}} (L_s^{-\frac{4}{3}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Pr}^{-\frac{1}{6}} (L_s^{-\frac{1}{3}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{2}}$</description>

      <title>Finite-difference-informed graph network for solving steady-state incompressible flows on block-structured grids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in deep learning have enabled physics-informed neural networks to solve partial differential equations. Numerical differentiation using the finite-difference (FD) method is efficient in physics-constrained designs, even in parameterized settings. In traditional computational fluid dynamics(CFD), body-fitted block-structured grids are often employed for complex flow cases when obtaining FD solutions. However, convolution operators in convolutional neural networks for FD are typically limited to single-block grids. To address this issue, \blueText{graphs and graph networks are used} to learn flow representations across multi-block-structured grids. \blueText{A graph convolution-based FD method (GC-FDM) is proposed} to train graph networks in a label-free physics-constrained manner, enabling differentiable FD operations on unstructured graph outputs. To demonstrate model performance from single- to multi-block-structured grids, \blueText{the parameterized steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved} for a lid-driven cavity flow and the flows around single and double circular cylinder configurations. When compared to a CFD solver under various boundary conditions, the proposed method achieves a relative error in velocity field predictions on the order of $10^{-3}$. Furthermore, the proposed method reduces training costs by approximately 20\% compared to a physics-informed neural network. \blueText{To} further verify the effectiveness of GC-FDM in multi-block processing, \blueText{a 30P30N airfoil geometry is considered} and the \blueText{predicted} results are reasonable compared with those given by CFD. \blueText{Finally, the applicability of GC-FDM to three-dimensional (3D) case is tested using a 3D cavity geometry.</description>

      <title>Using Symmetries to Investigate the Complete Integrability, Solitary Wave Solutions and Solitons of the Gardner Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a scaling symmetry, it is shown how to compute polynomial conservation laws, generalized symmetries, recursion operators, Lax pairs, and bilinear forms of polynomial nonlinear partial differential equations thereby establishing their complete integrability. The Gardner equation is chosen as the key example for it comprises both the Korteweg-de Vries and modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equations. The Gardner and Miura transformations which connect these equations are also computed using the concept of scaling homogeneity. Exact solitary wave solutions and solitons of the Gardner equation are derived using Hirota's method and other direct methods. The nature of these solutions depends on the sign of the cubic term in the Gardner equation and the underlying mKdV equation. It is shown that flat (table-top) waves of large amplitude only occur when the sign of the cubic nonlinearity is negative (defocusing case) whereas the focusing Gardner equation has the standard elastically colliding solitons. The paper's aim is to provide a review of integrability properties and solutions of the Gardner equation and illustrate the applicability of the scaling symmetry approach. The methods and algorithms used in this paper have been implemented in Mathematica but can be adapted for major computer algebra systems.</description>
