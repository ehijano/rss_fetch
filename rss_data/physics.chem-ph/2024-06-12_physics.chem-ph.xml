      <title>Half Heusler alloy CoVSn as self-supported electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in electrocatalysis for clean hydrogen fuel generation, the transition from concept to commercialization faces challenges due to the instability of electrocatalysts. This study delves into the exploration of a structurally and mechanically robust half-Heusler alloy, CoVSn, as an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen production. The synthesis of CoVSn was achieved using the arc-melting technique and optimized successfully into a cubic structure - a previously unattained and highly challenging feat. The resulting electrode, cut from the obtained CoVSn pellet, served as a self-supported electrocatalyst and initially generates a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 244 mV. Remarkably, this overpotential decreased uniquely over time, reaches 202 mV after a durability testing of 12 hours, while maintaining its crystal structure integrity after the electrocatalysis process. This progressive enhancement in catalytic activity and structural stability underscores the significance of this research. The synergistic effect between Co and V atoms as pivotal active centers for hydrogen generation was evident, further enhanced by formation of high valance metal sites Co2O3 and V2O3 during the hydrogen evolution reaction. In essence, this study confirms the stability and promise of CoVSn in hydrogen generation, paving the way for exploring additional self-supported ternary intermetallics to enhance water-splitting efficiency.</description>

      <title>Anomalous propagators and the particle-particle channel: Hedin's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hedin's equations provide an elegant route to compute the exact one-body Green's function (or propagator) via the self-consistent iteration of a set of non-linear equations.
  Its first-order approximation, known as $GW$, corresponds to a resummation of ring diagrams and has shown to be extremely successful in physics and chemistry. Systematic improvement is possible, although challenging, via the introduction of vertex corrections.
  Considering anomalous propagators and an external pairing potential, we derive a new self-consistent set of closed equations equivalent to the famous Hedin equations but having as a first-order approximation the particle-particle (pp) $T$-matrix approximation where one performs a resummation of the ladder diagrams.
  This pp version of Hedin's equations offers a way to go systematically beyond the $T$-matrix approximation by accounting for low-order pp vertex corrections.</description>

      <title>One-particle operator representation over two-particle basis sets for relativistic QED computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with two-spin-1/2-fermion relativistic quantum mechanics, and it is about the construction of one-particle projectors using an inherently two(many)-particle, `explicitly correlated' basis representation, necessary for good numerical convergence of the interaction energy. It is demonstrated that a faithful representation of the one-particle operators, which appear in intermediate but essential computational steps, can be constructed over a many-particle basis set by accounting for the full Hilbert space beyond the physically relevant anti-symmetric subspace. Applications of this development can be foreseen for the computation of quantum-electrodynamics corrections for a correlated relativistic reference state and high-precision relativistic computations of medium-to-high-$Z$ helium-like systems, for which other two-particle projection techniques are unreliable.</description>

      <title>On the spectroscopy of phosphaalkynes: Millimeter- and submillimeter wave study of C2H5CP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ethyl phosphaethyne, C2H5CP, has been characterized spectroscopically in the gas phase for the first time, employing millimeter- and submillimeter-wave spectroscopy in the frequency regime from 75 to 760 GHz. Spectroscopic detection and analysis was guided by high-level quantum-chemical calculations of molecular structures and force fields performed at the coupled-cluster singles and doubles level extended by a perturbative correction for the contribution from triple excitations, CCSD(T), in combination with large basis sets. Besides the parent isotopologue, the singly substituted 13C species were observed in natural abundance up to frequencies as high as 500 GHz. Despite the comparably low astronomical abundance of phosphorus, phosphaalkynes, R--CP, such as C2H5CP are promising candidates for future radio astronomical detection.</description>

      <title>From many-body ab initio to effective excitonic models: a versatile mapping approach including environmental embedding effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an original multi-state projective diabatization scheme based on the Green's function formalism that allows the systematic mapping of many-body ab initio calculations onto effective excitonic models. This method inherits the ability of the Bethe-Salpeter equation to describe Frenkel molecular excitons and intermolecular charge-transfer states equally well, as well as the possibility for an effective description of environmental effects in a QM/MM framework. The latter is found to be a crucial element in order to obtain accurate model parameters for condensed phases and to ensure their transferability to excitonic models for extended systems. The method is presented through a series of examples illustrating its quality, robustness, and internal consistency.</description>

      <title>Targeting spectroscopic accuracy for dispersion bound systems from ab initio techniques: translational eigenstates of Ne@C$_{70}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the endofullerene system Ne@C$_{70}$, by constructing a three-dimensional Potential Energy Surface (PES) describing the translational motion of the Ne atom. We compare a plethora of electronic structure methods including: MP2, SCS-MP2, SOS-MP2, RPA@PBE, C(HF)-RPA, which were previously used for He@C$_{60}$ in J. Chem. Phys. 160, 104303 (2024), alongside B86bPBE-25X-XDM and B86bPBE-50X-XDM. The reduction in symmetry moving from C$_{60}$ to C$_{70}$ introduces a double well potential along the anisotropic direction, which forms a test of the sensitivity and effectiveness of the methods. Due to the large cost of these calculations, the PES is interpolated using Gaussian Process Regression due to its effectiveness with sparse training data. The nuclear Hamiltonian is diagonalised using a symmetrised double minimum basis set outlined in J. Chem. Phys. 159, 164308 (2023), with translational energies having error bars $\pm 1$ and $\pm 2$ cm$^{-1}$. We quantify the shape of the ground state wavefunction by considering its prolateness and kurtosis, and compare the eigenfunctions between electronic structure methods from their Hellinger distance. We find no consistency between electronic structure methods as they find a range of barrier heights and minima positions of the double well, and different translational eigenspectra which also differ from the Lennard-Jones (LJ) PES given in J. Chem. Phys. 101, 2126,2140 (1994). We find that generating effective LJ parameters for each electronic structure method cannot reproduce the full PES, nor recreate the eigenstates and this suggests that the LJ form of the PES, while simple, may not be best suited to describe these systems. Even though MP2 and RPA@PBE performed best for He@C$_{60}$, due to the lack of concordance between all electronic structure methods we require more experimental data in order to properly validate the choice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for predicting molecular properties with high accuracy without the need for extensive pre-training. Employing ensemble learning and supervised fine-tuning of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet, our method demonstrates significant effectiveness compared to existing advanced models. Crucially, it addresses the issue of limited computational resources faced by experimental groups, enabling them to accurately predict molecular properties. This innovation provides a cost-effective and resource-efficient solution, potentially advancing further research in the molecular domain.</description>

      <title>MPSDynamics.jl: Tensor network simulations for finite-temperature (non-Markovian) open quantum system dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MPSDynamics.jl package provides an easy to use interface for performing open quantum systems simulations at zero and finite temperatures. The package has been developed with the aim of studying non-Markovian open system dynamics using the state-of-the-art numerically exact Thermalized-Time Evolving Density operator with Orthonormal Polynomials Algorithm (T-TEDOPA) based on environment chain mapping. The simulations rely on a tensor network representation of the quantum states as matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network (TTN) states. Written in the Julia programming language, MPSDynamics.jl is a versatile open-source package providing a choice of several variants of the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) method for time evolution (including novel bond-adaptive one-site algorithms). The package also provides strong support for the measurement of single and multi-site observables, as well as the storing and logging of data, which makes it a useful tool for the study of many-body physics. It currently handles long-range interactions, time-dependent Hamiltonians, multiple environments, bosonic and fermionic environments, and joint system-environment observables.</description>

      <title>Localized Orbital Scaling Correction with Linear Response in Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07351v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful tool for quantum-mechanical calculations, but practical calculations suffer systematic errors like incorrect charge densities and total energies in molecular dissociation, underestimated band gaps in bulk materials, and poor energy level alignment at interfaces. These problems are due to delocalization error. The localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) removes delocalization error in molecules effectively, but screening of the Hartree-exchange-correlation response is necessary to correct it in materials. We introduce LOSC with system-dependent linear-response screening (lrLOSC), which effectively corrects delocalization error in semiconductors and insulators. After correcting for electron-phonon effects, the band gaps of eleven test systems are predicted with a mean absolute error of 0.28 eV, comparable to self-consistent $GW$. This method represents a significant step forward in correcting densities and total energies across system sizes and solving the band gap and energy level alignment problems entirely within the DFT framework.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev Approximated Variational Coupled Cluster for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach to approximately implement the variational coupled cluster (VCC) theory on quantum computers, which struggles with exponential scaling of computational costs on classical computers. To this end, we employ expanding the exponential cluster operator using Chebyshev polynomials and introduce two methods: the Chebyshev approximated VCC (C$^d$-VCC) and the Hermitian-part Chebyshev approximated VCC (HC$^d$-VCC), where $d$ indicates the maximum degree of the Chebyshev polynomials. The latter method decomposes the cluster operator into anti-Hermitian and Hermitian parts, with the anti-Hermitian part represented by the disentangled unitary coupled cluster ansatz and the Hermitian part approximated using Chebyshev expansion. We illustrate the implementation of the HC$^d$-VCC in a quantum circuit using the quantum singular value transformation technique. Numerical simulations show that the C$^d$-VCC rapidly converges to the exact VCC with increasing truncation degree $d$, and the HC$^d$-VCC effectively reduces the Chebyshev expansion error compared to the C$^d$-VCC. The HC$^d$-VCC method for realizing non-unitary coupled cluster wave functions on quantum computers is expected to be useful for initial state preparation on quantum computers and efficient tomography of the quantum state for post-processing on classical computers after quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Interacting-bath dynamical embedding for capturing non-local electron correlation in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative simulation of electronic structure of solids requires the treatment of local and non-local electron correlations on an equal footing. Dynamical mean-field theory, a widely-used quantum embedding algorithm that assumes local self-energy approximation, is challenging to extend to capture long-range electron correlation. In this work, we present a new formulation of Green's function embedding that, instead of embedding the impurity in non-interacting bath through the hybridization function, derives bath representation with general two-particle interactions in a fully ab initio and systematically improvable manner. The resulting interacting-bath dynamical embedding theory (ibDET) simulates local and non-local self-energies using high-level quantum chemistry solvers, such as the coupled-cluster theory. We demonstrate that ibDET combined with the GW theory (GW+ibDET) achieves good agreements with experimental band structure and photoemission spectra while preserving translational symmetry across a range of semiconducting, insulating, and metallic materials. Furthermore, our approach allows quantifying the role of non-local electron correlation in determining spectral properties of materials and addressing the long-standing debate over the bandwidth narrowing of metallic sodium.</description>

Abstract: Properties of erfonium, a Hooke atom with the Coulomb interaction potential $1/r$ replaced by a non-singular $\text{erf}(\mu r)/r$ potential are investigated. The structure of the Hooke atom potential and properties of its energy spectrum, relative to the ones of the spherical harmonic oscillator and of harmonium, are analyzed. It is shown, that at a certain value of $\mu$ the system changes its behavior from a harmonium-like regime to a harmonic-oscillator-like regime.</description>
