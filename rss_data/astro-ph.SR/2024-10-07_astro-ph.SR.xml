      <title>Mixed-mode coupling in the Red Clump I. Standard single star models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of global, resonant oscillation modes in red giant stars offers valuable insights into their internal structures. In this study, we investigate in detail the information we can recover on the structural properties of core-helium burning (CHeB) stars by examining how the coupling between gravity- and pressure-mode cavities depends on several stellar properties, including mass, chemical composition, and evolutionary state. Using the structure of models computed with the stellar evolution code MESA we calculate the coupling coefficient implementing analytical expressions, which are appropriate for the strong coupling regime and the structure of the evanescent region in CHeB stars. Our analysis reveals a notable anti-correlation between the coupling coefficient and both the mass and metallicity of stars in the regime $M \lesssim 1.8~\mathrm{M}_\odot$, in agreement with Kepler data. We attribute this correlation primarily to variations in the density contrast between the stellar envelope and core. The strongest coupling is expected thus for red-horizontal branch stars, partially stripped stars, and stars in the higher-mass range exhibiting solar-like oscillations ($M \gtrsim 1.8~\mathrm{M}_\odot$). While our investigation emphasises some limitations of current analytical expressions, it also presents promising avenues. The frequency dependence of the coupling coefficient emerges as a potential tool for reconstructing the detailed stratification of the evanescent region.</description>

      <title>Thorne-\.Zytkow Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting binary star systems play a critical role in many areas of astrophysics. One interesting example of a binary merger product are Thorne-\.Zytkow Objects (T\.ZOs), stars that look like red supergiants but contain neutron stars at their cores. T\.ZOs were theorized nearly five decades ago, and significant work has gone into understanding the physics of their formation, evolution, and stability. Several searches for T\.ZO candidates have also been carried out. Whether or not T\.ZOs could even exist or if they would be stable after formation has also been investigated. Understanding the existence and possible prevalence of T\.ZOs would have important effects on our understanding of binary evolution, stellar mergers, and inform binary population synthesis models. In this chapter, we review the formation channels, evolution and structure, final fates, and observable signatures of T\.ZOs, as well as candidates in the literature, from the inception of T\.ZO theory to recent progress in the field.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Truly Young high-$\alpha$ Dwarf Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of high-$\alpha$ stars with inferred ages &lt; 6 Gyr has been confirmed recently with large spectroscopic and photometric surveys. However, stellar mergers or binary interactions can induce properties associated with young ages, such as high mass, rapid rotation, or high activity, even in old populations. Literature studies have confirmed that at least some of these apparently young stars are old merger products. However, none have ruled out the possibility of genuinely young high-$\alpha$ stars. Because cool GKM dwarfs spin down, rapid rotation can be used to indicate youth. In this paper, we provide strong evidence that truly young high-$\alpha$ stars exist by studying high-$\alpha$ rotators in the Kepler and K2 field with abundance measurements from GALAH and APOGEE. After excluding close binaries using radial velocity (RV) measurements from Gaia DR3 and multi-epoch RVs from APOGEE, we find a total of 70 high-$\alpha$ rapid rotators with periods ~10-30 days, 29 of which have lithium measurements from GALAH, indicating that they have not gone through past mass transfer or stellar merger events. We identify 10 young high-$\alpha$ candidates with no signs of merger-induced mixing or close companions. One clear example is a G dwarf with a measurable rotation and an age of 1.98$^{+0.12}_{-0.28}$ Gyr that is likely a single star with multiple RV measurements from APOGEE, has significant lithium detection from GALAH (A(Li) = 1.79), and has no signs of planet engulfment.</description>

      <title>Chromospheric Mg I Emission Lines of Pre-Main-Sequence Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reveal details of the internal structure, the relationship between chromospheric activity and the Rossby number has been extensively examined for main-sequence stars. For active pre-main sequence (PMS) stars, it is suggested that the level of activity be assessed using optically thin emission lines, such as Mg I. We aim to detect Mg I chromospheric emission lines from PMS stars and determine whether the chromosphere is activated by the dynamo process or by mass accretion from protoplanetary disks. We analyzed high-resolution optical spectra of $64\ $PMS stars obtained with Very Large Telescope (VLT)/X-shooter and UVES and examined the infrared Ca II (8542 A) and Mg I (8807 A) emission lines. To detect the weak chromospheric emission lines, we determined the atmospheric parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log\ g$) and the degree of veiling of the PMS stars by comparing the observed spectra with photospheric model spectra. After subtracting the photospheric model spectrum from the PMS spectrum, we detected Ca II and Mg I as emission lines. The strengths of the Mg I emission lines in PMS stars with no veiling are comparable to those in zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) stars if both types of stars have similar Rossby numbers. The Mg I emission lines in these PMS stars are thought to be formed by a dynamo process similar to that in ZAMS stars. In contrast, the Mg I emission lines in PMS stars with veiling are stronger than those in ZAMS stars. These objects are believed to have protoplanetary disks, where mass accretion generates shocks near the photosphere, heating the chromosphere. The chromosphere of PMS stars is activated not only by the dynamo process but also by mass accretion.</description>

      <title>Formation and Eruption of Hot Channel Magnetic Flux Rope in Nested Double Null Magnetic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coronal magnetic topology significantly affects the outcome of magnetic flux rope (MFR) eruptions. The recently reported nested double null magnetic system remains unclear as to how it affects MFR eruptions. Using observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope and the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we studied the formation and successful eruption of a hot channel MFR from NOAA active region AR12173 on 2014 September 28. We observed that a hot channel MFR formed and erupted as a coronal mass ejection (CME), and the magnetic field of the source region was a nested double null magnetic system in which an inner magnetic null point system was nested by an outer fan-spine magnetic system. Observational analysis suggests that the origin of the MFR was due to magnetic reconnection at the inner null point, which was triggered by the photospheric swirling motions. The long-term shearing motion in the source region throughout around 26 hours might accumulate enough energy to power the eruption. Since previous studies showed that MFR eruptions from nested double null magnetic systems often result in weak jets and stalled or failed eruptions, it is hard to understand the generation of the large-scale CME in our case. A detailed comparison with previous studies reveals that the birth location of the MFR relative to the inner null point might be the critical physical factor for determining whether an MFR can erupt successfully or not in such a particular nested double null magnetic system.</description>

      <title>Potential Chromospheric Evaporation in A M-dwarf's Flare Triggered by Einstein Probe Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although flares from late-type main-sequence stars have been frequently detected in multi-wavelength, the associated dynamical process has been rarely reported so far. Here, we report follow-up observations of an X-ray transient triggered by WXT onboard the Einstein Probe at UT08:45:08 in 2024, May 7. The photometry in multi-bands and time-resolved spectroscopy started at 3 and 7.5 hours after the trigger, respectively, which enables us to identify the transient as a flare of the M-dwarf 2MASS J12184187-0609123. The bolometric energy released in the flare is estimated to be $\sim10^{36}\ \mathrm{erg}$ from its X-ray light curve. The H$\alpha$ emission-line profile obtained at about 7 hours after the trigger shows an evident blue asymmetry with a maximum velocity of $200-250\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. The blue wing can be likely explained by the chromospheric temperature (cool) upflow associated with chromospheric evaporation, in which the mass of the evaporating plasma is estimated to be $1.2\times10^{18}$g. In addition, a prominence eruption with an estimated mass of $7\times10^{15}\mathrm{g}&lt;M_{\mathrm{p}}&lt;7\times10^{18}\mathrm{g}$ can not be entirely excluded.</description>

      <title>Novel Constraints on Companions to the Helix Nebula Central Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Helix is a visually striking and the nearest planetary nebula, yet any companions responsible for its asymmetric morphology have yet to be identified. In 2020, low-amplitude photometric variations with a periodicity of 2.8 d were reported based on Cycle 1 TESS observations. In this work, with the inclusion of two additional sectors, these periodic light curves are compared with lcurve simulations of irradiated companions in such an orbit. Based on the light curve modelling, there are two representative solutions: i) a Jupiter-sized body with 0.102 Rsol and an arbitrarily small orbital inclination i=1 deg, and ii) a 0.021 Rsol exoplanet with i approx. 25 deg, essentially aligned with the Helix Nebular inclination. Irradiated substellar companion models with equilibrium temperature 4970 K are constructed and compared with existing optical spectra and infrared photometry, where Jupiter-sized bodies can be ruled out, but companions modestly larger than Neptune are still allowed. Additionally, any spatially-unresolved companions are constrained based on the multi-wavelength, photometric spectral energy distribution of the central star. No ultracool dwarf companion earlier than around L5 is permitted within roughly 1200 au, leaving only faint white dwarfs and cold brown dwarfs as possible surviving architects of the nebular asymmetries. While a planetary survivor is a tantalizing possibility, it cannot be ruled out that the light curve modulation is stellar in nature, where any substellar companion requires confirmation and may be possible with JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Spectral Characteristics of a Rotating Solar Prominence in Multiple Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present synthetic spectra corresponding to a 2.5D magnetohydrodynamical simulation of a rotating prominence in the Ca II 8542 \r{A}, H$\alpha$, Ca II K, Mg II k, Ly $\alpha$, and Ly $\beta$ lines. The prominence rotation resulted from angular momentum conservation within a flux rope where asymmetric heating imposed a net rotation prior to the thermal-instability driven condensation phase. The spectra were created using a library built on the Lightweaver framework called Promweaver, which provides boundary conditions for incorporating the limb-darkened irradiation of the solar disk on isolated structures such as prominences. Our spectra show distinctive rotational signatures for the Mg II k, Ly $\alpha$, and Ly $\beta$ lines, even in the presence of complex, turbulent solar atmospheric conditions. However, these signals are hardly detectable for the Ca II 8542 \r{A}, H$\alpha$, Ca II K spectral lines. Most notably we find only a very faint rotational signal in the H$\alpha$ line, thus reigniting the discussion on the existence of sustained rotation in prominences.</description>

      <title>Variability of Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae with the Zwicky Transient Facility. I. Methods, Short-Timescale Variables, Binary Candidates, and the Unusual Nucleus of WeSb 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past several decades, time-series photometry of CSPNe has yielded significant results including, but not limited to, discoveries of nearly 100 binary systems, insights into pulsations and winds in young white dwarfs, and studies of stars undergoing very late thermal pulses. We have undertaken a systematic study of optical photometric variability of cataloged CSPNe, using the epochal photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). By applying appropriate variability metrics, we arrive at a list of 94 significantly variable CSPNe. Based on the timescales of the light-curve activity, we classify the variables broadly into short- and long-timescale variables. In this first paper in this series, we focus on the former, which is the majority class comprising 83 objects. We infer periods for six sources for the first time, and recover several known periodic variables. Among the aperiodic sources, most exhibit a jitter around a median flux with a stable amplitude, and a few show outbursts. We draw attention to WeSb 1, which shows a different kind of variability: prominent deep and aperiodic dips, resembling transits from a dust/debris disk. We find strong evidence for a binary nature of WeSb 1 (possibly an A- to G-type companion). The compactness of the emission lines and inferred high electron densities make WeSb 1 a candidate for either an EGB 6-type planetary nucleus, or a symbiotic system inside an evolved planetary nebula, both of which are rare objects. To demonstrate further promise with ZTF, we report three additional newly identified periodic sources that do not appear in the list of highly variable sources. Finally, we also introduce a two-dimensional metric space defined by the von Neumann statistics and Pearson Skew and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying unique variables of astrophysical interest, like WeSb 1.</description>

      <title>A long-duration superflare on the K giant HD 251108</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many giant stars are magnetically active, which causes rotational variability, chromospheric emission lines, and X-ray emission. Large outbursts in these emission features can set limits on the magnetic field strength and thus constrain the mechanism of the underlying dynamo. HD~251108 is a Li-rich active K-type giant. We find a rotational period of 21.3~d with color changes and additional long-term photometric variability. Both can be explained with very stable stellar spots. We followed the decay phase of a superflare for 28 days with NICER and from the ground. We track the flare decay in unprecedented detail in several coronal temperature components. With a peak flux around $10^{34}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ (0.5-4.0~keV) and an exponential decay time of 2.2~days in the early decay phase, this is one of the strongest flares ever observed; yet it follows trends established from samples of smaller flares, for example for the relations between H$\alpha$ and X-ray flux, indicating that the physical process that powers the flare emission is consistent over a large range of flare energies. We estimate a flare loop length about 2-4 times the stellar radius. No evidence is seen for abundance changes during the flare.</description>

      <title>Off-center ignition of sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs does not resolve the tension with the observed $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation of type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are likely the thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen (CO) white-dwarf (WD) stars, but the exact nature of their progenitor systems remains uncertain. Recent studies have suggested that a propagating detonation within a thin helium shell surrounding a sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO core can subsequently trigger a detonation within the core (the double-detonation model, DDM). The resulting explosion resembles a central ignition of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO WD (SCD), which is known to be in tension with the observed $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation, where $t_0$ (the $\gamma$-rays' escape time from the ejecta) is positively correlated with $M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ (the synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass). SCD predicts an anti-correlation between $t_0$ and $M_{\rm{Ni}56}$, with $t_0\mathord{\approx}30\,\textrm{day}$ for luminous ($M_{\rm{Ni}56}\gtrsim0.5\,M_{\odot}$) SNe Ia, while the observed $t_0$ is in the range of 35-45 days. In this study, we apply our recently developed numerical scheme to calculate in 2D the impact of off-center ignition in sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO WD, aiming to better emulate the behavior expected in the DDM scenario. Our calculations of the $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation, which do not require radiation transfer calculations, achieve convergence to within a few percent with a numerical resolution of $\mathord{\sim}1\,\rm{km}$. We find that the results only slightly depend on the ignition location, mirroring the SCD model, and consequently, the discrepancy with the observed $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation remains unresolved.</description>

      <title>Ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH): a potential significant sulfur sink in interstellar ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sulfur is depleted with respect to its cosmic standard abundance in dense star-forming regions. It has been suggested that this depletion is caused by the freeze-out of sulfur on interstellar dust grains, but the observed abundances and upper limits of sulfur-bearing ices remain too low to account for all of the missing sulfur. Toward the same environments, a strong absorption feature at 6.85 $\mu$m is observed, but its long-standing assignment to the NH4+ cation remains tentative. We investigate the plausibility of NH4SH salt serving as a sulfur reservoir and a carrier of the 6.85 $\mu$m band in interstellar ices by characterizing its IR signatures and apparent band strengths in water-rich laboratory ice mixtures and using this laboratory data to constrain NH4SH abundances in observations of 4 protostars and 2 cold dense clouds. The observed 6.85 $\mu$m feature is fit well with the laboratory NH4SH:H2O ice spectra. NH4+ column densities obtained from the 6.85 $\mu$m band range from 8-23% with respect to H2O toward the sample of protostars and dense clouds. The redshift of the 6.85 $\mu$m feature correlates with higher abundances of NH4+ with respect to H2O in both the laboratory data presented here and observational data of dense clouds and protostars. The apparent band strength of the SH- feature is likely too low for the feature to be detectable in the spectrally busy 3.9 $\mu$m region, but the 5.3 $\mu$m NH4+ $\nu_{4}$ + SH- R combination mode may be an alternative means of detection. Its tentative assignment adds to mounting evidence supporting the presence of NH4+ salts in ices and is the first tentative observation of the SH- anion toward interstellar ices. If the majority ($\gtrsim$80-85%) of the NH4+ cations quantified toward the investigated sources in this work are bound to SH- anions, then NH4SH salts could account for up to 17-18% of their sulfur budgets.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRISS reveals the water-rich "steam world" atmosphere of GJ 9827 d</title>

Abstract: With sizable volatile envelopes but smaller radii than the solar system ice giants, sub-Neptunes have been revealed as one of the most common types of planet in the galaxy. While the spectroscopic characterization of larger sub-Neptunes (2.5-4R$_\oplus$) has revealed hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, smaller sub-Neptunes (1.6--2.5R$_\oplus$) could either host thin, rapidly evaporating hydrogen-rich atmospheres or be stable metal-rich "water worlds" with high mean molecular weight atmospheres and a fundamentally different formation and evolutionary history. Here, we present the 0.6--2.8$\mu$m JWST NIRISS/SOSS transmission spectrum of GJ 9827 d, the smallest (1.98 R$_\oplus$) warm (T$_\mathrm{eq, A_B=0.3} \sim 620$K) sub-Neptune where atmospheric absorbers have been detected to date. Our two transit observations with NIRISS/SOSS, combined with the existing HST/WFC3 spectrum, enable us to break the clouds-metallicity degeneracy. We detect water in a highly metal-enriched "steam world" atmosphere (O/H of $\sim 4$ by mass and H$_2$O found to be the background gas with a volume mixing ratio of &gt;31%). We further show that these results are robust to stellar contamination through the transit light source effect. We do not detect escaping metastable He, which, combined with previous nondetections of escaping He and H, supports the steam atmosphere scenario. In water-rich atmospheres, hydrogen loss driven by water photolysis happens predominantly in the ionized form which eludes observational constraints. We also detect several flares in the NIRISS/SOSS light-curves with far-UV energies of the order of 10$^{30}$ erg, highlighting the active nature of the star. Further atmospheric characterization of GJ 9827 d probing carbon or sulfur species could reveal the origin of its high metal enrichment.</description>

      <title>The Dependence of Joy's Law and Mean Tilt as a Function of Flux Emergence Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) are analyzed from 1996 to 2023 to investigate tilt angles ($\gamma$) of bipolar magnetic regions and Joy's Law for Cycles 23, 24, and a portion of 25. The HMI radial magnetic field ($B_{r}$) and MDI magnetogram ($B_{los}$) data are used to calculate ($\gamma$) using the flux-weighted centroids of the positive and negative polarities. Each active region (AR) is only sampled once. The analysis includes only Beta ($\beta$)-class active regions since computing $\gamma$ of complex active regions is less meaningful. During the emergence of the ARs, we find that the average tilt angle ($\bar{\gamma}$) increases from 3.30$^{\circ}\pm$0.75 when 20\% of the flux has emerged to 6.79$^{\circ}\pm$0.66 when the ARs are at their maximum flux. Cycle 24 had a larger average tilt $\bar{\gamma}_{24}$=6.67$\pm$0.66 than Cycle 23, $\bar{\gamma}_{23}$=5.11$\pm$0.61. No significant difference is found in the slope of Joy's law or $\bar{\gamma}$ when sampling the ARs at the time of maximum flux or central meridian crossing. There are persistent differences in $\bar{\gamma}$ in the hemispheres, with the southern hemisphere having higher ${\bar{\gamma}}$ in Cycles 23 and 24, but the uncertainties are such that these differences are not statistically significant.</description>

      <title>Coronal dimmings as indicators of early CME propagation direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are solar eruptions of plasma and magnetic fields that significantly impact Space Weather, causing disruptions in technological systems and potential damage to power grids when directed towards Earth. Traditional coronagraphs along the Sun-Earth line struggle to precisely track the early evolution of Earth-directed CMEs. Coronal dimmings, localized reductions in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray emissions, are key indicators of CMEs in the low corona, resulting from mass loss and expansion during the eruption. This study introduces a novel method, DIRECD (Dimming InfeRred Estimate of CME Direction), to estimate the early propagation direction of CMEs based on the expansion of coronal dimmings. The approach involves 3D simulations of CMEs using a geometric cone model, exploring parameters like width, height, source location, and deflection from the radial direction. The dominant direction of dimming evolution is then determined, and an inverse problem is solved to reconstruct an ensemble of CME cones at various heights, widths, and deflections. By comparing the CME orthogonal projections onto the solar sphere with the dimming geometry, the 3D CME direction is derived. Validated through case studies on October 1, 2011, and September 6, 2011, the DIRECD method reveals the early propagation directions of CMEs. The CME on October 1, 2011, predominantly expands towards the South-East, while the CME on September 6, 2011, inclines towards the North-West. These findings align with previous studies using multi-viewpoint coronagraphic observations. The study demonstrates the utility of coronal dimming information for early CME direction estimation, providing valuable data for space weather forecasting and mitigating potential adverse impacts on Earth before observation in coronographs' field-of-view.</description>

      <title>Super-slowly rotating Ap (ssrAp) stars: Spectroscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To gain better understanding of the Ap stars with the longest rotation periods, we obtained high resolution spectra of a sample of super-slowly rotating Ap (ssrAp) star candidates identified by a TESS photometric survey, to confirm that they are indeed Ap stars, to check that their v sin i values are compatible with super-slow rotation, and to obtain a first estimate of their magnetic field strengths. We determined whenever possible their mean magnetic field modulus, their mean quadratic magnetic field, and an upper limit of their projected equatorial velocities. Eighteen of the 27 stars studied are typical Ap stars; most of the other nine appear to be misclassified. One of the Ap stars is not a slow rotator; it must be seen nearly pole-on. The properties of the remaining 17 are compatible with moderately to extremely long rotation periods. Eight new stars with resolved magnetically split lines in the visible range were discovered; their mean magnetic field modulus and their mean quadratic magnetic field were measured. The mean quadratic field could also be determined in five more stars. Five new spectroscopic binaries containing an Ap star were identified. Among the misclassified stars, one SB2 system with two similar, sharp-lined Am components was also discovered. The technique that we used to carry out a search for ssrAp star candidates using TESS data is validated, but appears limited by uncertainties in the spectral classification of Ap stars. The new magnetic field measurements obtained as part of this study lend further support to the tentative conclusions of our previous studies: the absence of periods longer than ~150 d in stars with magnetic fields stronger than ~7.5 kG, the lower rate of occurrence of super-slow rotation for field strengths less than ~2 kG than in the range ~3-7.5 kG, and the deficiency of slowly rotating Ap stars with field strengths between ~2 and ~3 kG.</description>

      <title>The earliest phases of CNO enrichment in galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. The recent detection of nitrogen-enhanced, metal-poor galaxies at high redshift by the James Webb Space Telescope has sparked renewed interest in exploring the chemical evolution of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (the CNO elements) at early times, prompting fresh inquiries into their origins. Aims. The main goal of this paper is to shed light onto the early evolution of the main CNO isotopes in our Galaxy and in young distant systems, such as GN-z11 at z=10.6. Methods. To this aim, we incorporate a stochastic star-formation component into a chemical evolution model calibrated with high-quality Milky Way (MW) data, focusing on the contribution of Population III (Pop III) stars to the early chemical enrichment. Results. By comparing the model predictions with CNO abundance measurements from high-resolution spectroscopy of an homogeneous sample of Galactic halo stars, we first demonstrate that the scatter observed in the metallicity range -4.5 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt;-1.5 can be explained by pre-enrichment from Pop III stars that explode as supernovae (SNe) with different initial masses and energies. Then, by exploiting the chemical evolution model, we provide testable predictions for log(C/N), log(N/O), and log(C/O) vs. log(O/H)+12 in MW-like galaxies observed at different cosmic epochs/redshifts. Finally, by calibrating the chemical evolution model to replicate the observed properties of GN-z11, we provide an alternative interpretation of its log(N/O) abundance ratio, demonstrating that its high N content can be reproduced through enrichment from high-mass faint Pop III SNe. Conclusions. Stochastic chemical enrichment from primordial stars explains both the observed scatter in CNO abundances in MW halo stars and the exceptionally high N/O ratios in some distant galaxies. These findings emphasize the critical role of Pop III stars in shaping early chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>Neutrino beaming in ultraluminous X-ray pulsars as a result of gravitational lensing by neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray pulsars experiencing extreme mass accretion rates can produce neutrino emission in the MeV energy band. Neutrinos in these systems are emitted in close proximity to the stellar surface and subsequently undergo gravitational bending in the space curved by a neutron star. This process results in the formation of a distinct beam pattern of neutrino emission and gives rise to the phenomenon of neutrino pulsars. The energy flux of neutrinos, when averaged over the neutron star's pulsation period, can differ from the isotropic neutrino energy flux, which impacts the detectability of bright pulsars in neutrinos. We investigate the process of neutrino beam pattern formation, accounting for neutron star transparency to neutrinos and gravitational bending. Based on simulated neutrino beam patterns, we estimate the potential difference between the actual and apparent neutrino luminosity. We show that the apparent luminosity can greatly exceed the actual luminosity, albeit only in a small fraction of cases, depending on the specific equation of state and the mass of the star. For example, the amplification can exceed a factor of ten for $\approx0.05\%$ of typical neutron stars with mass of $1.4\,M_\odot$. Strong amplification is less probable for neutron stars of higher mass. In the case of strange stars, a fraction of high energy neutrinos can be absorbed and the beam pattern, as well as the amplification of apparent neutrino luminosity, depend on neutrino energy.</description>

Abstract: We produce a new photometric calibration for the combined six-filter system formed by $Gaia$ DR2 + EDR3 $G$+$G_{\rm BP}$+$G_{\rm RP}$ using an improved STIS/HST spectrophotometric library with very red stars. The comparison between observed and synthetic photometry yields residual dispersions of just 3.4-8.7 mmag, resulting in the most accurate and precise whole-sky large-dynamic-range optical photometric system ever obtained. We include some tests and applications.</description>

      <title>The Villafranca project: Combining Gaia and ground-based surveys to study Galactic OB groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Villafranca project is studying Galactic stellar groups with OB stars combining information from $Gaia$ and ground-based surveys. We summarize the status of the project and we present its most important results. The Villafranca project has been used to produce a new astrometric calibration for $Gaia$ (E)DR3, which improves the previous one significantly for bright stars. We have discovered that dynamical interactions among massive stars at a very young age ($\sim$1 Ma or less) can play a significant interaction in the dynamical evolution of clusters. As a consequence, our current view of the massive-star IMF may be distorted and the number of free-floating neutron stars and black holes higher than previously considered.</description>
