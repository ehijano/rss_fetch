      <title>Data-Driven Topological Analysis of Polymorphic Crystal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymorphism, the ability of a compound to crystallize in multiple distinct structures, plays a vital role in determining the physical, chemical, and functional properties of materials. Accurate identification and prediction of polymorphic structures are critical for materials design, drug development, and device optimization, as unknown or overlooked polymorphs may lead to unexpected performance or stability issues. Despite its significance, predicting polymorphism directly from a chemical composition remains a challenging problem due to the complex interplay between molecular conformations, crystal packing, and symmetry constraints. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive data-driven analysis of polymorphic materials from the Materials Project database, uncovering key statistical patterns in their composition, space group distributions, and polyhedral building blocks. We discover that frequent polymorph pairs across space groups, such as (71, 225), display recurring topological motifs that persist across different compounds, highlighting topology not symmetry alone as a key factor in polymorphic recurrence. We reveal that many polymorphs exhibit consistent local polyhedral environments despite differences in their symmetry or packing. Additionally, by constructing polyhedron connectivity graphs and embedding their topology, we successfully cluster polymorphs and structurally similar materials even across different space groups, demonstrating that topological similarity serves as a powerful descriptor for polymorphic behavior. Our findings provide new insights into the structural characteristics of polymorphic materials and demonstrate the potential of data mining and machine learning for accelerating polymorph discovery and design.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Description of Spin Crossover Under Pressure and its Giant Barocaloric Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pressure-dependent evolution of the spin crossover (SCO) transition has garnered significant interest due to its connection to the giant barocaloric effect (BCE) near room temperature. Pressure alters both the molecular and solid-state structures of SCO materials, affecting the relative stability of low- and high-spin states and, consequently, the transition temperature ($T_{1/2}$). Crucially, the shape of the $T_{1/2}$ vs. pressure curve dictates the magnitude of the BCE, making its accurate characterization essential for identifying high-performance materials. In this work, we investigate the nonlinear $T_{1/2}$ vs. pressure behavior of the prototypical SCO complex [FeL$_2$][BF$_4$]$_2$ [L = 2,6-di(pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine] using solid-state PBE+U computations. Our results unveil the mechanisms by which pressure influences its SCO transition, including the onset of a phase transition, as well as the key role of low-frequency phonons in the BCE. Furthermore, we establish a computational protocol for accurately modeling the BCE in SCO crystals, providing a powerful tool for the rapid and efficient discovery of new materials with enhanced barocaloric performance.</description>

      <title>Type-I Multiferroic VHfO$_4$ with Strain-Switchable Magnetic Orders and Magnetoelectric Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the complementary properties of vanadium-based ferromagnets and HfO$_2$-based ferroelectrics, we propose a novel multiferroic oxide, VHfO$_4$, through 50\% Hf$^{4+}$ substitution with V$^{4+}$ in the ferroelectric $Pca2_1$ phase of HfO$_2$. First-principles DFT calculations reveal that the $Pca2_1$-like VHfO$_4$ phase exhibits dynamic stability and concurrent ferroic orders: robust ferroelectric polarization comparable to HfO$_2$ and V-driven magnetism. Parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations identify an antiferromagnetic ground state, while strain engineering enables tunable magnetoelectric coupling. Biaxial in-plane strain induces four magnetic states: intralayer FM/interlayer AFM, intralayer AFM/interlayer FM, spiral-like non-collinear order, and discrete alternating spin alignment. Critically, $c$-axis strain modulates magnetic energy landscapes, demonstrating electromechanical control of magnetism. This work establishes VHfO$_4$ as a Type-I multiferroic with coexisting atomic-scale ferroic origins and strain-tunable cross-coupling, offering a platform for voltage-controlled spintronics devices.</description>

      <title>EDIS: A Simulation Software for Dynamic Ion Intercalation/Deintercalation Processes in Electrode Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the core determinant of lithium-ion battery performance, electrode materials play a crucial role in defining the battery's capacity, cycling stability, and durability. During charging and discharging, electrode materials undergo complex ion intercalation and deintercalation processes, accompanied by defect formation and structural evolution. However, the microscopic mechanisms underlying processes such as cation disordering, lattice oxygen loss, and stage structure formation phenomena are still not fully understood. To address these challenges, we have developed the Electrode Dynamic Ion Intercalation/Deintercalation Simulator (EDIS), a software platform designed to simulate the dynamic processes of ion intercalation and deintercalation in electrode materials. Leveraging high-precision machine learning potentials, EDIS can efficiently model structural evolution and lithium-ion diffusion behavior under various states of charge and discharge, achieving accuracy approaching that of quantum mechanical methods in relevant chemical spaces. The software supports quantitative analysis of how variations in lithium-ion concentration and distribution affect lithium-ion transport properties, enables evaluation of the impact of structural defects, and allows for tracking of both structural evolution and transport characteristics during continuous cycling. EDIS is versatile and can be extended to sodium-ion batteries and related systems. By enabling in-depth analysis of these microscopic processes, EDIS provides a robust theoretical tool for mechanistic studies and the rational design of high-performance electrode materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>FastTrack: a fast method to evaluate mass transport in solid leveraging universal machine learning interatomic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a rapid, accurate framework for computing atomic migration barriers in crystals by combining universal machine learning force fields (MLFFs) with 3D potential energy surface sampling and interpolation. Our method suppresses periodic self interactions via supercell expansion, builds a continuous PES from MLFF energies on a spatial grid, and extracts minimum energy pathways without predefined NEB images. Across twelve benchmark electrode and electrolyte materials including LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and LGPS our MLFF-derived barriers lie within tens of meV of DFT and experiment, while achieving ~10^2 x speedups over DFT-NEB. We benchmark GPTFF, CHGNet, and MACE, show that fine-tuning on PBE/PBE+U data further enhances accuracy, and provide an open-source package for high-throughput materials screening and interactive PES visualization.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Unusual Dielectric Response to Low-Frequency s-Polarized Evanescent Waves in Metals with {\break} Implications for the Casimir Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report precision measurements of the lateral component of the oscillating magnetic field reflected from a copper plate, which is fully determined by s-polarized evanescent waves. The measurement data are compared with theoretical predictions of classical electrodynamics using the dielectric permittivity of copper as given by the Drude model. It is shown that these predictions are excluded by the measurement data which means that the currently used Drude model does not provide a complete description of the electromagnetic response of metals for s-polarized evanescent waves. The critical importance of this result for several fields of condensed matter physics and optics dealing with evanescent waves, including the Casimir effect, is discussed.</description>

      <title>Unraveling energy flow mechanisms in semiconductors by ultrafast spectroscopy: Germanium as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor materials are the foundation of modern electronics, and their functionality is dictated by the interactions between fundamental excitations occurring on (sub-)picosecond timescales. Using time-resolved Raman spectroscopy and transient reflectivity measurements, we shed light on the ultrafast dynamics in germanium. We observe an increase in the optical phonon temperature in the first few picoseconds, driven by the energy transfer from photoexcited holes, and the subsequent decay into acoustic phonons through anharmonic coupling. Moreover, the temperature, Raman frequency, and linewidth of this phonon mode show strikingly different decay dynamics. This difference was ascribed to the local thermal strain generated by the ultrafast excitation. We also observe Brillouin oscillations, given by a strain pulse traveling through germanium, whose damping is correlated to the optical phonon mode. These findings, supported by density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations, provide a better understanding of the energy dissipation mechanisms in semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Phonon anomalies, Anharmonicity, and thermal expansion coefficient in few layered PtX2 (X= S, Se): A temperature dependent Raman study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional group-10 noble transition metal dichalcogenides have garnered growing attention due to their rich physical properties and promising applications across nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and spintronics. Among them, PtX2 (X = S, Se) exhibits pronounced interlayer coupling driven by hybridization of the out-of-plane Pz orbitals of the chalcogen atoms. In this work, we present a detailed temperature and polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopic study of few-layer PtS2 and PtSe2 over the temperature range of ~ 5 to 300 K. Our study encompasses phonon-phonon interactions, symmetry analysis of phonon modes, low-frequency interlayer vibrations, and extraction of thermal expansion coefficients. Notable phonon anomalies in peak position, linewidth, and intensity emerge around ~ 80 K and 150 K for PtS2, and ~ 70 K and 240 K for PtSe2, indicating intricate coupling between thermal and vibrational dynamics. These results offer valuable insights for the development of devices based on PtS2, PtSe2, and related 2D materials, where interlayer interactions, anharmonic effects, and thermal expansion behaviour play crucial roles.</description>

      <title>Field-induced condensation of $\pi$ to 2$\pi$ soliton lattices in chiral magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral soliton lattices (CSLs) are nontrivial spin textures that emerge from the competition between Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, anisotropy, and magnetic fields. While well established in monoaxial helimagnets, their role in materials with anisotropic, direction-dependent chirality remains poorly understood. Here, we report the direct observation of a tunable transition from $\pi$ to 2$\pi$ soliton lattices in the non-centrosymmetric Heusler compound Mn1.4PtSn. Using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, resonant elastic X-ray scattering, and micromagnetic simulations, we identify a $\pi$-CSL as the magnetic ground state, in contrast to the expected helical phase, which evolves into a classical 2$\pi$-CSL under increasing out-of-plane magnetic fields. This transition is governed by a delicate interplay between uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetostatic interactions, as captured by a double sine-Gordon model. Our analysis not only reveals the microscopic mechanisms stabilizing these soliton lattices but also demonstrates their general relevance to materials with D2d, S4, Cnv, or Cn symmetries. The results establish a broadly applicable framework for understanding magnetic phase diagrams in chiral systems, with implications for soliton-based spintronic devices and topological transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Constrained Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Graphene Electronic Band Structure Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic band structures in two-dimensional materials remains a fundamental challenge, with existing methods struggling to balance computational efficiency and physical accuracy. We present the Symmetry-Constrained Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural Network (SCMS-PINN) v35, which directly learns graphene band structures while rigorously enforcing crystallographic symmetries through a multi-head architecture. Our approach introduces three specialized ResNet-6 pathways -- K-head for Dirac physics, M-head for saddle points, and General head for smooth interpolation -- operating on 31 physics-informed features extracted from k-points. Progressive Dirac constraint scheduling systematically increases the weight parameter from 5.0 to 25.0, enabling hierarchical learning from global topology to local critical physics. Training on 10,000 k-points over 300 epochs achieves 99.99\% reduction in training loss (34.597 to 0.003) with validation loss of 0.0085. The model predicts Dirac point gaps within 30.3 $\mu$eV of theoretical zero and achieves average errors of 53.9 meV (valence) and 40.5 meV (conduction) across the Brillouin zone. All twelve C$_{6v}$ operations are enforced through systematic averaging, guaranteeing exact symmetry preservation. This framework establishes a foundation for extending physics-informed learning to broader two-dimensional materials for accelerated discovery.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-enabled ab initio study of quantum phase transitions in SrTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) with machine learning interatomic potentials to calculate the effect of $^{18}$O substitution on the properties of quantum paraelectric SrTiO$_3$ (STO). We find that calculations including both quantum and anharmonic effects are able to reproduce the experimentally observed isotope effect, in which replacement of $^{16}$O by $^{18}$O induces the ferroelectric state, and demonstrate that the ferroelectric phase transition in ST$^{18}$O can be reproduced in a purely displacive manner. We calculate the ferroelectric soft mode frequency as a function of volume, lattice parameters and temperature for ST$^{16}$O and ST$^{18}$O, and find that the phase space in which ST$^{16}$O shows quantum paraelectric behaviour, while ST$^{18}$O becomes ferroelectric is narrow. Our study shows that machine learning interatomic potentials enable temperature-dependent simulations that include quantum and anharmonic phonon effects, however quantitative prediction of phase diagrams remains challenging due to a lack of universally accurate electronic structure methods.</description>

      <title>Formation and protection of an Eu-Ir surface compound below hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Europium (Eu) intercalation below hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) on an Ir(111) substrate at various Eu coverages is investigated. The structural and electronic properties were examined using low energy electron diffraction (LEED), scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Depending on the deposition temperature, different superstructures, (5 $\times$ $M$), (5 $\times$ 2), and ($ \sqrt{3}$ $\times$ $\sqrt{3})R30^{\circ}$ with respect to the Ir substrate were identified by LEED. The (5 $\times$ $M$) superstructure ($M$ $&gt;$ 2), at 0.1 monolayer (ML), preserved the hBN/Ir Moir{\'e} pattern and exhibited a unidirectional ordering of Eu atoms. At higher coverage of 0.26 ML, a (5 $\times$ 2) superstructure emerged, where excess Eu atoms diffused into the bulk and were analyzed as Eu in a tri-valent state. At the highest preparation temperature with a one-third ML Eu, the formation of a ($\sqrt{3}$ $\times$ $\sqrt{3})R30^{\circ}$ superstructure indicates the presence of a EuIr$_{2}$ surface alloy beneath the hBN layer, with di-valent Eu atoms suggesting potential ferromagnetic properties. Air exposure was used to evaluate the protection of the hBN layer, and the results indicate that the EuIr$_{2}$ surface alloy was partially protected. However, the hBN layer remained intact by intercalation and air exposure, as confirmed by ARPES analysis.</description>

      <title>New Materials, New Functionalities: Molecular Beam Epitaxy of Ultra-High Conductivity Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding fundamental properties of materials is necessary for all modern electronic technologies. Toward this end, the fabrication of new ultrapure thin film materials is critical to discover and understand novel properties that can allow further development of technology. Oxide materials are a vast material class abound with diverse properties, and, therefore, harnessing such phases is critical for realizing emerging technologies. Pushing forward, however, requires understanding basic properties of insulating, semiconducting and metallic oxides, as well as the more complex phases that arise out of strong electronic correlations unique to this class of materials. In this review, we will focus on one of the unique aspects of oxides: the ultra-high conductivity metallic state, which can be a critical component for future all-oxide microelectronics such as low-loss interconnects and gate-metals, spintronics, as well as future quantum technologies that employ emergent magnetic or superconducting ground states. Like most oxides, a critical challenge to understanding and ultimately integrating high-conductivity metals into new technologies is the ability to synthesize high-quality materials. Therefore, we will frame the discussions in the context of epitaxial film growth via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), which has provided insights into the electronic behavior of specific materials while providing samples with unprecedented quality. We will highlight and underscore how MBE has enabled developments and deeper understanding of their properties and how it plays a critical role in the future of this unique class of materials.</description>

      <title>Structural transition and possible pressure-induced superconductivity in a suboxide La$_5$Pb$_3$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we report a structural phase transition and its possible competition with superconductivity in the suboxide La$_5$Pb$_3$O. Upon cooling through $T_t$ = 225 K, La$_5$Pb$_3$O transforms from a high-temperature I4/mcm to a low-temperature P4/ncc structure in which La - Pb dimerization along the c-axis occurs. This transition is accompanied by anomalies in the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity and specific heat. High-pressure electrical transport measurements reveal that hydrostatic pressure suppresses the structural transition and possibly induces superconductivity with a maximum superconducting temperature of 10 K. Density functional theory calculations show minimal changes in the electronic density of states and no gap opening at $E_F$ across $T_t$, suggesting that the transition is driven by bonding effects rather than Fermi surface instability. These findings establish La$_5$Pb$_3$O as a promising platform for exploring the interplay between weak structural transitions and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Emergent Interacting Phases in the Strong Coupling Limit of Twisted M-Valley Moir\'e Systems: Application to SnSe${}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an interacting Wannier model for both AA-stacked and AB-stacked twisted SnSe2, revealing a rich landscape of correlated quantum phases. For the AA-stacked case, the system is effectively described by a three-orbital triangular lattice model, where each orbital corresponds to a valley and exhibits an approximate one-dimensional hopping structure due to a new momentum-space non-symmorphic symmetry. By exploring the interacting phase diagram using a combination of theoretical methods, including Hartree-Fock mean-field theory and exact solutions of the spin model in certain limits, we identify several exotic quantum phases. These include a dimerized phase with finite residual entropy, valence bond solids, and quantum paramagnetism. In the AB-stacked case, the system realizes an interacting kagome lattice model, where the Wannier orbitals associated with the three valleys form three sublattices. In the strong coupling regime, we use cluster mean-field methods to demonstrate the emergence of a classical spin liquid phase due to the frustrated lattice structure. The high tunability of the moir\'e system, which allows control over both the filling and interaction strength (via twist angle), renders twisted SnSe2 a versatile platform for realizing a wide range of exotic correlated quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Patient-Specific 3D Printed Dynamic Preoperative Planning Models in Modern Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) printed preoperative planning models serve a critical role in the success of many medical procedures. However, many of these models do not portray the patient's complete anatomy due to their monolithic and static nature. The use of dynamic 3D-printed models can better equip physicians by providing a more anatomically accurate model due to its movement capabilities and the ability to remove and replace printed anatomies based on planning stages. A dynamic 3D-printed preoperative planning model has the capability to move in similar ways to the anatomy that is being represented by the model, or reveal additional issues that may arise during the use of a movement mechanism. The 3D-printed models are constructed in a similar manner to their static counterparts; however, in the digital post-processing phase, additional care is needed to ensure the dynamic functionality of the model. Here, we discuss the process of creating a dynamic 3D-printed model and its benefits and uses in modern medicine.</description>

      <title>Group theory method for extracting order parameters from scanning tunneling microscopy data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a powerful local probe of correlated electronic states. Here we present a group theoretical framework for the analysis of STM data, filtering STM images into components which provide a real space mapping of the local symmetry properties of the underlying density of states. Using this formalism, we show that certain kinds of symmetry breaking are impossible to resolve in the first Brillouin zone, due to symmetry restrictions we term ``Bragg peak extinctions'' in analogy with related ideas in x-ray crystallography. We show extinct patterns of symmetry breaking can be resolved using sub-unit cell structure, and develop methodological details for the accurate extraction of this symmetry information. We illustrate our results on synthetic STM data for $2\times 2$ charge density waves on the kagome lattice, and on topographic data for kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. Our results provide a powerful method for extracting symmetry insights from STM data, and provide constraints on when and how certain ground states are experimentally observable.</description>

      <title>FreeBird.jl: An Extensible Toolbox for Simulating Interfacial Phase Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present FreeBird.jl, an extensible Julia-based platform for computational studies of phase equilibria at generic interfaces. The package supports a range of system configurations, from atomistic solid surfaces to coarse-grained lattice$-$gas models, with energies evaluated using classical interatomic potentials or lattice Hamiltonians. Both atomistic and lattice systems accommodate single- or multi-component mixtures with flexibly definable surface and lattice geometries. Implemented sampling algorithms include nested sampling, Wang$-$Landau sampling, Metropolis Monte Carlo, and, for tractable lattice systems, exact enumeration. Leveraging Julia's type hierarchies and multiple dispatch, FreeBird.jl provides a modular interface that allows seamless integration of system definitions, energy evaluators, and sampling schemes. Designed for flexibility, extensibility, and performance, FreeBird.jl offers a versatile framework for exploring the thermodynamics of interfacial phenomena.</description>

      <title>Electronic localization on the structural inhomogeneities formed due to Bi and Te deficiency in the MBE grown films of AFM topological insulator MnBi2Te4: Evidence from spectroscopic ellipsometry and infrared studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic substitutional and antisite defects cause unintentional doping and shift of the E_F position above the conduction band minimum in the AFM topological insulator (TI) MnBi2Te4. This prevents measurements of the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAH) and investigation of the topological Dirac states. In the present study, the Mn-Bi-Te films grown by the MBE technique onto Si(111) substrates with decreasing Bi and Te contents and increasing Mn content were investigated by 0.5-6.5 eV spectroscopic ellipsometry. In addition, the 0.004-0.9 eV infrared (IR) transmittance spectra were examined. An effective medium model was used to reproduce the measured ellipsometric angles, Psi(omega) and Delta(omega), of the Mn-Bi-Te films in terms of the constructed model, including film thickness, surface roughness, and volume fractions of two (MnTe and Bi2Te3) or three constituents, the latter being associated with the structural inhomogeneities contribution. The results obtained for the inhomogeneous Mn-Bi-Te films using the three-phase EMA model indicate that the defect-associated optical response systematically shifts to higher photon energies from ~1.95 to ~2.43 eV with decreasing Te and Bi contents and increasing Mn content, pointing out that the electrons become more deeply localized in the formed structural inhomogeneities. The obtained results indicate that the structure of the non-stoichiometric Mn-Bi-Te films is not continuous but represented by regions of nearly stoichiometric MnBi2Te4 phase, which includes hollows or quantum anti-dots (QADs). The measured FIR transmittance spectra for the non-stoichiometric Mn-Bi-Te films show substantially reduced (or absent) contribution(s) from free charge carriers, which supports the relevance of localization effects.</description>

      <title>Edgetronics in 2D Altermagnet via Real-Space-Spin Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling between real-space coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where the spin-split floating edge states - energetically isolated within the bulk band gap - emerge and exhibit both Neel-vector-dependent and electrically tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin r-s coupling ensures carrier transport to be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance, giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR) effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr2Se2O monolayer to demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the Neel order or electric field. Our findings propose a general prototype altermagnetic device for next-generation low-dimensional spintronics.</description>

      <title>Crystalline electric field excitations in Weyl semimetal \textit{R}AlSi (\textit{R} = Ce, Pr and Nd)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rare earth intermetallic system \textit{R}Al\textit{X} (\textit{R} = rare earth elements, \textit{X} = Si and Ge) is known to be a promising candidate of magnetic Weyl semimetal. Due to the complex interactions between the rare earth elements and surrounding atoms, as well as hybridization with itinerant electrons, this family likely possesses highly intriguing and novel magnetic structures and thus exhibits dynamic behaviors. We systematically probe polycrystalline samples of \textit{R}AlSi (\textit{R} = La, Ce, Pr and Nd) combining inelastic neutron scattering (INS), heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The INS measurements identify well-resolved crystalline electric field (CEF) excitations at 19.2 and 24.9 meV in CeAlSi, at 5.4 meV in PrAlSi, and at 2.5 and 4.2 meV in NdAlSi. We analyzed the INS data using the corresponding CEF models and determined the CEF parameters and ground state wave functions of \textit{R}AlSi (\textit{R} = Ce, Pr and Nd). Our results suggest strong single-ion anisotropy in their ground states: $|\pm3/2\rangle$ (94.5\%) in CeAlSi, $|\pm3\rangle$ (99.2\%) in PrAlSi, and $|\pm9/2\rangle$ (76.2\%) in NdAlSi. Notably, the weaker anisotropy and strong exchange interactions in NdAlSi promote competing magnetic orders and CEF splitting at low temperature, contrasting with the robust CEF levels in magnetic states of CeAlSi and PrAlSi.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic behavior of the 6H-perovskite dimer lattice Ba$_3$Zn$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$Ru$_2$O$_9$ using analytical theory, density functional theory, inelastic neutron scattering, and modeling of historical magnetization and neutron-scattering data. A dimer mean-field theory built upon classical Luttinger-Tisza analysis generates a phase diagram revealing a transition from a nonmagnetic singlet to a finite-moment ground state as interdimer couplings increase. A (generalized) linear spin-wave theory captures multiplet mixing, excitation gap closing, and fluctuation-induced moment suppression. Density functional theory on select compounds and neutron spectroscopy on dilute Ba$_3$Zn(Ru$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$O$_9$ confirm the exchange hierarchy, enabling quantification of previously published experiments within this framework. Our results identify three mechanisms for magnetic moment suppression: quantum fluctuations, ligand hybridization, and nonmagnetic-singlet/magnetic-multiplet mixing.</description>

      <title>An Open-Source User-Friendly Interface for Simulating Magnetic Soft Robots using Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft robots, particularly magnetic soft robots, require specialized simulation tools to accurately model their deformation under external magnetic fields. However, existing platforms often lack dedicated support for magnetic materials, making them difficult to use for researchers at different expertise levels. This work introduces an open-source, user-friendly simulation interface using the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), specifically designed to model magnetic soft robots. The tool enables users to define material properties, apply magnetic fields, and observe resulting deformations in real time. By integrating intuitive controls and stress analysis capabilities, it aims to bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and practical design. Four benchmark models - a beam, three- and four-finger grippers, and a butterfly - demonstrate its functionality. The software's ease of use makes it accessible to both beginners and advanced researchers. Future improvements will refine accuracy through experimental validation and comparison with industry-standard finite element solvers, ensuring realistic and predictive simulations of magnetic soft robots.</description>

      <title>Field-free superconducting diode effect in two-dimensional Shiba lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) refers to non-reciprocal transport, where current flows without resistance in one direction but becomes resistive in the opposite direction, but its typical reliance on magnetic field hinders scalability and device integration. In this article, we present a theoretical framework for realizing a field-free SDE based on a two-dimensional (2D) Shiba lattice featuring a conical spin texture. Using the real-space Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) calculations, we illustrate that the conical spin configuration alone is sufficient to break the necessary inversion and time reversal symmetries, enabling nonreciprocal supercurrent flow without any external magnetic field, yielding diode efficiency exceeding 40%. Furthermore, we find that the efficiency of such a diode effect becomes strongly dependent on the direction of current flow, revealing a pronounced angular dependence that can be tuned by varying the pitches of the spin texture along the two spatial lattice directions. Our findings offer a pathway toward scalable, field-free superconducting components for non-dissipative electronics and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Dynamically tunable hydrodynamic transport in boron nitride-encapsulated graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, graphene has emerged as a promising candidate for exploring the viscous nature of electronic flow facilitated by the availability of extremely high-quality devices employing a graphene channel encapsulated within dielectric layers of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, the level of disorder in such systems is mainly determined by the device fabrication protocols, making it impossible to obtain a tunability between the impurity-dominated and the viscous transport within the same device. In this work, using a combination of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and gate electric field, we have demonstrated a dynamic modulation of charge hydrodynamics, quantified in the thermal and electrical transport by the extent of departure from the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) Law in monolayer graphene devices at room temperature. We achieved this by tuning the disorder level continuously and reversibly using UV light to create transient trap states in the encapsulating hBN dielectric. With progressive UV radiation, we observed a dramatic increase in the momentum-relaxing scattering relative to that between the electrons and also the Lorentz number, by nearly a factor of ten, with increasing disorder, thereby approaching the restoration of the WF law in highly disordered graphene. Our experiments outline a potent strategy to tune the fundamental mechanism of charge flow in state-of-the-art graphene devices.</description>

Abstract: This study investigated the formation and relaxation dynamics of nuclear spin polarization in three Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As bulk samples with different aluminum concentrations $x$ of 0.00, 0.05, and 0.15. The time-resolved Kerr rotation technique was primarily used. The samples with $x$ = 0.15 and 0.05 exhibited anomalously large nuclear magnetic fields BN exceeding 1 T, approximately twice the applied magnetic field. Further investigations revealed that BN formation occurred in two-stages, a rapid initial rise followed by a gradual increase toward a saturation value. Relaxation measurements revealed that the relaxation time of BN was longer for AlGaAs than for GaAs. The comparison of the results obtained under strong and weak magnetic fields indicated the suppression of quadrupole-induced relaxation. We modified the dynamics model of nuclear spin polarization and explained the two-stage formation and the accompanying large BN in AlGaAs bulks.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotropes have drawn significant interest owing to their impressive physical and chemical characteristics. Following graphene's isolation, a wide range of 2D carbon materials has been suggested, each with distinct electronic, mechanical, and optical traits. Rational design and synthesis of new 2D carbon structures hinge on experimentally reported precursors. Here, we present a 2D carbon allotrope, propylenidene (PPD), originating from bicyclopropylidene. PPD forms a rectangular lattice with 3, 8, and 10-membered carbon rings. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations investigate its structural, electronic, mechanical, and optical properties. Our study shows PPD to be metallic. PPD exhibits absorption in the infrared and visible range, showing directional dependence in its response. Mechanically, PPD exhibits marked anisotropy; Young's modulus ($Y$) varies between 205.83 N/m and 164.46 N/m. These findings underscore the potential of this novel monolayer in applications such as energy storage, gas sensing, and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale friction of manganite superlattice films controlled by layer thickness and fluorine content</title>

Abstract: We investigate nanoscale friction in [LaMnO3]m/[SrMnO3]n superlattice films using lateral force microscopy, focusing on the effects of fluorine doping and top-layer thickness. For all samples, friction forces scale linearly with the sum of the applied normal and adhesion forces. While friction forces vary spatially due to local adhesion fluctuations, the friction coefficient remains position independent for each specimen. It is, however, systematically influenced by fluorine concentration and top-layer thickness. Our data indicates that frictional energy dissipation extends up to 5 nm beneath the surface, demonstrating a clear dependence on subsurface structure. We attribute this to viscoelastic dissipation within the stress field and evanescent waves generated by the sliding tip, which can quantitatively account for the observed friction coefficients. These results show that, once adhesion is properly accounted for, the friction coefficient is a reproducible material property that can be tuned via controlled modifications to surface and subsurface layers.</description>

      <title>Quasicrystal Scattering and the Riemann Zeta Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03673v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I carry out numerical scattering calculations against a family of finite-length one-dimensional point-like arrangements of atoms, $\chi(x)$, related to the distribution of prime numbers by a shift operation making the atomic density approximately constant. I show how the Riemann Zeta Function (RZF) naturally parameterizes the analytic structure of the scattering amplitude and give numerical results.</description>

      <title>Time-Independent Parameters in Quantum Systems: Revisiting Berry Phase, Curvature and Gauge Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a reformulation of quantum adiabatic theory in terms of an emergent electromagnetic framework, emphasizing the physical consequences of geometric structures in parameter space. Contrary to conventional approaches, we demonstrate that a Berry electric field naturally arises in systems with dynamic Hamiltonian, when the full time-dependent wavefunction is used to define the gauge potentials. This surprising result bridges the gap between static and dynamical formulations and leads to a deeper understanding of how gauge structures manifest in quantum systems. Building on this, we construct Berry Maxwell equations by analogy with classical electrodynamics, defining Berry electric and magnetic fields as derivatives of scalar and vector potentials obtained from the full quantum state. We verify these equations explicitly and derive field-theoretic identities such as generalized continuity and vorticity relations. This field-based formulation reveals the topological charges, monopole structures, and gauge currents that underlie parameter space, and clarifies how Berry curvature corrections enter dynamical quantities like expectation values and particle velocities. Our results establish a new regime of emergent electromagnetism in parameter space, unifying time-independent and time-dependent geometric phases within a covariant formalism. The implications extend to quantum transport, polarization, and topological classification of phases, providing a robust and generalizable framework for quantum systems driven by adiabatic or nonadiabatic evolution.</description>
