      <title>Interpreting the suction stress profiles under steady-state conditions considering the independence of van Genuchten SWCC parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suction stress is a fundamental component for applying the effective stress principle in unsaturated geotechnical engineering problems. The present paper aims to understand how the suction stress profiles get influenced if the $m$ and $n$ parameter of the van-Genuchten SWCC model is completely independent. Through the analysis, it is well noted that for constant air entry value, if the $m$ and $n$ relationships are varied, not only the number and the spread of the characteristic regimes get influenced, but the nature and the trend of the suction stress profiles associated with the regimes also alter significantly. A suggestion of selecting the m and n relationships is proposed for obtaining conservative solutions for geotechnical stability problems. The relevance of considering the unconstrained m parameter is established by computing the tensile crack depth of the clayey slope under steady-state infiltration conditions.</description>

      <title>HypoNet Nankai: Rapid hypocenter determination tool for the Nankai Trough subduction zone using physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate hypocenter determination in the Nankai Trough subduction zone is essential for hazard assessment and advancing our understanding of seismic activity in the region. A handy hypocenter determination tool incorporating a realistic 3D velocity structure, accessible to the scientific community, is beneficial. In this study, we developed HypoNet Nankai, a rapid hypocenter determination tool based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN) emulator (surrogate model) for travel time calculations. This tool leverages a PINN trained to predict P-wave travel times between arbitrary underground sources and surface receivers with a realistic 3D P-wave velocity structure model of the Nankai Trough subduction zone that incorporates marine seismic survey data. The PINN embeds physical laws, namely, the Eikonal equation, directly into the loss function of training and circumvents the need for labeled training data. To address the training challenges posed by small-scale features in the velocity model, we employed a simple domain decomposition approach and Fourier feature embedding. Once trained, the PINN immediately infers the P-wave travel time, enabling rapid hypocenter determination. The data size required to store NNs for travel time calculations is significantly smaller than those of conventional travel-time tables. HypoNet Nankai provides high flexibility for addition of new observation points. We verified HypoNet Nankai by comparing its performance with a widely used grid-based numerical method for forward travel time calculations and synthetic hypocenter determination. In both tests, HypoNet Nankai provided results consistent with those for the conventional method. HypoNet Nankai offers a rapid, accurate, and easy-to-use hypocenter determination method for the Nankai Trough subduction zone, with greater data efficiency and extendibility compared to conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms and timing of carbonaceous chondrite delivery to the Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nucleosynthetic isotope signatures of meteorites and the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) indicate that Earth consists of a mixture of "carbonaceous" (CC) and "non-carbonaceous" (NC) materials. We show that the fration of CC material recorded in the isotopic composition of the BSE varies for different elements, and depends on the element's tendency to partition into metal and its volatility. The observed behaviour indicates that the majority of material accreted to the Earth was NC-dominated, but that CC-dominated material enriched in moderately-volatile elements by a factor of ~10 was delivered during the last ~2-10% of Earth's acccretion. The late delivery of CC material to Earth contrasts with dynamical evidence for the early implantation of CC objects into the inner solar system during the growth and migration of the giant planets. This, together with the NC-dominated nature of both Earth's late veneer and bulk Mars, suggests that material scattered inwards had the bulk of its mass concentrated in a few, large CC embryos rather than in smaller planetesimals. We propose that Earth accreted a few of these CC embryos while Mars did not, and that at least one of the CC embryos impacted Earth relatively late (when accretion was 90-90% complete). This scenario is consistent with the subsequent Moon-formign impact of a large NC body, as long as this impact did not re-homogenize the entire Earth's mantle.</description>

      <title>Latent Diffusion Model for Conditional Reservoir Facies Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating accurate and geologically realistic reservoir facies based on limited measurements is crucial for field development and reservoir management, especially in the oil and gas sector. Traditional two-point geostatistics, while foundational, often struggle to capture complex geological patterns. Multi-point statistics offers more flexibility, but comes with its own challenges related to pattern configurations and storage limits. With the rise of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their success in various fields, there has been a shift towards using them for facies generation. However, recent advances in the computer vision domain have shown the superiority of diffusion models over GANs. Motivated by this, a novel Latent Diffusion Model is proposed, which is specifically designed for conditional generation of reservoir facies. The proposed model produces high-fidelity facies realizations that rigorously preserve conditioning data. It significantly outperforms a GAN-based alternative. Our implementation on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/ML4ITS/Latent-Diffusion-Model-for-Conditional-Reservoir-Facies-Generation}.</description>
