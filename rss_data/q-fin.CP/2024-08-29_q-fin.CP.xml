      <title>Alleviating Non-identifiability: a High-fidelity Calibration Objective for Financial Market Simulation with Multivariate Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-identifiability issue has been frequently reported in the social simulation works, where different parameters of an agent-based simulation model yield indistinguishable simulated time series data under certain discrepancy metrics. This issue largely undermines the simulation fidelity yet lacks dedicated investigations. This paper theoretically analyzes that incorporating multiple time series data features in the model calibration phase can alleviate the non-identifiability exponentially with the increasing number of features. To implement this theoretical finding, a maximization-based aggregation function is proposed based on existing discrepancy metrics to form a new calibration objective function. For verification, the task of calibrating the Financial Market Simulation (FMS), a typical yet complex social simulation, is considered. Empirical studies confirm the significant improvements in alleviating the non-identifiability of calibration tasks. Furthermore, as a model-agnostic method, it achieves much higher simulation fidelity of the chosen FMS model on both synthetic and real market data. Hence, this work is expected to provide not only a rigorous understanding of non-identifiability in social simulation, but an off-the-shelf high-fidelity calibration objective function for FMS.</description>

      <title>Trading with Time Series Causal Discovery: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of causal discovery algorithms in equity markets, with a focus on their potential to build investment strategies. An investment strategy was developed based on the causal structures identified by these algorithms. The performance of the strategy is evaluated based on the profitability and effectiveness in stock markets. The results indicate that causal discovery algorithms can successfully uncover actionable causal relationships in large markets, leading to profitable investment outcomes. However, the research also identifies a critical challenge: the computational complexity and scalability of these algorithms when dealing with large datasets. This challenge presents practical limitations for their application in real-world market analysis.</description>

      <title>SpotV2Net: Multivariate Intraday Spot Volatility Forecasting via Vol-of-Vol-Informed Graph Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces SpotV2Net, a multivariate intraday spot volatility forecasting model based on a Graph Attention Network architecture. SpotV2Net represents assets as nodes within a graph and includes non-parametric high-frequency Fourier estimates of the spot volatility and co-volatility as node features. Further, it incorporates Fourier estimates of the spot volatility of volatility and co-volatility of volatility as features for node edges, to capture spillover effects. We test the forecasting accuracy of SpotV2Net in an extensive empirical exercise, conducted with the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average index. The results we obtain suggest that SpotV2Net yields statistically significant gains in forecasting accuracy, for both single-step and multi-step forecasts, compared to a panel heterogenous auto-regressive model and alternative machine-learning models. To interpret the forecasts produced by SpotV2Net, we employ GNNExplainer \citep{ying2019gnnexplainer}, a model-agnostic interpretability tool, and thereby uncover subgraphs that are critical to a node's predictions.</description>
