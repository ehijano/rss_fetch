      <title>Phase estimation via number-conserving operation inside the SU(1,1) interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing nonlinear elements, SU(1,1) interferometers demonstrate superior phase sensitivity compared to passive interferometers. However, the precision is significantly impacted by photon losses, particularly internal losses. We propose a theoretical scheme to improve the precision of phase measurement using homodyne detection by implementing number-conserving operations (PA-then-PS and PS-then-PA) within the SU(1,1) interferometer, with the coherent state and the vacuum state as the input states. We analyze the effects of number-conserving operations on the phase sensitivity, the quantum Fisher information, and the quantum Cramer-Rao bound under both ideal and photon losses scenarios. Our findings reveal that the internal non-Gaussian operations can enhance the phase sensitivity and the quantum Fisher information, and effectively improve the robustness of the SU(1,1) interferometer against internal photon losses. Notably, the PA-then-PS scheme exhibits superior improvement in both ideal and photon losses cases in terms of phase sensitivity. Moreover, in the ideal case, PA-then-PS scheme slightly outperforms PS-then-PA scheme in terms of the quantum Fisher information and the Quantum Cramer-Rao. However, in the presence of photon losses, PS-then-PA scheme demonstrates a greater advantage.</description>

      <title>Conceptual Problems in Quantum Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In studies of quantum squeezing, the emphasis is typically placed more on specific squeezed states and their evolution rather than on the dynamical operations that could simultaneously squeeze a broader range of quantum states, regardless of their initial configuration. We explore new developments in this area, facilitated by gently acting external fields which might induce squeezing of the canonical observables $q$ and $p$ in charged particles. The extensive research in this field has yielded many valuable insights, raising the question of whether there is still room for significant new contributions to our understanding. Nonetheless, we present some exactly solvable instances of this problem, observed in symmetric evolution intervals. These intervals allow for the explicit determination of the temporal dependence of external fields necessary to generate the required evolution operators. Our findings are linked with a straightforward application of Toeplitz matrices, offering a more accessible description of the problem compared to the frequently employed Ermakov-Milne invariants.</description>

      <title>Relativistic generalization of Feynman's path integral on the basis of extended Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the extended Lagrange formalism of classical point dynamics, the system's dynamics is parametrized along a system evolution parameter $s$, and the physical time $t$ is treated as a \emph{dependent} variable $t(s)$ on equal footing with all other configuration space variables $q^{i}(s)$. In the action principle, the conventional classical action $L\,dt$ is then replaced by the generalized action $L_{\e}ds$. Supposing that both Lagrangians describe the same physical system then provides the correlation of $L$ and $L_{\e}$. In the existing literature, the discussion is restricted to only those extended Lagrangians $L_{\e}$ that are homogeneous forms of first order in the velocities. As a new result, it is shown that a class of extended Lagrangians $L_{\e}$ exists that are correlated to corresponding conventional Lagrangians $L$ \emph{without being homogeneous functions in the velocities}. With these extended Lagrangians, the system's dynamics is described as a motion on a hypersurface within a \emph{symplectic extended} phase space of even dimension. As a consequence of the formal similarity of conventional and extended Lagrange formalisms, Feynman's non-relativistic path integral approach can be converted into a form appropriate for \emph{relativistic} quantum physics. To provide an example, the non-homogeneous extended Lagrangian $L_{\e}$ of a classical relativistic point particle in an external electromagnetic field will be presented. This extended Lagrangian has the remarkable property to be a quadratic function in the velocities. With this $L_{\e}$, it is shown that the generalized path integral approach yields the Klein-Gordon equation as the corresponding quantum description. This result can be regarded as the proof of principle of the \emph{relativistic generalization} of Feynman's path integral approach to quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reinforcement Learning in Non-Abelian Environments: Unveiling Novel Formulations and Quantum Advantage Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into recent advancements in Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL), particularly focusing on non-commutative environments, which represent uncharted territory in this field. Our research endeavors to redefine the boundaries of decision-making by introducing formulations and strategies that harness the inherent properties of quantum systems.
  At the core of our investigation characterization of the agent's state space within a Hilbert space ($\mathcal{H}$). Here, quantum states emerge as complex superpositions of classical state introducing non-commutative quantum actions governed by unitary operators, necessitating a reimagining of state transitions. Complementing this framework is a refined reward function, rooted in quantum mechanics as a Hermitian operator on $\mathcal{H}$. This reward function serves as the foundation for the agent's decision-making process. By leveraging the quantum Bellman equation, we establish a methodology for maximizing expected cumulative reward over an infinite horizon, considering the entangled dynamics of quantum systems. We also connect the Quantum Bellman Equation to the Degree of Non Commutativity of the Environment, evident in Pure Algebra.
  We design a quantum advantage function. This ingeniously designed function exploits latent quantum parallelism inherent in the system, enhancing the agent's decision-making capabilities and paving the way for exploration of quantum advantage in uncharted territories. Furthermore, we address the significant challenge of quantum exploration directly, recognizing the limitations of traditional strategies in this complex environment.</description>

      <title>Derivation of Casimir Effect without Zeta-Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Casimir effect describes the attractive force arising due to quantum fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field between closely spaced conducting plates. Traditionally, zeta-regularization is employed in calculations to address infinities that emerge during the derivation. This paper presents a novel derivation of the Casimir effect that circumvents the need for zeta-regularization. We derive a formula for the average vacuum energy density between two perfectly conducting plates separated by distance a. Our approach relates the expected vacuum energy to the change in length and position associated with each energy state. The uncertainty principle is incorporated to calculate the area linked to each state. The final result aligns with the standard Casimir effect formula obtained with zeta-regularization. This work demonstrates that the Casimir effect can be derived without relying on zeta-regularization, offering an alternative perspective on this well-established phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Boosting end-to-end entanglement fidelity in quantum repeater networks via hybridized strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks are expected to enhance distributed quantum computing and quantum communication over long distances while providing security dependent upon physical effects rather than mathematical assumptions. Through simulation, we show that a quantum network utilizing only entanglement purification or only quantum error correction as error management strategies cannot create Bell pairs with fidelity that exceeds the requirement for a secured quantum key distribution protocol for a broad range of hardware parameters. We propose hybrid strategies utilizing quantum error correction on top of purification and show that they can produce Bell pairs of sufficiently high fidelity. We identify the error parameter regime for gate and measurement errors in which these hybrid strategies are applicable.</description>

      <title>Quantum Positional Encodings for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose novel families of positional encodings tailored to graph neural networks obtained with quantum computers. These encodings leverage the long-range correlations inherent in quantum systems that arise from mapping the topology of a graph onto interactions between qubits in a quantum computer. Our inspiration stems from the recent advancements in quantum processing units, which offer computational capabilities beyond the reach of classical hardware. We prove that some of these quantum features are theoretically more expressive for certain graphs than the commonly used relative random walk probabilities. Empirically, we show that the performance of state-of-the-art models can be improved on standard benchmarks and large-scale datasets by computing tractable versions of quantum features. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging quantum computing capabilities to enhance the performance of transformers in handling graph data.</description>

      <title>Partial symplectic quantum tomography schemes. Observables, evolution equations, and stationary states equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial symplectic conditional and joint probability representations of quantum mechanics are considered. The correspondence rules for most interesting physical operators are found and the expressions of the dual symbols of operators are derived. Calculations were made by use of general formalism of quantizers and dequantizers determining the star product quantization scheme in these representations. Taking the Gaussian functions as the distributions of the tomographic parameters the examples of joint probability representations were considered. Evolution equations and stationary states equations for partial symplectic conditional and joint probability distributions are obtained.</description>

      <title>Potential Applications of Quantum Computing at Los Alamos National Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum computing technology over the last decade indicates the potential for a transformational impact in the study of quantum mechanical systems. It is natural to presume that such computing technologies would be valuable to large scientific institutions, such as United States national laboratories. However, detailed descriptions of what these institutions would like to use these computers for are limited. To help provide some initial insights into this topic, this report develops detailed use cases of how quantum computing technology could be utilized to enhance a variety of quantum physics research activities at Los Alamos National Laboratory, including quantum magnetic materials, high-temperature superconductivity and nuclear astrophysics simulations. The report discusses how current high-performance computers are used for scientific discovery today and develops detailed descriptions of the types of quantum physics simulations that Los Alamos National Laboratory scientists would like to conduct, if a sufficient computing technology became available. While the report strives to highlight the breadth of potential application areas for quantum computation, this investigation has also indicated that many more use cases exist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, which could be documented in similar detail with sufficient time and effort.</description>

      <title>The elision of the subject and the manifestation of the world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to the contextuality of the properties of quantum objects, quantum mechanics does not appear to countenance the elision of the thinking and perceiving subject. If quantum objects owe their properties to the experimental conditions in which they are observed, the experimental apparatus cannot owe its properties to the quantum objects of which it is commonly said to be composed. It follows that neither quantum objects nor measuring instruments can be regarded as property-carriers existing independently of conscious subjects. However, if the difference between the classical domain and the quantum domain is understood as essentially the difference between the manifested world and what is instrumental in its manifestation, the elision of the subject can again be achieved.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning With Canonical Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilising dynamic electromagnetic field control over charged particles serves as the basis for a quantum machine learning platform that operates on observables rather than directly on states. Such a platform can be physically realised in ion traps or particle confinement devices that utilise electromagnetic fields as the source of control. The electromagnetic field acts as the ansatz within the learning algorithm. The models discussed are exactly solvable, with exact solutions serving as precursors for learning tasks to emerge, including regression and classification algorithms as particular cases. This approach is considered in terms of canonical variables with semi-classical behaviour, disregarding relativistic degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Quasiprobability distributions with weak measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how quantum coherence governs the quasiprobability statistics of outcome pairs, consecutively recorded at two distinct times, using weak measurements. In doing this, we have realised weak-sequential measurement with photonic qubits, where the first measurement is carried out by a positive operator-valued measure, whereas the second one is a projective operation. We determine the quasiprobability distributions associated to this procedure, based on both the commensurate and the Margenau-Hill approach, by establishing a link between these descriptions. Our results find application to quantum monitoring aimed at implementing or stabilising task without completely loosing the initial quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>Relative descriptors for quantum agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Heisenberg picture of Everettian quantum mechanics to work out the relative descriptors for the Frauchiger-Renner thought experiment. While Everettian mechanics reveals no paradox within the thought experiment, the decoherence-free setup offers an instructive branching tree. Traditionally, branching structures derived from the Schr\"odinger picture suggest that foliations are always sharply defined. However, the Heisenberg picture demonstrates that the tree contains regions with inherently non-sharp foliations, leading to the conclusion that, in Everettian mechanics, quantum agents possess a blurry memory. This analysis helps resolve several misconceptions stemming from the Schr\"odinger picture.</description>

      <title>Alignment and Optimisation of Optical Tweezers on Trapped Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a routine to align an optical tweezer on a single trapped ion and use the ion as a probe to characterize the tweezer. We find a smallest tweezer waist of $2.3(2)\,\mu$m, which is in agreement with the theoretical minimal attainable waist of $2.5(2)\,\mu$m in our setup. We characterize the spatial dependence of the tweezer Rabi frequency which is suppressed by a factor of 19(3) in the immediate surrounding of the ion. We investigate the effects of optical forces and coherent population trapping on the ion. Finally, we show that the challenges posed by these forces can be overcome, and that the number of tweezers can be easily scaled up to reach several ions by using a spatial light modulator.</description>

      <title>Physical coherent cancellation of optical addressing crosstalk in a trapped-ion experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental investigation of coherent crosstalk cancellation methods for light delivered to a linear ion chain cryogenic quantum register. The ions are individually addressed using focused laser beams oriented perpendicular to the crystal axis, which are created by imaging each output of a multi-core photonic-crystal fibre waveguide array onto a single ion. The measured nearest-neighbor native crosstalk intensity of this device for ions spaced by 5 $\mu$m is found to be $\sim 10^{-2}$. We show that we can suppress this intensity crosstalk from waveguide channel coupling and optical diffraction effects by a factor $&gt;10^3$ using cancellation light supplied to neighboring channels which destructively interferes with the crosstalk. We measure a rotation error per gate on the order of $\epsilon_{x} \sim 10^{-5}$ on spectator qubits, demonstrating a suppression of crosstalk error by a factor of $&gt; 10^2$. We compare the performance to composite pulse methods for crosstalk cancellation, and describe the appropriate calibration methods and procedures to mitigate phase drifts between these different optical paths, including accounting for problems arising due to pulsing of optical modulators.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel approach to quantum algorithms, by taking advantage of modular values, i.e., complex and unbounded quantities resulting from specific post-selected measurement scenarios. Our focus is on the problem of ascertaining whether a given function acting on a set of binary values is constant (uniformly yielding outputs of either all 0 or all 1), or balanced (a situation wherein half of the outputs are 0 and the other half are 1). Such problem can be solved by relying on the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. The proposed method, relying on the use of modular values, provides a high number of degrees of freedom for optimizing the new algorithm inspired from the Deutsch-Jozsa one. In particular, we explore meticulously the choices of the pre- and post-selected states. We eventually test the novel theoretical algorithm on a quantum computing platform. While the outcomes are currently not on par with the conventional approach, they nevertheless shed light on potential for future improvements, especially with less-optimized algorithms. We are thus confidend that the proposed proof of concept could prove its validity in bridging quantum algorithms and modular values research fields.</description>

      <title>Experimental benchmarking of quantum state overlap estimation strategies with photonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the overlap between quantum states is a fundamental task in quantum information processing. While various strategies using distinct quantum measurements have been proposed for overlap estimation, the lack of experimental benchmarks on estimation precision limits strategy selection in different situations. Here we compare the performance of four practical strategies for overlap estimation, including tomography-tomography, tomography-projection, Schur collective measurement and optical swap test. With a photonic system, the overlap-dependent estimation precision for each strategy is quantified in terms of the average estimation variance over uniformly sampled states, which highlight the different performance of different strategies. We further propose an adaptive strategy with optimized precision in full-range overlap estimation. Our results shed new light on extracting the parameter of interest from quantum systems, prompting the design of efficient quantum protocols.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Quantum Transpilers: Evaluating the Performance of qiskit-braket-provider, qBraid-SDK, and Pytket Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of several quantum transpilers, including the qiskit-braket-provider, the qBraid-SDK, and the pytket extensions, focusing on critical metrics such as correctness, failure rate, and transpilation time. Our results demonstrate that the qiskit-braket-provider exhibits superior performance achieving a remarkably low failure rate of 0.2%. the qiskit-braket-provider utilizes a combination of one-to-one transpilation and gate decomposition for unsupported gates, enhancing transpiler capabilities and speed. The qBraid-SDK offers a more generalized approach, suitable for transpilation across multiple SDKs, albeit with slower performance compared to the qiskit-braket-provider. The pytket extensions, while fast, exhibit limitations in handling complex circuits due to their one-to-one transpilation scheme. We also provide recommendations for future development, advocating for the adoption of the method employed by the qiskit-braket-provider to enhance transpiler capabilities and speed. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge in quantum transpiler benchmarking, fostering interoperability and guiding the development of quantum computing applications in a diverse hardware and software landscape.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Entanglement is Necessary for EFI Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regarding minimal assumptions, most of classical cryptography is known to depend on the existence of One-Way Functions (OWFs). However, recent evidence has shown that this is not the case when considering quantum resources. Besides the well known unconditional security of Quantum Key Distribution, it is now known that computational cryptography may be built on weaker primitives than OWFs, e.g., pseudo-random states [JLS18], one-way state generators [MY23], or EFI pairs of states [BCQ23]. We consider a new quantum resource, pseudo-entanglement, and show that the existence of EFI pairs, one of the current main candidates for the weakest computational assumption for cryptography (necessary for commitments, oblivious transfer, secure multi-party computation, computational zero-knowledge proofs), implies the existence of pseudo-entanglement, as defined by [ABF+24, ABV23] under some reasonable adaptations. We prove this by constructing a new family of pseudo-entangled quantum states given only EFI pairs. Our result has important implications for the field of computational cryptography. It shows that if pseudo-entanglement does not exist, then most of cryptography cannot exist either. Moreover, it establishes pseudo-entanglement as a new minimal assumption for most of computational cryptography, which may pave the way for the unification of other assumptions into a single primitive. Finally, pseudo-entanglement connects physical phenomena and efficient computation, thus, our result strengthens the connection between cryptography and the physical world.</description>

      <title>Optimal Qubit Mapping Search for Encoding Classical Data into Matrix Product State Representation with Minimal Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix product state (MPS) offers a framework for encoding classical data into quantum states, enabling the efficient utilization of quantum resources for data representation and processing. This research paper investigates techniques to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of MPS representations specifically designed for encoding classical data. Based on the observations that MPS truncation error depends on the pattern of the classical data, we devised an algorithm that finds optimal qubit mapping for given classical data, thereby improving the efficiency and fidelity of the MPS representation. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of the optimized MPS in the context of quantum classifiers, demonstrating their enhanced performance compared to the conventional mapping. This improvement confirms the efficacy of the proposed techniques for encoding classical data into quantum states. MPS representation combined with optimal qubit mapping can pave a new way for more efficient and accurate quantum data representation and processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultrafast quantum dynamics of photophysical processes in complex molecules is an extremely challenging computational problem with a wide variety of fascinating applications in quantum chemistry and biology. Inspired by recent developments in open quantum systems, we introduce a pure-state unraveled hybrid-bath method that describes a continuous environment via a set of discrete, effective bosonic degrees of freedom using a Markovian embedding. Our method is capable of describing both, a continuous spectral density and sharp peaks embedded into it. Thereby, we overcome the limitations of previous methods, which either capture long-time memory effects using the unitary dynamics of a set of discrete vibrational modes or use memoryless Markovian environments employing a Lindblad or Redfield master equation. We benchmark our method against two paradigmatic problems from quantum chemistry and biology. We demonstrate that compared to unitary descriptions, a significantly smaller number of bosonic modes suffices to describe the excitonic dynamics accurately, yielding a computational speed-up of nearly an order of magnitude. Furthermore, we take into account explicitly the effect of a $\delta$-peak in the spectral density of a light-harvesting complex, demonstrating the strong impact of the long-time memory of the environment on the dynamics.</description>

      <title>MPSDynamics.jl: Tensor network simulations for finite-temperature (non-Markovian) open quantum system dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MPSDynamics.jl package provides an easy to use interface for performing open quantum systems simulations at zero and finite temperatures. The package has been developed with the aim of studying non-Markovian open system dynamics using the state-of-the-art numerically exact Thermalized-Time Evolving Density operator with Orthonormal Polynomials Algorithm (T-TEDOPA) based on environment chain mapping. The simulations rely on a tensor network representation of the quantum states as matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network (TTN) states. Written in the Julia programming language, MPSDynamics.jl is a versatile open-source package providing a choice of several variants of the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) method for time evolution (including novel bond-adaptive one-site algorithms). The package also provides strong support for the measurement of single and multi-site observables, as well as the storing and logging of data, which makes it a useful tool for the study of many-body physics. It currently handles long-range interactions, time-dependent Hamiltonians, multiple environments, bosonic and fermionic environments, and joint system-environment observables.</description>

      <title>Adaptive quantum optimization algorithms for programmable atom-cavity systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing quantum algorithms adaptive to specific constraints of near-term devices is an essential step towards practical quantum advantage. In a recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 103601(2023)], we show cold atoms in an optical cavity can be built as a universal quantum optimizer with programmable all-to-all interactions, and the effective Hamiltonian for atoms directly encodes number partitioning problems (NPPs). Here, we numerically investigate the performance of quantum annealing (QA) and quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) to find the solution of NPP that is encoded in the ground state of atomic qubits. We find the success probability of the standard QA decays rapidly with the problem size. The optimized annealing path or inhomogeneous driving fields only lead to mild improvement on the success probability. Similarly, the standard QAOA always gets trapped in a false local minimum, and there is no significant performance improvement as we increase the depth of the quantum circuit. Inspired by the counterdiabatic driving, we propose an adaptive ansatz of QAOA which releases the parameter freedom of the NPP Hamiltonian to match higher-order counterdiabatic terms. Through numerical simulations, we find that our adaptive QAOA can achieve the optimal solution within very small circuit depth. It is thus worth paying the extra optimization cost of additional parameters for improving QAOA performance. Therefore, our adaptive QAOA provides a promising choice for programmable atom-cavity systems to demonstrate competitive computational power within its quantum coherence time.</description>

      <title>On the relation between trainability and dequantization of variational quantum learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for successful variational quantum machine learning (QML) relies on the design of suitable parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs), as analogues to neural networks in classical machine learning. Successful QML models must fulfill the properties of trainability and non-dequantization, among others. Recent works have highlighted an intricate interplay between trainability and dequantization of such models, which is still unresolved. In this work we contribute to this debate from the perspective of machine learning, proving a number of results identifying, among others when trainability and non-dequantization are not mutually exclusive. We begin by providing a number of new somewhat broader definitions of the relevant concepts, compared to what is found in other literature, which are operationally motivated, and consistent with prior art. With these precise definitions given and motivated, we then study the relation between trainability and dequantization of variational QML. Next, we also discuss the degrees of "variationalness" of QML models, where we distinguish between models like the hardware efficient ansatz and quantum kernel methods. Finally, we introduce recipes for building PQC-based QML models which are both trainable and nondequantizable, and corresponding to different degrees of variationalness. We do not address the practical utility for such models. Our work however does point toward a way forward for finding more general constructions, for which finding applications may become feasible.</description>

      <title>High-purity and stable single-photon emission in bilayer WSe$_2$ via phonon-assisted excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excitation scheme is essential for single-photon sources as it prepares the exciton state, defines the decay dynamics, and influences the spectral diffusion of the emitted single photons. Here, we investigate the impact of different optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission characteristics of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Under phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow and stable single-photon emission with an excellent purity reaching $ 0.94\pm 0.02\,$. Furthermore, the decay time is reduced by more than an order of magnitude from $(16.65 \pm 2.39)\,$ns for above-band excitation to $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns for phonon-assisted excitation. Finally, we observe a suppressed spectral wandering along with a two-fold reduction of the spectral linewidth. Our comprehensive investigation highlights the critical role of the excitation method in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Compact Polarization-Entangled Photon Source Based on Coexisting Noncritically Birefringent and Quasi Phase Matching in a Nonlinear Crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization-entangled photons are indispensable to numerous quantum technologies and fundamental studies. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a novel source that generates collinear polarization-entangled photons by simultaneously achieving two distinct types of phase-matching conditions (noncritically birefringent and quasi phase matching) in a periodically poled nonlinear crystal with a large poling period of 2 mm. The photon pairs are generated in a polarization-entangled state with a fidelity and concurrence of 0.998 and 0.935, respectively, and violate the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality by 84 standard deviations. The compact source does not require interferometer, delicate domain structures, or post selection, and is advantageous for scalable quantum computing and communication, where many replicas or chip-scale devices are needed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate measurements with implications in many branches in Physics have been accessed using Penning traps and conventional techniques within a temperature regime where each eigenmotion of a charged particle is still a classical harmonic oscillator. Cooling the particle directly or indirectly with lasers allows reaching the quantum regime of each oscillator, controlling subtle effects in the precision frontier by detecting photons instead of electric current. In this paper, we present a new in-vacuum optical system designed to detecting 397-nm fluorescence photons from individual calcium ions and Coulomb crystals in a 7-T Penning trap. Based on the outcome of computer simulations, our design shows diffraction-limited performance. The system has been characterized using a single laser-cooled ion as a point-like source, reaching a final resolution of 3.69(3) $\mu$m and 2.75(3) $\mu$m for the trap's axial and radial directions, respectively, after correcting aberrations.</description>

      <title>Four-qubit photonic system for publicly verifiable quantum random numbers and generation of public and private key</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate the use of a configurable four-qubit photonic system to generate a publicly verifiable quantum random numbers, to perform entanglement verification, and to generate a secure public and private key. Quantum circuits, to generate the desired four-qubit states and its experimental realization in the photonic architecture is carried out using photon pairs entangled in polarization and path degree of freedom. By performing measurements on the four-qubit system and accessing partial information of the four-qubit state for public verification, we generate publicly verified and purely secured random bits at the rate of 370 kbps. When the system is used for generating public and private keys, an equal number of public and private keys are generated simultaneously. We also record about 97.9\% of sampled bits from four-qubit states passing entanglement verification. The theoretical model of noise on the four-qubit state and its effect on the generation rate of verified and secured bits are in perfect agreement with the experimental results. This demonstrates the practical use of the small-scale multi-qubit photonic system for quantum-safe applications by providing the option for real-time verification of the security feature of the quantum system.</description>

      <title>Quantum repeaters based on stationary Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum repeaters that incorporate quantum error correction codes have been shown to be a promising alternative compared with the original quantum repeaters that rely upon probabilistic quantum error detection depending on classical communication over remote repeater stations. A particularly efficient way of encoding qubits into an error correction code is through bosonic codes where even a single oscillator mode serves as a sufficiently large, physical system. Here we consider the bosonic Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code as a natural choice for a loss-correction-based quantum repeater. However, unlike existing treatments, we focus on the excitation loss that occurs in the local, stationary memory qubits as represented by, for instance, collective atomic spin modes. We analyze and assess the performance of such a GKP-based quantum repeater where, apart from the initial state generations and distributions, all operations can be performed via deterministic linear mode transformations, as opposed to other existing memory-based quantum repeater schemes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedup of the Dispersion and Codebook Design Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new formulations of max-sum and max-min dispersion problems that enable solutions via the Grover adaptive search (GAS) quantum algorithm, offering quadratic speedup. Dispersion problems are combinatorial optimization problems classified as NP-hard, which appear often in coding theory and wireless communications applications involving optimal codebook design. In turn, GAS is a quantum exhaustive search algorithm that can be used to implement full-fledged maximum-likelihood optimal solutions. In conventional naive formulations however, it is typical to rely on a binary vector spaces, resulting in search space sizes prohibitive even for GAS. To circumvent this challenge, we instead formulate the search of optimal dispersion problem over Dicke states, an equal superposition of binary vectors with equal Hamming weights, which significantly reduces the search space leading to a simplification of the quantum circuit via the elimination of penalty terms. Additionally, we propose a method to replace distance coefficients with their ranks, contributing to the reduction of the number of qubits. Our analysis demonstrates that as a result of the proposed techniques a reduction in query complexity compared to the conventional GAS using Hadamard transform is achieved, enhancing the feasibility of the quantum-based solution of the dispersion problem.</description>

      <title>Robustness of perfect transmission resonances to asymmetric perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the perfect transmission resonances (PTRs) of perturbed 1D finite periodic systems with mirror symmetric cells. The unperturbed scattering region consists of $N$ identical cells and the related transmission spectrum possesses at least $N-1$ PTRs in each pass band of the Bloch dispersion of the unit cell. On the other hand, the perturbation is breaking the periodicity and, a priori, is able to eliminate all the PTRs. We show how PTRs could still appear in the perturbed case with a suitable design of the perturbation. We also reveal a connection between two apparently independent PTRs, a connection that lies in the symmetry of the finite Kronig-Penney systems and which implies that if one PTR is preserved then another one, among the $N-1$ PTRs in a pass band, is necessarily also preserved.</description>

      <title>A generic and robust quantum agent inspired by deep meta-reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has enabled human- or superhuman- performances in various applications. Recently, deep RL has also been adopted to improve the performance of quantum control. However, a large volume of data is typically required to train the neural network in deep RL, making it inefficient compared with the traditional optimal quantum control method. Here, we thus develop a new training algorithm inspired by the deep meta-reinforcement learning (deep meta-RL), which requires significantly less training data. The trained neural network is adaptive and robust. In addition, the algorithm proposed by us has been applied to design the Hadamard gate and show that for a wide range of parameters the infidelity of the obtained gate can be made of the order 0.0001. Our algorithm can also automatically adjust the number of pulses required to generate the target gate, which is different from the traditional optimal quantum control method which typically fixes the number of pulses a-priory. The results of this paper can pave the way towards constructing a universally robust quantum agent catering to the different demands in quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology utilizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to classify Markovian and non-Markovian quantum processes, leveraging time series data derived from Choi states. The model exhibits exceptional accuracy, surpassing 95%, across diverse scenarios, encompassing dephasing and Pauli channels in an arbitrary basis, and generalized amplitude damping dynamics. Additionally, the developed model shows efficient forecasting capabilities for the analyzed time series data. These results suggest the potential of RNNs in discerning and predicting the Markovian nature of quantum processes.</description>

      <title>Improved criteria of detecting multipartite entanglement structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is one of the crucial resources in quantum information processing tasks such as quantum metrology, quantum computing and quantum communications. It is essential to verify not only the multipartite entanglement, but also the entanglement structure in both fundamental theories and the applications of quantum information technologies. However, it is proved to be challenging to detect the entanglement structures, including entanglement depth, entanglement intactness and entanglement stretchability, especially for general states and large-scale quantum systems. By using the partitions of the tensor product space we propose a systematic method to construct powerful entanglement witnesses which identify better the multipartite entanglement structures. Besides, an efficient algorithm using semi-definite programming and a gradient descent algorithm are designed to detect entanglement structure from the inner polytope of the convex set containing all the states with the same entanglement structure. We demonstrate by detailed examples that our criteria perform better than other known ones. Our results may be applied to many quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>No-broadcasting characterizes operational contextuality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operational contextuality forms a rapidly developing subfield of quantum information theory. However, the characterization of the quantum mechanical entities that fuel the phenomenon has remained unknown with many partial results existing. Here, we present a resolution to this problem by connecting operational contextuality one-to-one with the no-broadcasting theorem. The connection works both on the level of full quantum theory and subtheories thereof. We demonstrate the connection in various relevant cases, showing especially that for quantum states the possibility of demonstrating contextuality is exactly characterized by non-commutativity, and for measurements this is done by a norm-1 property closely related to repeatability. Moreover, we show how techniques from broadcasting can be used to simplify known foundational results in contextuality.</description>

      <title>Few-Body Quantum Chaos, Localization, and Multi-Photon Entanglement in Optical Synthetic Frequency Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation and control of entanglement are fundamental tasks in quantum information processing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to generate controllable frequency-entangled photons by using the concept of synthetic frequency dimension in an optical system. Such a system consists of a ring resonator made by a tailored third-order nonlinear media to induce photon-photon interactions and a periodic modulator to manipulate coupling between different frequency modes. We show this system provides a unique platform for the exploration of distinct few- or many-body quantum phases including chaos, localization, and integrability in a highly integrable photonics platform. In particular, we develop the potential experimental method to calculate the spectral form factor, which characterizes the degree of chaos in the system and differentiates between these phases based on observable measurements. Interestingly, the transition signatures of each phase can lead to an efficient generation of frequency-entangled multi photons. This work is the first to explore rich and controllable quantum phases beyond single particle in a synthetic dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze an approach for fast syndrome measurements in an array of rubidium and cesium atomic qubits. The scheme works by implementing an inter-species $\textsf{CNOT}_k$ gate, entangling one cesium ancilla qubit with $k\geq 1$ rubidium qubits which are then used for state measurement. Utilizing Rydberg states with different inter- and intra-species interaction strengths, the proposal provides a syndrome measurement fidelity of $\mathcal{F}&gt;0.9999$ in less than 5 $\mu$s of integration time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong nonlinear interactions between quantized excitations are an important resource for quantum technologies based on bosonic oscillator modes. However, most electromagnetic and mechanical nonlinearities arising from intrinsic material properties are far too weak compared to dissipation in the system to allow for nonlinear effects to be observed on the single-quantum level. To overcome this limitation, electromagnetic resonators in both the optical and microwave frequency regimes have been coupled to other strongly nonlinear quantum systems such as atoms and superconducting qubits, allowing for the demonstration of effects such as photon blockade and coherent quantum protocols using the Kerr effect. Here, we demonstrate the realization of the single-phonon nonlinear regime in a solid-state mechanical system. The single-phonon anharmonicity in our system exceeds the decoherence rate by a factor of 6.8, allowing us to use the lowest two energy levels of the resonator as a mechanical qubit, for which we show initialization, readout, and a complete set of direct single qubit gates. Our work adds another unique capability to a powerful quantum acoustics platform for quantum simulations, sensing, and information processing.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev Approximated Variational Coupled Cluster for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approach to approximately implement the variational coupled cluster (VCC) theory on quantum computers, which struggles with exponential scaling of computational costs on classical computers. To this end, we employ expanding the exponential cluster operator using Chebyshev polynomials and introduce two methods: the Chebyshev approximated VCC (C$^d$-VCC) and the Hermitian-part Chebyshev approximated VCC (HC$^d$-VCC), where $d$ indicates the maximum degree of the Chebyshev polynomials. The latter method decomposes the cluster operator into anti-Hermitian and Hermitian parts, with the anti-Hermitian part represented by the disentangled unitary coupled cluster ansatz and the Hermitian part approximated using Chebyshev expansion. We illustrate the implementation of the HC$^d$-VCC in a quantum circuit using the quantum singular value transformation technique. Numerical simulations show that the C$^d$-VCC rapidly converges to the exact VCC with increasing truncation degree $d$, and the HC$^d$-VCC effectively reduces the Chebyshev expansion error compared to the C$^d$-VCC. The HC$^d$-VCC method for realizing non-unitary coupled cluster wave functions on quantum computers is expected to be useful for initial state preparation on quantum computers and efficient tomography of the quantum state for post-processing on classical computers after quantum computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel quantum battery realized with a few interacting particles in a three-well system with different on-site energies, which could be realized with ultracold atom platforms. We prepare the initial state in the lowest energy well and charge the battery using a Spatial Adiabatic Passage (SAP)-based protocol, enabling the population of a higher energy well. We examine the charging under varying interaction strengths and reveal that the consideration of collective charging results in an intriguing oscillatory behavior of the final charge for finite interactions, through diabatic evolution. Our findings open a new avenue for building stable and controllable quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to adiabaticity designed via time-rescaling follow the same transitionless route</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-rescaling (TR) has been recently proposed as a method to engineer fast processes, also known as shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA), which enables the coherent control of quantum systems beyond the adiabatic regime [B. L. Bernardo, Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 013133 (2020)]. The method provides the Hamiltonians that generate the fast processes without requiring information about the instantaneous eigenstates of a reference protocol, whereas experimental implementations dismiss additional coupling fields when compared with adiabatic protocols. Here, we revisit the technique and show that the obtained fast dynamics are transitionless, similar to the ones designed via the famous counterdiabatic (CD) approach. We also show that the time evolution of the STA found via TR relates to that of the reference adiabatic protocol by a simple reparametrization of time. To illustrate our findings, we studied the problem of speeding up the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) and found out that TR revealed quantum dynamics more robust to parameter variations than those provided by the CD technique. Our results shed new light on the application of TR in the control of larger quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Incompressibility and spectral gaps of random circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random reversible and quantum circuits form random walks on the alternating group $\mathrm{Alt}(2^n)$ and unitary group $\mathrm{SU}(2^n)$, respectively. Known bounds on the spectral gap for the $t$-th moment of these random walks have inverse-polynomial dependence in both $n$ and $t$. We prove that the gap for random reversible circuits is $\Omega(n^{-3})$ for all $t\geq 1$, and the gap for random quantum circuits is $\Omega(n^{-3})$ for $t \leq \Theta(2^{n/2})$. These gaps are independent of $t$ in the respective regimes. We can further improve both gaps to $n^{-1}/\mathrm{polylog}(n, t)$ for $t\leq 2^{\Theta(n)}$, which is tight up to polylog factors. Our spectral gap results have a number of consequences:
  1) Random reversible circuits with $\mathcal{O}(n^4 t)$ gates form multiplicative-error $t$-wise independent (even) permutations for all $t\geq 1$; for $t \leq \Theta(2^{n/6.1})$, we show that $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2 t)$ gates suffice.
  2) Random quantum circuits with $\mathcal{O}(n^4 t)$ gates form multiplicative-error unitary $t$-designs for $t \leq \Theta(2^{n/2})$; for $t\leq \Theta(2^{2n/5})$, we show that $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2t)$ gates suffice.
  3) The robust quantum circuit complexity of random circuits grows linearly for an exponentially long time, proving the robust Brown--Susskind conjecture [BS18,BCHJ+21].
  Our spectral gap bounds are proven by reducing random quantum circuits to a more structured walk: a modification of the ``$\mathrm{PFC}$ ensemble'' from [MPSY24] together with an expander on the alternating group due to Kassabov [Kas07a], for which we give an efficient implementation using reversible circuits. In our reduction, we approximate the structured walk with local random circuits without losing the gap, which uses tools from the study of frustration-free Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Novel Optimized Designs of Modulo $2n+1$ Adder for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum modular adders are one of the most fundamental yet versatile quantum computation operations. They help implement functions of higher complexity, such as subtraction and multiplication, which are used in applications such as quantum cryptanalysis, quantum image processing, and securing communication. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing design of quantum modulo $(2n+1)$ adder. In this work, we propose four quantum adders targeted specifically for modulo $(2n+1)$ addition. These adders can provide both regular and modulo $(2n+1)$ sum concurrently, enhancing their application in residue number system based arithmetic. Our first design, QMA1, is a novel quantum modulo $(2n+1)$ adder. The second proposed adder, QMA2, optimizes the utilization of quantum gates within the QMA1, resulting in 37.5% reduced CNOT gate count, 46.15% reduced CNOT depth, and 26.5% decrease in both Toffoli gates and depth. We propose a third adder QMA3 that uses zero resets, a dynamic circuits based feature that reuses qubits, leading to 25% savings in qubit count. Our fourth design, QMA4, demonstrates the benefit of incorporating additional zero resets to achieve a purer zero state, reducing quantum state preparation errors. Notably, we conducted experiments using 5-qubit configurations of the proposed modulo $(2n+1)$ adders on the IBM Washington, a 127-qubit quantum computer based on the Eagle R1 architecture, to demonstrate a 28.8% reduction in QMA1's error of which: (i) 18.63% error reduction happens due to gate and depth reduction in QMA2, and (ii) 2.53% drop in error due to qubit reduction in QMA3, and (iii) 7.64% error decreased due to application of additional zero resets in QMA4.</description>

      <title>Algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect and unified non-Bloch band theory in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, characterized by a proliferation of exponentially-localized edge modes, has led to numerous novel physical phenomena that challenge the limits of conventional band theory. In sharp contrast to the traditional exponential localization, this manuscript reports a new kind of non-Hermitian skin effect, which we term the ``algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect." This effect emerges across a diverse spectrum of non-Hermitian systems in both two- and higher space dimensions. For 2D systems with algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect, on geometries such as a torus or cylinder, these systems exhibit behavior reminiscent of the conventional non-Hermitian skin effect, where eigenmodes are either bulk Bloch waves (on a torus) or exponentially localized edge modes (on a cylinder). However, if the same system is placed on a disk or any geometrical shape featuring open boundaries in all directions, the skin modes immediately transform into the algebraic form, with amplitude decaying as a power-law function of the distance from the boundary. To explore these novel effects, we formulate a unified generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) framework that is universally applicable to all variations of non-Hermitian skin effects across any spatial dimension, developed through the usage of a generalized transfer-matrix approach. We find that in a $d$-dimensional non-Hermitian system, in general, the GBZ manifold's dimensionality must fall into the range from $d$ to $2d-1$, denoted by ${d \leq \dim\text{GBZ} \leq 2d-1}$. In 1D, this inequality is trivial because the upper and lower bounds converge, forcing the GBZ's dimensionality to match with that of the physical space. However, in 2D and above, this inequality indicates that there is no obligation for the GBZ's dimensionality to concur with the physical space's dimensionality, which gives rise to a new class of non-Hermitian skin effects.</description>

Abstract: The study of fundamental optics effects has been stimulated through the increasing ability to structure light in all its degrees of freedom (DOFs) in sophisticated but simple experimental settings. However, with such an increase in experimental capabilities, it has also become important to study theoretical descriptions for a more intuitive understanding of the underlying concepts. Here, we introduce a visual representation of light that is structured in its transverse space, frequency, and polarization in the form of a higher-order Poincar\'e sphere and discuss interesting links to its fundamental counterpart. We further leverage this connection to discuss and experimentally generate light possessing all possible polarization states across its spatio-spectral shape, which we term spatio-spectral Poincar\'e beams. By invoking all DOFs of light in the powerful description of higher-order Poincar\'e spheres, our work can pave the way for a deeper understanding and beneficial application of structured light as a powerful tool in optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The finite basis set method is commonly used to calculate atomic spectra, including QED contributions such as bound-electron self-energy. Still, it remains problematic and underexplored for vacuum-polarization calculations. We fill this gap by trying this approach in its application to the calculation of the vacuum-polarization charge density and the Wichmann-Kroll correction to the electron binding energy in a hydrogen-like ion. We study the convergence of the method with different types and sizes of basis sets. We cross-check our results for the Wichmann-Kroll correction by direct integration of the Green's function. As a relevant example, we consider several heavy hydrogen-like ions and evaluate the vacuum polarization correction for $S$ and $P$ electron orbitals.</description>

      <title>Unambiguous detection of high energy vortex states via the superkick effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex states of photons, electrons, and other particles are freely propagating wave packets with helicoidal wave fronts winding around the axis of a phase vortex. A particle prepared in a vortex state possesses a non-zero orbital angular momentum projection on the propagation direction, a quantum number that has never been exploited in experimental particle and nuclear physics. Low-energy vortex photons, electrons, neutrons, and helium atoms have been demonstrated in experiment and found numerous applications, and there exist proposals of boosting them to higher energies. However, the verification that a high energy particle is indeed in a vortex state will be a major challenge, since the low energy techniques become impractical for highly energetic particles. Here, we propose a new diagnostic method based of the so-called superkick effect, which can unambiguously detect the presence of a phase vortex. A proof-of-principle experiment with vortex electrons can be done with the existing technology and will, at the same time, constitute the first observation of the superkick effect.</description>

Abstract: We report on saturated absorption spectroscopy measurements of the $(4s^2) ^{1}S_0\rightarrow(4s4p) ^{1}P_1$ transition for the four most abundant even-mass isotopes in calcium. By referencing the laser locked to an ultralow expansion cavity and carefully investigating systematic errors, isotope shifts are determined with a precision below 100 kHz, improving previously reported values by a factor of about five. A King plot analysis employing literature values of the 729-nm transition in Ca ions shows excellent linearity. The field and mass shift parameters are determined from King plots with other transitions.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the influence of a massive photon in the dispersive interaction between two atoms in their fundamental states. We work in the context of Proca Quantum Electrodynamics. The photon mass not only introduces a new length scale but also gives rise to a longitudinal polarization for the electromagnetic field. We obtain explicitly the interaction energy between the atoms for any distance regime and consider several particular cases. We show that, for a given interatomic distance, the greater the photon mass the better it is the non-retarded approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need to determine scattering amplitudes of few-hadron systems for arbitrary kinematics expands a broad set of subfields of modern-day nuclear and hadronic physics. In this work, we expand upon previous explorations on the use of real-time methods, like quantum computing or tensor networks, to determine few-body scattering amplitudes. Such calculations must be performed in a finite Minkowski spacetime, where scattering amplitudes are not well defined. Our previous work presented a conjecture of a systematically improvable estimator for scattering amplitudes constructed from finite-volume correlation functions. Here we provide further evidence that the prescription works for larger kinematic regions than previously explored as well as a broader class of scattering amplitudes. Finally, we devise a new method for estimating the order of magnitude of the error associated with finite time separations needed for such calculations. In units of the lightest mass of the theory, we find that to constrain amplitudes using real-time methods within $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$, the spacetime volumes must satisfy $mL \sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^2)$ and $ mT\sim \mathcal{O}(10^2-10^4)$.</description>

      <title>Monadic ortholattices: completions and duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the variety of monadic ortholattices is closed under MacNeille and canonical completions. In each case, the completion of $L$ is obtained by forming an associated dual space $X$ that is a monadic orthoframe. This is a set with an orthogonality relation and an additional binary relation satisfying certain conditions. For the MacNeille completion, $X$ is formed from the non-zero elements of $L$, and for the canonical completion, $X$ is formed from the proper filters of $L$. The corresponding completion of $L$ is then obtained as the ortholattice of bi-orthogonally closed subsets of $X$ with an additional operation defined through the binary relation of $X$.
  With the introduction of a suitable topology on an orthoframe, as was done by Goldblatt and Bimb\'o, we obtain a dual adjunction between the categories of monadic ortholattices and monadic orthospaces. A restriction of this dual adjunction provides a dual equivalence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the non-Hermitian transition matrix and its gravity dual. States in quantum field theories or gravity theories are typically prepared using Euclidean path integrals. We demonstrate that it is both natural and necessary to introduce non-Hermitian transitions to describe the state when employing different inner products in Euclidean quantum field theories. Transition matrices that are $\eta$-pseudo-Hermitian, with $\eta$ being positive-definite, play the same role as density matrices, where the operator $\eta$ is closely related to the definition of the inner product. Moreover, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between these transition matrices and density matrices. In the context of AdS/CFT correspondence, the Euclidean path integral in the boundary field theory can be translated to the bulk gravitational path integral. We provide an overview of the construction and interpretation of non-Hermitian spacetime. Specifically, we demonstrate the crucial role of the non-Hermitian transition matrix in realizing the thermofield concept in general cases and in understanding the gravity states dual to the eternal black hole. In this context, the pseudoentropy of the transition matrix can also be interpreted as black hole entropy. Finally, we highlight the strong subadditivity property of pseudoentropy, and the connection between non-Hermitian transition matrices and complex metrics.</description>

      <title>Engineering impurity Bell states through coupling with a quantum bath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate the feasibility of creating Bell states in multi-component ultra-cold atomic gases by solely using the ability to control the inter-particle interactions via Feshbach resonances. For this we consider two distinguishable impurities immersed in an atomic background cloud of a few bosons, with the entire system being confined in a one-dimensional harmonic trap. By analyzing the numerically obtained ground states we demonstrate that the two impurities can form spatially entangled bipolaron states due to mediated interactions from the bosonic bath. Our analysis is based on calculating the correlations between the two impurities in a two-mode basis, which is experimentally accessible by measuring the particles positions in the left or right sides of the trap. While interspecies interactions are crucial in order to create the strongly entangled impurity states, it can also inhibit correlations depending on the ordering of the impurities and three-body impurity-bath correlations. We show how these drawbacks can be mitigated by manipulating the properties of the bath, namely its size, mass and intraspecies interactions, allowing to create impurity Bell states over a wide range of impurity-impurity interactions.</description>

Abstract: It is known that the momentum operator canonically conjugated to the position operator for a particle moving in some bounded interval of the line {(with Dirichlet boundary conditions) is not essentially self-adjoint}: it has a continuous set of self-adjoint extensions. We prove that essential self-adjointness can be recovered by symmetrically weighting the momentum operator with a positive bounded function approximating the indicator function of the considered interval. This weighted momentum operator is consistently obtained from a similarly weighted classical momentum through the so-called Weyl-Heisenberg covariant integral quantization of functions or distributions.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transition in fluctuating imaginary gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the exact solvability and point-gap topological phase transitions in non-Hermitian lattice models. These models incorporate site-dependent nonreciprocal hoppings $J e^{\pm g_n}$, facilitated by a spatially fluctuating imaginary gauge field $ig_n \hat~x$ that disrupts translational symmetry. By employing suitable imaginary gauge transformations, it is revealed that a lattice characterized by any given $g_n$ is spectrally equivalent to a lattice devoid of fields, under open boundary conditions. Furthermore, a system with closed boundaries can be simplified to a spectrally equivalent lattice featuring a uniform mean field $i\bar{g}\hat~x$. This framework offers a comprehensive method for analytically predicting spectral topological invariance and associated boundary localization phenomena for bond-disordered nonperiodic lattices. These predictions are made by analyzing gauge-transformed isospectral periodic lattices. Notably, for a lattice with quasiperiodic $g_n= \ln |\lambda \cos 2\pi \alpha n|$ and an irrational $\alpha$, a previously unknown topological phase transition is unveiled. It is observed that the topological spectral index $W$ assumes values of $-N$ or $+N$, leading to all $N$ open-boundary eigenstates localizing either at the right or left edge, solely dependent on the strength of the gauge field, where $\lambda&lt;2$ or $\lambda&gt;2$. A phase transition is identified at the critical point $\lambda\approx2$, at which all eigenstates undergo delocalization. The theory has been shown to be relevant for long-range hopping models and for higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with two-spin-1/2-fermion relativistic quantum mechanics, and it is about the construction of one-particle projectors using an inherently two(many)-particle, `explicitly correlated' basis representation, necessary for good numerical convergence of the interaction energy. It is demonstrated that a faithful representation of the one-particle operators, which appear in intermediate but essential computational steps, can be constructed over a many-particle basis set by accounting for the full Hilbert space beyond the physically relevant anti-symmetric subspace. Applications of this development can be foreseen for the computation of quantum-electrodynamics corrections for a correlated relativistic reference state and high-precision relativistic computations of medium-to-high-$Z$ helium-like systems, for which other two-particle projection techniques are unreliable.</description>

      <title>The renormalized classical spin liquid on the ruby lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent experimental detection of the onset of a dynamically prepared, gapped $Z_2$ quantum spin liquid on the ruby lattice brought the physics of frustrated magnetism and lattice gauge theory to Rydberg tweezer arrays (Semeghini et al, Science 374, 1242 (2021)). The thermodynamic properties of such models remain inadequately addressed, yet knowledge thereof is indispensable if one wants to prepare large, robust, and long-lived quantum spin liquids. Using large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations we find in the PXP model a renormalized classical spin liquid with constant entropy density $S/N$ approaching $\ln(2)/6$ in the thermodynamic limit for all moderate and large values of the detuning $\delta$ and starting from $T/\Omega \sim 0.5$ (in units of the Rabi frequency $\Omega$) down to the lowest temperatures we could simulate, $T/\Omega \sim 0.01$. With Van der Waals interactions, constant entropy plateaus are still found but its value shifts with $\delta$. We comment the adiabatic approximation to the dynamical ramps for the electric degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrable spin chains with a continuous non-Abelian symmetry, such as the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, show superdiffusive transport with little theoretical understanding. Although recent studies reported a surprising connection to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class in that case, this view was most recently questioned by discrepancies in full counting statistics. Here, by combining extensive numerical simulations of the Landau-Lifshitz one-dimensional magnet, with a framework developed by exact studies of the KPZ class, we characterize various two-point quantities that remain hitherto unexplored in spin chains, and find full agreement with KPZ scaling laws. This establishes the partial emergence of the KPZ class in isotropic spin chains. Moreover, we reveal that the KPZ scaling laws are intact in the presence of an energy current, under the appropriate Galilean boost required by the propagation of spacetime correlation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational power and fault-tolerance of future large-scale quantum processors derive in large part from the connectivity between the qubits. One approach to increase connectivity is to engineer qubit-qubit interactions at a distance. Alternatively, the connectivity can be increased by physically displacing the qubits. This has been explored in trapped-ion experiments and using neutral atoms trapped with optical tweezers. For semiconductor spin qubits, several studies have investigated spin coherent shuttling of individual electrons, but high-fidelity transport over extended distances remains to be demonstrated. Here we report shuttling of an electron inside an isotopically purified Si/SiGe heterostructure using electric gate potentials. First, we form static quantum dots, and study how spin coherence decays as we repeatedly move a single electron between up to five dots. Next, we create a traveling wave potential to transport an electron in a moving quantum dot. This second method shows substantially better spin coherence than the first. It allows us to displace an electron over an effective distance of 10 {\mu}m in under 200 ns with an average fidelity of 99%. These results will guide future efforts to realize large-scale semiconductor quantum processors, making use of electron shuttling both within and between qubit arrays.</description>

Abstract: Recent years have seen an increasing body of work examining how quantum entanglement can be measured at high energy particle physics experiments, thereby complementing traditional table-top experiments. This begs the question of whether more concepts from quantum computation can be examined at colliders, and we here consider the property of magic, which distinguishes those quantum states which have a genuine computational advantage over classical states. We examine top anti-top pair production at the LHC, showing that nature chooses to produce magic tops, where the amount of magic varies with the kinematics of the final state. We compare results for individual partonic channels and at proton-level, showing that averaging over final states typically increases magic. This is in contrast to entanglement measures, such as the concurrence, which typically decrease. Our results create new links between the quantum information and particle physics literatures, providing practical insights for further study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding surface forces of two-dimensional (2D) materials is of fundamental importance as they govern molecular dynamics and atomic deposition in nanoscale proximity. Despite recent observations in wetting transparency and remote epitaxy on substrate-supported graphene, very little is known about the many-body effects on their van der Waals (vdW) interactions, such as the role of surrounding vacuum in wettability of suspended 2D monolayers. Here we report on a stark repulsive Lifshitz-van der Waals (vdW) force generated at surfaces of suspended 2D materials, arising from quantum fluctuation coupled with the atomic thickness and birefringence of 2D monolayer. In combination with our theoretical framework taking into account the many-body Lifshitz formulism, we present direct measurement of Lifshitz-vdW repulsion on suspended graphene using atomic force microscopy. We report a repulsive force of up to 1.4 kN/m$^2$ at a separation of 8.8 nm between a gold-coated AFM tip and a sheet of suspended graphene, more than two orders of magnitude greater than the Casimir-Lifshitz repulsion demonstrated in fluids. Our findings suggest that suspended 2D materials are intrinsically repulsive surfaces with substantially lowered wettability. The amplified Lifshitz-vdW repulsion could offer technological opportunities such as molecular actuation and controlled atomic assembly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum anomaly of a global symmetry is known to strongly constrain the allowed low-energy physics in a clean and isolated quantum system. However, the effect of quantum anomalies in disordered systems is much less understood, especially when the global symmetry is only preserved on average by the disorder. In this work, we focus on disordered systems with both average and exact symmetries $A\times K$, where the exact symmetry $K$ is respected in every disorder configuration, and the average $A$ is only preserved on average by the disorder ensemble. When there is a mixed quantum anomaly between the average and exact symmetries, we argue that the mixed state representing the ensemble of disordered ground states cannot be featureless. While disordered mixed states smoothly connected to the anomaly-compatible phases in clean limit are certainly allowed, we also found disordered phases that have no clean-limit counterparts, including the glassy states with strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, and average topological orders for certain anomalies. We construct solvable lattice models to demonstrate each of these possibilities. We also provide a field-theoretic argument to provide a criterion for whether a given average-exact mixed anomaly admits a compatible average topological order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spread complexity measures the minimized spread of quantum states over all choices of basis. It generalizes Krylov operator complexity to quantum states under continuous Hamiltonian evolution. In this paper, we study spread complexity in the context of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos and propose a new flavor ratio based on complexity. Our findings indicate that our proposal might favor an initial ratio of fluxes as $\phi_{\nu_e}^0: \phi_{\nu_\mu}^0: \phi_{\nu_\tau}^0 = 1:0:0$ over a more generally expected ratio of $1:2:0$, when the IceCube neutrino observatory achieves its projected sensitivity to discriminate between flavors. Additionally, complexity-based definitions of flavor ratios exhibit a slight but nonzero sensitivity to the neutrino mass ordering, which traditional flavor ratios cannot capture.</description>

Abstract: The heart of quantum mechanics is quantum superposition between orthogonal bases of a single particle. In the particle nature of quantum mechanics, quantum superposition is represented by probability amplitudes between mutually exclusive natures such as orthogonal polarization bases. The delayed-choice quantum eraser is for the post-determination of the photon nature, raising the cause-effect relation issue. Over the last several decades, quantum erasers have been intensively studied using nearly all kinds of photons. Here, the macroscopic delayed-choice quantum eraser is experimentally demonstrated using a continuous wave laser and discussed for quantum superposition in a macroscopic regime. For this, a noninterfering Mach-Zehnder interferometer composed of two polarizing beam splitters is chosen to manipulate polarization bases of lights and to measure them in a delayed-choice manner via polarization-basis projection.</description>

      <title>A distribution testing oracle separation between QMA and QCMA</title>

Abstract: It is a long-standing open question in quantum complexity theory whether the definition of $\textit{non-deterministic}$ quantum computation requires quantum witnesses $(\textsf{QMA})$ or if classical witnesses suffice $(\textsf{QCMA})$. We make progress on this question by constructing a randomized classical oracle separating the respective computational complexity classes. Previous separations [Aaronson-Kuperberg (CCC'07), Fefferman-Kimmel (MFCS'18)] required a quantum unitary oracle. The separating problem is deciding whether a distribution supported on regular un-directed graphs either consists of multiple connected components (yes instances) or consists of one expanding connected component (no instances) where the graph is given in an adjacency-list format by the oracle. Therefore, the oracle is a distribution over $n$-bit boolean functions.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Variational Quantum Algorithms against stochastic parameter perturbation</title>

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are tailored to perform within the constraints of current quantum devices, yet they are limited by performance-degrading errors. In this study, we consider a noise model that reflects realistic gate errors inherent to variational quantum algorithms. We investigate the decoherence of a variationally prepared quantum state due to this noise model, which causes a deviation from the energy estimation in the variational approach. By performing a perturbative analysis of optimized circuits, we determine the noise threshold at which the criteria set by the stability lemma is met. We assess our findings against the variational quantum eigensolver and quantum approximate optimization algorithm for various problems with up to 14 qubits. Moreover, we show that certain gate errors have a significantly smaller impact on the coherence of the state, allowing us to reduce the execution time without compromising performance.</description>

      <title>Approximate Quantum Compiling for Quantum Simulation: A Tensor Network based approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08609v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce AQCtensor, a novel algorithm to produce short-depth quantum circuits from Matrix Product States (MPS). Our approach is specifically tailored to the preparation of quantum states generated from the time evolution of quantum many-body Hamiltonians. This tailored approach has two clear advantages over previous algorithms that were designed to map a generic MPS to a quantum circuit. First, we optimize all parameters of a parametric circuit at once using Approximate Quantum Compiling (AQC) - this is to be contrasted with other approaches based on locally optimizing a subset of circuit parameters and "sweeping" across the system. We introduce an optimization scheme to avoid the so-called ``orthogonality catastrophe" - i.e. the fact that the fidelity of two arbitrary quantum states decays exponentially with the number of qubits - that would otherwise render a global optimization of the circuit impractical. Second, the depth of our parametric circuit is constant in the number of qubits for a fixed simulation time and fixed error tolerance. This is to be contrasted with the linear circuit Ansatz used in generic algorithms whose depth scales linearly in the number of qubits. For simulation problems on 100 qubits, we show that AQCtensor thus achieves at least an order of magnitude reduction in the depth of the resulting optimized circuit, as compared with the best generic MPS to quantum circuit algorithms. We demonstrate our approach on simulation problems on Heisenberg-like Hamiltonians on up to 100 qubits and find optimized quantum circuits that have significantly reduced depth as compared to standard Trotterized circuits.</description>

      <title>Noisy Qudit vs Multiple Qubits : Conditions on Gate Efficiency for enchancing Fidelity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today, multiple new platforms are implementing qudits, $d$-level quantum bases of information, for Quantum Information Processing (QIP). It is therefore crucial to study their efficiencies for QIP compared to more traditional qubit platforms. We present a comparative study of the infidelity scalings of a qudit and $n$-qubit systems, both with identical Hilbert space dimensions and noisy environments. The first-order response of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) to the noise in the Lindblad formalism, which was found to be gate-independent, was calculated analytically in the two systems being compared. This yielded a critical curve $O(d^2/\log_2(d))$ of the ratio of their respective gate times in units of decoherence time. This quantity indicates how time-efficient operations on these systems are. The curve delineates regions where each system has a higher rate of increase of the AGI than the other. This condition on gate efficiency was applied to different existing platforms. It was found that specific qudit platforms possess gate efficiencies competitive with state-of-the-art qubit platforms. Numerical simulations complemented this work and allowed for discussion of the applicability and limits of the linear response formalism.</description>

Abstract: We present rapid and robust protocols for STIRAP and quantum logic gates. Our gates are based on geometric phases acquired by instantaneous eigenstates of a slowly accelerating inertial Hamiltonian. To begin, we establish the criteria for inertial evolution and subsequently engineer pulse shapes that fulfill these conditions. These tailored pulses are then used to optimize geometric logic gates. We analyze a realization of our protocols with $^{87}$Rb atoms, resulting in gate fidelity that approaches the current state-of-the-art, with marked improvements in robustness.</description>

      <title>Simplicity of mean-field theories in neural quantum states</title>

Abstract: The utilization of artificial neural networks for representing quantum many-body wave functions has garnered significant attention, with enormous recent progress for both ground states and non-equilibrium dynamics. However, quantifying state complexity within this neural quantum states framework remains elusive. In this study, we address this key open question from the complementary point of view: Which states are simple to represent with neural quantum states? Concretely, we show on a general level that ground states of mean-field theories with permutation symmetry only require a limited number of independent neural network parameters. We analytically establish that, in the thermodynamic limit, convergence to the ground state of the fully-connected transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), the mean-field Ising model, can be achieved with just one single parameter. Expanding our analysis, we explore the behavior of the 1-parameter ansatz under breaking of the permutation symmetry. For that purpose, we consider the TFIM with tunable long-range interactions, characterized by an interaction exponent $\alpha$. We show analytically that the 1-parameter ansatz for the neural quantum state still accurately captures the ground state for a whole range of values for $0\le \alpha \le 1$, implying a mean-field description of the model in this regime.</description>

      <title>Phonon Pumping by Modulating the Ultrastrong Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vacuum (i.e., the ground state) of a system in ultrastrong light-matter coupling contains particles that cannot be emitted without any dynamical perturbation and is thus called virtual. We propose a protocol for inducing and observing real mechanical excitations of a mirror enabled by the virtual photons in the ground state of a tripartite system, where a resonant optical cavity is ultrastrongly coupled to a two-level system (qubit) and, at the same time, optomechanically coupled to a mechanical resonator. Real phonons are coherently emitted when the frequency of the two-level system is modulated at a frequency comparable to that of the mechanical resonator and, therefore much lower than the optical frequency. We demonstrate that this hybrid effect is a direct consequence of the virtual photon population in the ground state. Within a classical physics analogy, attaching a weight to a spring only changes its resting position, whereas dynamically modulating the weight makes the system oscillate. In our case, however, the weight is the vacuum itself. We propose and accurately characterize a hybrid superconducting-optomechanical setup based on available state-of-the-art technology, where this effect can be experimentally observed.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonians whose low-energy states require $\Omega(n)$ T gates</title>

Abstract: The recent resolution of the NLTS Conjecture [ABN22] establishes a prerequisite to the Quantum PCP (QPCP) Conjecture through a novel use of newly-constructed QLDPC codes [LZ22]. Even with NLTS now solved, there remain many independent and unresolved prerequisites to the QPCP Conjecture, such as the NLSS Conjecture of [GL22]. In this work we focus on a specific and natural prerequisite to both NLSS and the QPCP Conjecture, namely, the existence of local Hamiltonians whose low-energy states all require $\omega(\log n)$ T gates to prepare. In fact, we prove a stronger result which is not necessarily implied by either conjecture: we construct local Hamiltonians whose low-energy states require $\Omega(n)$ T gates. We further show that our procedure can be applied to the NLTS Hamiltonians of [ABN22] to yield local Hamiltonians whose low-energy states require both $\Omega(\log n)$-depth and $\Omega(n)$ T gates to prepare. In order to accomplish this we define a "pseudo-stabilizer" property of a state with respect to each local Hamiltonian term, and prove an additive local energy lower bound for each term at which the state is pseudo-stabilizer. By proving a relationship between the number of T gates preparing a state and the number of terms at which the state is pseudo-stabilizer, we are able to give a constant energy lower bound which applies to any state with T-count less than $c \cdot n$ for some fixed positive constant $c$. This result represents a significant improvement over [CCNN23] where we used a different technique to give an energy bound which only distinguishes between stabilizer states and states which require a non-zero number of T gates.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement, crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity, is commonly assessed through various measures such as von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and entanglement contour, each with its inherent limitations. In this work, we introduce the \textit{hyperfine structure of entanglement}, which dissects entanglement contours known as the fine structure into particle-number cumulants. This measure exhibits a set of universal properties with its significance in quantum information science. We apply it across diverse contexts: in Fermi gases, establishing connections to mutual information and interacting conformal field theory; in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ holographic duality, unveiling finer subregion-subregion duality and extending bulk reconstruction; and in Chern insulators, distinguishing between different quantum phases. Our findings suggest experimental accessibility, offering fresh insights into quantum entanglement across physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the performance of a quantum Otto heat engine with two spins coupled by a Heisenberg interaction, taking into account not only the mean values of work and efficiency but also their fluctuations. We first show that, for this system, the output work and its fluctuations are directly related to the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility of the system at equilibrium with either heat bath. We analyze the regions where the work extraction can be done with low relative fluctuation for a given range of temperatures, while still achieving an efficiency higher than that of a single spin system heat engine. In particular, we find that, due to the presence of `idle' levels, an increase in the inter-spin coupling can either increase or decrease fluctuations, depending on the other parameters. In all cases, however, we find that the relative fluctuations in work or efficiency remain large, implying that this microscopic engine is not very reliable as a source of work.</description>

Abstract: In [Phys. Rev. A 107, 012427 (2023)], A. J. Baldwin and J. A. Jones proved that Uhlmann-Jozsa's fidelity between two quantum states $\rho$ and $\sigma$, i.e., $F(\rho,\sigma)~:=~(Tr\sqrt{\sqrt{\rho}\sigma\sqrt{\rho}})^2$, can be written in a simplified form as $F(\rho,\sigma) = (Tr\sqrt{\rho\sigma})^2$. In this article, we give an alternative proof of this result, using a function power series expansion and the properties of the trace function. Our approach not only reinforces the validity of the simplified expression but also facilitates the exploration of novel dissimilarity functions for quantum states and more complex trace functions of a density operator.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement membrane theory is an effective coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics and operator growth in chaotic quantum many-body systems. The fundamental quantity characterizing the membrane is the entanglement line tension. However, determining the entanglement line tension for microscopic models is in general exponentially difficult. We compute the entanglement line tension in a recently introduced class of exactly solvable yet chaotic unitary circuits, so-called generalized dual-unitary circuits, obtaining a non-trivial form that gives rise to a hierarchy of velocity scales with $v_E&lt;v_B$. For the lowest level of the hierarchy, $\bar{\mathcal{L}}_{2}$ circuits, the entanglement line tension can be computed entirely, while for the higher levels the solvability is reduced to certain regions in spacetime. This partial solvability enables us to place bounds on the entanglement velocity. We find that $\bar{\mathcal{L}}_{2}$ circuits saturate certain bounds on entanglement growth that are also saturated in holographic models. Furthermore, we relate the entanglement line tension to temporal entanglement and correlation functions. We also develop new methods of constructing generalized dual-unitary gates, including constructions based on complex Hadamard matrices that exhibit additional solvability properties and constructions that display behavior unique to local dimension greater than or equal to three. Our results shed light on entanglement membrane theory in microscopic Floquet lattice models and enable us to perform non-trivial checks on the validity of its predictions by comparison to exact and numerical calculations. Moreover, they demonstrate that generalized dual-unitary circuits display a more generic form of information dynamics than dual-unitary circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations of Hadron Dynamics in the Schwinger Model using 112 Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hadron wavepackets are prepared and time evolved in the Schwinger model using 112 qubits of IBM's 133-qubit Heron quantum computer ibm_torino. The initialization of the hadron wavepacket is performed in two steps. First, the vacuum is prepared across the whole lattice using the recently developed SC-ADAPT-VQE algorithm and workflow. SC-ADAPT-VQE is then extended to the preparation of localized states, and used to establish a hadron wavepacket on top of the vacuum. This is done by adaptively constructing low-depth circuits that maximize the overlap with an adiabatically prepared hadron wavepacket. Due to the localized nature of the wavepacket, these circuits can be determined on a sequence of small lattices using classical computers, and then robustly scaled to prepare wavepackets on large lattices for simulations using quantum computers. Time evolution is implemented with a second-order Trotterization. To reduce both the required qubit connectivity and circuit depth, an approximate quasi-local interaction is introduced. This approximation is made possible by the emergence of confinement at long distances, and converges exponentially with increasing distance of the interactions. Using multiple error-mitigation strategies, up to 14 Trotter steps of time evolution are performed, employing 13,858 two-qubit gates (with a CNOT depth of 370). The propagation of hadrons is clearly identified, with results that compare favorably with Matrix Product State simulations. Prospects for a near-term quantum advantage in simulations of hadron scattering are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Neuromorphic processors improve the efficiency of machine learning algorithms through the implementation of physical artificial neurons to perform computations. However, whilst efficient classical neuromorphic processors have been demonstrated in various forms, practical quantum neuromorphic platforms are still in the early stages of development. Here we propose a fixed optical network for photonic quantum reservoir computing that is enabled by photon number-resolved detection of the output states. This significantly reduces the required complexity of the input quantum states while still accessing a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The approach is implementable with currently available technology and lowers the barrier to entry to quantum machine learning.</description>

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are highly remarkable phenomena manifesting in quantum many-body systems. However, their precise identifications in equilibrium systems pose significant theoretical and experimental challenges. Thus far, dynamical detection protocols employing global quantum quenches have been proposed, wherein transitions are discerned from global nonequilibrium excitations. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum phase transitions can be detected through localized out-of-equilibrium excitations induced by local quantum quenches. While the resulting dynamics after the quench are influenced by both the local quench operation and the intrinsic dynamics of the quantum system, the effects of the former are exclusively extracted through the cutting-edge framework called quantum reservoir probing (QRP). Through the QRP, we find that the impacts of the local quenches vary across different quantum phases and are significantly suppressed by quantum fluctuations amplified near quantum critical points, thereby precisely delineating phase boundaries. We demonstrate that the QRP can detect quantum phase transitions in the paradigmatic integrable and nonintegrable quantum systems, and even topological quantum phase transitions, all within the identical framework employing single-site observables.</description>

      <title>Avoiding decoherence with giant atoms in a two-dimensional structured environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Giant atoms are quantum emitters that can couple to light at multiple discrete points. Such atoms have been shown to interact without decohering via a one-dimensional waveguide. Here, we study how giant atoms behave when coupled to a two-dimensional square lattice of coupled cavities, an environment characterized by a finite energy band and band gaps. In particular, we describe the role that bound states in the continuum (BICs) play in how giant atoms avoid decoherence. By developing numerical methods, we are able to investigate the dynamics of the system and show the appearance of interfering BICs within a single giant atom, as well as oscillating BICs between many giant atoms. In this way, we find the geometric arrangements of atomic coupling points that yield protection from decoherence in the two-dimensional lattice. These results on engineering the interaction between light and matter may find applications in quantum simulation and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Wiretap Channel Coding Assisted by Noisy Correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the private classical capacity of a quantum wiretap channel, where the users (sender Alice, receiver Bob, and eavesdropper Eve) have access to the resource of a shared quantum state, additionally to their channel inputs and outputs. An extreme case is maximal entanglement or a secret key between Alice and Bob, both of which would allow for onetime padding the message. But here both the wiretap channel and the shared state are general. In the other extreme case that the state is trivial, we recover the wiretap channel and its private capacity [N. Cai, A. Winter and R. W. Yeung, Probl. Inform. Transm. 40(4):318-336, 2004]. We show how to use the given resource state to build a code for secret classical communication. Our main result is a lower bound on the assisted private capacity, which asymptotically meets the multi-letter converse and which encompasses all sorts of previous results as special cases.</description>

Abstract: Macrorealism formalizes the intuitive notion that at any given time the system occupies a definite state and that the evolution of the system is independent of the measurements performed on it, in contrast to the principles of quantum mechanics. In this study, we carry out a comparative analysis between three-time Leggett--Garg-type inequalities and the conditions of no-signaling-in-time and arrow-of-time for macrorealism within the context of meson oscillations. Our findings indicate that, under given initial conditions, no violations of Leggett--Garg inequalities are observed. However, no-signaling-in-time conditions are found to be violated, thereby revealing the impossibility of applying a macrorealistic description to the analysis of meson physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01760v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adiabatic quantum computation is a paradigmatic model aiming to solve a computational problem by finding the many-body ground state encapsulating the solution. However, its use of an adiabatic evolution depending on the spectral gap of an intricate many-body Hamiltonian makes its analysis daunting. While it is plausible to directly cool the final gapped system of the adiabatic evolution instead, the analysis of such a scheme on a general ground is missing. Here, we propose a specific Hamiltonian model for this purpose. The scheme is inspired by cavity cooling, involving the emulation of a zero-temperature reservoir. Repeated discarding of ancilla reservoir qubits extracts the entropy of the system, driving the system toward its ground state. At the same time, the measurement of the discarded qubits hints at the energy level structure of the system as a return. We show that quantum computation based on this cooling procedure is equivalent in its computational power to the one based on quantum circuits. We then exemplify the scheme with a few illustrative use cases for combinatorial optimization problems. In the first example, the cooling is free from any local energy minima, reducing the scheme to Grover's search algorithm with a few improvements. In the second example, the cooling suffers from abundant local energy minima. To circumvent this, we implant a mechanism in the Hamiltonian so that the population trapped in the local minima can tunnel out by high-order transitions. We support this idea with a numerical simulation for a particular combinatorial optimization problem. We also discuss its application to preparing quantum many-body ground states, arguing that the spectral gap is a crucial factor in determining the time scale of the cooling.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantum discord of an arbitrary two-qudit state: the exact value and general upper bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric quantum discord of a two-qudit state has been studied in many papers, however, its exact analytical value in the explicit form is known only for a general two-qubit state, a general qubit-qudit state and some special families of two-qudit states. Based on the general Bloch vectors formalism [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 54 195301 (2021)], we find the explicit exact analytical value of the geometric quantum discord for a general two-qudit state of an arbitrary dimension via the parameters of its correlation matrix and the Bloch vectors of its reduced states. This new general analytical result indicates that the lower bound on the geometric quantum discord found in [Phys. Rev. A. 85, 204102 (2012)] is attained on each two-qudit state and also, includes all the known exact results on the geometric discord only as particular cases. Moreover, it allows us to find for an arbitrary two-qudit state, pure or mixed, the new general upper bounds on its geometric quantum discord, expressed via the Hilbert space characteristics of this state and in case of a pure two-qudit state -- in terms of its concurrence.</description>

      <title>Dipole-dipole interacting two-level emitters in a moderately intense laser field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the resonance fluorescence features of a small ensemble of closely packed and moderately laser pumped two-level emitters at resonance. The mean distance between any two-level radiators is smaller than the corresponding emission wavelength, such that the dipole-dipole interactions are not negligible. We have found that under the secular approximation, the collective resonance fluorescence spectrum consists of 2N+1 spectral lines, where N is the number of emitters from the sample. The 2N spectral sidebands, symmetrically located around the generalized Rabi frequency with respect to the central line at the laser frequency, are distinguishable if the dipole-dipole coupling strength is larger than the collective spontaneous decay rate. This way, one can estimate the radiators number within the ensemble via measuring of the spontaneously scattered collective resonance fluorescence spectrum. Contrary, if the dipole-dipole coupling is of the order of or smaller than the cooperative spontaneous decay rate, but still non-negligible, the spectrum turns into a Mollow-like fluorescence spectrum, where the two sidebands spectral lines broadens, proportional to the dipole-dipole coupling strength, respectively.</description>

      <title>Quantifying spectral signatures of non-Markovianity beyond the Born-Redfield master equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Memory or time-non-local effects in open quantum dynamics pose theoretical as well as practical challenges in the understanding and control of noisy quantum systems. While there has been a comprehensive and concerted effort towards developing diagnostics for non-Markovian dynamics, all existing measures rely on time-domain measurements which are typically slow and expensive as they require averaging several runs to resolve small transient features on a broad background, and scale unfavorably with system size and complexity. In this work, we propose a spectroscopic measure of non-Markovianity which can detect persistent non-Markovianity in the system steady state. In addition to being experimentally viable, the proposed measure has a direct information theoretic interpretation: a large value indicates the information loss per unit bandwidth of making the Markov approximation. In the same vein, we derive a frequency-domain quantum master equation (FD-QME) that goes beyond the standard Born-Redfield description and retains the full memory of the state of the reduced system. Using the FD-QME and the proposed measure, we are able to reliably diagnose and quantify non-Markovianity in several system-environment settings including those with environmental correlations and retardation effects.</description>

      <title>Simulation of a feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization for a realistic neutral atom system with an optimized small-angle controlled-phase gate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to the classical optimization process required by the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, FALQON, a feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization [A. B. Magann {\it et al.,} {\color{blue}Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf129}, 250502 (2022)}], enables one to obtain approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems without any classical optimization effort. In this study, we leverage the specifications of a recent experimental platform for the neutral atom system [Z. Fu {\it et al.,} {\color{blue}Phys. Rev. A {\bf105}, 042430 (2022)}] and present a scheme to implement an optimally tuned small-angle controlled-phase gate. By examining the 2- to 4-qubit FALQON algorithms in the Max-Cut problem and considering the spontaneous emission of the neutral atomic system, we have observed that the performance of FALQON implemented with small-angle controlled-phase gates exceeds that of FALQON utilizing CZ gates. This approach has the potential to significantly simplify the logic circuit required to simulate FALQON and effectively address the Max-Cut problem, which may pave a way for the experimental implementation of near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithms with neutral-atom systems.</description>

Abstract: We employ quantum-volume random-circuit sampling to benchmark the two-QPU entanglement-assisted distributed quantum computing (DQC) and compare it with single-QPU quantum computing. We first specify a single-qubit depolarizing noise model in the random circuit. Based on this error model, we show the one-to-one correspondence of three figures of merits, namely average gate fidelity, heavy output probability, and linear cross-entropy. We derive an analytical approximation of the average gate fidelity under the specified noise model, which is shown to align with numerical simulations. The approximation is calculated based on a noise propagation matrix obtained from the extended connectivity graph of a DQC device. In numerical simulation, we unveil the scalability enhancement in DQC for the QPUs with limited connectivity. Furthermore, we provide a simple formula to estimate the average gate fidelity, which also provides us with a heuristic method to evaluate the scalability enhancement in DQC, and a guide to optimize the structure of a DQC configuration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in the field of quantum machine learning have promoted the idea of incorporating physical symmetries in the structure of quantum circuits. A crucial milestone in this area is the realization of $S_{n}$-permutation equivariant quantum neural networks (QNN) that are equivariant under permutations of input objects. In this work, we focus on encoding the rotational symmetry of point cloud datasets into the QNN. The key insight of the approach is that all rotationally invariant functions with vector inputs are equivalent to a function with inputs of vector inner products. We provide a novel structure of QNN that is exactly invariant to both rotations and permutations, with its efficacy demonstrated numerically in the problems of two-dimensional image classifications and identifying high-energy particle decays, produced by proton-proton collisions, with the $SO(1,3)$ Lorentz symmetry.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Framework for Partial Differential Equation Constrained Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel variational quantum framework for linear partial differential equation (PDE) constrained optimization problems. Such problems arise in many scientific and engineering domains. For instance, in aerodynamics, the PDE constraints are the conservation laws such as momentum, mass and energy balance, the design variables are vehicle shape parameters and material properties, and the objective could be to minimize the effect of transient heat loads on the vehicle or to maximize the lift-to-drag ratio. The proposed framework utilizes the variational quantum linear system (VQLS) algorithm and a black box optimizer as its two main building blocks. VQLS is used to solve the linear system, arising from the discretization of the PDE constraints for given design parameters, and evaluate the design cost/objective function. The black box optimizer is used to select next set of parameter values based on this evaluated cost, leading to nested bi-level optimization structure within a hybrid classical-quantum setting. We present detailed computational error and complexity analysis to highlight the potential advantages of our proposed framework over classical techniques. We implement our framework using the PennyLane library, apply it to a heat transfer optimization problem, and present simulation results using Bayesian optimization as the black box optimizer.</description>

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation using two-dimensional topological quantum error correcting codes can benefit from multi-qubit long-range operations. By using simple commutation rules, a quantum circuit can be transpiled into a sequence of solely non-Clifford multi-qubit gates. Prior work on fault-tolerant compilation avoids optimal scheduling of such gates since they reduce the parallelizability of the circuit. We observe that the reduced parallelization potential is outweighed by the significant reduction in the number of gates. We therefore devise a method for scheduling multi-qubit lattice surgery using an earliest-available-first policy, solving the associated forest packing problem using a representation of the multi-qubit gates as Steiner trees. Our extensive testing on random and application-inspired circuits demonstrates the method's scalability and performance. We show that the transpilation significantly reduces the circuit length on the set of circuits tested, and that the resulting circuit of multi-qubit gates has a further reduction in the expected circuit execution time compared to serial execution.</description>

Abstract: Whereas many different models exist in the mathematical and physics literature for ground states of non-relativistic crystals, the relativistic case has been much less studied and we are not aware of any mathematical result on a fully relativistic treatment of crystals. In this paper, we introduce a mean-field relativistic energy for crystals in terms of periodic density matrices. This model is inspired both from a recent definition of the Dirac-Fock ground state for atoms and molecules, due to one of us, and from the non-relativistic Hartree-Fock model for crystals. We prove the existence of a ground state when the number of electrons per cell is not too large.</description>

      <title>Cubic* criticality emerging from a quantum loop model on triangular lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal examples of correlated systems with local constraints. Obtaining generic solutions for these models is difficult due to the lack of controlled methods to solve them in the thermodynamic limit. Nevertheless, these solutions are of immediate relevance to both statistical and quantum field theories, as well as the rapidly growing experiments in Rydberg atom arrays and quantum moir\'e materials, where the interplay between correlation and local constraints gives rise to a plethora of novel phenomena. In a recent work [X. Ran, Z. Yan, Y.-C. Wang, et al, arXiv:2205.04472 (2022)], it was found through sweeping cluster quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations and field theory analysis that the triangular lattice quantum loop model (QLM) hosts a rich ground state phase diagram with lattice nematic, vison plaquette (VP) crystals, and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid (QSL) close to the Rokhsar-Kivelson point. Here, we focus on the continuous quantum critical point separating the VP and QSL phases and demonstrate via both static and dynamic probes in QMC simulations that this transition is of the (2+1)D cubic* universality. In this transition, the fractionalized visons in QSL condense to give rise to the crystalline VP phase, while leaving their trace in the anomalously large anomalous dimension exponent and pronounced continua in the dimer and vison spectra compared with those at the conventional cubic or O(3) quantum critical points.</description>

Abstract: The machinery of industrial environments was connected to the Internet years ago with the scope of increasing their performance. However, this change made such environments vulnerable against cyber-attacks that can compromise their correct functioning resulting in economic or social problems. Moreover, implementing cryptosystems in the communications between operational technology (OT) devices is a more challenging task than for information technology (IT) environments since the OT networks are generally composed of legacy elements, characterized by low-computational capabilities. Consequently, implementing cryptosystems in industrial communication networks faces a trade-off between the security of the communications and the amortization of the industrial infrastructure. Critical Infrastructure (CI) refers to the industries which provide key resources for the daily social and economical development, e.g. electricity. Furthermore, a new threat to cybersecurity has arisen with the theoretical proposal of quantum computers, due to their potential ability of breaking state-of-the-art cryptography protocols, such as RSA or ECC. Many global agents have become aware that transitioning their secure communications to a quantum secure paradigm is a priority that should be established before the arrival of fault-tolerance. In this paper, we aim to describe the problematic of implementing post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to CI environments. For doing so, we describe the requirements for these scenarios and how they differ against IT. We also introduce classical cryptography and how quantum computers pose a threat to such security protocols. Furthermore, we introduce state-of-the-art proposals of PQC protocols and present their characteristics.

      <title>Closed-channel parameters of Feshbach resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates how the closed channel of a Feshbach resonance is characterised by experimental observables. Surprisingly, it is found that the two-body observables associated with the Feshbach resonance can be insensitive to the properties of the closed channel. In particular, it is impossible in this situation to determine the energy of the bound state causing the resonance from the usual experimental data. This is the case for all magnetic Feshbach resonances in ultracold atoms, due to their deep two-body interaction potentials. This insensitivity highlights a major difference with Feshbach resonances that involve shallow interaction potentials, such as hadron resonances. It appears however that short-range two-body correlations and three-body observables are affected by a parameter of the closed channel called the "closed-channel scattering length". A photoassociation experiment is proposed to measure this parameter in ultracold atom systems.</description>

      <title>Pseudoentropy sum rule by analytical continuation of the superposition parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a sum rule that connects the pseudoentropy and entanglement entropy of a superposition state. Through analytical continuation of the superposition parameter, we demonstrate that the transition matrix and density matrix of the superposition state can be treated in a unified manner. Within this framework, we naturally derive sum rules for the (reduced) transition matrix, pseudo R\'enyi entropy, and pseudoentropy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the close relationship between the sum rule for pseudoentropy and the singularity structure of the entropy function for the superposition state after analytical continuation. We also explore potential applications of the sum rule, including its relevance to understanding the gravity dual of non-Hermitian transition matrices and establishing upper bounds for the absolute value of pseudoentropy.</description>

      <title>A dynamical implementation of canonical second quantization on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop theoretical methods for the implementation of creation and destruction operators in separate registers of a quantum computer, allowing for a transparent and dynamical creation and destruction of particle modes in second quantization in problems with variable particle number. We establish theorems for the commutation (anticommutation) relations on a finite memory bank and provide the needed symmetrizing and antisymmetrizing operators. Finally, we provide formulae in terms of these operators for unitary evolution under conventional two- and four-body Hamiltonian terms, as well as terms varying the particle number. In this formalism, the number of qubits needed to codify $n$ particles with $N_p$ modes each is of order $n\log_2 N_p$. Such scaling is more efficient than the Jordan-Wigner transformation which requires $O(N_p)$ qubits, whenever there are a modest number of particles with a large number of states available to each (and less advantageous for a large number of particles with few states available to each). And although less efficient, it is also less cumbersome than compact encoding.</description>

      <title>Computing $\varphi(N)$ for an RSA module with a single quantum query</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give a polynomial time algorithm to compute $\varphi(N)$ for an RSA module $N$ using as input the order modulo $N$ of a randomly chosen integer. The algorithm consists only on a computation of a greatest common divisor, two multiplications and a division. The algorithm works with a probability of at least $1-\frac{C\log\log N}{N^{1/2}}$.</description>

      <title>Enabling Large-Scale and High-Precision Fluid Simulations on Near-Term Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computational fluid dynamics (QCFD) offers a promising alternative to classical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) by leveraging quantum algorithms for higher efficiency. This paper introduces a comprehensive QCFD method implemented on a superconducting quantum computer, demonstrating successful simulations of steady Poiseuille flow and unsteady acoustic wave propagation. The Poiseuille flow simulation achieved a relative error of less than $0.2\%$, and the unsteady acoustic wave simulation solved a 5043-dimension matrix, marking the largest fluid simulation on a quantum computer to date. Our approach bridges quantum and classical computing, adapting to quantum hardware constraints and offering scalable solutions for large-scale CFD problems, which paves the way for practical applications of near-term quantum computers in computational science.</description>
