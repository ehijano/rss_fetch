      <title>Role of the symmetry energy slope in neutron stars: exploring the model-dependency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using six different parametrizations of the quantum hadrodynamics (one of which is original), I study how different values of the symmetry energy slope ($L)$ affect some microscopic and macroscopic properties of neutron stars, such as the proton fraction, the maximum mass, the radius of the canonical 1.4$M_\odot$ star and its dimensionless tidal parameter $\Lambda$. I show that while most quantities present the same qualitative results, the tidal parameter can increase or decrease with the slope, depending on the model. Moreover, special attention is given to the minimum mass that enables the direct URCA process to occur in neutron stars' interiors ($M_{DU})$. Assuming the weak constraint $M_{DU}~&gt;~1.35M_\odot$, we see that the maximum value of $L$ that satisfies it lies between 79 and 86 MeV. A range of only 7 MeV. Therefore, $M_{DU}$ is an easy way to impose upper bounds to the slope.</description>

      <title>Odd-even mass differences of well and rigidly deformed nuclei in the rare earth region: A test of a newly proposed fit of pairing matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a test of a recently proposed approach to determine average pairing matrix elements within a given interval of single-particle states (sp) around the Fermi level $\lambda$ as obtained in the so-called uniform gap method (UGM). It takes stock of the crucial role played by the averaged sp level density $\tilde{\rho}(e)$. These matrix elements are deduced within the UGM approach, from microscopically calculated $\tilde{\rho}(e)$ and gaps obtained from analytical formulae of a semi-classical nature. Two effects generally ignored in similar fits have been taken care of. They are: (a) the correction for a systematic bias in choosing to fit pairing gaps corresponding to equilibrium deformation solutions as discussed by M\"{o}ller and Nix [Nucl. Phys. A 476, 1 (1992)] and (b) the correction for a systematic spurious enhancement of $\tilde{\rho}(e)$ for protons in the vicinity of $\lambda$, because of the local Slater approximation used for the treatment of the Coulomb exchange terms in most calculations (see e.g. [Phys. Rev C 84, 014310 (2011)]). This approach has been deemed to be very efficient upon performing Hartree-Fock + BCS (with seniority force and self-consistent blocking when dealing with odd nuclei) calculations of a large sample of well and rigidly deformed even-even rare-earth nuclei. The reproduction of their experimental moments of inertia has been found to be at least of the same quality as what has been obtained in a direct fit of these data [Phys. Rev C 99, 064306 (2019)]. We extend here the test of our approach to the reproduction, in the same region, of three-point odd-even mass differences centered on odd-$N$ or odd-$Z$ nuclei. The agreement with the data is again roughly of the same quality as what has been obtained in a direct fit, as performed in [Phys. Rev C 99, 064306 (2019)].</description>

      <title>Density-dependent relativistic mean-field model for $ \Xi^{-} $ hypernuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In hypernuclear systems, interactions involving nucleons and hyperons are intricately influenced by the surrounding particles, particularly by the density and isospin feature of the nuclear medium. In this work, the relativistic mean-field (RMF) theory is adopted to describe the structure of several typical $ \Xi^{-} $ hypernuclei. New sets of $\Xi N$ effective interactions, by taking a density-dependent meson-nucleon/hyperon coupling perspective, are developed by fitting experimental data on the $\Xi^{-}$ hyperon $1s$ and $1p$ state separation energy of $^{15}_{\Xi^{-}}$C. It is found that the density-dependent behavior of meson-hyperon coupling strengths sensitively affects the description of hyperon single-particle levels, which play a crucial role in the consistent description of the theoretical and experimental separation energies of $\Xi^{-}$ $1s$ and $1p$ states in $^{15}_{\Xi^{-}}$C. In fact, the density-dependent meson-baryon coupling strengths introduce additional rearrangement contributions in the hyperon self-energy. Correspondingly, detailed forms of density dependence in these coupling strengths and different consideration of meson-baryon coupling channels will impact the hyperon single-particle properties within hypernuclei. Especially with the additional inclusion of isovector scalar $\delta$ meson, the significant enhancement of rearrangement terms in the effective interaction DD-ME$ \delta $ impacts the shape of the hyperon potential and alters the characteristics of the isovector channel dynamics balance in the effective nuclear force. Such effects may be crucial for describing hyperon separation energies in specific $\Xi^{-}$ hypernuclei such as $^{12}_{\Xi^{-}}$Be and in hypernuclei with higher mass numbers. Relevant research underscores the importance of precisely accounting for medium effects in hyperon-nucleon interactions.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of the nonlinear boson diffusion equation for gluon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact analytical solution of the nonlinear boson diffusion equation (NBDE) is presented. It accounts for the time evolution towards the Bose-Einstein equilibrium distribution through inelastic and elastic collisions in case of constant transport coefficients. As a currently interesting application, gluon scattering in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is investigated. An estimate of time-dependent gluon-condensate formation in overoccupied systems through number-conserving elastic scatterings in Pb-Pb collisions at relativistic energies is given.</description>

      <title>$B_c^{\pm}$-$^{12}$C states and detailed study of momentum space method for $\Upsilon$- and $\eta_b$-nucleus bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed study of the $\Upsilon$-, $\eta_b$- and $B_c$-nucleus systems in momentum space to calculate the bound-state energies and the corresponding coordinate space radial wave functions. A comparison is made among different methods to obtain the partial wave decomposition of meson-nucleus potentials in momentum space, namely, (i) the spherical Bessel transform of the numerically obtained original potential in coordinate space, (ii) the partial wave decomposition of the Fourier transform of the Woods-Saxon approximated form for the original potential, and (iii) the spherical Bessel transform of the Woods-Saxon approximation of the numerically obtained original potential. The strong nuclear bound-state energies for the $\Upsilon$-$^{4}$He, $\Upsilon$-$^{12}$C, $\eta_b$-$^{4}$He, $\eta_b$-$^{12}$C, $B_c$-$^{4}$He (no Coulomb), and $B_c$-$^{12}$C (no Coulomb) systems and the corresponding wave functions in coordinate space are compared for the three methods. Furthermore, as an initial and realistic study, the $B_c^{\pm}$-$^{12}$C bound states are studied for the first time, with the effects of self-consistently calculated Coulomb potentials in $^{12}$C (when the $B_c^{\pm}$ mesons are absent).</description>

      <title>Time-dependent density functional theory study of induced-fission dynamics of $^{226}$Th</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A microscopic finite-temperature model based on time-dependent nuclear density functional theory (TDDFT), is employed to study the induced-fission process of $^{226}$Th. The saddle-to-scission dynamics of this process is explored, starting from various points on the deformation surface of Helmholtz free energy at a temperature that corresponds to the experimental excitation energy, and following self-consistent isentropic fission trajectories as they evolve toward scission. Dissipation effects and the formation of excited fragments are investigated and, in particular, the difference in the evolution of the local temperature along asymmetric and symmetric fission trajectories. The relative entropies and entanglement between fission fragments emerging at scission are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Investigating the excitation function of HBT radii for L\'evy-stable sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main goals of today's heavy-ion physics research is to explore the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter and search for signs of the possible critical endpoint on the QCD phase diagram. Femtoscopy is among the important tools used for this endeavor; there have been indications that combinations of femtoscopic radii parameters (referred to as HBT radii for identical boson pairs) can be related to the system's emission duration. An apparent non-monotonic behavior in their excitation function thus might signal the location of the critical point. In this paper, we show that conclusions drawn from the results obtained with a Gaussian approximation for the pion source shape might be altered if one utilizes a more general L\'evy-stable source description. We find that the characteristic size of the pion source function is strongly connected to the shape of the source and its possible power-law behavior. Taking this into account properly changes the observed behavior of the excitation function.</description>

      <title>Low Energy Nuclear Reactions Through Weak Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the possibility that low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR) arise due to the conversion of proton to neutron through weak interactions. The resulting neutron forms a short-lived virtual state, which then gets captured by another nucleus through photon emission. This whole process happens under the framework of second-order perturbation theory. We find that the rate of this process is negligibly small in most cases. However, in the presence of a resonance, the rate can be substantial and observable.</description>

      <title>Four-dimensional QCD equation of state with multiple chemical potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional version of the equation of state (EoS) model NEOS, NEOS-4D, as a function of the temperature and chemical potentials of baryon, electric charge, and strangeness for the hot and dense QCD matter created in relativistic nuclear collisions. This EoS enables multiple conserved charge current evolution in a relativistic fluid. Input from Lattice QCD simulations and a hadron resonance gas model is considered for constructing the equation of state. We investigate its applicability to the relativistic hydrodynamic description of nuclear collisions and present a method for efficient numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>QCD-Gravity double-copy in the Regge regime: shock wave propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work, we demonstrated a double-copy relation between inclusive gluon radiation in shock wave collisions of ultrarelativistic nuclei and inclusive graviton radiation in trans-Planckian gravitational shock wave collisions. We compute here the corresponding gravitational shock wave propagators in general relativity and demonstrate that they too obey a double copy relation to gluon shock wave propagators computed previously. These results provide key input in a renormalization group approach towards computing the high frequency radiation spectrum in close black hole encounters.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium fragmentation in a variable-flavor number scheme: Towards NRFF1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report progress on the determination and study of quarkonium production within the fragmentation approximation. Our analyses address the moderate and large transverse-momentum regime, where the collinear fragmentation of a single parton is expected to dominate over the short-distance production, directly from the hard scattering, of the constituent $(Q \bar{Q})$ system. Parton fragmentation channels to pseudoscalar and vector quarkonia are built on the basis of non-Relativistic QCD next-to-leading computations, which we use to model initial-scale fragmentation inputs. Thus, a preliminary family of Variable-Flavor Number-Scheme (VFNS) fragmentation functions, named NRFF1.0, are constructed through standard DGLAP evolution. Statistical uncertainties are obtained from a Monte Carlo, replica-like approach embodying missing higher-order uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Isospin QCD as a laboratory for dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QCD with the isospin chemical potential, $\mu_I$, is a useful laboratory to delineate the microphysics in dense QCD. To study the quark-hadron-continuity we use a quark-meson model that interpolates hadronic and quark matter physics at microscopic level. The equation of state is dominated by mesons at low density but taken over by quarks at high density. We extend our previous studies with two-flavors to the three-flavors case to study the impact of the strangeness which may be brought by kaons $(K_+, K_0) = (u\bar{s}, s\bar{d})$ and the U$_A$(1) anomaly. In the normal phase the excitation energies of kaons are reduced by $\mu_I$ in the same way as hyperons in nuclear matter at finite baryon chemical potential. Once pions condense, kaon excitation energies increases as $\mu_I$ does. Moreover, strange quarks become more massive through the U$_A$(1) coupling to the condensed pions. Hence at zero and low temperature the strange hadrons and quarks are highly suppressed. The previous findings in two-flavor models, sound speed peak, negative trace anomaly, gaps insensitve to $\mu_I$, persist in our three-flavor model and remain consistent with the lattice results to $\mu_I \sim 1$ GeV. We discuss the non-perturbative power corrections and quark saturation effects as important ingredients to understand the crossover equations of state measured on the lattice.</description>

Abstract: Using exact solutions of the three-body problem, the spectrum of non efimovian three-body resonances for two identical particles interacting with another one is derived in the regime of large but finite scattering length. The universality of the problem is depicted by using a contact model in the generalized effective range approximation, parameterized by two three-body parameters and the scattering length.</description>

      <title>Helicity Evolution at Small $x$: Quark to Gluon and Gluon to Quark Transition Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We include the quark to gluon and gluon to quark shock-wave transition operators into the small Bjorken-$x$ evolution equations for helicity in the flavor-singlet channel derived earlier. While such transitions do not affect the large-$N_c$ version of the evolution equations for helicity, the large-$N_c \&amp; N_f$ equations are affected. ($N_c$ and $N_f$ are the numbers of quark colors and flavors, respectively.) We derive the corresponding corrected large-$N_c \&amp; N_f$ equations for the polarized dipole amplitudes contributing to the flavor-singlet quark and gluon helicity distributions in the double-logarithmic approximation (DLA), resumming powers of $\alpha_s \, \ln^2 (1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the strong coupling constant. We solve these equations iteratively and extract the polarized splitting functions up to four loops. We show that our splitting functions agree with the fixed-order perturbative calculations up to and including the existing three-loops results. Similar to the large-$N_c$ helicity evolution in the shock-wave approach, our large-$N_c \&amp; N_f$ small-$x$ splitting functions agree with those obtained in the infrared evolution equations framework up to three loops, but appear to slightly disagree at four loops.</description>

      <title>Emulating \emph{ab initio} computations of infinite nucleonic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct efficient emulators for the \emph{ab initio} computation of the infinite nuclear matter equation of state. These emulators are based on the subspace-projected coupled-cluster method for which we here develop a new algorithm called small-batch voting to eliminate spurious states that might appear when emulating quantum many-body methods based on a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The efficiency and accuracy of these emulators facilitate a rigorous statistical analysis within which we explore nuclear matter predictions for $&gt; 10^6$ different parametrizations of a chiral interaction model with explicit $\Delta$-isobars at next-to-next-to leading order. Constrained by nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts and bound-state observables of light nuclei up to \nuc{4}{He}, we use history matching to identify non-implausible domains for the low-energy coupling constants of the chiral interaction. Within these domains we perform a Bayesian analysis using sampling/importance resampling with different likelihood calibrations and study correlations between interaction parameters, calibration observables in light nuclei, and nuclear matter saturation properties.</description>

Abstract: Eigenvector continuation is a computational method for parametric eigenvalue problems that uses subspace projection with a basis derived from eigenvector snapshots from different parameter sets. It is part of a broader class of subspace-projection techniques called reduced-basis methods. In this colloquium article, we present the development, theory, and applications of eigenvector continuation and projection-based emulators. We introduce the basic concepts, discuss the underlying theory and convergence properties, and present recent applications for quantum systems and future prospects.</description>

      <title>Nuclear scattering via quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework to solve the elastic scattering phase shift of two well-bound nuclei in an uncoupled channel. Within this framework, we develop a many-body formalism in which the continuum scattering states of the two colliding nuclei are regulated by a weak external harmonic oscillator potential with varying strength. Based on our formalism, we propose an approach to compute the eigenenergies of the low-lying scattering states of the relative motion of the colliding nuclei as a function of the oscillator strength of the confining potential. Utilizing the modified effective range expansion, we extrapolate the elastic scattering phase shift of the colliding nuclei from these eigenenergies to the limit when the external potential vanishes. In our hybrid approach, we leverage the advantage of quantum computing to solve for these eigenenergies from a set of many-nucleon Hamiltonian eigenvalue problems. These eigenenergies are inputs to classical computers to obtain the phase shift. We demonstrate our framework with two simple problems, where we implement the rodeo algorithm to solve the relevant eigenenergies with the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator. The results of both the spectra and the elastic scattering phase shifts agree well with other theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature equations of state of compact stars with hyperons: three-dimensional tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct tables of finite temperature equation of state (EoS) of hypernuclear matter in the range of densities, temperatures, and electron fractions that are needed for numerical simulations of supernovas, proto-neutron stars, and binary neutron star mergers and cast them in the format of {\sc CompOSE} database. The tables are extracted from a model that is based on covariant density functional (CDF) theory that includes the full $J^P=1/2^+$ baryon octet in a manner that is consistent with the current astrophysical and nuclear constraints. We employ a parameterization with three different values of the slope of the symmetry energy $L_{\rm sym}=30$, 50 and 70 MeV and fixed skewness $Q_{\rm sat}= 400$ MeV for above saturation matter. A model for the EoS of inhomogeneous matter is matched at sub-saturation density to the high-density hypernuclear EoS. We discuss the generic features of the resulting EoS and the composition of matter as a function of density, temperature, and electron fraction. The nuclear characteristics and strangeness fraction of these models are compared to the alternatives from the literature. The integral properties of static and rapidly rotating compact stars in the limit of zero temperature are discussed and confronted with the multimessenger astrophysical constraints.</description>

      <title>Shear Viscosity of an $N$-Component Gas Mixture using the Chapman--Enskog Method under Anisotropic Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analytical Chapman-Enskog formula for calculating the shear viscosity $\eta$ of a relativistic ideal gas, such as a massless quark-gluon plasma, has consistently demonstrated good agreement with the numerical results obtained using the Green-Kubo relation under both isotropic and anisotropic two-body scatterings. However, past analyses of massless, multicomponent quark-gluon plasma have focused on an effective single-component "gluon gas." The Chapman-Enskog formula for multicomponent mixtures with nonzero yet adjustable masses was previously developed for simpler cases of isotropic scatterings. This study aims to obtain the Chapman-Enskog shear viscosity formula for a massless, multicomponent mixture under general anisotropic scatterings. Since the shear viscosity depends on a linearized collision kernel, an approximation formula for the linearized collision kernel is derived under elastic and anisotropic $l+k\rightarrow l+k$ scatterings. This derived approximation agrees very well with the isotropic two-body kernels provided in previous works for both like and different species. Furthermore, for multicomponent mixtures beyond two species types, an alternative expansion method of the $N$-component Chapman-Enskog viscosity is presented. This is applied to a two-component "binary" mixture and compared with the conventional formula for binary viscosity. The agreement between the two, for interacting and noninteracting binary mixtures, varies from moderate to well.</description>

      <title>An integral-free representation of the Dyson series using divided differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.09888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dyson series is an infinite sum of multi-dimensional time-ordered integrals, which serves as a formal representation of the quantum time-evolution operator in the interaction-picture. Using the mathematical tool of divided differences, we introduce an alternative representation for the series that is entirely free from both time ordering and integrals. In this new formalism, the Dyson expansion is given as a sum of efficiently-computable divided differences of the exponential function, considerably simplifying the calculation of the Dyson expansion terms, while also allowing for time-dependent perturbation calculations to be performed directly in the Schr{\"o}dinger-picture. We showcase the utility of this novel representation by studying a number of use cases. We also discuss several immediate applications.</description>

      <title>High-precision mass measurements of neutron deficient silver isotopes probe the robustness of the $N$ = 50 shell closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-precision mass measurements of exotic $^{95-97}$Ag isotopes close to the $N = Z$ line have been conducted with the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap mass spectrometer, with the silver ions produced using the recently commissioned inductively-heated hot cavity catcher laser ion source at the Ion Guide Isotope Separator On-Line facility. The atomic mass of $^{95}$Ag was directly determined for the first time. In addition, the atomic masses of $\beta$-decaying 2$^+$ and 8$^+$ states in $^{96}$Ag have been identified and measured for the first time, and the precision of the $^{97}$Ag mass has been improved. The newly measured masses, with a precision of $\approx$ 1 keV/c$^2$, have been used to investigate the $N =$ 50 neutron shell closure confirming it to be robust. Empirical shell-gap and pairing energies determined with the new ground-state mass data are compared with the state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} calculations with various chiral effective field theory Hamiltonians. The precise determination of the excitation energy of the $^{96m}$Ag isomer in particular serves as a benchmark for \textit{ab initio} predictions of nuclear properties beyond the ground state, specifically for odd-odd nuclei situated in proximity to the proton dripline below $^{100}$Sn. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and configuration-interaction shell-model (CISM) calculations are compared with the experimental results. All theoretical approaches face challenges to reproduce the trend of nuclear ground-state properties in the silver isotopic chain across the $N =$50 neutron shell and toward the proton drip-line.</description>

      <title>The possible $K \bar{K}^*$ and $D \bar{D}^*$ bound and resonance states by solving Schrodinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schrodinger equation with a Yukawa type of potential is solved analytically. When different boundary conditions are taken into account, a series of solutions are indicated as Bessel function, the first kind of Hankel function and the second kind of Hankel function, respectively. Subsequently, the scattering processes of $K \bar{K}^*$ and $D \bar{ D}^*$ are investigated. In the $K \bar{K}^*$ sector, the $f_1(1285)$ particle is treated as a $K \bar{K}^*$ bound state, therefore, the coupling constant in the $K \bar{K}^*$ Yukawa potential can be fixed according to the binding energy of the $f_1(1285)$ particle. Consequently, a $K \bar{K}^*$ resonance state is generated by solving the Schrodinger equation with the outgoing wave condition, which lie at $1417-i18$MeV on the complex energy plane. It is reasonable to assume that the $K \bar{K}^*$ resonance state at $1417-i18$MeV might correspond to the $f_1(1420)$ particle in the review of Particle Data Group(PDG).In the $D \bar{D}^*$ sector, since the $X(3872)$ particle is almost located at the $D \bar{ D}^*$ threshold, the binding energy of it equals to zero approximately. Therefore, the coupling constant in the $D \bar{ D}^*$ Yukawa potential is determined, which is related to the first zero point of the zero order Bessel function. Similarly to the $K \bar{K}^*$ case, four resonance states are produced as solutions of the Schrodinger equation with the outgoing wave condition. It is assumed that the resonance states at $3885-i1$MeV, $4029-i108$ MeV, $4328-i191$MeV and $4772-i267$MeV might be associated with the $Zc(3900)$, the $X(3940)$, the $\chi_{c1}(4274)$ and $\chi_{c1}(4685)$ particles, respectively. It is noted that all solutions are isospin degenerate.</description>

      <title>Energy loss of a heavy fermion in a collisional QED plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the energy loss of heavy fermions moving in a plasma, taking into account the modification of the photon collective modes induced by collisions using a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook collisional kernel. We include contributions from both hard and soft scatterings of the heavy fermion using a collisionally modified hard-thermal-loop resummed propagator. Using this method, one does not need to introduce a separation scale between hard- and soft-momentum exchanges. To place our calculation in context, we review other theoretical approaches to computing the collisional energy loss of fermions and discuss the systematics and results obtained in each approach compared to using a resummed propagator for both hard and soft momentum exchanges. Our final results indicate that self-consistently including the effect of collisions in the self-energies of the resummed propagator results in an increased energy loss compared to using collisionless hard-thermal-loop propagators. The effect becomes larger as the magnitude of the coupling constant and the velocity of the fermion increase.</description>

      <title>Improved Constraints on the Variation of the Weak Scale from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an improved calculation of the light element abundances in the framework of Big Bang nucleosynthesis as a function of the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$. We compare the methods of our calculation to previous literature including the recently published work of Burns et al. [1]. The PDG result for the $^4$He abundance can be explained within $2\sigma$ by $-0.014 \leq \delta v / v \leq 0.026$, for deuterium we find the constraint $-0.005 \leq \delta v / v \leq -0.001$. These bounds are more stringent than what was found earlier.</description>

      <title>Steady state, displacement current and spin polarization for massless fermion in a shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider spin polarization of massless fermions in a shear flow, whose complete contributions contain magnetization current and side-jump current known from collisional chiral kinetic theory. We argue that the side-jump current adopts interpretation of displacement current. We explicitly determine the displacement current contribution in the steady state reached in shear flow for a QED plasma. We find the displacement contribution enhances the magnetization contribution at small and large momenta, but leads to a suppression effect at intermediate momenta. Major differences from previous studies on collisional effect are: (i) the fermions are in the same steady state as the medium rather than being probes; (ii) Compton scattering and pair annihilation are also included in addition to the Coulomb scattering considered before.</description>
