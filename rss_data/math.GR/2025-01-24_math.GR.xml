      <description>arXiv:2501.13362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct examples of groups which have the same set of conjugacy class sizes as nilpotent groups, while their center is trivial. This answers a question posed by A. R. Camina in 2006.</description>

      <title>Finite groups admitting a regular tournament $m$-semiregular representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive integer $m$, a finite group $G$ is said to admit a tournament $m$-semiregular representation (TmSR for short) if there exists a tournament $\Gamma$ such that the automorphism group of $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to $G$ and acts semiregularly on the vertex set of $\Gamma$ with $m$ orbits. Clearly, every finite group of even order does not admit a TmSR for any positive integer $m$, and T1SR is the well-known tournament regular representation (TRR for short). In 1986, Godsil \cite{god} proved, by a probabilistic approach, that the only finite groups of odd order without a TRR are $\mathbb{Z}_3^2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_3^3$ .
  More recently, Du \cite{du} proved that every finite group of odd order has a TmSR for every $m \geq 2$. The author of \cite{du} observed that a finite group of odd order has no regular TmSR when $m$ is an even integer, a group of order $1$ has no regular T3SR, and $\mathbb{Z}_3^2$ admits a regular T3SR. At the end of \cite{du}, Du proposed the following problem.
  \noindent{\sf\it Problem.} \ \ {\it For every odd integer $m\geq 3$, classify finite groups of odd order which have a regular TmSR.}
  The motivation of this paper is to give an answer for the above problem. We proved that if $G$ is a finite group with odd order $n&gt;1$, then $G$ admits a regular TmSR for any odd integer $m\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Elements of Prime Power Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \textit{conjugacy classes} and the \textit{vanishing elements} of a finite group (i.e. elements where some irreducible character of group vanishes) are among many basic invariants associated to a finite group, which have shown their influence on the structure of group. In recent years, the effect of combination of both the invariants has been widely studied. In this paper, we study the effect of vanishing elements \textit{of prime power order} and \textit{their conjugacy classes}, which generalize some recent results by Dolfi et al, and by Robati.</description>

      <title>Constructing reducibly geometrically finite subgroups of the mapping class group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider qualified notions of geometric finiteness in mapping class groups called parabolically geometrically finite (PGF) and reducibly geometrically finite (RGF). We examine several constructions of subgroups and determine when they produce a PGF or RGF subgroup. These results provide a variety of new examples of PGF and RGF subgroups. Firstly, we consider the right-angled Artin subgroups constructed by Koberda and Clay--Leininger--Mangahas, which are generated by high powers of given elements of the mapping class group. We give conditions on the supports of these elements that imply the resulting right-angled Artin subgroup is RGF. Secondly, we prove combination theorems which provide conditions for when a collection of reducible subgroups, or sufficiently deep finite-index subgroups thereof, generate an RGF subgroup.</description>

      <title>Stable cylinders and fine structures for hyperbolic groups and curve graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1995, Rips and Sela asked if torsionfree hyperbolic groups admit globally stable cylinders. We establish this property for all residually finite hyperbolic groups and curve graphs of finite-type surfaces. These cylinders are fine objects, and the core of our approach is to upgrade the hyperbolic space to one with improved fine properties via a generalisation of Sageev's construction. The methods also let us prove that curve graphs of surfaces admit equivariant quasiisometric embeddings in finite products of quasitrees.</description>

      <title>A Quest for countable statistically characterized subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very recently in [Das et al., Expo. Math., 2025], statistically characterized subgroups have been investigated for some non-arithmetic sequences, addressing certain cardinality-related questions. Building on this work, we investigate further and demonstrate that, for a particular class of non-arithmetic sequences, the statistically characterized subgroup coincides with the corresponding characterized subgroup. As a corollary, we identify a class of sequences for which statistically characterized subgroups are countably infinite. This result provides a negative solution to Problem 2.16 posed in [Das et al., Expo. Math., 2025] and Question 6.3 from [Dikranjan et al., Fund. Math., 2020]. Additionally, our findings resolve several open problems discussed in [Dikranjan et al., submitted]</description>

      <title>Profinite rigidity of K\"ahler groups: Riemann surfaces and subdirect products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes strong profinite rigidity results for K\"ahler groups, showing that certain groups are determined within the class of residually finite K\"ahler groups by their profinite completion. Examples include products of surface groups and certain groups with exotic finiteness properties studied earlier by Dimca-Papadima-Suciu and Llosa Isenrich. Consequently, there are aspherical smooth projective varieties that are determined up to homeomorphism by their algebraic fundamental group. The main tool is the following: the holomorphic fibrations of a closed K\"ahler manifold over hyperbolic 2-orbifolds can be recovered from the profinite completion of its fundamental group. We also prove profinite invariance of the BNS invariant.</description>

      <title>Exponentially slow thermalization in 1D fragmented dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermalization dynamics of 1D systems with local constraints coupled to an infinite temperature bath at one boundary. The coupling to the bath eventually erases the effects of the constraints, causing the system to tend towards a maximally mixed state at long times. We show that for a large class of local constraints, the time at which thermalization occurs can be extremely long. In particular, we present evidence for the following conjecture: when the constrained dynamics displays strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the thermalization time diverges exponentially with system size. We show that this conjecture holds for a wide range of dynamical constraints, including dipole-conserving dynamics, the $tJ_z$ model, and a large class of group-based dynamics, and relate a general proof of our conjecture to a different conjecture about the existence of certain expander graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the class of groups of bounded type from tile inflations. These tile inflations also determine some automata describing the groups. In the case when the automata are stationary, we show that if the set of incompressible elements of a group in this class is finite, then this group has subexponential growth with a bounded power in the exponent. Then we describe some examples with certain special structures of orbital graphs and give explicit ways to find the upper bounds for the growth functions of these groups.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a topological group and let $K,L\subseteq G$ be closed subgroups, with $K\subseteq L$.
  We prove that if $L$ is a locally compact pro-Lie group, then the map $q:G/K\to G/L$ is a fibration. As an application of this, we obtain two older results by Skljarenko, Madison and Mostert.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite nilpotent group and $n\in \{3,4, 5\}$. Consider $S_n\times G$ as a subgroup of $S_n\times S_{|G|}\subset S_{n|G|}$, where $G$ embeds into the second factor of $S_n\times S_{|G|}$ via the regular representation. Over any number field $k$, we prove the strong form of Malle's conjecture for $S_n\times G$ viewed as a subgroup of $S_{n|G|}$. Our result requires that $G$ satisfies some mild conditions.</description>

Abstract: We study permutations on n elements preserving orientation (parity) of every subset of size k. We describe all groups of these permutations. Unexpectedly, these groups (except for some special cases) are either trivial, cyclic or dihedral. In this context, we define and study monoids generalizing monoids of order-preserving mappings and monoids of orientation-preserving mappings.</description>

      <title>Positive entropy actions by higher-rank lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study smooth actions by lattices in higher-rank simple Lie groups. Assuming one element of the action acts with positive topological entropy, we prove a number of new rigidity results. For lattices in $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ acting on $n$-manifolds, if the action has positive topological entropy we show the lattice must be commensurable with $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{Z})$. Moreover, such actions admit an absolutely continuous probability measure with positive metric entropy; adapting arguments by Katok and Rodriguez Hertz, we show such actions are measurably conjugate to affine actions on (infra-)tori.
  In a main technical argument, we study families of probability measures invariant under sub-actions of the induced action by the ambient Lie group on an associated fiber bundle. To control entropy properties of such measures when passing to limits, in the appendix we establish certain upper semicontinuity of fiber entropy under weak-$*$ convergence, adapting classical results of Yomdin and Newhouse.</description>
