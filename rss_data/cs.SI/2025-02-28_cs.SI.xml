      <title>Social Influence Distorts Ratings in Online Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical work on sequential choice and large-scale experiments in online ranking and voting systems has demonstrated that social influence can have a drastic impact on social and technological systems. Yet, the effect of social influence on online rating systems remains understudied and the few existing contributions suggest that online ratings would self-correct given enough users. Here, we propose a new framework for studying the effect of social influence on online ratings. We start from the assumption that people are influenced linearly by the observed average rating, but postulate that their propensity to be influenced varies. When the weight people assign to the observed average depends only on their own latent rating, the resulting system is linear, but the long-term rating may substantially deviate from the true mean rating. When the weight people put on the observed average depends on both their own latent rating and the observed average rating, the resulting system is non-linear, and may support multiple equilibria, suggesting that ratings might be path-dependent and deviations dramatic. Our results highlight potential limitations in crowdsourced information aggregation and can inform the design of more robust online rating systems.</description>

      <title>Community Detection by ELPMeans: An Unsupervised Approach That Uses Laplacian Centrality and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection in network analysis has become more intricate due to the recent hike in social networks (Cai et al., 2024). This paper suggests a new approach named ELPMeans that strives to address this challenge. For community detection in the whole network, ELPMeans combines Laplacian, Hierarchical Clustering as well as K-means algorithms. Our technique employs Laplacian centrality and minimum distance metrics for central node identification while k-means learning is used for efficient convergence to final community structure. Remarkably, ELPMeans is an unsupervised method which is not only simple to implement but also effectively tackles common problems such as random initialization of central nodes, or finding of number of communities (K). Experimental results show that our algorithm improves accuracy and reduces time complexity considerably outperforming recent approaches on real world networks. Moreover, our approach has a wide applicability range in various community detection tasks even with nonconvex shapes and no prior knowledge about the number of communities present.</description>

      <title>Towards Collaborative Anti-Money Laundering Among Financial Institutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Money laundering is the process that intends to legalize the income derived from illicit activities, thus facilitating their entry into the monetary flow of the economy without jeopardizing their source. It is crucial to identify such activities accurately and reliably in order to enforce anti-money laundering (AML). Despite considerable efforts to AML, a large number of such activities still go undetected. Rule-based methods were first introduced and are still widely used in current detection systems. With the rise of machine learning, graph-based learning methods have gained prominence in detecting illicit accounts through the analysis of money transfer graphs. Nevertheless, these methods generally assume that the transaction graph is centralized, whereas in practice, money laundering activities usually span multiple financial institutions. Due to regulatory, legal, commercial, and customer privacy concerns, institutions tend not to share data, restricting their utility in practical usage. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm that supports performing AML over multiple institutions while protecting the security and privacy of local data. To evaluate, we construct Alipay-ECB, a real-world dataset comprising digital transactions from Alipay, the world's largest mobile payment platform, alongside transactions from E-Commerce Bank (ECB). The dataset includes over 200 million accounts and 300 million transactions, covering both intra-institution transactions and those between Alipay and ECB. This makes it the largest real-world transaction graph available for analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods can effectively identify cross-institution money laundering subgroups. Additionally, experiments on synthetic datasets also demonstrate that our method is efficient, requiring only a few minutes on datasets with millions of transactions.</description>

      <title>AirCalypse: Can Twitter Help in Urban Air Quality Measurement and Who are the Influential Users?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this digital age, Online Social Media's ubiquity has led it to it's role as a "Sensor". Starting from disaster response to political predictions, online social media like Twitter, have been instrumental and are actively researched areas. In this work, we have focused on something quite insidious in the current context, i.e., air pollution in developing regions. Starting as an empirical study on using Twitter as a "Sensor" to measure air quality, the focal point of this work is to identify the users who have been actively tweeting in the air pollution events in Delhi, the capital of India. From these users, we try to identify the influential ones, who play a significant role in creating the initial awareness and hence act as "Sensors". We have utilized a tailored "TRank" algorithm for finding out the influential users by considering \textit{Retweet, Favorite, and Follower influence} of the users. After ranking the users based on their social influence, we further study the behavior, i.e., perception of pollution from those users' posts with respect to the actual air pollution levels using the physical sensors. The tracking of influential users in air quality monitoring assists in developing a crowd sensed air quality measurement framework, which can augment the physical air quality sensors for raising awareness against air pollution.</description>

      <title>A City of Millions: Mapping Literary Social Networks At Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We release 70,509 high-quality social networks extracted from multilingual fiction and nonfiction narratives. We additionally provide metadata for ~30,000 of these texts (73% nonfiction and 27% fiction) written between 1800 and 1999 in 58 languages. This dataset provides information on historical social worlds at an unprecedented scale, including data for 1,192,855 individuals in 2,805,482 pair-wise relationships annotated for affinity and relationship type. We achieve this scale by automating previously manual methods of extracting social networks; specifically, we adapt an existing annotation task as a language model prompt, ensuring consistency at scale with the use of structured output. This dataset provides an unprecedented resource for the humanities and social sciences by providing data on cognitive models of social realities.</description>

      <title>Block-corrected Modularity for Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unknown node attributes in complex networks may introduce community structures that are important to distinguish from those driven by known attributes. We propose a block-corrected modularity that discounts given block structures present in the network to reveal communities masked by them. We show analytically how the proposed modularity finds the community structure driven by an unknown attribute in a simple network model. Further, we observe that the block-corrected modularity finds the underlying community structure on a number of simple synthetic network models while methods using different null models fail. We develop an efficient spectral method as well as two Louvain-inspired fine-tuning algorithms to maximize the proposed modularity and demonstrate their performance on several synthetic network models. Finally, we assess our methodology on various real-world citation networks built using the OpenAlex data by correcting for the temporal citation patterns.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the effect of retractions on publishing careers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retracting academic papers is a fundamental tool of quality control, but it may have far-reaching consequences for retracted authors and their careers. Previous studies have highlighted the adverse effects of retractions on citation counts and coauthors' citations; however, the broader impacts beyond these have not been fully explored. We address this gap leveraging Retraction Watch, the most extensive data set on retractions and link it to Microsoft Academic Graph and Altmetric. Retracted authors, particularly those with less experience, often leave scientific publishing in the aftermath of retraction, especially if their retractions attract widespread attention. However, retracted authors who remain active in publishing maintain and establish more collaborations compared to their similar non-retracted counterparts. Nevertheless, retracted authors generally retain less senior and less productive coauthors, but gain more impactful coauthors post-retraction. Our findings suggest that retractions may impose a disproportionate impact on early-career authors.</description>

      <title>Discovering overlapping communities in multi-layer directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community detection in multi-layer undirected networks has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, multi-layer directed networks are common in the real world, and existing community detection methods often either ignore the asymmetric structure in multi-layer directed networks or assume that every node solely belongs to a single community, significantly limiting their applicability to overlapping multi-layer directed networks, where nodes can belong to multiple communities simultaneously. To fill this gap, this article explores the challenging problem of detecting overlapping communities in multi-layer directed networks. Our goal is to understand the underlying asymmetric overlapping community structure by analyzing the mixed memberships of nodes. We introduce a novel multi-layer mixed membership stochastic co-block model (multi-layer MM-ScBM) to model overlapping multi-layer directed networks. We develop a spectral procedure to estimate nodes' memberships in both sending and receiving patterns. Our method uses a successive projection algorithm on a few leading eigenvectors of two debiased aggregation matrices. To our knowledge, this is the first work to detect asymmetric overlapping communities in multi-layer directed networks. We demonstrate the consistent estimation properties of our method by providing per-node error rates under the multi-layer MM-ScBM framework. Our theoretical analysis reveals that increasing the overall sparsity, the number of nodes, or the number of layers can improve the accuracy of overlapping community detection. Extensive numerical experiments validate these theoretical findings. We also apply our method to one real-world multi-layer directed network, gaining insightful results.</description>

      <title>Repeated and incontrovertible collective action failure leads to protester disengagement and radicalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protest is ubiquitous in the 21st Century and the people who participate in such movements do so because they seek to bring about social change. However, social change takes time and involves repeated interactions between individual protesters, social movements and the authorities to whom they appeal for change. These complexities of time and scale have frustrated efforts to isolate the conditions that foster an enduring movement, on the one hand, and the adoption of more radical (unconventional, unacceptable) tactics on the other. Here, we present a novel, theoretically informed and empirically evidenced, agent-based model of collective action that provides a unified framework to address these dual challenges. We model ~10,000 iterations within a simulated society and show that where an authority is responsive, and protesters can (cognitively and/or socially) contest the failure of their movement, a moderate conventional movement prevails. Conversely, where an authority repeatedly and incontrovertibly fails the movement, the population disengages but becomes radicalised (latent radicalism). This latter finding, whereby the whole population is disengaged but prepared to use radical methods to bring about social change, likely reflects the febrile pre-cursor state to sudden, revolutionary change. Results highlight the potential for simulations to reveal emergent, as-yet under-theorized, phenomena.</description>

      <title>Hyperdimensional Representation Learning for Node Classification and Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Hyperdimensional Graph Learner (HDGL), a novel method for node classification and link prediction in graphs. HDGL maps node features into a very high-dimensional space (\textit{hyperdimensional} or HD space for short) using the \emph{injectivity} property of node representations in a family of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and then uses HD operators such as \textit{bundling} and \textit{binding} to aggregate information from the local neighborhood of each node yielding latent node representations that can support both node classification and link prediction tasks. HDGL, unlike GNNs that rely on computationally expensive iterative optimization and hyperparameter tuning, requires only a single pass through the data set. We report results of experiments using widely used benchmark datasets which demonstrate that, on the node classification task, HDGL achieves accuracy that is competitive with that of the state-of-the-art GNN methods at substantially reduced computational cost; and on the link prediction task, HDGL matches the performance of DeepWalk and related methods, although it falls short of computationally demanding state-of-the-art GNNs.</description>

      <title>A Large-Scale Simulation on Large Language Models for Decision-Making in Political Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text generation and reasoning, their ability to simulate human decision-making -- particularly in political contexts -- remains an open question. However, modeling voter behavior presents unique challenges due to limited voter-level data, evolving political landscapes, and the complexity of human reasoning. In this study, we develop a theory-driven, multi-step reasoning framework that integrates demographic, temporal and ideological factors to simulate voter decision-making at scale. Using synthetic personas calibrated to real-world voter data, we conduct large-scale simulations of recent U.S. presidential elections. Our method significantly improves simulation accuracy while mitigating model biases. We examine its robustness by comparing performance across different LLMs. We further investigate the challenges and constraints that arise from LLM-based political simulations. Our work provides both a scalable framework for modeling political decision-making behavior and insights into the promise and limitations of using LLMs in political science research.</description>
