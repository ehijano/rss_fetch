      <title>Numerical Treatment of Shock-Induced Nuclear Burning in Double Detonation Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a benchmark problem to assess the treatment of shock-induced nuclear burning in the context of double detonation Type Ia supernovae. In a stratified white dwarf model, we implement a shock-detection criterion that suppresses burning in zones characterized by compression and significant pressure gradients, controlled by a tunable parameter, $f_{\rm shock}$. One-dimensional simulations, using the open-source Castro suite, were conducted across three treatments - burning fully enabled, and burning suppressed with $f_{\rm shock} = 2/3$ and $f_{\rm shock} = 1$ - across three spatial resolutions (5.0, 2.5, and 0.3125 km). At the finest resolution, the burning-enabled and $f_{\rm shock} = 1$ models converge, while the $f_{\rm shock} = 2/3$ front continues to show slight offset behavior. Since most simulations are carried out at much lower resolutions, our tests support the idea that burning in shocks should always be disabled in practice. We also observe that the behavior of lower-resolution simulations remains extremely sensitive to the choice of $f_{\rm shock}$.</description>

      <title>Forming prominences accounting for partial ionisation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most striking structures in the solar atmosphere are prominences, predominantly coronal structures, with thermodynamic conditions that vary from chromospheric internally to the corona that surrounds them. These structures play an important role in the energy transfer between all layers of the atmosphere. Although mostly studied as a fully ionised plasma, prominences are, in fact, composed of partially ionised plasma. We do not yet fully understand the extent to which the two-fluid plasma-neutral properties play a role in the evolution of these coronal structures. In this work, we explore for the very first time how prominence formation and growth in a coronal loop evolves in a two-fluid setting. We used MPI-AMRVAC to study the evaporation-condensation process, where we consider radiative cooling, thermal conduction, and localised heating in a coronal loop in a fully stratified atmosphere. We report on the differences the two-fluid plasma brings into the prominence evolution, and more specifically in the period after the dynamic formation process finishes. Furthermore, we highlight the role it plays during the linear and the non-linear phases of the evolution. We find pronounced two-fluid effects in shocks that appear with the first complete condensation and confirm decoupling effects in the PCTR on the order of 100$\,$m$\,$s$^{-1}$, consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the binary nature of the magnetospheric B-type star $\rho$ Oph A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nearby B-type star $\rho$ Oph A was recently identified as a rapidly rotating magnetic B-type star with variable radio and X-ray emission consistent with a magnetospheric origin. We present a high-resolution spectropolarimetric time series obtained with ESPaDOnS, which we use to perform a magnetic analysis using least-squares deconvolution (LSD). We find that $\rho$ Oph A is a spectroscopic binary consisting of two B-type stars with masses of about 8 and 10 $M_\odot$ on a slightly eccentric 88-day orbit, with the magnetic field being associated with the smaller Ab component. This leads to $\rho$ Oph Ab's 4 kG surface magnetic dipole being approximately twice as strong as the previously reported 2 kG. The oblique rotator model derived from the longitudinal magnetic field curve agrees well with the LSD Stokes $V$ profiles, indicating that the magnetic field is likely to be very nearly dipolar. The orbital and rotational axes appear to be aligned. We report for the first time $\rho$ Oph Ab's magnetospheric H$\alpha$ emission, which is consistent with an origin in a centrifugal magnetosphere. We also demonstrate that $\rho$ Oph Ab's light curve can be recovered from the previously reported {\em Kepler-2} light curve of $\rho$ Oph C, and that it demonstrates prominent magnetospheric eclipses similar to those of $\sigma$ Ori E, and which can be reproduced using a dipolar Rigidly Rotating Magnetosphere model. Both H$\alpha$ and the light curve are indicative of a strongly asymmetric magnetosphere. All indications are that $\rho$ Oph Ab's magnetic field is essentially dipolar, meaning that contributions from higher-order multipoles probably cannot explain the strong asymmetry in the magnetosphere. Only two other stars show comparable degrees of asymmetry, both of which are also close binaries, suggesting that binarity can affect the magnetospheric plasma distributions.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Orbit and Dynamical Masses of GJ 105 AC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precision of stellar models is higher than the precision at which we are able to measure the masses of most stars, with the notable exception of binaries where we can determine dynamical masses of the component stars. In addition to well-measured stellar properties, the ideal benchmark star is far enough from its companion that its properties are indistinguishable from an otherwise identical single star. Currently, there are a handful of stars with precise ($\pm$3 %), model-independent mass measurements that are "effectively single" and for which we can obtain clean spectra (i.e. spectra that are not blended with a close companion). In this paper, we introduce GJ 105 AC as the newest members of this exclusive population. We present an updated orbital analysis for the long-period K3+M7 binary GJ 105 AC. We jointly analyze radial velocity (RV) and relative astrometry data, including new RVs from the Miniature Exoplanet Radial Velocity Array (MINERVA) that capture the full periapsis passage and the RV minimum of the $76.0 \pm 1.3$ yr orbit for the first time. We derive precise dynamical masses of $M_1 = 0.78 \pm 0.02\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.098 \pm 0.002\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$. We find that of all stars with similarly precise masses (~2%), GJ 105 AC stands out as having the widest on-sky separation after $\alpha$ Centauri AB, making it one of the most easily accessible to spectroscopy, as well as the the second-widest true separation, ensuring that its members are truly "effectively single" in terms of their evolution.</description>

      <title>Hints of Disk Substructure in the First Brown Dwarf with a Dynamical Mass Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution ALMA observations at 0.89 mm of the Class II brown dwarf 2MASS J04442713+2512164 (2M0444), achieving a spatial resolution of 0$.\!\!^{\prime\prime}$046 ($\sim$6.4 au at the distance to the source). These observations targeted continuum emission together with $^{12}$CO (3-2) molecular line. The line emission traces a Keplerian disk, allowing us to derive a dynamical mass between 0.043-0.092 M${_{\odot}}$ for the central object. We constrain the gas-to-dust disk size ratio to be $\sim$7, consistent with efficient radial drift. However, the observed dust emission suggest that a dust trap is present, enough to retain some dust particles. We perform visibility fitting of the continuum emission, and under the assumption of annular substructure, our best fit shows a gap and a ring at 98.1$^{+4.2}_{-8.4}$ mas ($\sim$14 au) and 116.0$^{+4.2}_{-4.8}$ mas ($\sim$16 au), respectively, with a gap width of 20 mas ($\sim$3 au). To ensure robustness, the data were analyzed through a variety of methods in both the image and uv plane, employing multiple codes and approaches. This tentative disk structure could be linked to a possible planetary companion in the process of formation. These results provide the first dynamical mass of the lowest mass object to date, together with the possible direct detection of a substructure, offering new insights into disk dynamics and planet formation in the very low-mass regime. Future higher spatial resolution ALMA observations will be essential to confirm these findings and further investigate the link between substructures and planet formation in brown dwarf disks.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismically Inferred Ages of 132,000 Red Giants with TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA's TESS mission has identified at least 158,000 oscillating red giants, increasing the known sample by roughly an order of magnitude. After validating that these measurements are reliable to 5% for up to 90% of red giants (Theodoridis &amp; Tayar 2023), we make custom stellar evolution models using MESA in order to estimate ages for ~132,794 of these stars to an average uncertainty of 23%. We show that these ages follow similar distributions to those observed in other samples such as Kepler with small differences likely resulting in the galactic volume probed. We provide these ages to the community to enable future galactic archaeology analyses.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation and transmission in a rotating solar-type star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the internal wave propagation and transmission across the radiation-convection interface in a solar-type star by solving the linear perturbation equations of a self-gravitating and uniformly rotating polytropic fluid in spherical geometry with Coriolis force fully taken into account. Three structures are considered: convective zone, radiative zone, and a transitional layer at the interface. In a rotating convective zone, energy flux is predominantly carried by sound waves while kinetic energy by inertial waves, and rotation has a great effect on non-axisymmetric modes. In a radiative zone without rotation, energy flux is predominantly carried by sound waves or gravity waves while kinetic energy by gravity waves. In a layered structure, rotation enhances gravito-inertial waves transmission at the interface because the group velocity of inertial waves is almost along the rotational axis. This implies that we can detect the deep interior of rapidly rotating solar-type stars at the young age.</description>

      <title>Recovery of the Solar Cycle from Maunder-like Grand Minima Episodes: A Quantification of the Necessary Polar Flux Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 11-yr cycle of sunspots undergo amplitude modulation over longer timescales. As a part of this long-term modulation in solar activity, the decennial rhythm occasionally breaks, with quiescent phases with very few sunspots observed over multiple decades. These episodes are termed as solar grand minima. Observation of solar magnetic activity proxies complemented by solar dynamo simulations suggests that the large-scale solar polar fields become very weak during this minima phases with a temporary halt in the polar field reversal. Eventually, with the accumulation of sufficient polar fluxes, the polarity reversal and regular cyclic activity is thought to resume, Using multi-millennial dynamo simulations with stochastic forcing, we quantify the polar flux threshold necessary to recover global solar polarity reversal and surmount grand minima phases. We find that the duration of a grand minimum is independent of the onset rate and does not affect the recovery rate. Our results suggest a method to forecast the Sun's recovery from a grand minima phase. However, based on our approach, we could not identify specific precursors that signal entry in to a grand minima phase -- implying that predicting the onset of grand minima remains an outstanding challenge.</description>

      <title>The present-day cosmic phosphorus abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present-day phosphorus abundance in the solar neighbourhood is determined from a sample of OB-type stars. This is in order to constrain the endpoint of the galactochemical evolution of phosphorus in the course of stellar nucleosynthesis over cosmic time and to provide an abundance baseline for the study of the depletion of phosphorus onto dust grains in the interstellar medium. A model atom for P II/III/IV based on a comprehensive new set of ab initio data for line transitions, photoionisations and electron-impact excitation was developed. Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) line formation calculations with the codes DETAIL and SURFACE were conducted, based on LTE line-blanketed hydrostatic model atmospheres computed with the ATLAS12 code. High-resolution optical spectra for a sample of 42 apparently slowly rotating main-sequence OB-type stars and B-type supergiants in the solar vicinity within ~500 pc and beyond, out to a distance of ~2 kpc, were analysed. The non-LTE effects on the formation of the P II/III/IV lines are discussed. Non-LTE effects on the stellar abundances range from zero to ~0.3 dex. Where available in the spectra, ionisation balance between two phosphorus ionic species is achieved. Accurate and precise abundances are provided for the sample stars, statistical and systematic 1 sigma uncertainties are typically each well below 0.1 dex. The present-day cosmic phosphorus abundance in the solar neighbourhood is constrained to log(P/H)+12 = 5.36 +- 0.14, which is compatible with the solar photospheric abundance, but lower than derived by LTE analyses of neutral phosphorus lines in solar-type stars. The amount of phosphorus depleted onto dust grains is ~0.25 dex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection and characterisation of other "Earths", orbiting other suns, is a bold objective of present-day astrophysics. However, this quest is severely challenged by astrophysical "noise" from the host stars, whose signatures distort the observed spectra. Motivated by this problem, we are building a dedicated facility, the Paranal solar ESPRESSO Telescope (PoET). PoET will collect solar light and channel it into the ESPRESSO spectrograph, allowing us to use the Sun as a proxy to unambiguously identify and understand the sources of relevant variability in solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>On the origins of coronal Alfv\'enic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alfv\'enic waves are considered a key contributor to the energy flux that powers the Sun's corona, with theoretical models demonstrating their potential to explain coronal EUV and X-ray emission and the acceleration of the solar wind. However, confirming underlying assumptions of the models has proved challenging, especially obtaining evidence for the excitation and dissipation of Alfv\'enic waves in the lower solar atmosphere and tracing their propagation into the corona. We present an investigation of the Alfv\'enic wave power spectrum in the Sun's corona, obtained from observations with DKIST Cryo-NIRSP. The data provide unprecedented temporal resolution and signal-to-noise, revealing a detailed power spectrum out to frequencies exceeding 10 mHz. A broad enhancement in power dominates the spectrum and we demonstrate it is accurately reproduced using a physics-based model. The results corroborate the scenario where the corona is dominated by Alfv\'enic waves excited in the photosphere by horizontal convective motions, with low-frequency waves subject to reflection at the transition region and higher frequency waves significantly dissipated by the partially ionized chromosphere. The coronal Alfv\'enic power spectrum also indicates there are contributions from \textit{p}-modes (via mode conversion) and a yet-unknown higher-frequency source. These results provide key insight into how the Sun's convective motions imprint themselves on the corona and highlight the critical role of partial ionization, reflection, and damping in regulating upward-propagating Alfv\'enic waves. A further implication of this is that reconnection-driven Alfv\'enic waves likely play a smaller role in powering the corona and solar wind than has been suggested by recent studies.</description>

      <title>Be star demographics: a comprehensive study of thousands of lightcurves in the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-color OGLE survey light curves of about 20 years duration are analyzed for about 3000 classical Be stars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC) in order to study the properties and variability. Each light curve was manually analyzed to distinguish between different scenarios, such as photospheric baseline levels, and disk build-up and dissipation phases. This analysis was aided by dynamical disk models and photospheric models to coarsely determine inclination angle and mass. Measured quantities such as the fraction of time spent actively ejecting mass (the duty cycle), the fraction of time spent with a detectable disk (the disk duty cycle), the build-up and dissipation time of isolated disk events, and the number of mass outbursts per year allow us to characterize and compare the behavior of the two populations. There is a wide spread in the duty cycle, with median values of 0.44 (LMC) and 0.60 (SMC). The disk duty cycle is high for both populations, with median values of 0.99 (LMC) and 1.0 (SMC), indicating that disks are almost always present for these stars. The occurrence rate of outbursts ranges from zero to about two per year, with median values of 0.31 (LMC) and 0.26 (SMC). There are strong statistical differences in the behavior of the LMC and SMC populations, with the lower metallicity stars being more active in terms of their duty cycle and disk duty cycle, and with less frequent but longer lasting outbursts.</description>

Abstract: The retrograde orbit of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b is suggestive of high-eccentricity migration caused by dynamical interactions with a massive companion. However, the only other known body in the system is an M dwarf located $\sim$10$^3$~AU away, too distant to cause high-eccentricity migration without fine tuning. Here we present transit-timing and radial-velocity evidence for an additional stellar companion with semi-major axis $32^{+16}_{-11}$~AU, eccentricity $0.76^{+0.12}_{-0.26}$, and minimum mass $0.19^{+0.11}_{-0.06}$~$\rm M_\odot$. We investigate several dynamical routes by which this nearby companion star could have played a role in converting a cold Jupiter into the retrograde hot Jupiter that is observed today. Of particular interest is a novel "eccentricity cascade" mechanism involving both of the companion stars: the outer companion periodically excites the eccentricity of the inner companion through von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) cycles, and this eccentricity excitation is slowly transferred to the cold Jupiter via successive close encounters, eventually triggering its high-eccentricity migration. The plausibility of this mechanism in explaining HAT-P-7b shows that stellar companions traditionally considered too distant to cause hot Jupiter formation might nevertheless be responsible, with the aid of closer-orbiting massive companions. With these developments, HAT-P-7b is one of the few hot Jupiters for which a complete high-eccentricity migration history can be simulated based only on observed bodies, rather than invoking bodies that are beneath detection limits or that are no longer in the system.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismological constraints on--and hints of--dark matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If dark matter interacts with nuclei or electrons, then elastic collisions with constituents of stars will cause some of the galactic dark matter to fall below the escape velocity and become gravitationally bound. For asymmetric dark matter (which does not self-annihilate), the large accumulated population of dark matter can act as an additional source of heat transport, altering stellar structure and evolution. These effects can be probed by the use of asteroseismology. Here, we demonstrate this effect via numerical simulations. We use Monte Carlo-calibrated heat transport calculations, with a focus on the erasure of the convective core in stars that are slightly more massive than the Sun. We find limits on spin-dependent dark matter-nucleon and dark matter-electron interactions using asteroseismological data from a nearby sub-giant star. More tantalizingly, we find a $\gtrsim 4 \sigma$ preference for dark matter-electron interactions for dark matter masses $\lesssim 3.5$ GeV and cross sections $\sigma_{\chi-e} \sim 10^{-34.5}$ cm$^2$, albeit in strong tension with limits from Earth-based direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS): overview of program and early results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The embedded phase is a crucial period in the development of a young star. Mid-IR observations, now possible with JWST with unprecedented sensitivity, spectral resolution and sharpness are key for probing many physical and chemical processes on sub-arcsecond scales. JOYS addresses a wide variety of questions, from protostellar accretion and the nature of primeval jets, winds and outflows, to the chemistry of gas and ice, and the characteristics of embedded disks. We introduce the program and show representative results. MIRI-MRS data of 17 low-mass and 6 high-mass protostars show a wide variety of features. Atomic line maps differ among refractory (e.g., Fe), semi-refractory (e.g., S) and volatile elements (e.g., Ne), linked to their different levels of depletion and local (shock) conditions. Nested, stratified jet structures consisting of an inner ionized core seen in [Fe II] with an outer H2 layer are commonly seen. Wide-angle winds are found in low-J H2 lines. [S I] follows the jet in the youngest protostars, but is concentrated on source when more evolved. [Ne II] reveals a mix of jet shock and photoionized emission. H I lines measure accretion, but are also associated with jets. Molecular emission (CO2, C2H2, HCN, H2O, ..) is cool compared with disks, and likely associated with hot cores. Deep ice absorption features reveal not just the major ice components but also ions (as part of salts) and complex organic molecules, with comparable abundances from low- to high-mass sources. A second detection of HDO ice in a solar-mass source is presented with HDO/H2O ~ 0.4%, providing a link with disks and comets. A deep search for solid O2 suggests it is not a significant oxygen reservoir. Only few embedded Class I disks show the same forest of water lines as Class II disks do, perhaps due to significant dust extinction of the upper layers [abridged].</description>

      <title>White dwarfs in regularized 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs), as the remnants of low to intermediate-mass stars, provide a unique opportunity to explore the interplay between quantum mechanical degeneracy pressure and gravitational forces under extreme conditions. In this study, we examine the structure and macroscopic properties of WDs within the framework of 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity, a modified theory that incorporates higher-order curvature corrections through the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha$. Using the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations tailored for 4DEGB gravity, we analyze the hydrostatic equilibrium of WDs modeled with a realistic equation of state (EoS). Our findings reveal that the inclusion of the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term significantly influences the mass-radius ($M-R$) relation, allowing for deviations from the Chandrasekhar mass limit. In particular, we observe that such stars become more compact and slightly smaller with the increase of the parameter $\alpha$. For WDs with $\vert\alpha\vert \leq 500\, \rm km^2$, the impact of 4DEGB gravity appears to be negligible. However, a larger range for $\alpha$ allows for appreciable changes in the $M-R$ diagram, mainly in the high-central-density region. Furthermore, we explore the role of anisotropic pressures, quantified by the parameter $\beta$, on such systems and demonstrate their impact on stability and compactness. For sufficiently large values of $\vert\beta\vert$ keeping negative $\beta$ with a large and positive $\alpha$, there exists a second stable branch according to the classical stability criterion $dM/d\rho_c &gt;0$. These results suggest that anisotropic WDs in 4DEGB gravity exhibit unique characteristics that distinguish them from their general relativistic counterparts, offering a novel testing ground for modified gravity theories in astrophysical settings.</description>

      <title>Insights into the 3D layered structure of nearby open clusters through N-body simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Open clusters (OCs) are important for understanding star formation, dynamics, and evolution. Previous studies have indicated a relationship between cluster structure and member star properties, but the formation mechanism of the layered structure of OCs remains unclear. Aims. We study the three-dimensional spatial distribution of 279 nearby OCs to understand the formation mechanism of the layered structure. Methods. We analyzed the spatial distribution of member stars within each OC and correlated the presence of a layered structure with the number of member stars. Additionally, we performd N-body simulations to model the evolution of OCSN 125. We assessd the correlation between the binary fraction, the most massive star, and the radius of the layered structure in each simulated OC. Results. Our analysis reveals that OCs with fewer member stars tend to lack a layered structure. The results from N-body simulations indicate that the presence of a layered structure is strongly influenced by dynamical factors, particularly the most massive star and the binary fraction. Massive stars drive mass loss through supernova explosions and stellar winds, which weaken the spatial layering. Furthermore, clusters with higher binary fractions exhibit a weaker layered structure, likely due to energy equipartition, dynamical friction, and perturbations caused by binary systems. These factors contribute to delaying core collapse and slowing the emergence of a layered structure. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that dynamical interactions, including the effects of the most massive stars and binary fraction, play a critical role in the formation and disruption of the layered structure in OCs.</description>

      <title>Propagation and transmission of Jupiter's internal waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations from the Juno spacecraft show that Jupiter has a large dilute core rather than a compact core. To investigate the effects of different core structures on wave propagation and transmission in Jupiter's interior, we consider three models: (1) an isentropic sphere, (2) an isentropic envelope with a rigid core, and (3) an isentropic envelope with a dilute core. We study the propagation and transmission of p modes (sound waves), g modes (gravity waves), r modes (inertial waves), and GIWs (gravito-inertial waves) by solving the linear equations of a compressible, self-gravitating, uniformly rotating polytropic model, fully taking into account the the effects of Coriolis force but neglecting centrifugal flattening. Our results show that energy flux is primarily carried by fast waves with higher frequencies whereas kinetic energy by slow waves with lower frequencies. Rotation has a greater effect on non-axisymmetric modes than on axisymmetric ones. In model 2, rigid core facilitates propagation of r modes. In model 3, rotation enhances the transmission of GIWs across the interface between the dilute core and the isentropic envelope, particularly at high latitudes. This suggests that Jupiter's internal structure may be inferred by detecting the oscillation signals in its polar regions.</description>

      <title>Neutron-Capture Element Signatures in Globular Clusters: Insights from the Gaia-ESO Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are key to understanding the formation and evolution of our Galaxy. While the abundances of light and Fe-peak elements in GCs have been widely studied, investigations into heavier, neutron-capture elements -- and their connection to multiple stellar populations and GC origins -- remain limited. In this work, we analysed the chemical abundances of neutron-capture elements in GCs to trace the Galactic halo and to explore possible links to the MP phenomenon. Our goal is to better constrain the nature of the polluters responsible for intracluster enrichment and to distinguish the origin of GCs through the chemical signature of neutron-capture elements. We examined 14 GCs from the Gaia-ESO Survey, spanning a wide metallicity range, [Fe/H] from -0.40 to -2.32, using a homogeneous methodology. We focused on the abundances of Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Pr, and Eu, derived from FLAMES-UVES spectra. These were compared with predictions from a stochastic Galactic chemical evolution model. With the exception of Zr, the model broadly reproduces the observed trends in neutron-capture elements. In some GCs, we found strong correlations between hot H-burning products (Na, Al) and s-process elements, pointing to a shared nucleosynthesis site, e.g., asymptotic giant branch stars of different masses and/or fast-rotating massive stars. We also detect a distinct difference in [Eu/Mg] ratio between in-situ ($\langle$[Eu/Mg]$\rangle$ = 0.14 dex) and ex-situ ($\langle$[Eu/Mg]$\langle$ = 0.32 dex) GCs, highlighting their different enrichment histories. Finally, on average, Type II GCs (NGC 362, NGC 1261, and NGC 1851) showed a s-process element spread ratio between second- and first-generations about twice as large as those seen in Type I clusters.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Shell Structure in the Primary Outflow from IRAS 15398-3359</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: IRAS 15398-3359, a Class 0 protostar in Lupus I star forming region, is associated with three generations of outflows. The primary outflow, i.e., the most recent one, shows internal structure named ``shell structure'' in the near infrared emission map. The shell structure is also seen in the emission lines of CO, H$_2$CO, and others species. We find a similar structure in an underexpanded jet produced in aerodynamics and other engineering applications. A high pressure gas ejected through a nozzle expands to form a supersonic flow. When the pressure of the ejected gas becomes lower than that of the ambient gas, the jet is compressed to form a shock wave. The shock heated gas expands again to form substructures along the jet. We examine the similarity between the primary outflow of IRAS 15398-3359 and industrial underexpanded jet and the possibility that the shell structure of the former is due to repeated expansion and compression in the direction perpendicular to the jet propagation.</description>

      <title>Modelling the multi-wavelength emission and polarisation signatures of the novel white-dwarf pulsar system AR Sco</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reclassification of AR Scorpii (AR Sco) from a delta Scuti variable star to a white dwarf binary system has initiated an in-depth exploration of this novel system. The main aim of this work was to develop a general emission code to concurrently model the emission maps, light curves, and spectra at various orbital phases for AR Sco. For the development of the emission code, I solved the general equations of motion with included classical radiation reaction forces (RRF) by implementing the Dormand-Prince 8(7) numerical integrator with adaptive time-step methods. This yielded improved accuracy and computational time vs. the commonly used Vay symplectic integrator, particularly for the high $B$-fields, $E_{\perp}$-fields, and RRF needed for pulsar and pulsar-like magnetospheres. Additionally, I demonstrated the novel result of the particles entering and conforming to the radiation reaction limit regime of Aristotelian Electrodynamics. As calibration for the radiation calculations, emission maps, and spectra I compared my model output with results from the code of the pulsar emission model of Harding and collaborators for a pulsar with $10\%$ the $B$-field strength of Vela and how my results converged to theirs. Next, I showed my exploratory modelling of the magnetic mirror scenario proposed for AR Sco. I demonstrate I could fit the observational spectral energy distribution including the recent \textit{NICER} pulsed X-ray spectrum well, constraining the white dwarf $B$-field to $B_{\rm S} = (2.5 - 3.0) \times 10^{8} \, \rm{G}$. Finally, I showed the effect the $B$-field, $E_{\perp}$-field, initial pitch angle, and initial particle Lorentz factor have on the mirror points, RRF, emission maps, and spectra. This demonstrates how crucial it is to include the general particle dynamics to accurately model the micro-physics present in magnetic mirror models.</description>

      <title>A Fast, Analytic Empirical Model of the Gaia Data Release 3 Astrometric Orbit Catalog Selection Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In June 2022, the Gaia mission released a catalog of astrometric orbital solutions for 168,065 binary systems, by far the largest such catalog to date. The catalog's selection function is difficult to characterize because of choices made in its construction. Understanding the catalog's selection function is required to model and interpret its contents. We use a combination of analytic and empirical prescriptions to construct a function that computes the probability that a binary with a given set of properties would have been published in the Gaia Data Release 3 astrometric orbit catalog. This is a complementary approach to the more accurate but significantly more computationally expensive approach of El-Badry et al. (2024). We also construct a binary population synthesis model to validate our characterization of the selection function, finding good agreement with the actual Gaia NSS catalog, with the exception of the orbital eccentricity distribution. The NSS catalog suggests high-eccentricity orbits are relatively uncommon at intermediate periods $100 \lesssim P_{orb} \lesssim 1000$ days. As an example application of the selection function, we estimate the Gaia DR3 detection probabilities of the star + BH binaries Gaia BH1 and BH2, and find them to be 0.38 and 0.27, respectively. Compared to the values obtained by detailed modeling in El-Badry et al. (2024), the probabilities are identical for BH1, and within a factor of 2 for BH2. We also estimate the population of Sun-like star + BH binaries in the Galaxy to be $\sim 3000$ for $100 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 400$ day, $&lt; 800$ for $400 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 1000$ day, and $&lt; 12,000$ for $1000 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 1500$ day.</description>

      <title>SN 2023ixf: interaction signatures in the spectrum at 445 days</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SN 2023ixf is one of the most neaby and brightest Type II supernovae (SNe) of the past decades. A rich set of pre-explosion data provided important insight on the properties of the progenitor star. There has been a wide range of estimated initial masses of 9 - 22 $M{_\odot}$. Early monitoring of the SN also showed the presence of a dense CSM structure near the star ($10^{15}$ cm) that was probably expelled in the last years prior to the explosion. These extended CSM structure can be further probed with late-time observations during the nebular phase. This study is based on a nebular spectrum obtained with GMOS at the Gemini North Telescope 445 days after explosion. The SN evolution is analyzed in comparison with a previous spectrum at an age of 259 days, and compared with those of similar SNe II and with synthetic radiation-transfer nebular spectra. The 445-d spectrum exhibits a dramatic evolution with clear signs of ejecta-CSM interaction. The H${\alpha}$ profile shows a complex profile that can be separated into a boxy component arising from the interaction with a CSM shell and a central peaked component that may be due to the radioactive-powered SN ejecta. The CSM shell would be located at a distance of $\approx10^{16}$ cm from the progenitor and it may be associated with mass loss occurring up until $\approx 500 - 1000$ years before the explosion. Similar interaction signatures have been detected in other SNe II, although for events with standard plateau durations this happened at times later than 600 - 700 days. SN 2023ixf appears to belong to a group of SNe II with short plateaus or linear light curves that develop interaction features before $\approx 500$ days. Other lines, such as those from [O I] and [Ca II] appear to be unaffected by the CSM interaction. This allowed us to estimate an initial progenitor mass, which resulted in the relatively low range of 10 - 15 $M{_\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Probing Solar Heavy Neutrinos with Heliospheric Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for an excess of electrons and positrons in the interplanetary space from the decays of heavy neutrinos produced in nuclear reactions in the Sun. Using measurements of the electron spectra in the MeV range from the Ulysses and SOHO satellites, we report the strongest direct upper bound to date on the mixing between heavy neutral leptons with MeV masses and electron neutrinos, reaching $U_e^2\simeq 10^{-6}$ at $M_N=10\,$MeV. Our sensitivity is predominantly constrained by the uncertainties in the propagation of electrons and positrons, particularly the diffusion coefficient in the inner Solar System, as well as the uncertainties in the astrophysical background. Enhancing our understanding of either of these factors could lead to a significant improvement in sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: The transport of energetic particles is intimately related to the properties of plasma turbulence, a ubiquitous dynamic process that transfers energy across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. However, the mechanisms governing the interactions between plasma turbulence and energetic particles remain incompletely understood. Here we present comprehensive observations from the upstream region of a quasi-perpendicular interplanetary (IP) shock on 2004 January 22, using data from four Cluster spacecraft to investigate the interplay between turbulence dynamics and energetic particle transport. Our observations reveal a transition in energetic proton fluxes from exponential to power-law decay with increasing distance from the IP shock. This result provides possible observational evidence of a shift in transport behavior from normal diffusion to superdiffusion. This transition correlates with an increase in the time ratio from $\tau_s/\tau_{c}&lt;1$ to $\tau_s/\tau_{c}\gg1$, where $\tau_s$ is the proton isotropization time, and $\tau_{c}$ is the turbulence correlation time. Additionally, the frequency-wavenumber distributions of magnetic energy in the power-law decay zone indicate that energetic particles excite linear Alfv\'en-like harmonic waves through gyroresonance, thereby modulating the original turbulence structure. These findings provide valuable insights for future studies on the propagation and acceleration of energetic particles in turbulent astrophysical and space plasma systems.</description>

      <title>The Effect of the Fast-Flavor Instability on Core-Collapse Supernova Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04896</link>

Abstract: Merging our supernova code F{\sc{ornax}} with the Box3D fast-flavor neutrino oscillation formalism, we explore the effects of fast-flavor conversion (FFC) in state-of-the-art 1D and 2D core-collapse supernova simulations. We find that after a few tens of milliseconds after bounce the FFC emerges just interior to and exterior to the stalled shock wave. It does not obtain in the PNS core nor near the average neutrinosphere radii. Interior to the shock, this results in a temporary change in the net neutrino heating rate of $\sim$10\%, due mostly to a hardening of the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ neutrino spectra, despite the decrease in their corresponding neutrino number fluxes. In 1D, the hydrodynamic effects are not large, with increases in the stalled shock radius by of order ten to twenty kilometers that abate within a few hundred milliseconds. In 2D, the hydrodynamic effect of the FFC is a bit more noticeable, resulting in slightly earlier explosions for models for lower-mass progenitors, but also potentially inhibiting explosions for some higher-mass progenitors. Fast-flavor conversion continues to operate at larger radii at later times. The net result is a shift upward in the $\nu_{\mu}$ energy and number luminosities and a shift downward in the same quantities for both the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ neutrinos. There seems to be a trend at very large radii and later times towards partial species and spectral equipartition. If this is true, it could be an interesting feature of supernova neutrino detection at later times in underground and under-ice facilities.</description>
