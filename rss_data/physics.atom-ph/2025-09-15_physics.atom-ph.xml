      <title>High-sensitivity molecular spectroscopy of SrOH using magneto-optical trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyatomic molecules are projected to be powerful tools in searches for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), including new CP-violating (CPV) interactions and ultralight dark matter (UDM) particles. Certain degrees of freedom present in polyatomic molecules enhance the sensitivity of these searches, as well as reject systematic errors, but necessitate extensive high-precision spectroscopy to identify pathways for optical cycling and quantum state readout. Here we show how a magneto-optical trap (MOT) can be used to locate weak optical transitions and identify rovibronic states for optical cycling and quantum control. We demonstrate this spectroscopic approach with strontium monohydroxide (SrOH), which is a candidate for both CPV and UDM searches. We identify two new repumping transitions in SrOH and implement them in a deeper optical cycle to achieve 32400(4700) trapped molecules, a 4.5-fold increase over the previous, shallower cycle. In addition, we determine the energy spacing between the $X^{2}\Sigma^{+}(200)$ and $X^{2}\Sigma^{+}(03^10)$ vibrational manifolds of SrOH, confirming the existence of numerous low-frequency rovibrational transitions that are sensitive to temporal variations of the proton-to-electron mass ratio, a predicted effect of the existence of UDM.</description>

      <title>A generalized independent atom model approach for net ionization of molecules by multiply-charged heavy-ion impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The previously applied independent atom model (IAM) for highly charged ion-molecule collisions which implemented the suppression of multiple ionization and capture on the basis of geometric overlaps of cross-sectional areas representing ion-atom cross sections using a pixel counting method (PCM), [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 101}, 062709 (2020)] is extended to incorporate the possibility of multiple collisions within the molecule. This is accomplished on the basis of estimated mean free paths for sequential projectile-atom collisions. The IAM-PCM was demonstrated to be successful in describing proton-molecule collisions, and moderately-charged ion impact at high collision energies. The new model does agree with these results, but has important consequences for highly charged projectiles providing larger cross sections than IAM-PCM, but still well below the simple additivity rule results.</description>

      <title>A novel method for measuring the Fermi velocity of elemental targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The right kind of theoretical treatment of direct Coulomb ionization of inner-shell of target atoms including multiple ionization of their outer-shells by using accurate x-ray fluorescence yield data and electron capture by projectile ions from inner-shell electrons of target atoms enables us to fully understand the complex physics issues with the heavy-ion-induced inner-shell ionization phenomenon. Such great success has only been achieved recently [Phys. Rev. A 111 (2025) 042827]. Aftermath, further investigations exhibit such a picture only if the Fermi velocity of the elemental target is accurate, as it takes a significant role in correct evaluation of charge-state distribution of the projectile ions inside the target, which contributes an invaluable share in calculating the electron capture-induced ionization cross section correctly. In this work, we devise a powerful method that enables us to measure the correct and accurate Fermi velocity for almost every elemental metal in the periodic table. As per our present knowledge, this in turn not only improves our understanding of the said complex physics issues one step ahead but also helps move toward further miniaturization of integrated circuits and use the heavy-ion-induced X-ray emission in impurity analysis more reliable and accurate.</description>

      <title>First operation of the FAMU experiment at the RIKEN-RAL high intensity muon beam facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FAMU experiment, supported and funded by the Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN) and by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), aims to perform the first measurement of the ground-state hyperfine splitting (1S-hfs) of muonic hydrogen ($\mu H$). This quantity is highly sensitive to the proton's Zemach radius $R_Z$. An experimental determination of $R_Z$ provides significant constraints on the parametrization of the proton form factors as well as on theoretical models describing the proton's electromagnetic structure. Following years of technological and methodological development, the FAMU experiment began operations in 2023 at Port 1 of the RIKEN-RAL muon beam line at the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source facility (Didcot, UK). In this paper, we first describe the unique detection technique employed by FAMU to determine the 1S-hfs of muonic hydrogen, followed by a detailed presentation of the final experimental layout. Finally, we report the first outcome from the 2023 commissioning run and from the initial physics runs performed in 2023 and 2024.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing in the presence of pulse errors and qubit leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using both simulation and experiment, we investigate the robustness of dynamical decoupling sequences to pulse errors: rotation errors and detuning errors. Whereas prior work examined the effect of errors on coherence times, here we show that quantum sensing can be affected by pulse errors in dramatically different ways than coherence times alone. We also explore the effects of qubit leakage: off-resonant coupling to other quantum levels. We find order-of-magnitude differences between commonly-used dynamical decoupling sequences in both their sensitivity to pulse errors and leakage.</description>

      <title>Theoretical characterisation of the barium II and radium II ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental advances, including the ongoing development of an optical atomic clock in singly ionised radium, we perform a detailed theoretical characterisation of Ra+ and its lighter analogue, Ba+. Both ions are of interest for precision studies, including for atomic parity violation and searches for new physics beyond the standard model. Using the all-orders correlation potential method, including Breit and radiative quantum electrodynamics corrections, we perform high-accuracy calculations of electric-dipole (E1), electric-quadrupole (E2), and magnetic-dipole (M1) transition matrix elements between the low-lying s, p, and d states of these ions, as well as the excited-state lifetimes, polarizabilities, magic wavelengths, and magnetic dipole (A) hyperfine structure constants. By combining lifetime measurements with precise theoretical ratios, we extract high-accuracy determinations of the s-d_1/2 and s-d_3/2 E2 matrix elements. By combining hyperfine measurements with atomic theory, we extract parameters of the nuclear magnetisation distribution (the Bohr-Weisskopf effect) for 135-, 137-Ba and 223-, 225-Ra. These results provide theoretical input for ongoing and future experimental programs in fundamental physics and precision metrology.</description>

      <title>Orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transform minima in molecular ionization probabilities into maxima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the tunneling regime and at sufficiently low field amplitudes, the shape of orientation-dependent molecular ionization rate curves usually resembles the shape of the ionized orbital. As the ionizing field strength increases, the shape of the ionization rate can deviate from this pattern. The oft-cited explanation is that the increasing contribution of excited states relative to the ground state modifies the distribution. In this paper, we show that orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, which are independent of excited-state effects, can also significantly modify the angular dependence of the yields of widely studied molecules where excited state effects are negligible. For example, we find that in CH$_3$Br, the interplay between orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transforms a local minimum in the orientation-dependent ionization rate to a local maximum as the ionizing field strength increases. To simulate orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, we use the one-electron weak-field asymptotic theory including the first-order correction (OE-WFAT(1)) in the integral representation. Since OE-WFAT(1) incurs expensive computations when the number of orientation angles is large, we also reformulate the original OE-WFAT(1) algorithm into a partial-wave expansion form, which greatly enhances the efficiency of the method.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered moire quasicrystal patterns of ultracold Bose gases in twisted bilayer optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of novel moir\'e quasicrystal patterns in Bose gases confined in twisted bilayer optical lattices via Floquet-engineered intralayer-atomic interactions. By introducing the density wave amplitude, we divide the dynamical evolution into four distinct stages and verify the pattern changes at each stage. The spatial symmetry of the patterns is closely linked to the modulation amplitudes and frequencies. Consequently, appropriately reducing the modulation frequency and increasing the amplitude facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Notably, a twelve-fold quasicrystal pattern emerges under specific parameters, closely resembling the moir\'e quasicrystal in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space distributions also exhibit high rotational symmetry, consistent with the real-space patterns at specific evolution times. The patterns exhibit remarkable sensitivity to the modulation frequency, suggesting potential applications of this strongly frequency-dependent pattern formation in quantum precision measurement. Our findings establish a new quantum platform for exploring quasicrystals and their symmetry properties in ultracold bosonic systems.</description>
