      <title>Degree Sequence of Albertson and $\sigma$-Indices on Trees of Order $n\geqslant 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08213v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we presented a study of topological indices on trees, where we show a relationship with irregularity of Albertson index and minimum, maximum degrees $\delta,\Delta$ of graph $G$, where contribute vital roles in determining connection, shading, component incorporation, and realisability where well-known Albertson index as: $\operatorname{irr}(G)=\sum_{uv\in E(G)}\lvert d_u(G)-d_v(G) \rvert$. The sigma index on trees that we introduced as $\sigma(T)=(d_1-1)^3+\sum_{i=1}^{3}(d_i-1)(d_i-2)+(d_3-1)^3$.</description>

      <title>On the spectra of prefix-reversal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study spectral properties of prefix-reversal graphs. These graphs are obtained by connecting two elements of $C_m\wr S_n$ via prefix reversals. If $m=1,2$, the corresponding prefix-reversal graphs are the classic pancake and burnt pancake graphs. If $m&gt;2$, then one can consider the directed and undirected versions of these graphs. We prove that the spectrum of the undirected prefix-reversal graph $\mathbb{P}_m(n)$ contains all even integers in the interval $[0,2n]\setminus\{2\lfloor n/2\rfloor\}$ and if $m\equiv0\pmod4$, we then show that the spectrum contains all even integers in $[0,2n]$. In the directed case, we show that the spectrum of the directed prefix-reversal graph $P(m,n)$ contains all integers in the interval $[0,n]\setminus\{\lfloor n/2\rfloor\}$. As a consequence, we show that in either case, the prefix-reversal graphs have a small spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Enumerating several statistics of r-Colored Dyck paths with no dd-steps having the same colors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $r$-colored Dyck path is a Dyck path with all $\mathbf{d}$-steps having one of $r$ colors in $[r]=\{1, 2, \dots, r\}$. In this paper, we consider several statistics on the set $\mathcal{A}_{n,0}^{(r)}$ of $r$-colored Dyck paths of length $2n$ with no two consecutive $\mathbf{d}$-steps having the same colors. Precisely, the paper studies the statistics ``number of points" at level $\ell$, ``number of $\mathbf{u}$-steps" at level $\ell+1$, ``number of peaks" at level $\ell+1$ and ``number of $\mathbf{udu}$-steps" on the set $\mathcal{A}_{n,0}^{(r)}$. The counting formulas of the first three statistics are established by Riordan arrays related to $S(a,b; x)$, the weighted generating function of $(a,b)$-Schr\"{o}der paths. By a useful and surprising relations satisfied by $S(a,b; x)$, several identities related to these counting formulas are also described.</description>

      <title>A decomposition of Grassmannian associated with a hyperplane arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Grassmannian, which is the manifold of all $k$-dimensional subspaces in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, was decomposed through three equivalent methods connecting combinatorial geometries, Schubert cells and convex polyhedra by Gelfand, Goresky, MacPherson and Serganova. Recently, Liang, Wang and Zhao discovered a novel decomposition of the Grassmannian via an essential hyperplane arrangement, which generalizes the first two methods. However, their work was confined to essential hyperplane arrangements. Motivated by their research, we extend their results to a general hyperplane arrangement $\mathcal{A}$, and demonstrate that the $\mathcal{A}$-matroid, the $\mathcal{A}$-adjoint and the refined $\mathcal{A}$-Schubert decompositions of the Grassmannian are consistent. As a byproduct, we provide a classification for $k$-restrictions of $\mathcal{A}$ related to all $k$-subspaces through two equivalent methods: the $\mathcal{A}$-matroid decomposition and the $\mathcal{A}$-adjoint decomposition.</description>

      <title>On the maximal matchings of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An independent edge set of graph $G$ is a matching, and is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other matching of $G$. The number of all the maximal matchings of $G$ is denoted by $\Psi(G)$. In this paper, an algorithm to count $\Psi(T)$ for a tree $T$ is given. We show that for any tree $T$ with $n$ vertices, $\Psi(T)\geq\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$, and the tree which obtained the lower bound is characterized.</description>

      <title>The number of maximal matchings in polygon rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A matching of graph $G$ is maximal if it cannot be expanded by adding any edge to create a larger matching. In this paper, for a hexagonal ring $H$ with $n$ hexagons, we show that the number of maximal matchings of $H$ equals to the trace of the product of $n$ matrices, each of which is $S$, $L$, or $R$ according to the type of the connection mode of $H$. Finally, we extend this conclusion to arbitrary polygon rings and provide an algorithm to determine the transition matrices of polygon chains (rings).</description>

      <title>A note on two cycles of consecutive even lengths in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bondy and Vince proved that a graph of minimum degree at least three contains two cycles whose lengths differ by one or two, which was conjectured by Erd\H{o}s. Gao, Li, Ma and Xie gave an average degree counterpart of Bondy-Vince's result, stating that every $n$-vertex graph with at least $\frac{5}{2}(n-1)$ edges contains two cycles of consecutive even lengths, unless $4|(n-1)$ and every block of $G$ is a clique $K_5$. This confirms the case $k=2$ of Verstra\"ete's conjecture, which states that every $n$-vertex graph without $k$ cycles of consecutive even lengths has edge number $e(G)\leq\frac{1}{2}(2k+1)(n-1)$, with equality if and only if every block of $G$ is a clique of order $2k+1$. Sudakov and Verstra\"{e}te further conjectured that if $G$ is a graph with maximum number of edges that does not contain $k$ cycles of consecutive even lengths, then every block of $G$ is a clique of order at most $2k+1$. In this paper, we prove the case $k=2$ for Sudakov-Verstra\"{e}te's conjecture, by extending the results of Gao, Li, Ma and Xie.</description>

      <title>Infinite induced-saturated graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $H$-induced-saturated if $G$ is $H$-free but deleting any edge or adding any edge creates an induced copy of $H$. There are various graphs $H$, such as $P_4$, for which no finite $H$-induced-saturated graph $G$ exists. We show that for every finite graph $H$ that is not a clique or stable set, there always exists a countable $H$-induced-saturated graph. In fact, a stronger property can be achieved: there is an $H$-free graph $G$ such that $G'$ contains a copy of $H$ whenever $G'\neq G$ is obtained from $G$ by deleting and adding edges so that only a finite number of changes have been made incident to any vertex.</description>

      <title>Excluding an induced wheel minor in graphs without large induced stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a conjecture due to Dallard, Krnc, Kwon, Milani\v{c}, Munaro, \v{S}torgel, and Wiederrecht stating that for any positive integer $d$ and any planar graph $H$, the class of all $K_{1,d}$-free graphs without $H$ as an induced minor has bounded tree-independence number. A $k$-wheel is the graph obtained from a cycle of length $k$ by adding a vertex adjacent to all vertices of the cycle. We show that the conjecture of Dallard et al. is true when $H$ is a $k$-wheel for any $k\geq 3$. Our proof uses a generalization of the concept of brambles to tree-independence number. As a consequence of our main result, several important $\mathsf{NP}$-hard problems such as Maximum Independent Set are tractable on $K_{1,d}$-free graphs without large induced wheel minors. Moreover, for fixed $d$ and $k$, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a $K_{1,d}$-free graph $G$ as input, finds an induced minor model of a $k$-wheel in $G$ if one exists.</description>

      <title>The connection between the chromatic function and the Redei-Berge function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a natural way to assign both graph and digraph to every poset. Furthermore, any graph has its chromatic function, while any digraph has its Redei-Berge function. On the level of posets, these two functions are almost identical. Here, we prove that this connection is actually a reflection of the connection between the noncommutative generalizations of these two functions. The simplicity of this relationship enables us to easily translate the properties proved for one of them to the case of the other. We perform such conversions regarding distinguishability, decomposition techniques and positivity questions. Among others, we obtain the converse of Redei's theorem, generalization of the triple deletion property and expressions for these functions in some special cases.</description>

      <title>Preorders on maximal chains: hyperplane arrangements, Cambrian lattices, and maximal green sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study preorders on (equivalence classes of) maximal chains in the general context of polygonal lattices endowed with suitably nice edge labellings. We show that, given a quotient of polygonal lattices, such edge labellings descend to the quotient, and that there is an induced order-preserving surjective map on the preordered sets of equivalence classes of maximal chains. Under a natural condition ensuring that the domain is a poset, the map is a contraction of preordered sets. We apply this to lattices of regions of simplicial hyperplane arrangements, where the preorders are partial orders, in particular to finite Coxeter arrangements. For the latter, each choice of Coxeter element gives us a different partial order on the set of equivalence classes of maximal chains; these generalise certain reoriented higher Bruhat orders in dimension two. The maps of posets of maximal chains induced by Cambrian congruences generalise the map of Kapranov and Voevodsky from the higher Bruhat orders to the higher Stasheff--Tamari orders in dimension two. While the fibres of this map are known not always to be intervals, our results show that they are always connected. We show that, in the case of Cambrian lattices, the induced maps on maximal chains have nice descriptions in terms of orientations of rank-two root subsystems, in a way which resembles taking the stable objects of a Rudakov stability condition. We finally consider the algebraic realisation of the weak order and Cambrian lattices via torsion-free classes of preprojective and path algebras, relating the posets of maximal chains to our earlier work on maximal green sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zagreb index of a hypergraph is defined as the sum of the squares of the degrees of its vertices. A connected $k$-uniform hypergraph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges is called bicyclic if $n=m(k-1)-1$. In this paper, we determine the hypergraphs with the maximum and minimum Zagreb indices among all linear bicyclic uniform hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Factorizations in Hecke algebras I: long cycle factorizations and Jucys-Murphy elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a permutation, there is a well-developed literature studying the number of ways one can factor it into a product of other permutations subject to certain conditions. We initiate the analogous theory for the type A Iwahori-Hecke algebra by generalizing the notion of factorization in terms of the Jucys-Murphy elements. Some of the oldest and most foundational factorization results for the symmetric groups pertain to the long cycle. Our main results give q-deformations of these long cycle factorizations and reveal q-binomial, q-Catalan, and q-Narayana numbers along the way.</description>

      <title>Flagged LLT polynomials, nonsymmetric plethysm, and nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plethystic transformation $f[X] \mapsto f[X/(1-t)]$ and LLT polynomials are central to the theory of symmetric Macdonald polynomials. In this work, we introduce and study nonsymmetric flagged LLT polynomials. We show that these admit both an algebraic and a combinatorial description, that they Weyl symmetrize to the usual symmetric LLT polynomials, and we conjecture that they expand positively in terms of Demazure atoms. Additionally, we construct a nonsymmetric plethysm operator $\Pi_{t,x}$ on $\mathfrak{K}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, which serves as an analogue of $f[X] \mapsto f[X/(1-t)]$. We prove that $\Pi_{t,x}$ remarkably maps flagged LLT polynomials defined over a signed alphabet to ones over an unsigned alphabet.
  Our main application of this theory is to formulate a nonsymmetric version of Macdonald positivity, similar in spirit to conjectures of Knop and Lapointe, but with several new features. To do this, we recast the Haglund-Haiman-Loehr formula for nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials $\mathcal{E}_{\mu }(x;q,t)$ as a positive sum of signed flagged LLT polynomials. Then, after taking a suitable stable limit of both $\mathcal{E}_{\mu }(x;q,t)$ and $\Pi_{t,x}$, we obtain modified nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials which are positive sums of flagged LLT polynomials and thus are conjecturally atom positive, strengthening the Macdonald positivity conjecture.</description>

      <title>Induced rational exponents and bipartite subgraphs in $K_{s, s}$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a general phenomenon that many extremal results for bipartite graphs can be transferred to the induced setting when the host graph is $K_{s, s}$-free. As manifestations of this phenomenon, we prove that every rational $\frac{a}{b} \in (1, 2), \, a, b \in \mathbb{N}_+$, can be achieved as Tur\'{a}n exponent of a family of at most $2^a$ induced forbidden bipartite graphs, extending a result of Bukh and Conlon [JEMS 2018]. Our forbidden family is a subfamily of theirs which is substantially smaller. A key ingredient, which is yet another instance of this phenomenon, is supersaturation results for induced trees and cycles in $K_{s, s}$-free graphs. We also provide new evidence to a recent conjecture of Hunter, Milojevi\'{c}, Sudakov, and Tomon [JCTB 2025] by proving optimal bounds for the maximum size of $K_{s, s}$-free graphs without an induced copy of theta graphs or prism graphs, whose Tur\'{a}n exponents were determined by Conlon [BLMS 2019] and by Gao, Janzer, Liu, and Xu [IJM 2025+].</description>

      <title>Treewidth of Outer $k$-Planar Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Treewidth is an important structural graph parameter that quantifies how closely a graph resembles a tree-like structure. It has applications in many algorithmic and combinatorial problems. In this paper, we study treewidth of outer $k$-planar graphs - graphs admitting a convex drawing where all vertices lie on a circle and each edge crosses at most $k$ other edges. We also consider a more general class of outer min-$k$-planar graphs, which are graphs admitting a convex drawing where for every crossing of two edges at least one of these edges is crossed at most $k$ times.
  Firman, Gutowski, Kryven, Okada and Wolff [GD 2024] proved that every outer $k$-planar graph has treewidth at most $1.5k+2$ and provided a lower bound of $k+2$ for even $k$. We establish a lower bound of $1.5k+0.5$ for every odd $k$. Additionally, they showed that every outer min-$k$-planar graph has treewidth at most $3k+1$. We improve this upper bound to $3 \cdot \lfloor 0.5k \rfloor+4$.
  Our approach also allows us to upper bound the separation number, a parameter closely related to treewidth, of outer min-$k$-planar graphs by $2 \cdot \lfloor 0.5k \rfloor+4$. This improves the previous bound of $2k+1$ and achieves a bound with an optimal multiplicative constant.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations for Markovian Graphon Processes and Associated Dynamical Systems on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider temporal models of rapidly changing Markovian networks modulated by time-evolving spatially dependent kernels that define rates for edge formation and dissolution. Alternatively, these can be viewed as Markovian networks with $O(1)$ jump rates viewed over a long time horizon. In the regimes we consider, the window averages of graphon valued processes over suitable time intervals are natural state descriptors for the system. Under appropriate conditions on the jump-rate kernels, we establish laws of large numbers and large deviation principles(LDP) for the graphon processes averaged over a suitable time window, both in the weak topology and with respect to the cut norm in the associated graphon space. Although the problem setting and analysis are more involved than for the well-studied static random network model, the variational problem associated with the rate function admits an explicit solution, yielding an equally tractable, though different, expression for the rate function, similar to the static case. Using these results, we then establish the LDP for node-valent dynamical systems driven by the underlying evolving network.</description>

      <title>A Refined Algorithm For the EPR model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen~(EPR) model is an analogous model of the anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg model or the equivalent quantum maximum-cut problem, proposed by R. King two years ago. Adjacent qubits in the model prefer symmetric EPR/Bell parings rather than the antisymmetric one, in order to maximize the energy. Recently, two groups independently develop specific algorithms for the highest-energy state with approximation ratio $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{4}\approx.809$, based on maximum fractional matchings. Here we try to refine one of the two algorithms by devising homogeneous/quasi-homogeneous fractional matchings, with the aim to distribute quantum entanglement as much as possible. For regular graphs $G_d$, we immediately obtain increasing approximation ratios $r_d$ with $r_2=\frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{6}\approx.872$. For irregular graphs, we show such a refinement could still guarantee nice performance if the fractional matchings are chosen properly.</description>

      <title>k-Planar and Fan-Crossing Drawings and Transductions of Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-way connection between FO transductions (logical transformations) of planar graphs, and a certain variant of fan-crossing (fan-planar) drawings of graphs which for bounded-degree graphs essentially reduces to being k-planar for fixed k. For graph classes, this connection allows to derive non-transducibility results from nonexistence of the said drawings and, conversely, from nonexistence of a transduction to derive nonexistence of the said drawings. For example, the class of 3D-grids is not k-planar for any fixed k. We hope that this connection will help to draw a path to a possible proof that not all toroidal graphs are transducible from planar graphs.
  Our characterization can be extended to any fixed surface instead of the plane. The result is based on a very recent characterization of weakly sparse FO transductions of classes of bounded expansion by [Gajarsk\'y, G{\l}adkowski, Jedelsk\'y, Pilipczuk and Toru\'nczyk, arXiv:2505.15655].</description>

      <title>Metaconcepts of rooted tree balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measures of tree balance play an important role in many different research areas such as mathematical phylogenetics or theoretical computer science. Typically, tree balance is quantified by a single number which is assigned to the tree by a balance or imbalance index, of which several exist in the literature. Most of these indices are based on structural aspects of tree shape, such as clade sizes or leaf depths. For instance, indices like the Sackin index, total cophenetic index, and $\widehat{s}$-shape statistic all quantify tree balance through clade sizes, albeit with different definitions and properties.
  In this paper, we formalize the idea that many tree (im)balance indices are functions of similar underlying tree shape characteristics by introducing metaconcepts of tree balance. A metaconcept is a function $\Phi_f$ that depends on a function $f$ capturing some aspect of tree shape, such as balance values, clade sizes, or leaf depths. These metaconcepts encompass existing indices but also provide new means of measuring tree balance. The versatility and generality of metaconcepts allow for the systematic study of entire families of (im)balance indices, providing deeper insights that extend beyond index-by-index analysis.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Tur\'an exponent for $1$-subdivisions of graphs that are neither bipartite nor complete. Specifically, we establish an upper bound on the Tur\'an number of the 1-subdivision of $K_{s,t}^+$, where $K_{s,t}^+$ is obtained by adding a single edge within the part of size $s$ of the complete bipartite graph $K_{s,t}$, with $4\leq s \leq t$. In addition, we derive an upper bound for the extremal number of a family of graphs formed by (possibly degenerate) 1-subdivisions of certain tripartite graphs.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Ramsey Theorem for Ordered Hypergraph Matchings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove essentially sharp bounds for Ramsey numbers of ordered hypergraph matchings, inroduced recently by Dudek, Grytczuk, and Ruci\'{n}ski. Namely, for any $r \ge 2$ and $n \ge 2$, we show that any collection $\mathcal H$ of $n$ pairwise disjoint subsets in $\mathbb Z$ of size $r$ contains a subcollection of size $\lfloor n^{1/(2^r-1)}/2\rfloor$ in which every pair of sets are in the same relative position with respect to the linear ordering on $\mathbb Z$. This improves previous bounds of Dudek-Grytczuk-Ruci\'nski and of Anastos-Jin-Kwan-Sudakov and is sharp up to a factor of $2$. For large $r$, we even obtain such a subcollection of size $\lfloor (1-o(1))\cdot n^{1/(2^r-1)}\rfloor$, which is asymptotically tight (here, the $o(1)$-term tends to zero as $r \to \infty$, regardless of the value of $n$). Furthermore, we prove a multiparameter extension of this result where one wants to find a clique of prescribed size $m_P$ for each relative position pattern $P$. Our bound is sharp for all choices of parameters $m_P$, up to a constant factor depending on $r$ only. This answers questions of Anastos-Jin-Kwan-Sudakov and of Dudek-Grytczuk-Ruci\'nski.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Euclidean Ramsey Theory usually we are looking for monochromatic configurations in the Euclidean space, whose points are colored with a fixed number of colors. In the canonical version, the number of colors is arbitrary, and we are looking for an `unavoidable' set of colorings of a finite configuration, that is a set of colorings with the property that one of them always appears in any coloring of the space. This set definitely includes the monochromatic and the rainbow colorings. In the present paper, we prove the following two results of this type. First, for any acute triangle $T$, and any coloring of $\mathbb{R}^3$, there is either a monochromatic or a rainbow copy of $T$. Second, for every $m$, there exists a sufficiently large $n$ such that in any coloring of $\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists either a monochromatic or a rainbow $m$-dimensional unit hypercube. In the maximum norm, $\ell_{\infty}$, we have a much stronger statement. For every finite $M$, there exits an $n$ such that in any coloring of $\mathbb{R}_\infty^n$, there is either a monochromatic or a rainbow isometric copy of $M$.</description>

Abstract: Upper bounds on the minimum Lee distance of codes that are linear over ${\mathbb Z}_q$, $q=p^t$, $p$ prime are discussed. The bounds are Singleton like, depending on the length, rank, and alphabet size of the code. Codes meeting such bounds are referred to as Maximum Lee Distance with respect to Rank (MLDR) Codes. We present some new bounds on MLDR codes, using combinatorial arguments. In the context of MLDR codes, our work provides improvements over existing bounds in the literature</description>

      <title>Lassos: Pushing Tree Decompositions Forward Along Homomorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15184v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is folklore that tree-width is monotone under taking subgraphs (i.e. injective graph homomorphisms) and contractions (certain kinds of surjective graph homomorphisms). However, although tree-width is obviously not monotone under any surjective graph homomorphism, it is not clear whether contractions are canonically the only class of surjections with respect to which it is monotone. Under the requirement that the decomposition shape must be preserved, we prove that this is indeed the case.
  Our results provide a framework for answering questions of this sort for many other kinds of combinatorial data structures (such as directed multigraphs, hypergraphs, Petri nets, circular port graphs, half-edge graphs, databases, simplicial sets etc.) for which natural analogues of tree decompositions can be defined. Furthermore and of independent interest, we prove these results by introducing the notion of a lasso, a generalization of contractions of graphs to arbitrary categories with pushouts of monomorphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tackle three optimization problems in which a colored graph, where each node is assigned a color, must be partitioned into colorful connected components. A component is defined as colorful if each color appears at most once. The problems differ in the objective function, which determines which partition is the best one. These problems have applications in community detection, cybersecurity, and bioinformatics. We present integer non-linear formulations, which are then linearized using standard techniques. To solve these formulations, we develop exact branch-and-cut algorithms, embedding various improving techniques, such as valid inequalities, bounds limiting the number of variables, and warm-start and preprocessing techniques. Extensive computational tests on benchmark instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedures. The branch-and-cut algorithms can solve reasonably sized instances efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an exact algorithm for solving these problems.</description>

      <title>Stabilities of the Kleitman diameter theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of subsets of $[n]$. The diameter of $\mathcal{F}$ is the maximum size of symmetric differences among pairs of its members. Resolving a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s, Kleitman determined the maximum size of a family with fixed diameter, which states that a family with diameter $s$ has cardinality at most that of a Hamming ball of radius $s/2$. Specifically, if $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^{[n]}$ is a family with diameter $s$, then for $s=2d$, $|\mathcal{F}|\le \sum_{i=0}^d {n \choose i}$; for $s=2d+1$, $|\mathcal{F}|\le \sum_{i=0}^d {n \choose i} + {n-1 \choose d}$. This result is known as the Kleitman diameter theorem, which generalizes both the Katona union theorem and the Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado theorem. In 2017, Frankl provided a complete characterization of the extremal families of Kleitman's theorem and provided a stability result. In this paper, we determine the extremal families of Frankl's theorem and establish a further stability result of Kleitman's theorem. This solves a recent problem proposed by Li and Wu. Our findings constitute the second stability for the Kleitman diameter theorem.</description>

Abstract: We study two kinds of generalizations of symmetric block designs to higher dimensions, the so-called $\mathcal{C}$-cubes and $\mathcal{P}$-cubes. For small parameters, all examples up to equivalence are determined by computer calculations. Known properties of automorphisms of symmetric designs are extended to autotopies of $\mathcal{P}$-cubes, while counterexamples are found for $\mathcal{C}$-cubes. An algorithm for the classification of $\mathcal{P}$-cubes with prescribed autotopy groups is developed and used to construct more examples. A bound on the dimension of difference sets for $\mathcal{P}$-cubes is proved and shown to be tight in elementary abelian groups. The construction is generalized to arbitrary groups by introducing regular sets of (anti)automorphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tangram is a word in which every letter occurs an even number of times. Thus it can be cut into parts that can be arranged into two identical words. The \emph{cut number} of a tangram is the minimum number of required cuts in this process. Tangrams with cut number one corresponds to squares. For $k\ge1$, let $t(k)$ denote the minimum size of an alphabet over which an infinite word avoids tangrams with cut number at most~$k$. The existence of infinite ternary square-free words shows that $t(1)=t(2)=3$. We show that $t(3)=t(4)=4$, answering a question from D\k{e}bski, Grytczuk, Pawlik, Przyby\l{}o, and \'Sleszy\'nska-Nowak.</description>

Abstract: Freeness of multiarrangements is extremely important in the study of freeness of hyperplane arrangements. In particular, the exponents of 2-multiarrangement play an important role in freeness of 3-arrangement. However, it is not easy to compute exponents in general. Wakamiko (2007) determined bases and the exponents for multiarrangements of three lines over a field of characteristic zero. In this paper, we study the exponents of multiarrangements of three lines for the case of positive characteristic. We provide an effective algorithm for computing the exponents. Furthermore, we prove that the multiplicity lattice has plenty of symmetries. We also discuss the validity of bases constructed from binomial expansions in the case of positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>Counting (skew-)reciprocal Littlewood polynomials with square discriminant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Littlewood polynomial is a single-variable polynomial all of whose coefficients lie in $\{ \pm 1\}$. We establish the leading term asymptotics of the number of reciprocal or skew-reciprocal Littlewood polynomials with square discriminant. This relates to a bounded-height analogue of the Van der Waerden conjecture on Galois groups of random polynomials. As a byproduct, we establish the asymptotics of certain Gaussian-weighted counts of Pythagorean triples.</description>

      <title>A complete characterization of pairs of binary phylogenetic trees with identical $A_k$-alignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees play a key role in the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships. Typically, they are derived from aligned sequence data (like DNA, RNA, or proteins) by using optimization criteria like, e.g., maximum parsimony (MP). It is believed that the latter is able to reconstruct the \enquote{true} tree, i.e., the tree that generated the data, whenever the number of substitutions required to explain the data with that tree is relatively small compared to the size of the tree (measured in the number $n$ of leaves of the tree, which represent the species under investigation). However, reconstructing the correct tree from any alignment first and foremost requires the given alignment to perform differently on the \enquote{correct} tree than on others.
  A special type of alignments, namely so-called $A_k$-alignments, has gained considerable interest in recent literature. These alignments consist of all binary characters (\enquote{sites}) which require precisely $k$ substitutions on a given tree. It has been found that whenever $k$ is small enough (in comparison to $n$), $A_k$-alignments uniquely characterize the trees that generated them. However, recent literature has left a significant gap between $n\leq 2k+2$ -- namely the cases in which no such characterization is possible -- and $n\geq 4k$ -- namely the cases in which this characterization works. It is the main aim of the present manuscript to close this gap, i.e., to present a full characterization of all pairs of trees that share the same $A_k$-alignment. In particular, we show that indeed every binary phylogenetic tree with $n$ leaves is uniquely defined by its $A_k$-alignments if $n\geq 2k+3$. By closing said gap, we also ensure that our result is optimal.</description>

      <title>Twisted Fusion Products and Quantum Twisted $Q$-Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a complete characterization of the space of matrix elements dual to the graded multiplicity space arising from fusion products of Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules over special twisted current algebras defined by Kus and Venkatesh, which generalizes the result of Ardonne and Kedem to the special twisted current algebras. We also prove the conjectural identity of $q$-graded fermionic sums by Hatayama et al. for the special twisted current algebras, from which we deduce that the graded tensor product multiplicities of the fusion products of Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules over special twisted current algebras are both given by the $q$-graded fermionic sums, and constant term evaluations of products of solutions of the quantum twisted $Q$-systems obtained by Di Francesco and Kedem.</description>

      <title>Emergence of network communities driven by local rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17042v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks with nodes and links. Often the nodes are segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here, by means of numerical simulations, I show that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_ \kappa$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. Using the stochastic block model and Infomap methods for community detection, I show that networks generated by local rules have finite $r_ \kappa$ values while their randomized versions do not have emergent communities. I conjecture that network communities are an emergent property of networks evolving with local rules.</description>
