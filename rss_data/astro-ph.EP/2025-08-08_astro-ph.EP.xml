      <title>In-Situ Formation of the Cold Classical Kuiper Belt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold Classical Kuiper belt objects (CCKBOs) are considered first-generation planetesimals that formed 42-47 au from the Sun and remained untouched since. Formation is thought to proceed by clumping of dust particles in protoplanetary disk gas by the streaming instability, followed by gravitational collapse. Previous calculations along these lines are inconsistent with the CCKB's supposedly pristine nature, because they assume orders of magnitude more solid mass than is actually present in the CCKB (a few thousandths of an Earth mass) and do not explain how to expel the &gt;99% extra mass. Here we show from 3D numerical simulations of dust and gas that the total mass in CCKBOs, their characteristic sizes of ~100 km, and the preponderance of prograde binaries can all be reproduced at the tail end of the solar nebula's life, when it contained just 2-5% of its original (minimum-mass) gas. As a solar metallicity's worth of mm-sized solids drains out from 42-47 au from nebular headwinds, about 1% of the dust collapses into planetesimals that remain behind in the CCKB region. Binarity is guaranteed from a simple analytic estimate, confirmed numerically, of the spin angular momentum in clumps seeded by the streaming instability. We show that other formation scenarios, including trapping of dust within a gas pressure bump, fail to reproduce the low-mass CCKB. Outstanding problems are identified.</description>

      <title>Flares on TRAPPIST-1 reveal the spectrum of magnetic features on its surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TRAPPIST-1 is an M8 dwarf hosting seven known exoplanets and is currently one of the most frequently observed targets of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). However, it is notoriously active, and its surface is believed to be covered by magnetic features that contaminate the planetary transmission spectra. The radiative spectra of these magnetic features are needed to clean transmission spectra, but they currently remain unknown. Here, we develop a new approach for measuring these spectra using time-resolved JWST/NIRISS observations. We detect a persistent post-flare enhancement in the spectral flux of TRAPPIST-1. Our analysis rules out lingering flare decay as the cause of the flux enhancement and, thus, points to structural changes on the stellar surface induced by flares. We suggest that the flaring event triggers the disappearance of (part of) a dark magnetic feature, producing a net brightening. This suggestion is motivated by solar data: flare-induced disappearance of magnetic features on the solar surface has been directly detected in high spatial resolution images, and our analysis shows that this process produces changes in solar brightness very similar to those we observe on TRAPPIST-1. The proposed explanation for the flux enhancement enables, to our knowledge, the first measurement of the spectrum of a magnetic feature on an M8 dwarf. Our analysis indicates that the disappearing magnetic feature is cooler than the TRAPPIST-1 photosphere, but by at most a few hundred kelvins.</description>

      <title>Detection of New Auroral Emissions at Io and Implications for Its Interaction with the Plasma Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed Io's optical aurora in eclipse on six nights between 2022 and 2024 using Keck I/HIRES. Spectra revealed 13 new auroral emissions not identified previously, tripling the total number of optical emissions lines detected at Io. These included the O I lines at 777.4 and 844.6 nm, the Na I lines at 818.3 and 819.5 nm, the [S I] lines at 458.9 and 772.5 nm, the S I triplet at 922.3 nm, the [O II] lines at 732.0 and 733.0 nm and the [S II] lines at 406.9, 407.6, 671.6 and 673.1 nm. We leveraged these new detections by comparing with imaging data from the 2001 Cassini flyby to better understand the distribution of atmospheric species and their contribution to the observed auroral brightnesses. Our auroral emission model showed that the observed 557.7, 777.4 and 844.6 nm oxygen emission line brightnesses could be explained by excitation by electron impact of canonical 5 eV torus electrons on an atmosphere composed of O, SO2 and an isoelectronic proxy for SO. The SO2 emission did not decrease immediately after eclipse ingress, suggesting the emitting column may be restricted to higher altitudes. The derived O/SO2 mixing ratio was typically about 10%, but it also exhibited order-of-magnitude variance during some observations. Io's 630.0 nm [O I] brightness did not strongly vary with plasma sheet distance, suggesting electron flux at Io varies substantially beyond model predictions.</description>

      <title>Leading &amp; Trailing Spiral Arms in a Nearly Broken Protoplanetary Disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to investigate the formation of spiral arms in misaligned circumbinary discs. In a nearly broken disc the misaligned inner and outer discs interact at two nodes, launching leading spiral arms that do not rotate with the disc. These spirals vanish when the disc is fully broken or aligned. Our results show that the formation of leading spirals is driven by the relative misalignment of the inner and outer disc, and does not depend on the disc physics. With live radiative transfer, the shadows cast by the misaligned inner disc are also able to launch trailing spiral arms that only appear at high misalignments when the discs are disconnected. When the disc is strongly misaligned, leading and trailing spiral arms can both appear and interact with each other. At lower misalignments, the impact of shadows is negligible and leading spiral arms are seen instead. The presence of both leading and trailing spiral arms implies that the rotation of the disc cannot be assumed based on the orientation of the spiral arms alone. Unlike spirals formed by gravitational instability, the spirals in this work can also form in low-mass, gravitationally stable discs.</description>

      <title>Supervised Machine Learning Methods with Uncertainty Quantification for Exoplanet Atmospheric Retrievals from Transmission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard Bayesian retrievals for exoplanet atmospheric parameters from transmission spectroscopy, while well understood and widely used, are generally computationally expensive. In the era of the JWST and other upcoming observatories, machine learning approaches have emerged as viable alternatives that are both efficient and robust. In this paper we present a systematic study of several existing machine learning regression techniques and compare their performance for retrieving exoplanet atmospheric parameters from transmission spectra. We benchmark the performance of the different algorithms on the accuracy, precision, and speed. The regression methods tested here include partial least squares (PLS), support vector machines (SVM), k nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), voting (VOTE), stacking (STACK), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). We also investigate the impact of different preprocessing methods of the training data on the model performance. We quantify the model uncertainties across the entire dynamical range of planetary parameters. The best performing combination of ML model and preprocessing scheme is validated on a the case study of JWST observation of WASP-39b.</description>

      <title>Coupled 1D Chemical Kinetic-Transport and 2D Hydrodynamic Modeling Supports a modest 1-1.5x Supersolar Oxygen Abundance in Jupiter's Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the deep atmospheric composition of Jupiter provides critical constraints on its formation and the chemical evolution of the solar nebula. In this study, we combine one-dimensional thermochemical kinetic-transport modeling with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to constrain Jupiter's deep oxygen abundance using carbon monoxide (CO) as a proxy tracer. Leveraging a comprehensive chemical network generated by Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG), we assess the impact of updated reaction rates, including the often-neglected but thermochemically significant Hidaka reaction (CH3OH + H -&gt; CH3 + H2O). Our 1D-2D coupled approach supports a modest supersolar oxygen enrichment of 1.0-1.5x the solar value. We also present a method for deriving Jupiter's eddy diffusion coefficient Kzz = 3e6 to 5e7 cm2/s) from 2D hydrodynamic simulations using the quasi steady-state approach. This method is applicable to exoplanet atmospheres, where Kzz remains highly uncertain despite its strong influence on atmospheric chemistry. Finally, our results imply a significantly elevated planetary carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio of ~2.9, highlighting the importance of clarifying the mechanisms behind the preferential accretion of carbon-rich material during Jupiter's formation. By integrating thermochemical and hydrodynamic processes, our study offers a more complete framework for constraining chemical and dynamical processes in (exo)planetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Gas Giant and Brown Dwarf Companions: Mass Ratio and Orbital Distributions From A stars to M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding demographic properties of planet populations and multiple star systems constrains theories of planet and star formation. Surveys for very low-mass companions to M-A type stars detect brown dwarfs from multiple star formation and planets from circumstellar disks. We fit a composite model describing both very low-mass brown dwarf companions from "multiple-like processes" and gas giants from "planet-like processes" as functions of orbital separation and host star mass. We assemble a database of companion frequency estimates for masses from $&lt; 1$ to $&gt; 75$ Jupiter masses, separations from $&lt; 0.3$ to $&gt; 300$ AU, and host masses from $&lt; 0.3$ to $&gt; 2 M_{\odot}$. Using multinest, we fit these data to various models, performing model selection and deriving probability density functions. We assume companion mass ratio distributions are independent of orbital separation and fit a common log-normal orbital distribution to gas giant populations around M dwarfs, FGK, and A stars. A six-parameter model based on companion mass ratio distributions for planets and brown dwarfs is preferred. The planet CMRD slope is consistent with previous studies ($dN/dq \sim q^{-1.3} \pm 0.03$). Gas giant planets around stars from $&lt; 0.3$ to $&gt; 2.0 M_{\odot}$ follow a log-normal distribution peaking at ln(a) = 1.30 $\pm$ 0.03 (3.8 AU) with dispersion 0.22 $\pm$ 0.04. M dwarf distributions peak at smaller orbital radii than A stars, consistent with iceline considerations. Brown dwarf companion distributions extend stellar binary patterns, with the brown dwarf desert explained by flat-in-q mass functions and limited mass ratios below 0.1.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic lapse rate estimation using a van der Waals-type equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a family of temperature-dependent van der Waals-type equations of state (EOS) to improve the estimation of the adiabatic lapse rate in planetary atmospheres. These EOS generalize the classical van der Waals and Berthelot models by introducing a single parameter that modulates the temperature dependence of intermolecular interactions. We analyze their thermodynamic properties, including critical behavior, spinodal and coexistence curves, and entropy. The adiabatic curves are computed by incorporating explicitly the contribution of molecular vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom. Using a generalized expression for the adiabatic lapse rate, we estimate the adiabatic lapse rate in the troposphere of Titan and Venus. Our results show that the van der Waals-type EOS reproduce observed lapse rates more accurately than the van der Waals EOS.</description>

      <title>LiDO: Discovery of a 10:1 Resonator with a Novel Libration State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large inclination Distant Objects LiDO survey has discovered the first securely classified object in the 10:1 mean motion resonance of Neptune. This object, 2020 VN40, is short-term stable in the 10:1 resonance, but not stable on Gyr timescales. 2020 VN40 is likely part of the scattering sticking population, and temporarily resides in the 10:1 resonance at ~139.5 au. This discovery confirms that this distant resonance is populated, as a single detection is likely to be indicative of a large population that is difficult to detect due to observational biases. This object has an inclination of 33.4 degrees, and n-body integrations of orbital clones of 2020 VN40 have revealed some unexpected evolutions. While clones of 2020 VN40 show resonant libration around the expected resonance centers of approximately 90, 180, and 270 degrees, for a restricted range of inclination and eccentricity values some clones librate around a resonant argument of 0 degrees. As this occurs for the slightly lower-eccentricity portions of the evolution, this behavior can also be quite stable. Our initial exploration suggests that this libration around a center of 0 degrees is a generic effect for highly inclined objects in n:1 resonances because the nature of their resonant interaction with Neptune becomes a strong function of their argument of pericenter, omega. At large inclination, the resonant islands shift as omega precesses, switching the center of symmetric libration to 0 degrees for omega=90 degrees and omega=270 degrees. 2020 VN40 provides interesting insight into the evolution of the large-inclination resonators, which become more common at increasing semi-major axis.</description>

      <title>Nascent chemical complexity in prestellar core IRAS 16293E: complex organics and deuterated methanol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prestellar cores represent early sites of low-mass ($M$ $\leq$ few M$_\odot$) star and planet formation and provide insight into initial chemical conditions of complex organic molecules (COMs). Deuterated COMs trace the degree of molecular inheritance and/or reprocessing, as high deuteration in protostellar systems suggests COMs forming during the prestellar stage when deuteration is enhanced. Within the L1689N molecular cloud, the prestellar core IRAS 16293E sits $90^{"}$ eastward of the chemically-rich IRAS 16293-2422 A and B protostellar system. A unique view of star formation inside a common natal cloud, IRAS 16293A, B, and E all show some of the highest levels of deuteration in the ISM, with a number of D/H ratios $10^{5}$ times higher than Solar. We investigate for the first time the deuteration levels of the simplest COM, methanol (CH$_3$OH), in IRAS 16293E. Using the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 12 m telescope, we target favorable transitions of CH$_2$DOH, CHD$_2$OH, $^{13}$CH$_3$OH, and several higher complexity COMs (including acetaldehyde, CH$_3$CHO, methyl formate, HCOOCH$_3$, and dimethyl ether, CH$_3$OCH$_3$) in the 3 mm band. Follow-up observations with the Yebes 40 m telescope provided additional transitions in the 7 mm (Q-band). We report the first detections of these COMs and deuterated methanol in prestellar core IRAS 16293E and use our observations to calculate excitation temperatures, column densities, and relative abundance ratios. Striking similarities are found between relative molecular ratios and D/H values when comparing IRAS 16293E to the A and B protostars, as well as to a heterogeneous sample of other prestellar cores, protostars, and the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Our results support the idea that there is a limited amount of chemical reprocessing of COMs when prestellar cores collapse and heat-up during the protostellar phase.</description>

      <title>MINDS. Cha H{\alpha} 1, a brown dwarf with a hydrocarbon-rich disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Recent JWST observations have shown that brown dwarfs (BD) are chemically rich, offering valuable insights into giant planet formation. Aims. As part of the MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS) JWST guaranteed time program, we aim to characterize the gas and dust composition of the disk around the brown dwarf [NC98] Cha HA 1, hereafter Cha H$\alpha$ 1, in the mid-infrared. Methods. We obtain data from the MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) from 4.9 to 28$\mu$m. We use the dust fitting tool DuCK to investigate the dust composition and grain sizes while we identify and fit molecular emission using slab models. Results. Compared with disks around very low mass stars, clear silicate emission features are seen in this BD disk. In addition, JWST reveals a plethora of hydrocarbons, including C$_2$H$_2$, $^{13}$CCH$_2$, CH$_3$, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_4$, C$_4$H$_2$, C$_3$H$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, and C$_6$H$_6$ which suggest a disk with a gas C/O &gt; 1. Additionally, we detect CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, HCN, H$_2$, and H$_2$O. CO and OH are absent from the spectrum. The dust is dominated by large $\sim$4 $\mu$m size amorphous silicates (MgSiO$_3$). We infer a small dust mass fraction ($&gt;$10$\%$) of 5 $\mu$m size crystalline forsterite. We do not detect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Conclusions. Cha H$\alpha$ 1 shows the most diverse chemistry seen to date in a BD protoplanetary disk, consisting of a strong dust feature, 12 carbon-bearing molecules plus H$_2$, and water. The diverse molecular environment offers a unique opportunity to test our understanding of BD disks chemistry and how it affects the possible planets forming in them.</description>

      <title>The Multiband Imaging Survey for High-Alpha PlanetS (MISHAPS) I: Preliminary Constraints on the Occurrence Rate of Hot Jupiters in 47 Tucanae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first generation of transiting planet searches in globular clusters yielded no detections, and in hindsight, only placed occurrence rate limits slightly higher than the measured occurrence rate in the higher-metallicity Galactic thick disk. To improve these limits, we present the first results of a new wide field search for transiting hot Jupiters in the globular cluster 47~Tucanae. We have observed 47~Tuc as part of the Multiband Imaging Survey for High-Alpha Planets (MISHAPS). Using 24 partial and full nights of observations taken with the Dark Energy Camera on the 4-m Blanco telescope at CTIO, we perform a search on 19,930 stars in the outer regions of the cluster. Though we find no clear planet detections, by combining our result with the upper limit enabled by Gilliland et al.'s 2000 Hubble search for planets around an independent sample of 34,091 stars in the inner cluster, we place the strongest limit to date on hot Jupiters with periods of $0.8 \leq P \leq 8.3$ days and $0.5~R_{\rm Jup} \leq R_{\rm P} \leq 2.0~R_{\rm Jup}$ of $f_{\rm HJ} &lt; 0.11\%$, a factor of ${\sim}$4 below the occurrence rate in the \textit{Kepler} field. Our search found 35 transiting planet candidates, though we are ultimately able to rule out each without follow-up observations. We also found 4 eclipsing binaries, including 3 previously-uncataloged detached eclipsing binary stars.</description>

      <title>Linear Thermal Instability of a Condensing Gas-Particle Mixture, with Possible Application to Chondrites and Planetesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stability of a hot saturated gas coexisting with condensed particles in an optically thin medium. Such a situation may obtain downstream of a shock, at condensation fronts, or in vaporizing impacts. We show that the gas-particle mixture is subject to a thermal instability whereby a region of lower temperature and higher condensate density cools faster to condense faster. If the region of runaway condensation has a sound-crossing time shorter than its cooling time, then it accretes more mass, in gas and particles, from its higher pressure surroundings. Numerical integration of the linearized perturbation equations demonstrates that this radiation-condensation instability can create particle clumps and voids out of a secularly cooling gas. Provided radiation can escape to cool particle overdensities, thermal instability can help assemble chondrite parent bodies out of the vaporized debris of asteroid collisions, and form planetesimals generally.</description>

      <title>The Kinematic Age of 3I/ATLAS and its Implications for Early Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of the third interstellar object (3I/ATLAS) expands the known census from two to three and significantly improves statistical inferences regarding the underlying galactic population. In this paper, we argue that cometary activity likely significantly contributes to 3I/ATLAS's brightness, since the nuclear size inferred when assuming an asteroidal reflectance implies an untenable interstellar object mass per star. 3I/ATLAS exhibits a high excess velocity of $v_\infty=58$ km/s relative to the Sun, which implies that 3I/ATLAS is relatively old in comparison to previous interstellar objects. Here, we calculate the posterior distribution of ages implied by the kinematics of the interstellar objects and find that 3I/ATLAS is likely $\sim3-11$ Gyr old, assuming that the interstellar object and stellar age-velocity dispersion relations are equivalent. We also calculate the distribution of host star metallicities and find that 3I/ATLAS has a 12% chance of originating from a star with $\text{[Fe/H]}\leq-0.4$. These results show that interstellar object formation is likely efficient at low metallicities and early in the history of the Galaxy. Finally, we estimate the interstellar object formation rate throughout Galactic history implied by these three objects. As future interstellar objects are discovered, the framework presented here can be applied to further refine this calculation. Comparison between the interstellar object and stellar formation histories will provide unique insights into the history of stellar system formation in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Spectral Characteristics of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS from SOAR Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs) provide unique insights into the building blocks and conditions of extrasolar planetary systems. The newly discovered object, 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1), represents the third known ISO after 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. We present initial spectroscopic characterizations of 3I using observations from the Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph on the 4.1 m SOAR Telescope in Chile during the night of July 3rd. The reflectance spectrum of 3I, covering 3700-7000{\AA} reveals a red continuum, comparable to extreme trans-Neptunian objects, with a weak UV-optical turnover indicative of complex carbonaceous and irradiated organics. At the time of observation, when 3I was at a heliocentric distance of 4.4 AU, we detected no discernible gas emission from canonical cometary species (CN, C$_3$, C$_2$, CO$^+$, [OI]). This is in agreement with expectations from our thermal-evolution model, which indicates sublimation-driven activity should commence once 3I/ATLAS approaches smaller heliocentric distances. Nonetheless, the paradoxical situation of early onset coma without evidence of sublimation tracers calls for other dust-liberating mechanisms that ancient ISOs may be subjected to at large heliocentric distances.</description>

      <title>Hubble Space Telescope Observations of the Interstellar Interloper 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high angular resolution observations of the third known interstellar interloper, 3I/ATLAS, from the Hubble Space Telescope. The object is clearly active at 3.8 au pre-perihelion, showing dust emitted from the hot Sun-facing side of the nucleus and a weak, radiation pressure swept tail away from the Sun. We apply a simple model to estimate the mass loss rate in dust as dM/dt = 6 sqrt(a) kg/s, where a is the mean particle size in microns. With 1 &lt; a &lt; 100, we infer dM/dt = 6 to 60 kg/s. A fit to the surface brightness distribution of the inner coma limits the effective radius of the nucleus to be r &lt; 2.8 km, assuming red geometric albedo 0.04. Conversely, the nucleus cannot be smaller than 0.16 km in radius if its coma is supplied by sublimation of carbon monoxide, and must be larger if a less volatile molecule drives the mass loss.</description>

      <title>Attitude Determination and Control of GPS Satellites: Stabilization, Orbital Insertion, and Operational Control Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites are essential for providing accurate navigation and timing information worldwide. Operating in medium Earth orbit (MEO), these satellites must maintain precise Earth-pointing attitudes to transmit signals effectively. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the operational dynamics, attitude determination and control systems (ADCS), and orbital insertion techniques for GPS satellites. We explore the integration of sensors and actuators, control algorithms, stabilization strategies, and the launch procedures required to deploy these satellites. Key equations related to orbital mechanics and attitude control are discussed, and references to recent technical literature are included.</description>
