      <title>Poincar\'e duality for loop spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.13161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Rabinowitz Floer homology and cohomology carry the structure of a graded Frobenius algebra for both closed and open strings. We prove a Poincar\'e duality theorem between homology and cohomology that preserves this structure. This lifts to a duality theorem between graded open-closed TQFTs. We use in a systematic way the formalism of Tate vector spaces.
  Specializing to the case of cotangent bundles, we define Rabinowitz loop homology and cohomology and explain from a unified perspective pairs of dual results that have been observed over the years in the context of the search for closed geodesics. These concern critical levels, relations to the based loop space, manifolds all of whose geodesics are closed, Bott index iteration, and level-potency. Moreover, the graded Frobenius algebra structure gives meaning and proof to a relation conjectured by Sullivan between the loop product and coproduct.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.07590v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a variant of contact homology for convex open contact manifolds. As an application, we prove the existence of (in fact, infinitely many) exotic tight contact structures on $\mathbb{R}^{2n-1}$ for all $n&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic discs of negative Maslov index and extended deformations in mirror symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SYZ approach to mirror symmetry for log Calabi-Yau manifolds starts from a Lagrangian torus fibration on the complement of an anticanonical divisor. A mirror space is constructed by gluing local charts (moduli spaces of local systems on generic torus fibers) via wall-crossing transformations which account for corrections to the analytic structure of moduli spaces of objects of the Fukaya category induced by bubbling of Maslov index 0 holomorphic discs, and made into a Landau-Ginzburg model by equipping it with a regular function (the superpotential) which enumerates Maslov index 2 holomorphic discs.
  When they occur, holomorphic discs of negative Maslov index deform this picture by introducing inconsistencies in the wall-crossing transformations, so that the mirror is no longer an analytic space; the geometric features of the corrected mirror can be understood in the language of extended deformations of Landau-Ginzburg models. We illustrate this phenomenon (and show that it actually occurs) by working through the construction for an explicit example (a log Calabi-Yau 4-fold obtained by blowing up a toric variety), and discuss a family Floer approach to the geometry of the corrected mirror in this setting. Along the way, we introduce a Morse-theoretic model for family Floer theory which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A universal characterization of the curved homotopy Lie and associative operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the category of nonsymmetric dg operads valued in strict graded-mixed complexes, equipped with a distinguished arity zero weight one element which generates the weight grading, and whose differential has weight one. We show that the initial object is the curved A-infinity operad, that the forgetful functor to the category of operads under it admits a right adjoint, and that the unit of the adjunction encodes the operation of twisting a curved A-infinity algebra by a Maurer-Cartan element.
  The corresponding notions for symmetric operads characterize the curved L-infinity operad and the corresponding twisting procedure.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Anosov flows on hyperbolic L-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ there is a hyperbolic L-space with $n$ pseudo-Anosov flows, no two of which are orbit equivalent. These flows have no perfect fits and are thus quasigeodesic. In addition, our flows admit positive Birkhoff sections, which we argue implies that they give rise to $n$ universally tight contact structures whose lifts to any finite cover are non-contactomorphic. This argument involves cylindrical contact homology together with the work of Barthelm\'e, Frankel, and Mann on the reconstruction of pseudo-Anosov flows from their closed orbits. These results answer more general versions of questions posed by Calegari and by Min and Nonino.</description>

      <title>Spencer-Riemann-Roch Theory: Mirror Symmetry of Hodge Decompositions and Characteristic Classes in Constrained Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of mirror symmetry in compatible pair Spencer complex theory brings new theoretical tools to the study of constrained geometry. Inspired by classical Spencer theory and modern Hodge theory, this paper establishes Spencer-Riemann-Roch theory in the context of constrained geometry, systematically studying the mirror symmetry of Spencer-Hodge decompositions and their manifestations in algebraic geometry. We utilize Serre's GAGA principle to algebraic geometrize Spencer complexes, establish coherent sheaf formulations, and reveal the topological essence of mirror symmetry through characteristic class theory. Main results include: Riemann-Roch type Euler characteristic computation formulas for Spencer complexes, equivalence theorems for mirror symmetry of Hodge decompositions at the characteristic class level, and verification of these theories in concrete geometric constructions. Research shows that algebraic geometric methods can not only reproduce deep results from differential geometry, but also reveal the intrinsic structure of mirror symmetry in constrained geometry through characteristic class analysis, opening new directions for applications of Spencer theory in constrained geometry.</description>
