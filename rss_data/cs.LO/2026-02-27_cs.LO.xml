      <title>Complete Robust Hybrid Systems Reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces robust differential dynamic logic (a fragment of differential dynamic logic) to specify and reason about robust hybrid systems. Practically meaningful syntactic restrictions naturally ensure that definable properties are topologically open and thus by construction robust with respect to infinitesimal perturbations, without explicit quantitative margins of error in the syntax or in proofs.
  The main result is a proof of absolute completeness of robust differential dynamic logic for reachability properties of general hybrid systems. This is the first absolute completeness proof for hybrid systems with exact semantics. The proof is constructive, self-contained, and demonstrates how robustly correct hybrid systems reachability specifications can be automatically verified through proof.</description>

      <title>Verification of Unbounded Client-Server Systems with Distinguishable Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Client-server systems are a computing paradigm in concurrent and distributed systems. We deal with unbounded client-server systems (UCS) where all clients are of the same type, interact with a single server and they may enter and exit the system dynamically. At any point in time, the number of clients is bounded, but their exact number is unknown and dynamic. To model these systems, simple Petri nets are not directly usable, so we use unbounded $\nu$-nets. Owing to the distinguishability of clients in UCS, it is not straightforward to express their properties in LTL or CTL. To address this, we propose the logic $\mathsf{FOTL_1}$, a monodic fragment of Monadic First Order Temporal Logic (MFOTL). In this work, we provide the SMT encodings of $\nu$-nets and $\mathsf{FOTL_1}$ to do Bounded Model Checking (BMC). We also build an accompanying open source tool to perform BMC of UCS.</description>

      <title>Effectful Toposes and Their Lawvere-Tierney Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces effectful toposes as an extension of the effective topos and investigates their structure relative to Lawvere-Tierney topologies. First, we formulate effectful toposes by lifting the evidenced frame, which is a recently proposed model for effectful computation. Next, we define Lawvere-Tierney topologies on effectful toposes and characterize the sheaves on them. In the effective topos, Lawvere-Tierney topologies are known to correspond to computational oracles. Finally, to demonstrate that our result contributes to the connection between realizability relativized by oracles and effects, we show that the sheaf topos for the double negation topology is isomorphic to the effectful topos with the Continuation-Passing-Style effect; these toposes serve as a model of classical realizability.</description>

      <title>Reliable XAI Explanations in Sudden Cardiac Death Prediction for Chagas Cardiomyopathy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is unpredictable, and its prediction in Chagas cardiomyopathy (CC) remains a significant challenge, especially in patients not classified as high risk. While AI and machine learning models improve risk stratification, their adoption is hindered by a lack of transparency, as they are often perceived as \textit{black boxes} with unclear decision-making processes. Some approaches apply heuristic explanations without correctness guarantees, leading to mistakes in the decision-making process. To address this, we apply a logic-based explainability method with correctness guarantees to the problem of SCD prediction in CC. This explainability method, applied to an AI classifier with over 95\% accuracy and recall, demonstrated strong predictive performance and 100\% explanation fidelity. When compared to state-of-the-art heuristic methods, it showed superior consistency and robustness. This approach enhances clinical trust, facilitates the integration of AI-driven tools into practice, and promotes large-scale deployment, particularly in endemic regions where it is most needed.</description>

      <title>Layered Monoidal Theories II: Fibrational Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered monoidal theories provide a categorical framework for studying scientific theories at different levels of abstraction, via string diagrammatic algebra. We introduce models for three closely related classes of layered monoidal theories: fibrational, opfibrational and deflational theories. We prove soundness and completeness of these theories for the respective models. Our work reveals connections between layered monoidal theories and well-known categorical structures such as Grothendieck fibrations and displayed categories.</description>

      <title>TorchLean: Formalizing Neural Networks in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly deployed in safety- and mission-critical pipelines, yet many verification and analysis results are produced outside the programming environment that defines and runs the model. This separation creates a semantic gap between the executed network and the analyzed artifact, so guarantees can hinge on implicit conventions such as operator semantics, tensor layouts, preprocessing, and floating-point corner cases. We introduce TorchLean, a framework in the Lean 4 theorem prover that treats learned models as first-class mathematical objects with a single, precise semantics shared by execution and verification. TorchLean unifies (1) a PyTorch-style verified API with eager and compiled modes that lower to a shared op-tagged SSA/DAG computation-graph IR, (2) explicit Float32 semantics via an executable IEEE-754 binary32 kernel and proof-relevant rounding models, and (3) verification via IBP and CROWN/LiRPA-style bound propagation with certificate checking. We validate TorchLean end-to-end on certified robustness, physics-informed residual bounds for PINNs, and Lyapunov-style neural controller verification, alongside mechanized theoretical results including a universal approximation theorem. These results demonstrate a semantics-first infrastructure for fully formal, end-to-end verification of learning-enabled systems.</description>

      <title>Array-Carrying Symbolic Execution for Function Contract Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Function contract generation is a classical problem in program analysis that targets the automated analysis of functions in a program with multiple procedures. The problem is fundamental in inter-procedural analysis where properties of functions are first obtained via the generation of function contracts and then the generated contracts are used as building blocks to analyze the whole program. Typical objectives in function contract generation include pre-/post-conditions and assigns information (that specifies the modification information over program variables and memory segments during function execution). In programs with array manipulations, a crucial point in function contract generation is the treatment of array segments that imposes challenges in inferring invariants and assigns information over such segments. To address this challenge, we propose a novel symbolic execution framework that carries invariants and assigns information over contiguous segments of arrays. We implement our framework as a prototype within LLVM, and further integrate our prototype with the ACSL assertion format and the Frama-C software verification platform. Experimental evaluation over a variety of benchmarks from the literature and functions from realistic libraries shows that our framework is capable of handling array manipulating functions that indeed involve the carry of array information and are beyond existing approaches.</description>

      <title>The logic of KM belief update is contained in the logic of AGM belief revision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each axiom of KM belief update we provide a corresponding axiom in a modal logic containing three modal operators: a unimodal belief operator $B$, a bimodal conditional operator $&gt;$ and the unimodal necessity operator $\square$. We then compare the resulting logic to the similar logic obtained from converting the AGM axioms of belief revision into modal axioms and show that the latter contains the former. Denoting the latter by $\mathcal L_{AGM}$ and the former by $\mathcal L_{KM}$ we show that every axiom of $\mathcal L_{KM}$ is a theorem of $\mathcal L_{AGM}$. Thus AGM belief revision can be seen as a special case of KM belief update. For the strong version of KM belief update we show that the difference between $\mathcal L_{KM}$ and $\mathcal L_{AGM}$ can be narrowed down to a single axiom, which deals exclusively with unsurprising information, that is, with formulas that were not initially disbelieved.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary-arity Tree Automata and QCTL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18799v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of automata (which we coin EU-automata) running on infininte trees of arbitrary (finite) arity. We develop and study several algorithms to perform classical operations (union, intersection, complement, projection, alternation removal) for those automata, and precisely characterise their complexities. We also develop algorithms for solving membership and emptiness for the languages of trees accepted by EU-automata.
  We then use EU-automata to obtain several algorithmic and expressiveness results for the temporal logic QCTL (which extends CTL with quantification over atomic propositions) and for MSO. On the one hand, we obtain decision procedures with optimal complexity for QCTL satisfiability and model checking; on the other hand, we obtain an algorithm for translating any QCTL formula with k quantifier alternations to formulas with at most one quantifier alternation, at the expense of a $(k + 1)$-exponential blow-up in the size of the formulas. Using the same techniques, we prove that any MSO formula can be translated into a formula with at most four quantifier alternations (and only one second-order-quantifier alternation), this time with a $(k + 2)$-exponential blow-up in the size of the formula.</description>

Abstract: We initiate the study of the complexity-theoretic properties of convex logics in team semantics. We focus on the extension of classical propositional logic with the nonemptiness atom NE, a logic known to be both convex and union closed. We show that the satisfiability problem for this logic is NP-complete, that its validity problem is coNP-complete, and that its model-checking problem is in P.</description>

      <title>LeanCat: A Benchmark Suite for Formal Category Theory in Lean (Part I: 1-Categories)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in formal theorem proving, current benchmarks fail to adequately measure library-grounded abstraction -- the ability to reason with high-level interfaces and reusable structures central to modern mathematics and software engineering. We introduce LeanCat, a challenging benchmark comprising 100 fully formalized category-theory tasks in Lean. Unlike algebra or arithmetic, category theory serves as a rigorous stress test for structural, interface-level reasoning. Our evaluation reveals a severe abstraction gap: the best state-of-the-art model solves only 12.0% of tasks at pass@4, with performance collapsing from 55.0% on Easy tasks to 0.0% on High-difficulty tasks, highlighting a failure in compositional generalization. To overcome this, we evaluate LeanBridge, a retrieval-augmented agent that employs a retrieve-generate-verify loop. LeanBridge achieves a peak success rate of 24.0% -- doubling the performance of the best static baseline. These results empirically demonstrate that iterative refinement and dynamic library retrieval are not merely optimizations but strict necessities for neuro-symbolic reasoning in abstract domains. LeanCat offers a compact, reusable testbed for tracking progress toward reliable, research-level formalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming that no family of polynomial-size Boolean circuits can factorize a constant fraction of all products of two $n$-bit primes, we show that the bounded arithmetic theory $\text{PV}_1$, even when augmented by the sharply bounded choice scheme $BB(\Sigma^b_0)$, cannot prove that every number has some prime divisor. By the completeness theorem, it follows that under this assumption there is a model $M$ of $\text{PV}_1$ that contains a nonstandard number $m$ which has no prime factorization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16014v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Pudlak-Buss style Prover-Adversary games to characterise proof systems reasoning over deterministic branching programs (BPs) and non-deterministic branching programs (NBPs). Our starting points are the proof systems eLDT and eLNDT, for BPs and NBPs respectively, previously introduced by Buss, Das and Knop. We prove polynomial equivalences between these proof systems and the corresponding games we introduce. This crucially requires access to a form of negation of branching programs which, for NBPs, requires us to formalise a non-uniform version of the Immerman-Szelepcsenyi theorem that coNL = NL. Thanks to the techniques developed, we further obtain a proof complexity theoretic version of Immerman-Szelepcsenyi, showing that eLNDT is polynomially equivalent to systems over boundedly alternating branching programs.</description>

      <title>Generalised M\"obius Categories and Convolution Kleene Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convolution algebras on maps from structures such as monoids, groups or categories into semirings, rings or fields abound in mathematics and the sciences. Of special interest in computing are convolution algebras based on variants of Kleene algebras, which are additively idempotent semirings equipped with a Kleene star. Yet an obstacle to the construction of convolution Kleene algebras on a wide class of structures has so far been the definition of a suitable star. We show that a generalisation of M\"obius categories combined with a generalisation of a classical definition of a star for formal power series allow such a construction. We discuss several instances of this construction on generalised M\"obius categories: convolution Kleene algebras with tests, modal convolution Kleene algebras, concurrent convolution Kleene algebras and higher convolution Kleene algebras (e.g. on strict higher categories and higher relational monoids). These are relevant to the verification of weighted and probabilistic sequential and concurrent programs, using quantitative Hoare logics or predicate transformer algebras, as well as for algebraic reasoning in higher-dimensional rewriting. We also adapt the convolution Kleene algebra construction to Conway semirings, which is widely studied in the context of weighted automata. Finally, we compare the convolution Kleene algebra construction with a previous construction of convolution quantales and present concrete example structures in preparation for future applications.</description>

      <title>Approaching the Continuous from the Discrete: an Infinite Tensor Product Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Increasingly in recent years, probabilistic computation has been investigated through the lenses of categorical algebra, especially via string diagrammatic calculi. Whereas categories of discrete and Gaussian probabilistic processes have been thoroughly studied, with various axiomatisation results, more expressive classes of continuous probability are less understood, because of the intrinsic difficulty of describing infinite behaviour by algebraic means.
  In this work, we establish a universal construction that adjoins infinite tensor products, allowing continuous probability to be investigated from discrete settings. Our main result applies this construction to $\mathsf{FinStoch}$, the category of finite sets and stochastic matrices, obtaining a category of locally constant Markov kernels, where the objects are finite sets plus the Cantor space $2^{\mathbb{N}}$. Any probability measure on the reals can be reasoned about in this category. Furthermore, we show how to lift axiomatisation results through the infinite tensor product construction. This way we obtain an axiomatic presentation of continuous probability over countable powers of $2=\lbrace 0,1\rbrace$.</description>

      <title>A Reversible Semantics for Janus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Janus is a paradigmatic example of a reversible programming language. Indeed, Janus programs can be executed backwards as well as forwards. However, its current small-step semantics (useful, e.g., for debugging or as a basis for extensions with concurrency primitives) is not reversible, since it loses information while computing forwards. E.g., it does not satisfy the Loop Lemma, stating that any reduction has an inverse, a main property of reversibility in process calculi, where a small-step semantics is commonly used. We present here a novel small-step semantics which is actually reversible, while remaining equivalent to the previous one. It involves the non-trivial challenge of defining a semantics based on a "program counter" for a high-level programming language.</description>
