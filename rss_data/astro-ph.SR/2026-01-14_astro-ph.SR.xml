      <title>A persistent bow shock in a diskless magnetised accreting white dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar bow shocks are formed when an outflow interacts with the interstellar medium. In white dwarfs accreting from a binary companion, outflows are associated with either strong winds from the donor star, the accretion disk, or a thermonuclear runaway explosion on the white dwarf surface. To date, only six accreting white dwarfs are known to harbour disk-wind driven bow shocks that are not associated to thermonuclear explosions. Here, we report the discovery of a bow shock associated with a high-proper-motion disk-less accreting white dwarf, 1RXS J052832.5+283824. We show that the white dwarf has a strong magnetic field in the range B~42-45 MG, making RXJ0528+2838 the a bonafide known polar-type cataclysmic variable harbouring a bow shock. The resolved bow shock is shown to be inconsistent with a past thermonuclear explosion, or being inflated by a donor wind, ruling out all accepted scenarios for inflating a bow shock around this system. Modelling of the energetics reveals that the observed bow shock requires a persistent power source with a luminosity significantly exceeding the system accretion energy output. This implies the presence of a powerful, previously unrecognized energy loss mechanism - potentially tied to magnetic activity - that may operate over sufficiently long timescales to influence the course of binary evolution.</description>

      <title>An eclipsing 8.56 minute orbital period mass-transferring binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of ATLAS J101342.5-451646.8 (hereafter ATLAS J1013-4516), an eclipsing, mass-transferring AM Canum Venaticorum binary with an 8.56-minute orbital period, identified via periodic variability in light curves from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System survey of Gaia white dwarf candidates. Follow-up spectroscopy with the Large Lenslet Array Magellan Spectrograph reveals a helium-dominated accretion disk, while high-speed photometry with ULTRACAM shows pronounced primary and secondary eclipses. We construct a decade-long timing baseline using data from ATLAS, Gaia, ULTRACAM on the Gran Telescopio Canarias, and the proto-Lightspeed instrument on the Magellan Clay telescope. From this baseline, we measure an orbital period derivative of dP/dt = -1.60 +/- 0.07 x 10^-12 seconds per second. Interpreted in the context of stable mass transfer, the magnitude and sign of the period derivative indicate that the orbital evolution is governed by the interplay between gravitational-wave-driven angular momentum losses and mass transfer, directly probing the donor star's structural response to mass loss. Assuming angular momentum loss dominated by gravitational wave emission, we constrain the component masses and infer the characteristic gravitational wave strain of the system for future space-based observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. We predict a characteristic strain corresponding to a four-year signal-to-noise ratio greater than approximately 20, establishing ATLAS J1013-4516 as a strong prospective source for probing long-term orbital evolution in the mass-transferring regime.</description>

      <title>Stellar Rotation in the First Six Million Years: Rotational Velocities and Radii Estimates of T Tauri Stars in IC 5070 and IC 348</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have acquired high-resolution optical spectroscopy for a sample of T Tauri stars (TTSs) in open clusters using Hydra on the WIYN 3.5m telescope, and present projected rotational velocities (v sin i values) for 54 stars in IC 5070 and 99 stars in IC 348. We combine these with published values for stellar temperature, luminosity, rotation period, circumstellar disk status, and binarity; we are predominantly interested in how the last two factors may affect the rotation speeds of the stars. We find evidence to support theories that interaction with circumstellar disks may slow the rotation of TTSs compared to Class III stars in both clusters. We also identify a higher fraction of slow-rotating Class III stars in IC 348 compared to other clusters; we suggest that some fraction of these may be stars that recently lost their disks. We find that a higher fraction of binary stars are rapid rotators compared to single stars, though not to a statistically significant degree. We also combine our v sin i measurements with rotation periods to estimate projected stellar radii, which we compare to predictions from stellar evolution models using a maximum likelihood method. We continue to show that models with increasing starspot coverage reduce radius inflation and align better with published age estimates than models without starspots.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Year-Long Radial Velocity Variations in Red Clump Region -- I: Comprehensive analysis of a K0 Giant star, 2 Draconis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slow-rotating evolved stars frequently exhibit radial velocity (RV) variations on annual timescales, complicated by instrumental systematics and aliasing in the one-year regime. Here we investigate the origin of the near-yearly periodicity in 2 Dra, a star located in the red-clump region, assessing possible causes between stellar activity, instrumental profile (IP) effects, sampling alias, and planetary companions. We applied two independent approaches: (1) constraining diagnostic signals and performing a correlation analysis ($r$) between period-confined signals, and (2) evaluating phase stability by partitioning Keplerian fits. These methods enabled us to examine the physical connections and phase coherence among stellar activity indicators, RV measurements, and IP diagnostics. Our analysis suggests a stellar rotation period of $\simeq270\text{--}320$\,d for 2~Dra. The 340-d RV signal does not appear to originate from stellar activity in this chromospherically quiet star ($|r| \lesssim 0.33$), nor from instrumental systematics near the annual period ($|r| \lesssim 0.1$). This conclusion is supported by contrasting phase behavior: the RV and stellar activity phases remain stable, whereas the IP phases do not. We therefore propose that the 340-d variation likely arises from either small-amplitude intrinsic variability or a tentative gas giant companion with potential weak activity-induced modulation. The case of 2~Dra provides a framework for distinguishing the origins of $\sim$1-yr RV variations in other evolved stars.</description>

      <title>Thermal-timescale accretion does not always yield critical rotation in mass gainers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary evolution plays a central role in producing rapidly rotating stars. Previous studies have shown that mass gainers in binaries can reach critical rotation after accreting only modest amounts of material, particularly during thermal-timescale Case B mass transfer, where tidal spin-down is ineffective due to wide orbits. However, such rapid accretion often drives the mass gainer out of thermal equilibrium, and its subsequent spin evolution during thermal relaxation has not been analysed in depth. In this study, we construct a suite of accreting detailed single-star models with different accretion prescriptions, which inflate and spin up to critical rotation during the accretion. After the accretion has ended, the models relax thermally and deflate. We find that the ratio of surface to critical angular velocity decreases to subcritical values during thermal contraction, with the magnitude of this decrease correlating with the degree of thermal disequilibrium at the end of accretion. This reduction in fractional critical rotation is even stronger when internal angular momentum transport is inefficient. Detailed binary models show the same trend, indicating that the results from our toy single-star models also apply to real binary evolution. Our results highlight that binary mass transfer does not always produce critically rotating stars, but instead may yield a wide range of spin rates depending on the mass transfer and accretion history. Our findings offer new insights into the rotational properties of mass gainers in binaries, stellar merger products, and newly formed massive stars following accretion.</description>

      <title>Substellar population of the young massive cluster RCW 36 in Vela</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial mass function (IMF) is a cornerstone of star formation studies, yet its universality remains debated. We investigate the IMF in the young massive cluster RCW 36, located in the Vela Molecular Ridge and comparable to the Orion Nebula Cluster in stellar density. Our goal is to build the most complete census of RCW 36 and derive its first IMF and star-to-brown-dwarf (BD) ratio. We combine new GLAO observations from HAWK-I/VLT with archival data (2MASS, SOFI/NTT) and Gaia DR3 kinematics. Photometric accuracy and source extraction were improved using \textsc{DeNeb}, a deep-learning algorithm that removes complex nebular emission. Membership probabilities were assigned via color-magnitude diagram comparisons with a control field, and stellar masses were estimated using model isochrones. We find a revised distance of $954\pm40\,$pc and determine the IMF down to $\sim0.03\,M_{\odot}$, described by a broken power law ($dN/dM\propto M^{-\alpha}$) with $\alpha=1.62\pm0.03$ for $0.20$-$20\,M_{\odot}$ and $\alpha=0.46\pm0.14$ for $0.03$-$0.20\,M_{\odot}$. The star-BD ratio is $2$-$5$, consistent with other Galactic clusters. Lastly, through a study of the differences in the IMF within and outside $0.2\,$pc and the cumulative mass distributions for low-mass and intermediate to high-mass sources, we also detected signs of possible mass segregation within RCW 36, which should be primordial. RCW 36 shares many characteristics with other young massive clusters, such as a shallower than Salpeter high-mass slope and the possibility of mass segregation. The flatter lower-mass regime of the IMF is similar to most Galactic clusters. The star-BD ratio is also in line with the observed values in other clusters, independent of their inherent properties.</description>

      <title>The drastic impact of Eddington-limit induced mass ejections on massive star populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars are the key engines of the Universe. However, their evolution and thus their ionizing feedback are still not fully understood. One of the largest gaps in current stellar evolution calculations is the lack of a model for the mass ejections that occur when the stars reach the Eddington limit, such as during an Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) phase. We aim to remedy this situation by providing a physically motivated and empirically calibrated method applicable in any 1D stellar evolution code to approximate the effect of such mass loss on stellar evolution. We employ the 1D stellar evolution code MESA, in which we implement a new mass-loss prescription that is acting when stellar models inflate too much when reaching the Eddington limit. Synthetic massive-star stellar populations using calculated grids of single-star models with this mass loss prescription are compared with the observed populations in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. In combination with already computed grids of binary evolution models, we investigate the impact of binarity on our predictions. Our single-star models reproduce key features of the observed stellar populations, namely (i) the absence of stars located beyond the Humphreys-Davidson limit, (ii) an upper limit of RSG luminosities, (iii) the faintest observed single WR stars, (iv) the absolute number of O-stars, WRs, and RSGs, (v) WO stars in low metallicity environments, and (vi) the positions of LBV stars in the HRD. Our binary population explains at the same time the 70% binary fraction of O-stars and the 40% binary fraction of WR stars. However, our synthetic population also has caveats, such as an overproduction of bright H-free WN stars. Our results show that the effect of Eddington-limit induced mass ejections on the structure and evolution of massive stars can remove tension between predicted and observed massive star populations.</description>

      <title>The Topological Origin of Bohm Resistivity in Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08054v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta~\propto~T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the magnetized electron fluid as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the "frozen-in" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation in the model: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the magnetic field. By rigorously mapping the breakdown of adiabatic invariance to electron gyro axis slippage on the unit sphere, we show that the resulting resistivity naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. Numerical simulations of the $XY$ universality class confirm that the onset of this resistive state is explosive, following a logistic trigger consistent with the impulsive phase of solar flares. Furthermore, the topological defects in the condensate decay via a $t^{-0.75}$ power law, consistent with magnetic island coalescence as the mechanism of anomalous transport. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</description>

      <title>The Secret Lives of Open Clusters: a Multiwavelength Examination of Three Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star clusters are well known for their dynamical interactions, an outcome of their high stellar densities; in this paper we use multiwavelength observations to search for the unique outcomes of these interactions in three nearby Galactic open clusters: IC 2602 (30 Myr), NGC 2632 (750 Myr) and M67 (4 Gyr). We compared X-ray observations from all-sky surveys like eROSITA, plus archival observations from Chandra X-ray Observatory, survey radio observations from ASKAP's Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey plus archival VLA observations, in conjunction with new cluster catalogs with Gaia. From X-ray, we found 77 X-ray sources likely associated with IC 2602, 31 X-ray sources in NGC 2632, and 31 near M67's central regions. We were further able to classify these X-ray sources based on their optical variability and any radio emission. Three IC 2602 X-ray sources had radio counterparts, which are likely all chromospherically active binary stars. We also identified luminous radio and X-ray variability from a spectroscopic triple system in M67, WOCS 3012/S1077, which is either consistent with a quiescent black hole binary, or due to an active binary stellar system. A recent population study of optical variables by Anderson &amp; Hunt 2025 shows that the population of optical variables in open clusters clearly changes over cluster age; this pilot study gives evidence that the X-ray population also changes with time, and demonstrates the need for a broader multiwavelength study of Galactic open clusters.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Forbush decrease on 2024 May 10, using the ALPAQUITA air-shower array at the 70-1000 GV rigidity range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Andes Large area PArticle detector for Cosmic ray and Astronomy (ALPACA) is a new air-shower array experiment under construction in the Bolivian Andes, and its prototype ALPAQUITA surface array has been operating since 2023 April. In addition to the traditional $\ge$3-hit or $\ge$4-hit coincidences to trigger recording air-shower events, ALPAQUITA records the counting rates of the $\ge$1-hit and $\ge$2-hit events (Any1 and Any2, respectively). We report a successful detection of a Forbush decrease occurred on 2024 May 10 caused by a passage of an interplanetary shock formed ahead of the Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection. The amplitude detected in the Any1 rate is 4.26$\pm$0.33% at the median primary rigidity of 76GV which is consistent with the observations with the worldwide neutron monitor and muon detector networks. Under the assumption of a power-law rigidity spectrum, we renormalized the errors of the observed amplitude ($A_{obs}$) and fitted them as a function of the median primary rigidity ($R_{m}$) of each detector and observational method. The result $A_{obs} = (10.9\% \pm 0.9\%) \times (R_{m}/10\,GV)^{-0.55 \pm 0.07}$ exhibits a hard nature of this event. Our non-detection in the Any2 rate decrease constrains the amplitude with a 2$\sigma$ upper limit to be 0.95% at 960GV. This marginally suggests an existence of a spectral softening between 100GV and 1000GV as also suggested by the Misato underground muon detector at 145GV. Although a strong geomagnetic storm was observed during this period, we conclude it does not impact our results. Our novel technique realizes a unique coverage to study the behavior of the Forbush decreases at the highest rigidity.</description>

      <title>Velocity-Space Signatures of Energy Transfer for Ion-Acoustic Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) of electrostatic waves suggest that electrostatic instabilities, including the ion-ion-acoustic instability (IIAI) frequently observed in the inner heliosphere, play an important role in plasma heating and particle acceleration. Aims. Our aim is to explore the application of single spacecraft diagnostics to the IIAI, in anticipation of application to the current missions operating in the inner heliosphere, e.g. PSP and Solar Orbiter. Methods. We apply the field-particle correlation (FPC) technique to fully kinetic simulations of IIAI. We characterize the conversion of energy between the electric field and particle species, allowing the differentiation between oscillatory and secular energy transfer to and from the particles and highlighting the role of resonant energy exchange. We then identify the characteristic IIAI signatures for the proton and electron distributions, and relate them to our previous knowledge of IIAI onset and energy exchange mechanisms. Results. Applying the FPC technique to our simulations run in parameters regime compatible with solar wind conditions, we have identified IIAI signatures that would enable efficient recognition of IIAI in observations. This task is left for future missions, since the time scale over which IIAI signatures develop is too fast for the sampling rates of current missions.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Empirical Transit Spectra of Mars based on TGO/NOMAD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transit spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing atmospheric structures of exoplanets. Accurately accounting for the effects of aerosols is key to reconstructing atmospheric properties from transit spectra, yet this remains a significant challenge. To advance this effort, it is invaluable to examine the spectral features of well-characterized planetary atmospheres. Here, we synthesize empirical transit spectra of Mars across different seasons based on data from the NOMAD's Solar Occultation channel onboard ExoMars/TGO, which operates at wavelengths of 0.2-0.65 and 2-4 micron. In the generated empirical transit spectra, the atmosphere below 25 km is found to be largely opaque due to the presence of micron-sized dust and water ice clouds, both of which substantially weaken spectral features. The spectra exhibit CO2 absorption features at 2.7-2.8 micron and signatures of sub-micron-sized mesospheric water ice clouds around 3.1 micron, accompanied by a continuum slope. The amplitudes of these spectral features are found to vary with the Martian seasons, where the dust storms weaken the CO2 signatures and strengthen the water ice features, which serve as potential indicators of a dusty planet like Mars. If TRAPPIST-1f possessed a Mars-like atmospheric structure, both CO2 and water ice features would be detectable at a noise level of 3 ppm, a level likely beyond current observational capabilities. Nevertheless, the 3.1 micron feature produced by sub-micron-sized mesospheric water ice clouds offers a novel avenue for characterizing the atmospheres of habitable-zone exoplanets.</description>

      <title>On the Interstellar Extinction Curve toward HD 93222, A Sightline with an Exceedingly Narrow 2175 Angstrom Extinction Bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2175 Angstrom extinction bump, the most prominent spectral feature superimposed on the interstellar extinction curve, is widely seen in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way and external galaxies, both near and far. While its central wavelength is remarkably stable and independent with environment, its width shows considerable variation and environmental dependence. Here we examine the extinction curve for the line of sight toward HD 93222, a young star located in the Carina nebula. It is found that the 2175 Angstrom bump is extremely sharp, which is among the narrowest ever found in the Milky Way and external galaxies. We model the derived extinction curve and find that, to explain the extinction characteristics of HD 93222, in addition to the conventional silicate and graphite dust mixture, an additional population of nano-sized graphitic grains is required.</description>

      <title>A new estimate of the zero-point shift of the Gaia DR3 parallaxes obtained from a comparison with VLBI measurements of masers and radio stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most complete sample of radio stars and masers with trigonometric parallaxes measured by the VLBI method, common with the Gaia EDR3 and Gaia DR3 catalogs, has been compiled using literature data. The sample contains 151 stars. An analysis of the differences in parallaxes and proper motions of Gaia-VLBI stars has been performed. A new estimate of the systematic shift of the Gaia parallax zero point relative to the inertial coordinate system has been obtained: $\Delta\pi=-0.038\pm0.011$ mas. The obtained estimates of the relative rotation rates confirm the absence of a significant rotation of the Gaia\,DR3 system relative to the extragalactic coordinate system, which in this case is represented by VLBI measurements.</description>

      <title>Variable X-ray Emission of the Planet Hosting T Tauri Star CI Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report results of Chandra X-ray observations of CI Tau, a young magnetically active classical T Tauri star for which previous studies have reported periodic variability attributed to a massive planet in a short-period orbit. CI Tau was clearly detected by Chandra in four separate observations acquired in late 2023. The X-ray emission was steady in the first two observations with a characteristic plasma temperature kT ~ 2 keV (~23 MK) and X-ray luminosity log Lx = 29.74 erg/s. During each of the last two observations obtained two weeks later the count rate increased slowly and the X-ray plasma temperature was much higher but remained nearly steady at kT ~ 4 - 5 keV (~46 - 58 MK) and peak luminosity log Lx = 30.5 erg/s. Such variable X-ray emission in T Tauri stars accompanied by high plasma temperatures is a signature of magnetic activity, consistent with the known presence of a strong magnetic field in CI Tau. We summarize the variable X-ray emission properties of CI Tau within the framework of T Tauri stars of similar mid-K spectral type, identify possible variability mechanisms, and assess the effects of stellar X-ray irradiation on the claimed planet.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field dynamics in presence of Hall conductivity and thermo-diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropy of kinetic coefficients in presence of a magnetic field is
  represented by Hall currents, which appear in a collisional medium due to action of the Lorentz force on the charged particles between collisions.
  We derive equations, describing dynamics of the magnetic field in presence of thermo-diffusion with Hall currents, using a standard electrodynamic consideration. The influence of the Hall currents, at presence of thermo-diffusion, on the magnetic field structure is considered in simple models. The equation is derived, which includes additional term for a seed magnetic field creation in the non-magnetized plasma, due to thermo-diffusion. This equation describes the action of the seed magnetic field creation by the mechanism known as "Biermann battery".</description>

      <title>A planet-host ratio relation to synthesize microlensing and transiting exoplanet demography from Roman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NASA Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will be the first survey able to detect large numbers of both cold and hot exoplanets across Galactic distances: $\sim$1,400 cold exoplanets via microlensing and $\sim$200,000 hot, transiting planets. Differing sensitivities to planet bulk properties between the microlensing and transit methods require relations like a planet mass--radius relation (MRR) to mediate. We propose using instead a planet--host {\em ratio} relation (PHRR) to couple directly microlensing and transit observables in demographic forward-modelling simulations. Unlike the MRR, a PHRR uses parameters that are always measured and so can potentially leverage the full Roman exoplanet sample. Using 908 confirmed exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, we show that transit depth, $\delta$, and planet--host mass ratio, $q$, obey a PHRR that is continuous over all planet scales. The PHRR is improved by including orbital period, $P$, and host effective temperature, $T_{\star}$. We compare several candidate PHRRs of the form $\delta (q,T_\star, P)$, with the Bayesian Information Criterion favouring power-law dependence on $T_\star$ and $P$, and broken power-law dependence on $q$. The break in $q$ itself depends on $T_\star$, as do the power-law slopes in $q$ either side of the break. The favoured PHRR achieves a fairly uniform $50\%$ relative precision in $\delta$ for all $q$. Approximately $5\%$ of the sample has a transit depth that is strongly over-predicted by the PHRR; around half of these are associated with large stars ($R_\star &gt; 2.5 \, R_{\odot}$) potentially subject to Malmquist bias.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spherical dynamos exhibiting a small-scale MAC balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the asymptotic behaviour of numerical dynamo models is critical for extrapolating results to the physical conditions that characterise terrestrial planetary cores. Here we investigate the behaviour of convection-driven dynamos reaching a MAC (magnetic-Archimedes-Coriolis) balance on the convective length scale and compare the results with non-magnetic convection cases. In particular, the dependence of physical quantities on the Ekman number, $Ek$, is studied in detail. The scaling of velocity dependent quantities is observed to be independent of the force balance and in agreement with quasi-geostrophic theory. The primary difference between dynamo and non-magnetic cases is that the fluctuating temperature is order unity in the former such that the buoyancy force scales with the Coriolis force. The MAC state yields a scaling for the flow speeds that is identical to the so-called CIA (Coriolis-inertia-Archimedes) scaling. There is an $O(Ek^{1/3})$ length scale present within the velocity field irrespective of the leading order force balance. This length scale is consistent with the asymptotic scaling of the terms of the governing equations and is not an indication that viscosity plays a dominant role. The peak of the kinetic energy spectrum and the ohmic dissipation length scale both exhibit an Ekman number dependence of approximately $Ek^{1/6}$, which is consistent with a scaling of $Rm^{-1/2}$, where $Rm$ is the magnetic Reynolds number. For the dynamos, advection remains comparable to, and scales similarly with, both inertia and viscosity, implying that nonlinear convective Rossby waves play an important role in the dynamics even in a MAC regime.</description>

      <title>JCMT detection of HCN emission from 3I/ATLAS at 2.1 AU</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of HCN ($J=3-2$) rotational emission from comet 3I/ATLAS at a heliocentric distance of 2.13 AU with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). Observations were conducted from 07 August 2025 and 14 September 2025 (UT) using the $^{\prime}\overline U^{\prime}\overline u$ heterodyne receiver and ACSIS spectroscopic backend. The HCN line was detected at $&gt;6\sigma$ on 14 Sep 2025 (UT) and a production rate of $Q({\rm HCN})=(4.0\pm1.7)\times10^{25}\ {\rm s}^{-1}$ was derived by non-LTE radiative transfer modelling. Preliminary estimates of the HCN/H$_2$O and CN/HCN abundance ratios suggest values similar to Solar System comets.</description>
