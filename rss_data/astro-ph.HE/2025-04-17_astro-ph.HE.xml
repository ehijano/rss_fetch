      <title>Gotta Go Fast: A Generalization of the Escape Speed to Fluid-dynamical Explosions and Implications for Astrophysical Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A star's ability to explode in a core-collapse supernova is correlated with its density profile, $\rho(r)$, such that compact stars with shallow density profiles preferentially ``fail'' and produce black holes. This correlation can be understood from a mass perspective, as shallower density profiles enclose $\sim 3M_{\odot}$ (i.e., the maximum neutron-star mass) at relatively small radii, but could also be due to the fact that a shockwave (driving the explosion) inevitably stalls if the density profile into which it propagates is shallower than $\rho(r) \propto r^{-2}$. Here we show that this condition -- the density profile being steeper than $\rho \propto r^{-2}$ -- is necessary, but not sufficient, for generating a strong explosion. In particular, we find solutions to the fluid equations that describe a shockwave propagating at a fixed fraction of the local freefall speed into a temporally evolving, infalling medium, the density profile of which scales as $\rho \propto r^{-n}$ at large radii. The speed of the shock diverges as $n\rightarrow 2$ and declines (eventually to below the Keplerian escape speed) as $n$ increases, while the total energy contained in the explosion approaches zero as the shock recedes to large distances. These solutions therefore represent fluid-dynamical analogs of marginally bound orbits, and yield the ``shock escape speed'' as a function of the density profile. We also suggest that stellar explodability is correlated with the power-law index of the density at $\sim10^9$ cm, where the neutrino diffusion time equals the local dynamical time for most massive stars, which agrees with supernova simulations.</description>

      <title>3D full-GR simulations of magnetorotational core-collapse supernovae on GPUs: A systematic study of rotation rates and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a series of fully three-dimensional, dynamical-spacetime general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) for a progenitor of zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS) mass $25\, M_\odot$. We simulate a total of 12 models for simulation times in the range $190-260\, \mathrm{ms}$ to systematically study the effect of rotation rates and magnetic fields on jet formation via the magnetorotational mechanism. We have performed simulations on OLCF's Frontier using the new GPU-accelerated dynamical-spacetime GRMHD code \theCode for magnetic fields $B_0 = (10^{11}, 10^{12})\, \mathrm{G}$ and rotation rates $\Omega_0 = (0.14, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5)\, \mathrm{rad/s}$. We always resolve the entire region containing the shock with a resolution of at least $1.48\, \mathrm{km}$. We find that models with $B_0=10^{11}\, \mathrm{G}$ fail to explode, while those with $B_0=10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$ show a wide range of jet morphologies and explosive outcomes depending on the rotation rate. Models with $B_0=10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$ and $\Omega_0=(1.0,1.5)\, \mathrm{rad/s}$ form jets that bend sideways, giving the ejecta a more spherical character, and possibly representing explosions that \textit{appear} neutrino-driven even though they are magnetorotationally-driven. Models with $B_0=10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$ and $\Omega_0\geq2.0\, \mathrm{rad/s}$ show ejecta velocities $\gtrsim15000\, \mathrm{km/s}$, making them suitable candidates for broad-lined type Ic supernova progenitors. This work represents the largest set of 3D general-relativistic GRMHD simulations studying magnetorotational supernovae in full GR and demonstrates the potential of systematic studies with GPU-accelerated 3D simulations of CCSNe.</description>

      <title>Scaler rates from the Pierre Auger Observatory: a new proxy of solar activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modulation of low-energy galactic cosmic rays reflects interplanetary magnetic field variations and can provide useful information on solar activity. An array of ground-surface detectors can reveal the secondary particles, which originate from the interaction of cosmic rays with the atmosphere. In this work, we present an investigation of the low-threshold rate (scaler) time series recorded in 16 years of operation by the Pierre Auger Observatory surface detectors in Malargue, Argentina. Through an advanced spectral analysis, we detected highly statistically significant variations in the time series with periods ranging from the decadal to the daily scale. We investigate their origin, revealing a direct connection with solar variability. Thanks to their intrinsic very low noise level, the Auger scalers allow a thorough and detailed investigation of the galactic cosmic-ray flux variations in the heliosphere at different timescales and can, therefore, be considered a new proxy of solar variability.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high energy cosmic rays with UFA-15 source model in Bumblebee gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the effects of Bumblebee gravity on the propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) using astrophysical sources modeled in the Unger-Farrar-Anchordoqui (UFA) framework (2015), which includes star formation rate (SFR), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and active galactic nuclei (AGN). We compute the density enhancement factor for various source separation distances ($d_\text{s}$s) up to 100 Mpc within the Bumblebee gravity scenario. Additionally, we calculate the CRs flux and their suppression, comparing the results with observational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) and the Telescope Array through $\chi^2$ and $\chi_\text{red}^2$ analysis for the flux and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for suppression. The anisotropy in CRs arrival directions is examined, with corresponding $\chi^2$ and $\chi_\text{red}^2$ values obtained from the PAO surface detector data (SD 750 and SD 1500). Finally, we present skymaps of flux and anisotropy under different model assumptions, providing insights into the observational signatures of UHECRs in Bumblebee gravity. Our results show that increasing the Bumblebee gravity parameter $l$ enhances the density factor $\xi$, particularly at low energies, highlighting Lorentz violation's impact on CRs' propagation. Larger $d_\text{s}$ values amplify deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model, with AGN sources dominating at high energies and GRB/SFR sources at lower energies. The skymaps indicate the structured flux patterns at large $d_\text{s}$ and structured anisotropy at higher energies.</description>

      <title>Constraining the initial Lorentz factor of gamma-ray bursts under different circumburst mediums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_{\text{0}}$) plays a crucial role in uncovering the physical characteristics of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Previous studies have indicated that the ambient medium density index $k$ for GRBs falls in the range of 0 - 2, rather than exactly equal to 0 (homogeneous interstellar ambient) or 2 (typical stellar wind). In this work, we aim to constrain the $\Gamma_0$ of GRBs considering their distinct circumburst medium. We select a total of 33 GRBs for our analysis, comprising 7 X-ray GRBs and 26 optical GRBs. Subsequently, by utilizing the deceleration time of fireball $t_{\rm p}$, we derive the $\Gamma_0$ for the 33 GRBs assuming the radiation efficiency of $\eta =$ 0.2. The inferred initial Lorentz factor was found to be from 50 to 500, consistent with previous studies. We then investigate the correlation between the $\Gamma_0$ and the isotropic energy $E_{\rm \gamma,iso}$ (as well as the mean isotropic luminosity $L_{\rm \gamma,iso}$), finding very tight correlations between them, i.e., $\Gamma_0$ $\propto$ $E^{0.24}_{\rm \gamma,iso,52}$ ($\Gamma_0$ $\propto$ $L^{0.20}_{\rm \gamma,iso.49}$) with $\eta$=0.2. Additionally, we verify the correlation among $\Gamma_0$, the isotropic energy $E_{\rm \gamma,iso}$ (or $L_{\rm \gamma,iso}$) and the peak energy $E_{\rm{p,z}}$, i.e., $E_{\rm \gamma,iso,52}$ $\propto$ $\Gamma^{1.36}_0$$E^{0.82}_{\rm{p,z}}$ ($L_{\rm \gamma,iso,49}$ $\propto$ $\Gamma^{1.05}_0$$E^{0.66}_{\rm{p,z}}$) under the same radiation efficiency ($\eta$=0.2).</description>

      <title>A New Radio Continuum Study of the Large Magellanic Cloud Supernova Remnant MC SNR J0519-6902</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new radio continuum study of the Large Magellanic Cloud supernova remnant (SNR) MC SNR J0519-6902. With a diameter of ~8 pc, this SNR shows a radio ring-like morphology with three bright regions toward the north, east, and south. Its linear polarisation is prominent with average values of 5 +- 1% and 6 +- 1% at 5500 and 9000 MHz, and we find a spectral index of -0.62 +- 0.02 , typical of a young SNR. The average rotation measure is estimated at -124 +- 83 rad m-2 and the magnetic field strength at ~11 muG. We also estimate an equipartition magnetic field of 72 +- 5 muG and minimum explosion energy of Emin = 2.6x1048 erg. Finally, we identified an H I cloud that may be associated with MC SNR J0519-6902, located in the southeastern part of the remnant, along with a potential wind-bubble cavity.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Cross-Correlation functions with delays in Sco X-1: Evidence of possible Jet triggering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and origin of Jets from Z sources are not well understood, although an X-ray-radio correlation has been observed. We analyzed a few observations of Sco X-1 using the Rossi X-ray Timing Experiment Satellite. Out of the 17 observations, 5 showed lags of a few 10s of seconds with an asymmetry in the CCF between the soft and hard bands in their cross-correlation function (CCF) analysis. Interestingly, during these observations, a ballistic-type radio jet of Ultra-relativistic(UR) nature was reported. The observed lags and associated cross-correlation coefficients were validated using simulations. The rest of the 12 observations' CCFs were symmetric, and their associated Power Density Spectrum (PDS) displayed Normal Branch(NBO)/Normal + Horizontal Branch Oscillations(NBO+HBO). The X-ray spectral study of 2 obs. where radio core emission was seen with abrupt variation in both PDS and CCF showed a black-body flux variation of 10-20%, but no spectral parameter varied. We suggest that the ballistic jet caused a disturbance in the inner accretion region, viz., the Boundary Layer plausibly along with the Corona, that caused the lags observed in the CCFs along with the absence of any oscillatory features in the PDS tracing only a flat-topped noise. Whereas the regions with no lags showed a persistent NBO/NBO+HBO feature, suggesting a steady accretion flow. Although the UR jet can't be related to NBO or HBO, we suggest it could be related to the phenomena that cause NBO since the majority of PDSs displayed NBO. We also constrain the inner accretion region size to 20-30 km, which is responsible for the accretion ejecta in Sco X-1.</description>

      <title>Overview of hadronic interaction studies at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of fluorescence and surface detectors at the Pierre Auger Observatory offers unprecedented precision in testing models of hadronic interactions at center-of-mass energies around 70 TeV and beyond. However, for some time, discrepancies between model predictions and measured air-shower data have complicated efforts to accurately determine the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. A key inconsistency is the deficit of simulated signals compared to those measured with the surface detectors, typically interpreted as a deficit in the muon signal generated by the hadronic component of simulated showers.
  Recently, a new global method has been applied to the combined data from the surface and fluorescence detectors at the Pierre Auger Observatory. This method simultaneously determines the mass composition of cosmic rays and evaluates variations in the simulated depth of the shower maximum and hadronic signals on the ground. The findings reveal not only the alleviated muon problem but also show that all current models of hadronic interactions predict depths of the shower maximum that are too shallow, offering new insights into deficiencies in these models from a broader perspective.</description>

      <title>A Novel Jet Model for the Novikov-Thorne Disk and its Observable Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution observations have established a strong link between black hole jets and accretion disk structures, particularly in the 3.5 mm wavelength band [Nature. 616, 686 (2023)]. In this work, we propose a ``jet-modified Novikov-Thorne disk model'' that explicitly incorporates jet luminosity into the accretion disk radiation framework. By integrating synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons in the jet, we derive a modified luminosity function that accounts for both the accretion disk and jet contributions. Our analysis demonstrates that the inclusion of jet luminosity enhances the total accretion disk luminosity by approximately 33.5\%, as derived from the integration of radiative flux. Furthermore, we compare our modified model with the standard Novikov-Thorne model and find that the jet contribution remains significant across different observational inclinations. These results highlight the necessity of incorporating jet effects when estimating the observable flux of black hole accretion systems, which has direct implications for future astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Jets from a stellar-mass black hole are as relativistic as those from supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic jets from supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei are amongst the most powerful phenomena in the universe, acting to regulate the growth of massive galaxies. Similar jets from stellar-mass black holes offer a chance to study the same phenomena on accessible observation time scales. However, such comparative studies across black hole masses and time scales remain hampered by the long-standing perception that stellar-mass black hole jets are in a less relativistic regime. We used radio interferometry observations to monitor the Galactic black hole X-ray binary 4U 1543-47 and discovered two distinct, relativistic ejections launched during a single outburst. Our measurements reveal a likely Lorentz factor of $\sim$ 8 and a minimum of 4.6 at launch with 95% confidence, demonstrating that stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries can launch jets as relativistic as those seen in active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>A Heavy-Metal Scenario of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays is an open problem in astroparticle physics. It is usually inferred from the depth of the shower maximum (Xmax) of cosmic-ray showers, which is only ambiguously determined by modern hadronic interaction models. We examine a data-driven scenario, in which we consider the expectation value of Xmax as a free parameter. We test the novel hypothesis whether the cosmic-ray data from the Pierre Auger Observatory can be interpreted in a consistent picture, under the assumption that the mass composition of cosmic rays at the highest energies is dominated by high metallicity, resulting in pure iron nuclei at energies above ~40 EeV. We investigate the implications on astrophysical observations and hadronic interactions, and we discuss the global consistency of the data assuming this heavy-metal scenario. We conclude that the data from the Pierre Auger Observatory can be interpreted consistently if the expectation values for Xmax from modern hadronic interaction models are shifted to larger values.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Coherent Radio Emission from Solitons : Average Emission Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations have established that coherent radio emission from pulsars arise at few hundred kilometers above stellar surface. Recent polarization studies have further demonstrated that plasma instabilities are necessary for charge bunching that gives rise to coherent emission. The formation of charged solitons in the electron-positron plasma is the only known bunching mechanism that can be realised at these heights. More than five decades of observations have revealed a number of emission features that should emerge from any valid radio emission mechanism. We have carried out numerical calculations to find the features of average emission from curvature radiation due to charged solitons. The characteristic curvature radiation spectrum has been updated from the well known one-dimensional dependence into a general two-dimensional form, and contribution from each soliton along observer's line of sight (LOS) has been added to reproduce the pulsar emission. The outflowing plasma is formed by sparking discharges above the stellar surface that are located within concentric rings resembling the core-cone emission beam, and uniform distribution of solitons along any LOS has been assumed. The observed effects of radius to frequency mapping, where the lower frequency emission originates from higher altitudes, is seen in this setup. The power law spectrum and relative steepening of the core spectra with respect to the cones also emerges. The estimated polarization position angle reflects the geometrical configuration of pulsars as expected. These studies demonstrate the efficacy of coherent curvature radiation from charged solitons to reproduce the average observational features of pulsars.</description>

      <title>Towards asteroseismology of neutron stars with physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the gravitational wave signatures of neutron star oscillations may provide important information of their interior structure and Equation of State (EoS) at high densities. We present a novel technique based on physically informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve the eigenvalue problem associated with normal oscillation modes of neutron stars. The procedure is tested in a simplified scenario, with an analytical solution, that can be used to test the performance and the accuracy of the method. We show that it is possible to get accurate results of both the eigenfrequencies and the eigenfunctions with this scheme. The flexibility of the method and its capability of adapting to complex scenarios may serve in the future as a path to include more physics into these systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring GRBs and supernovae connection: does a superluminous hypernova population exist?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of several gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that are temporally and spatially compatible with energetic supernovae (hypernovae) has established their common origin. In one case (GRB 111209A/SN 2011kl) the associated supernova was classified as superluminous (SN 2011kl). The exceptional duration of the observed gamma-ray prompt emission of GRB 111209A (about 7 hours) is widely considered key to unlocking the physics behind the still mysterious origin of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). We review the main observational and theoretical findings that may link some ultra-long GRBs to SLSNe. Specifically, we examine notable events, the role of progenitors and host galaxies in shaping these phenomena, and focus on the proposed models. While a magnetar central engine is a plausible mechanism for both luminous and long-duration GRBs, a conclusive answer remains elusive, as alternative explanations are still viable. Further observational and theoretical work is required to clarify progenitor pathways and explosion mechanisms, potentially extending the classical GRB-SN connection to rare superluminous hypernovae.</description>

      <title>Suppression of composition g-modes in chemically-equilibrating warm neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of chemical equilibration and the resulting bulk viscosity on non-radial oscillation modes of warm neutron stars at temperatures up to T~5 MeV, relevant for protoneutron stars and neutron-star post-merger remnants. In this regime, the relaxation rate of weak interactions becomes comparable to the characteristic frequencies of composition g-modes in the core, resulting in resonant damping. To capture this effect, we introduce the dynamic sound speed, a complex, frequency-dependent generalization of the adiabatic sound speed that encodes both the restoring force and the dissipative effects of bulk compression. Using realistic weak reaction rates and three representative equations of state, we compute the complex frequencies of composition g-modes with finite-temperature profiles. We find that bulk viscous damping becomes increasingly significant with temperature and can completely suppress composition g-modes. In contrast, the f-mode remains largely unaffected by bulk viscosity due to its nearly divergence-free character. Our results highlight the sensitivity of g-mode behavior to thermal structure, weak reaction rates, and the equation of state, and establish the dynamic sound speed as a valuable descriptor characterizing oscillation properties in dissipative neutron star matter.</description>

      <title>The Late-time Afterglow of GW170817 and Implications for Jet Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GW170817 is the first binary neutron star merger detected with gravitational and electromagnetic waves, and its afterglow is still detectable 7 years post-merger. Some previous studies of the X-ray afterglow have claimed the onset of a new afterglow component or raised concerns about the data processing techniques. Motivated thus, we present here a reanalysis of X-ray afterglow data for GW170817 and find potential sources of discrepancies between the data reduction techniques employed by various research groups. We also analyze the updated panchromatic afterglow data to find that there is no significant evidence for any new afterglow component (e.g. due to the ejecta that gave rise to the kilonova) and that the jet must be still in a mildly relativistic phase. The decline in the afterglow light curve is significantly shallower compared to that expected from the standard synchrotron afterglow jet models with sideways spreading, indicating either an additional energy injection at late times or the velocity dependence on the microphysics parameters. In this context, we discuss the implications of the late time afterglow data on jet dynamics.</description>

      <title>Constraining Lens Masses in Moderately to Highly Magnified Microlensing Events from Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microlensing events provide a unique way to detect and measure the masses of isolated, non-luminous objects, particularly dark stellar remnants. Under certain conditions, it is possible to measure the mass of these objects using photometry alone, specifically when a microlensing light curve displays a finite-source (FS) effect. This effect generally occurs in highly magnified light curves, i.e. when the source and the lens are very well aligned. In this study, we analyse Gaia Alerts and Gaia Data Release 3 datasets, identifying four moderate-to-high-magnification microlensing events without a discernible FS effect. The absence of this effect suggests a large Einstein radius, implying substantial lens masses. In each event, we constrain the FS effect and therefore establish lower limits for angular Einstein radius and lens mass. Additionally, we use the DarkLensCode software to obtain mass, distance, and brightness distribution for the lens based on the Galactic model. Our analysis established lower mass limits of $\sim 0.2$ $M_{\odot}$ for one lens and $\sim 0.3-0.5$ $M_{\odot}$ for two others. DarkLensCode analysis supports these findings, estimating lens masses in the range of$\sim 0.42-1.66$ $M_{\odot}$ and dark lens probabilities exceeding 60\%. These results strongly indicate that the lenses are stellar remnants, such as white dwarfs or neutron stars. While further investigations are required to confirm the nature of these lenses, we demonstrate a straightforward yet effective approach to identifying stellar remnant candidates.</description>

      <title>Extended scenarios for solar radio emissions with downshifted electron beam plasma excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-principle studies of radiative processes aimed at explaining the origin of type II and type III solar radio bursts raise questions on the implications of downshifted electron beam plasma excitations with frequency (slightly) below the plasma frequency ($\omega\lesssim\omega_{pe}$) in the generation of radio emissions. Unlike the beam-induced Langmuir waves ($\omega \gtrsim \omega_{pe}$) in the standard radio emission plasma model, the primary wave excitations of cooler and/or denser beams have predominantly downshifted frequencies. Broadbands of such downshifted excitations are also confirmed by in situ observations in association with terrestrial foreshock and electron beams (in contrast to narrowband Langmuir waves), but their involvement in radiative processes has not been examined so far. We revisit three radiative scenarios specific to downshifted primary excitations, and the results demonstrate their direct or indirect involvement in plasma radio emission. Downshifted excitations of an electron beam primarily play an indirect role, contributing to the relaxation to a plateau-on-tail still able to induce Langmuir beam waves that satisfy conditions for nonlinear wave-wave interactions leading to free radio waves. At longer time scales, the primary excitations can become predominantly downshifted, and then directly couple with the secondary (backscattered) Langmuir waves to generate the second harmonic of radio emissions. Two counterbeams are more efficient and lead to faster radiative mechanisms, involving counterpropagating downshifted excitations, which couple to each other and generate intense, broadband and isotropic radio spectra of downshifted second harmonics. Such a long-lasting (second) radio harmonic can thus be invoked to distinguish regimes with downshifted ($\omega \gtrsim \omega_{pe}$) primary excitations.</description>

      <title>Light WIMPs and MeV Gamma-ray Detection with COSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), whose masses are in the sub-GeV scale, have been attracting more attention due to the negative results searching for traditional WIMPs. The light WIMPs are expected to produce gamma rays from annihilation in the MeV energy region. Advancements in technology have opened up possibilities to precisely detect MeV gamma rays, leading to the upcoming space-based mission of the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI). We comprehensively and quantitatively study the phenomenology of light WIMPs to determine if the COSI observations will probe their viable model parameter regions. We first construct models to describe light WIMPs based on the minimality and renormalizability of quantum field theory. Next, we impose various constraints on the models obtained from cosmological observations (CMB, BBN) and dark matter searches (accelerator, underground, astrophysical experiments, etc.). Finally, we identify viable parameter regions in each model and discuss whether or not COSI will be sensitive to the parameter regions. We find that a velocity-dependent annihilation cross-section is predicted in some regions, enabling COSI to detect the dark matter signal while avoiding severe constraints from cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Moon's Earth-like isotopic composition from giant impact on a differential rotating proto-Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the giant impact theory, the Moon formed by accreting the circum-terrestrial debris disk produced by Theia colliding with the proto-Earth. The giant impact theory can explain most of the properties of the Earth-Moon system, however, simulations of giant impact between a planetary embryo and the growing proto-Earth indicate that the materials in the circum-terrestrial debris disk produced by the impact originate mainly from the impactor, contradicting with the fact that different Solar System bodies have distinct compositions. Thus, the giant impact theory has difficulty explaining the Moon's Earth-like isotopic compositions. More materials from the proto-Earth could be delivered to the circum-terrestrial debris disk when a slightly sub-Mars-sized body collides with a fast rotating planet of rigid rotation but the resulting angular momentum is too large compared with that of the current Earth-Moon system. Since planetesimals accreted by the proto-Earth hit the surface of the proto-Earth, enhancing the rotation rate of the surface of the proto-Earth. The surface's fast rotation rate relative to the slow rotation rate of the inner region of the proto-Earth leads to transfer of angular momentum from surface to inner, resulting in the differential rotation. Here, we show that the giant impact of a sub-Mars-sized body on a differential rotating proto-Earth with a fast rotating outer region and a relative slow rotating inner region could result in a circum-terrestrial debris disk with materials predominately from the proto-Earth without violating the angular momentum constraint. The theory proposed here may provide a viable way of explaining the similarity in the isotopic compositions of the Earth and Moon.</description>

      <title>Magnetically driven outflows in 3D common-envelope evolution of massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the common-envelope interaction revealed the self-consistent formation of bipolar magnetically driven outflows launched from a toroidal structure resembling a circumbinary disk. So far, the dynamical impact of bipolar outflows on the common-envelope phase remains uncertain and we aim to quantify its importance. We illustrate the impact on common-envelope evolution by comparing two simulations -- one with magnetic fields and one without -- using the three-dimensional moving-mesh hydrodynamics code AREPO. We focus on the specific case of a $10 M_\odot$ red supergiant star with a $5 M_\odot$ black hole companion. By the end of the magnetohydrodynamic simulations (after $\sim 1220$ orbits of the core binary system), about $6.4 \%$ of the envelope mass is ejected via the bipolar outflow, contributing to angular momentum extraction from the disk structure and core binary. The resulting enhanced torques reduce the final orbital separation by about $24 \%$ compared to the hydrodynamical scenario, while the overall envelope ejection remains dominated by recombination-driven equatorial winds. We analyze field amplification and outflow launching mechanisms, confirming consistency with earlier studies: magnetic fields are amplified by shear flows, and outflows are launched by a magneto-centrifugal process, supported by local shocks and magnetic pressure gradients. These outflows originate from $\sim 1.1$ times the orbital separation. We conclude that the magnetically driven outflows and their role in the dynamical interaction are a universal aspect, and we further propose an adaptation of the $\alpha_\mathrm{CE}$-formalism by adjusting the final orbital energy with a factor of $1+ M_\mathrm{out}/\mu$, where $M_\mathrm{out}$ is the mass ejected through the outflows and $\mu$ the reduced mass of the core binary.

Abstract: The dynamics of a black hole traveling through a plasma--a general relativistic extension of the classic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion problem--can be related to a variety of astrophysical contexts, including the aftermath of binary black hole mergers in gaseous environments. We perform three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of BHL accretion onto a spinning black hole when magnetic field of the incoming wind is inclined to the spin axis of the black hole. Irrespective of inclination but dependent on the wind speed, we find that the accretion flow onto the black hole can become magnetically arrested, launching an intermittent jet whose formation is assisted by a turbulent dynamo-like process in the inner disk. The upstream ram pressure of the wind bends the jet, and confines the angular extent into which the magnetic flux tubes ejected from quasiperiodic eruptions are released. Recoil from magnetic flux eruptions drives strong oscillations in the inner accretion disk, resulting in jet nutation at the outer radii and occasionally ripping off the inner part of the accretion disk. When the incoming magnetic field is perpendicular to the spin axis of the black hole, we find that the magnetic polarity of the jets can undergo a stochastic reversal. In addition to dynamical friction, the black hole experiences a perpendicular drag force analogous to the Magnus effect. Qualitative effects of the incoming magnetic field orientation, the strength of the magnetization, and the incoming wind speed are investigated as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of the entire neutron star population can be inferred by modeling their evolution, from birth to the present, through pulsar population synthesis. This involves simulating a mock population, applying observational filters, and comparing the resulting sources to the limited subset of detected pulsars. We specifically focus on the magneto-rotational properties of Galactic isolated neutron stars and provide new insights into the intrinsic radio luminosity law by combining pulsar population synthesis with a simulation-based inference (SBI) technique called truncated sequential neural posterior estimation (TSNPE). We employ TSNPE to train a neural density estimator on simulated pulsar populations to approximate the posterior distribution of the underlying parameters. This technique efficiently explores the parameter space by concentrating on regions that are most likely to match the observed data thus allowing a significant reduction in training dataset size. We demonstrate the efficiency of TSNPE over standard neural posterior estimation (NPE), achieving robust inferences of magneto-rotational parameters consistent with previous studies using only around 4% of the simulations required by NPE approaches. Moreover, for the first time, we incorporate data from the Thousand Pulsar Array (TPA) program on MeerKAT, the largest unified sample of neutron stars with consistent fluxes measurement to date, to help constrain the stars' intrinsic radio luminosity. We find that adding flux information as an input to the neural network largely improves the constraints on the pulsars' radio luminosity, as well as improving the estimates on other input parameters.</description>

      <title>Discriminating between different modified dispersion relations from gamma-ray observations</title>

Abstract: The fact that the standard dispersion relation for photons in vacuum could be modified because of their interaction with the quantum nature of spacetime has been proposed more than two decades ago. A quantitative model [Jacob \&amp; Piran, JCAP 01, 031 (2008)], has been tested extensively using distant highly energetic astrophysical sources, searching for energy-dependent time delays in photon arrival times. Since no delay was firmly measured, lower limits were set on the energy scale $\Lambda$ related to these effects. In recent years, however, different but equally well-grounded expressions beyond the Jacob \&amp; Piran model were obtained for the photon dispersion relation, leading to different expressions for the dependence of lag versus redshift. This article introduces a general parameterization of modified dispersion relations in cosmological symmetry, which directly leads to a general parameterized lag versus redshift dependence encompassing both existing and new models. This parameterization could be used in the future to compare the predicted time lags of the different models and test them against observations. To investigate this possibility, realistic data sets are simulated, mimicking different types of extragalactic sources as detected by current and future instruments. When no lag is injected in the simulated data, each lag-redshift model leads, as expected, to a different value for the limit on $\Lambda$, and the Jacob \&amp; Piran model gives the most stringent bound. When a lag at $\Lambda \sim E_P$ in the Jacob \&amp; Piran model is injected, it is detected for all the other lag-redshift relations considered, although leading to different values. Finally, the possibility to discriminate between several lag-redshift models is investigated, emphasizing the importance of an evenly distributed sample of sources across a wide range of redshifts.</description>

Abstract: Stellar-mass binary black hole\,(BBH) mergers within the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei may contribute to gravitational wave\,(GW) events detected by grounded-based GW detectors. In particular, the interaction between a BBH and a single stellar-mass black hole\,(sBH), known as the binary-single interaction\,(BSI) process, can potentially lead to GW events with detectable non-zero eccentricity. Previous studies of the BSI process, which neglected the effects of gas, showed that BSIs contribute non-negligibly to GW events in a coplanar disk environment. In this work, we conduct a series of 2-dimensional hydrodynamical and N-body simulations to explore the BSI in a gas environment by coupling REBOUND with Athena++. We perform 360 simulation runs, spanning parameters in disk surface density \(\Sigma_0\) and impact parameter \(b\). We find that the gas-induced energy dissipation within the three-body system becomes significant if the encounter velocity between the sBHs is sufficiently large\,($\gg c_s$). Our simulation results indicate that approximately half of the end states of the BSI are changed by gas. Furthermore, at higher gas density, the number of close encounters during the BSI process will increase and the end-state BBHs tend to be more compact. Consequently, the presence of gas may shorten the GW merger timescale for end-state BBHs and increase the three-body merger rate.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger Emission by Magnetically Arrested Disks and Relativistic Jets of Black Hole X-ray Binaries</title>

Abstract: Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) are observed in various wavelengths from radio to GeV gamma-ray. Several BHXBs, including MAXI J1820+070 and Cygnus X-1, are also found to emit ultrahigh-energy (UHE; photon energy $&gt;$100 TeV) gamma rays. The origin and production mechanism of the multi-wavelength emission of BHXBs are under debate. We propose a scenario where relativistic particles from magnetically arrested disks (MADs), which could form when BHXBs are in quiescent or hard states, produce UHE gamma rays, while electrons in the jets produce GeV gamma-ray emission. Specifically, magnetic turbulence in MADs heats up and accelerates electrons and protons, while magnetic reconnection in jets accelerates electrons. Sub-PeV gamma rays and neutrinos are produced when relativistic protons interact with the thermal protons and the radiation by thermal electrons in the disk. We discuss the perspectives of observing sub-PeV multi-messenger signals from individual BHXBs. Finally, we evaluate the integrated fluxes of the quiescent and hard-state BHXB population and find that BHXBs may contribute to the Galactic diffuse emission above $\sim 100$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Spin evolution modeling for a newly-formed white dwarf resulting from binary white dwarf merger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Merger of two white dwarfs (WDs) has been proposed to form an isolated WD having high magnetization and rapid rotation. We study the influence of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind on spin evolution of the newly-formed merger product. We consider the scenario that the merger product appears as a giant-star-like object with a radius of $&gt; 10^{10}$ cm and a luminosity of the order of an Eddington value. We solve a structure of the merger product under the hydrostatic equilibrium and identify the position of the slow-point in the hot envelope. It is found that if such a giant-star-like object is spinning with an angular speed of the order of the Keplerian value, the MHD wind can be produced. The mass-loss rate is estimated to be of the order of $\sim 10^{20-21}~\mathrm{g~s^{-1}}$, and the timescale of the spin down is $\sim 10\text{-}10^{3}$ years, which depends on stellar magnetic field. We discuss that the final angular momentum when the MHD wind is terminated is related to the magnetic flux and initial radiation luminosity of the merger product. We apply our model to three specific magnetic WD sources ZTF J190132.9+145808.7, SDSS J221141.8+113604.4, and PG 1031+234 by assuming that those WDs were as a result of the merger product. We argue that the current periods of ZTF J190132.9+145808.7 and PG 1031+234 that are strongly magnetized WDs are related to the initial luminosity at the giant phase. For SDSS J221141.8+113604.4, which is mildly magnetized WD, its angular momentum was almost determined when the spin-down timescale due to MHD wind is comparable to the cooling timescale in the giant phase.</description>

      <title>Hidden Twin Star Solutions from an Agnostic Speed-of-Sound Model: Confronting XTE J1814--338's Extreme Compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08662</link>

Abstract: The twin star configuration, where two neutron stars share the same mass but exhibit different radii, arises from a strong first-order phase transition within the stellar interior. In widely used equation of state (EoS) meta-models, such as the Polytrope (PP) and Speed-of-Sound (CS) models, this first-order phase transition behavior can be naturally mimicked by tuning some model parameters. Here, we systematically explore the under-explored parameter space within one of a widely adopted CS model that leads to twin stars via a strong first-order phase transition. Within this twin-star subspace, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis that integrates mass--radius (MR) constraints from X-ray observations of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. The resultant twin star branch, situated within the 1--1.2 $M_{\odot}$ mass range and approximately 7 km in radius, surprisingly coincides with the MR ranges proposed for the recent anomaly in the Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars XTE J1814--338 (J1814), suggesting a hybrid twin star configuration. Moreover, incorporating the J1814 observation as an additional constraint yields an extreme phase transition pressure $P_{\text{trans}} = 108.9_{-4.85}^{+6.46}$ MeV/fm$^3$, a transition density of $\varepsilon_{\text{trans}}/\varepsilon_0 = 4.847_{-0.134}^{+0.271}$(where $\varepsilon_0$ is the nuclear saturation energy density) and an energy density jump $\Delta \varepsilon = 558.7_{-278.7}^{+303.6}$ MeV/fm$^3$, corresponding to $\Delta \varepsilon/\varepsilon_0 = 3.716_{-1.854}^{+2.020}$. Notably, to satisfy all astrophysical constraints, the speed of sound inside of the hybrid twin star core is driven toward the speed of light ($c_s^2/c^2 &gt; 0.9$), indicating the potential presence of strongly interacting, exotic matter in this core region.</description>

      <title>Does Magnetic Reconnection Change Topology?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13732v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ well-known concepts from statistical physics, quantum field theories and general topology to study magnetic reconnection, topology-change and their connection in incompressible flows in the context of an effective field theory without appealing to magnetic field lines. We consider the dynamical system corresponding to wave-packets moving with Alfven velocity dx/dt=V_A whose trajectories x(t) define path lines, which naturally provides a mathematical way to estimate the rate of magnetic topology-change. In laminar and even chaotic flows, the separation of path lines at all times remains proportional to their initial separation, argued to correspond to slow reconnection, and topology changes by dissipation with a rate proportional to resistivity. In turbulence, path lines diverge super-linearly with time independent of their initial separation, i.e., fast reconnection, and magnetic topology changes by turbulent dissipation with a rate independent of small-scale plasma effects. In fact, due to the loss of Lipschitz continuity of magnetic field in turbulence, path lines separate super-linearly even if their initial separation tends to vanish, unlike deterministic chaos. This super-chaotic behavior is an example of spontaneous stochasticity in statistical physics, sometimes called the real butterfly effect in chaos theory to distinguish it from the butterfly effect in which trajectories can diverge exponentially only if initial separation remains finite. If 3D reconnection is defined as magnetic topology-change, it can be fast only in turbulence where both reconnection and topology-change are driven by spontaneous stochasticity, independent of any plasma effects. Our results strongly support the Lazarian-Vishniac theory of turbulent reconnection.</description>

      <title>The next frontiers for magnetic monopole searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles (MMs) are well-motivated hypothetical particles whose discovery would symmetrize Maxwell equations, explain quantization of electric charge, and probe the gauge structure of the unified theory. Recent models predict MMs with low masses, reinvigorating searches at colliders. However, most theories predict composite MMs, whose production in parton-parton collisions is expected to be suppressed. The Schwinger process, whereby MM pairs tunnel through the vacuum barrier in the presence of a strong magnetic field, is not subject to this limitation. Additionally, the Schwinger cross section can be calculated nonperturbatively. Together, these make it a golden channel for low-mass MM searches. We investigate the Schwinger production of MMs in heavy-ion collisions at future colliders, in collisions of cosmic rays with the atmosphere, and in decay of magnetic fields of cosmic origin. We find that a next-generation collider would provide the best sensitivity, allowing one to discover or exclude MMs with TeV-scale masses. At the same time, exploiting the infrastructure of industrial ore extraction and Antarctic ice drilling could advance the field at a faster timescale and with only a modest investment. In particular, we show with detailed calculations that the proposed experiments will be sensitive to fluxes of low-mass MMs as low as a few units of 10^{-22} cm^{-2} s^{-1} sr^{-1} in a wide range of Lorentz factors. We also propose deploying dedicated MM detectors in conjunction with cosmic ray observatories to directly investigate if the unexplained, highest energy cosmic rays are MMs. Together, the proposed efforts would define the field of MM searches in the next decades.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Equation of State from Neutron Star Observables via Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have conducted an extensive study using a diverse set of equations of state (EoSs) to uncover strong relationships between neutron star (NS) observables and the underlying EoS parameters using symbolic regression method. These EoS models, derived from a mix of agnostic and physics-based approaches, considered neutron stars composed of nucleons, hyperons, and other exotic degrees of freedom in beta equilibrium. The maximum mass of a NS is found to be strongly correlated with the pressure and baryon density at an energy density of approximately 800 MeV.fm$^{-3}$. We have also demonstrated that the EoS can be expressed as a function of radius and tidal deformability within the NS mass range 1-2$M_\odot$. These insights offer a promising and efficient framework to decode the dense matter EoS directly from the accurate knowledge of NS observables.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Nova Simulations with an Extended Buffer and Lower Initial Mixing Temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classical nova is a thermonuclear runaway initiated on a white dwarf accreting solar-like material from its stellar companion. Once the white dwarf accretes enough mass, the pressure at the base of the accreted layer reaches a critical point, leading to the ignition of the hydrogen fuel at their interface. This paper presents a set of two-dimensional CO classical nova simulations with an extended buffer zone of a fixed low density and temperature between the top of the accreted layer and the upper boundary, allowing us to capture the thermonuclear outburst in the domain. Our domain reduces the role of the upper-outflow boundary condition that has affected previous simulations and allows us to explore the nucleosynthesis evolution in detail. We also study the effects of the initial temperature perturbation and buffer size to explore their sensitivity in our simulations. Finally, we start our simulations with a lower temperature at the base of the accreted layer ($7\times 10^7\,\mathrm{K}$) than previous work, allowing us to capture mixing earlier in the evolution, reducing the effects of the mixing-length-theory assumptions. This allows for a more realistic description of convective transport in our models.</description>

      <title>The stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic superstrings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic gravitational wave background sourced by a network of cosmic superstrings and demonstrate that incorporating higher-mass string species, beyond the fundamental string, is crucial for accurately modelling the resulting gravitational wave spectrum across frequencies ranging from nanohertz to kilohertz. Using the multi-tension velocity-dependent one-scale model to evolve the cosmic superstring network, we perform several fits to the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension, string coupling and effective size of compact extra dimensions. We find that the cosmic superstring best-fits are comparable in likelihood to Supermassive Black Hole models, thought by many to be the leading candidate explanation of the signal. The implications of the best-fit spectra are discussed within the context of future gravitational wave experiments. We obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension of $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-11.4^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$($-11.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$) for gravitational waves originating from large cuspy (kinky) cosmic superstring loops and $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-9.7^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$($-9.9^{+1.0}_{-0.5}$) for small cuspy (kinky) loops. We also place $2\sigma$ upper bounds on the string coupling, finding $g_s&lt;0.7$ in all cases, and comment on the implication of our results for the effective size of the compact extra dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Thousand-Pulsar-Array programme on MeerKAT -- XVI. Mapping the Galactic magnetic field with pulsar observations</title>

Abstract: Measuring the magnetic field of the Milky Way reveals the structure and evolution of the galaxy. Pulsar rotation measures (RMs) provide a means to probe this Galactic magnetic field (GMF) in three dimensions. We use the largest single-origin data set of pulsar measurements, from the MeerKAT Thousand-Pulsar-Array, to map out GMF components parallel to pulsar lines of sight. We also present these measurements for easy integration into the consolidated RM catalogue, RMTable. Focusing on the Galactic disk, we investigate competing theories of how the GMF relates to the spiral arms, comparing our observational map with five analytic models of magnetic field structure. We also analyse RMs to extragalactic radio sources, to help build up a three-dimensional picture of the magnetic structure of the galaxy. In particular, our large number of measurements allows us to investigate differing magnetic field behaviour in the upper and lower halves of the Galactic plane. We find that the GMF is best explained as following the spiral arms in a roughly bisymmetric structure, with antisymmetric parity with respect to the Galactic plane. This picture is complicated by variations in parity on different spiral arms, and the parity change location appears to be shifted by a distance of 0.15 kpc perpendicular to the Galactic plane. This indicates a complex relationship between the large-scale distributions of matter and magnetic fields in our galaxy. Future pulsar discoveries will help reveal the origins of this relationship with greater precision, as well as probing the locations of local magnetic field inhomogenities.</description>

      <title>Cataclysmic Variable Candidates Identified in eROSITA-DE DR1,XMM-Newton, Swift, and ROSAT Catalogs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are binary systems with a white dwarf accreting matter from a low-mass star, making them significant sources of X-ray emission in the Galaxy. We present a systematic search for X-ray emitting CV candidates by cross-matching four X-ray catalogs (eROSITA, XMM-Newton, Swift, and ROSAT) with Gaia sources located in the bridge region between the main sequence and white dwarf cooling sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. From 444 candidates (267 confirmed CVs and 177 new candidates), we detect orbital modulation in 56 sources using ZTF/TESS light curves. The eROSITA catalog contributes 51% of candidates, outperforming other surveys due to its wider sky coverage and higher sensitivity (~10^{-14} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}). Our method demonstrates the efficiency of combining X-ray data with time-domain analysis for CV identification, with future eROSITA observations expected to expand the population of X-ray emitting CVs.</description>
