      <title>Generative Manufacturing: A requirements and resource-driven approach to part making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in CAD and CAM have enabled engineers and design teams to digitally design parts with unprecedented ease. Software solutions now come with a range of modules for optimizing designs for performance requirements, generating instructions for manufacturing, and digitally tracking the entire process from design to procurement in the form of product life-cycle management tools. However, existing solutions force design teams and corporations to take a primarily serial approach where manufacturing and procurement decisions are largely contingent on design, rather than being an integral part of the design process. In this work, we propose a new approach to part making where design, manufacturing, and supply chain requirements and resources can be jointly considered and optimized. We present the Generative Manufacturing compiler that accepts as input the following: 1) An engineering part requirements specification that includes quantities such as loads, domain envelope, mass, and compliance, 2) A business part requirements specification that includes production volume, cost, and lead time, 3) Contextual knowledge about the current manufacturing state such as availability of relevant manufacturing equipment, materials, and workforce, both locally and through the supply chain. Based on these factors, the compiler generates and evaluates manufacturing process alternatives and the optimal derivative designs that are implied by each process, and enables a user guided iterative exploration of the design space. As part of our initial implementation of this compiler, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on examples of a cantilever beam problem and a rocket engine mount problem and showcase its utility in creating and selecting optimal solutions according to the requirements and resources.</description>

      <title>Practical Forecasting of Cryptocoins Timeseries using Correlation Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptocoins (i.e., Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin) are tradable digital assets. Ownerships of cryptocoins are registered on distributed ledgers (i.e., blockchains). Secure encryption techniques guarantee the security of the transactions (transfers of coins among owners), registered into the ledger. Cryptocoins are exchanged for specific trading prices. The extreme volatility of such trading prices across all different sets of crypto-assets remains undisputed. However, the relations between the trading prices across different cryptocoins remains largely unexplored. Major coin exchanges indicate trend correlation to advise for sells or buys. However, price correlations remain largely unexplored. We shed some light on the trend correlations across a large variety of cryptocoins, by investigating their coin/price correlation trends over the past two years. We study the causality between the trends, and exploit the derived correlations to understand the accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting techniques for time series modeling (e.g., GBMs, LSTM and GRU) of correlated cryptocoins. Our evaluation shows (i) strong correlation patterns between the most traded coins (e.g., Bitcoin and Ether) and other types of cryptocurrencies, and (ii) state-of-the-art time series forecasting algorithms can be used to forecast cryptocoins price trends. We released datasets and code to reproduce our analysis to the research community.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Monolithic Two-Level Schwarz Methods for the Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear domain decomposition methods became popular in recent years since they can improve the nonlinear convergence behavior of Newton's method significantly for many complex problems. In this article, a nonlinear two-level Schwarz approach is considered and, for the first time, equipped with monolithic GDSW (Generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund) coarse basis functions for the Navier-Stokes equations. Results for lid-driven cavity problems with high Reynolds numbers are presented and compared with classical global Newton's method equipped with a linear Schwarz preconditioner. Different options, for example, local pressure corrections on the subdomain and recycling of coarse basis functions are discussed in the nonlinear Schwarz approach for the first time.</description>

      <title>Iterative Classification of Graph-Set-Based Designs (IC-GSBD) for the Down-Selection of Aircraft Thermal Management Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Iterative Classification of Graph-Set-Based Design (IC-GSBD), a framework utilizing graph-based techniques with geometric deep learning (GDL) integrated within a set-based design (SBD) approach for the classification and down-selection complex engineering systems represented by graphs. We demonstrate this approach on aircraft thermal management systems (TMSs) utilizing previous datasets created using an enumeration or brute-force graph generation procedure to represent novel aircraft TMSs as graphs. However, as with many enumerative approaches, combinatorial explosion limits its efficacy in many real-world problems, particularly when simulations and optimization must be performed on the many (automatically-generated) physics models. Therefore, the approach uses the directed graphs representing aircraft TMSs and GDL to predict on a subset of the graph-based dataset through graph classification. This paper's findings demonstrate that incorporating additional graph-based features using principle component analysis (PCA) enhances GDL model performance, achieving an accuracy of 98% for determining a graph's compilability and simulatability while using only 5% of the data for training. By applying iterative classification methods, we also successfully segmented the total set of graphs into more specific groups with an average inclusion of 75.5 of the top 100 highest-performing graphs, achieved by training on 40% of the data.</description>

      <title>Large-Batch, Iteration-Efficient Neural Bayesian Design Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01095v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) provides a powerful framework for optimizing black-box, expensive-to-evaluate functions. It is therefore an attractive tool for engineering design problems, typically involving multiple objectives. Thanks to the rapid advances in fabrication and measurement methods as well as parallel computing infrastructure, querying many design problems can be heavily parallelized. This class of problems challenges BO with an unprecedented setup where it has to deal with very large batches, shifting its focus from sample efficiency to iteration efficiency. We present a novel Bayesian optimization framework specifically tailored to address these limitations. Our key contribution is a highly scalable, sample-based acquisition function that performs a non-dominated sorting of not only the objectives but also their associated uncertainty. We show that our acquisition function in combination with different Bayesian neural network surrogates is effective in data-intensive environments with a minimal number of iterations. We demonstrate the superiority of our method by comparing it with state-of-the-art multi-objective optimizations. We perform our evaluation on two real-world problems -- airfoil design and 3D printing -- showcasing the applicability and efficiency of our approach.

      <title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning Towards A Real-Time Spacecraft Thermal Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling thermal states for complex space missions, such as the surface exploration of airless bodies, requires high computation, whether used in ground-based analysis for spacecraft design or during onboard reasoning for autonomous operations. For example, a finite-element thermal model with hundreds of elements can take significant time to simulate, which makes it unsuitable for onboard reasoning during time-sensitive scenarios such as descent and landing, proximity operations, or in-space assembly. Further, the lack of fast and accurate thermal modeling drives thermal designs to be more conservative and leads to spacecraft with larger mass and higher power budgets. The emerging paradigm of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) presents a class of hybrid modeling architectures that address this challenge by combining simplified physics models with machine learning (ML) models resulting in models which maintain both interpretability and robustness. Such techniques enable designs with reduced mass and power through onboard thermal-state estimation and control and may lead to improved onboard handling of off-nominal states, including unplanned down-time. The PIML model or hybrid model presented here consists of a neural network which predicts reduced nodalizations (distribution and size of coarse mesh) given on-orbit thermal load conditions, and subsequently a (relatively coarse) finite-difference model operates on this mesh to predict thermal states. We compare the computational performance and accuracy of the hybrid model to a data-driven neural net model, and a high-fidelity finite-difference model of a prototype Earth-orbiting small spacecraft. The PIML based active nodalization approach provides significantly better generalization than the neural net model and coarse mesh model, while reducing computing cost by up to 1.7x compared to the high-fidelity model.</description>

      <title>Role of Data-driven Regional Growth Model in Shaping Brain Folding Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surface morphology of the developing mammalian brain is crucial for understanding brain function and dysfunction. Computational modeling offers valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms for early brain folding. Recent findings indicate significant regional variations in brain tissue growth, while the role of these variations in cortical development remains unclear. In this study, we unprecedently explored how regional cortical growth affects brain folding patterns using computational simulation. We first developed growth models for typical cortical regions using machine learning (ML)-assisted symbolic regression, based on longitudinal real surface expansion and cortical thickness data from prenatal and infant brains derived from over 1,000 MRI scans of 735 pediatric subjects with ages ranging from 29 post-menstrual weeks to 24 months. These models were subsequently integrated into computational software to simulate cortical development with anatomically realistic geometric models. We comprehensively quantified the resulting folding patterns using multiple metrics such as mean curvature, sulcal depth, and gyrification index. Our results demonstrate that regional growth models generate complex brain folding patterns that more closely match actual brains structures, both quantitatively and qualitatively, compared to conventional uniform growth models. Growth magnitude plays a dominant role in shaping folding patterns, while growth trajectory has a minor influence. Moreover, multi-region models better capture the intricacies of brain folding than single-region models. Our results underscore the necessity and importance of incorporating regional growth heterogeneity into brain folding simulations, which could enhance early diagnosis and treatment of cortical malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders such as cerebral palsy and autism.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Implicit Representation of Accessibility for Multi-Axis Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main concerns in design and process planning for multi-axis additive and subtractive manufacturing is collision avoidance between moving objects (e.g., tool assemblies) and stationary objects (e.g., a part unified with fixtures). The collision measure for various pairs of relative rigid translations and rotations between the two pointsets can be conceptualized by a compactly supported scalar field over the 6D non-Euclidean configuration space. Explicit representation and computation of this field is costly in both time and space. If we fix $O(m)$ sparsely sampled rotations (e.g., tool orientations), computation of the collision measure field as a convolution of indicator functions of the 3D pointsets over a uniform grid (i.e., voxelized geometry) of resolution $O(n^3)$ via fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) scales as in $O(mn^3 \log n)$ in time and $O(mn^3)$ in space. In this paper, we develop an implicit representation of the collision measure field via deep neural networks (DNNs). We show that our approach is able to accurately interpolate the collision measure from a sparse sampling of rotations, and can represent the collision measure field with a small memory footprint. Moreover, we show that this representation can be efficiently updated through fine-tuning to more efficiently train the network on multi-resolution data, as well as accommodate incremental changes to the geometry (such as might occur in iterative processes such as topology optimization of the part subject to CNC tool accessibility constraints).</description>
