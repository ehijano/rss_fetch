      <title>Enhancing Collaborative Semantics of Language Model-Driven Recommendations via Graph-Aware Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly prominent in the recommendation systems domain. Existing studies usually utilize in-context learning or supervised fine-tuning on task-specific data to align LLMs into recommendations. However, the substantial bias in semantic spaces between language processing tasks and recommendation tasks poses a nonnegligible challenge. Specifically, without the adequate capturing ability of collaborative information, existing modeling paradigms struggle to capture behavior patterns within community groups, leading to LLMs' ineffectiveness in discerning implicit interaction semantic in recommendation scenarios. To address this, we consider enhancing the learning capability of language model-driven recommendation models for structured data, specifically by utilizing interaction graphs rich in collaborative semantics. We propose a Graph-Aware Learning for Language Model-Driven Recommendations (GAL-Rec). GAL-Rec enhances the understanding of user-item collaborative semantics by imitating the intent of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to aggregate multi-hop information, thereby fully exploiting the substantial learning capacity of LLMs to independently address the complex graphs in the recommendation system. Sufficient experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GAL-Rec significantly enhances the comprehension of collaborative semantics, and improves recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>CLIP-Branches: Interactive Fine-Tuning for Text-Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of text-image models, most notably CLIP, has significantly transformed the landscape of information retrieval. These models enable the fusion of various modalities, such as text and images. One significant outcome of CLIP is its capability to allow users to search for images using text as a query, as well as vice versa. This is achieved via a joint embedding of images and text data that can, for instance, be used to search for similar items. Despite efficient query processing techniques such as approximate nearest neighbor search, the results may lack precision and completeness. We introduce CLIP-Branches, a novel text-image search engine built upon the CLIP architecture. Our approach enhances traditional text-image search engines by incorporating an interactive fine-tuning phase, which allows the user to further concretize the search query by iteratively defining positive and negative examples. Our framework involves training a classification model given the additional user feedback and essentially outputs all positively classified instances of the entire data catalog. By building upon recent techniques, this inference phase, however, is not implemented by scanning the entire data catalog, but by employing efficient index structures pre-built for the data. Our results show that the fine-tuned results can improve the initial search outputs in terms of relevance and accuracy while maintaining swift response times</description>

      <title>UpDLRM: Accelerating Personalized Recommendation using Real-World PIM Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) have gained popularity in recommendation systems due to their effectiveness in handling large-scale recommendation tasks. The embedding layers of DLRMs have become the performance bottleneck due to their intensive needs on memory capacity and memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose UpDLRM, which utilizes real-world processingin-memory (PIM) hardware, UPMEM DPU, to boost the memory bandwidth and reduce recommendation latency. The parallel nature of the DPU memory can provide high aggregated bandwidth for the large number of irregular memory accesses in embedding lookups, thus offering great potential to reduce the inference latency. To fully utilize the DPU memory bandwidth, we further studied the embedding table partitioning problem to achieve good workload-balance and efficient data caching. Evaluations using real-world datasets show that, UpDLRM achieves much lower inference time for DLRM compared to both CPU-only and CPU-GPU hybrid counterparts.</description>

      <title>Unifying Graph Convolution and Contrastive Learning in Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based models and contrastive learning have emerged as prominent methods in Collaborative Filtering (CF). While many existing models in CF incorporate these methods in their design, there seems to be a limited depth of analysis regarding the foundational principles behind them. This paper bridges graph convolution, a pivotal element of graph-based models, with contrastive learning through a theoretical framework. By examining the learning dynamics and equilibrium of the contrastive loss, we offer a fresh lens to understand contrastive learning via graph theory, emphasizing its capability to capture high-order connectivity. Building on this analysis, we further show that the graph convolutional layers often used in graph-based models are not essential for high-order connectivity modeling and might contribute to the risk of oversmoothing. Stemming from our findings, we introduce Simple Contrastive Collaborative Filtering (SCCF), a simple and effective algorithm based on a naive embedding model and a modified contrastive loss. The efficacy of the algorithm is demonstrated through extensive experiments across four public datasets. The experiment code is available at \url{https://github.com/wu1hong/SCCF}. \end{abstract}</description>

      <title>Do Not Wait: Learning Re-Ranking Model Without User Feedback At Serving Time in E-Commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems have been widely used in e-commerce, and re-ranking models are playing an increasingly significant role in the domain, which leverages the inter-item influence and determines the final recommendation lists. Online learning methods keep updating a deployed model with the latest available samples to capture the shifting of the underlying data distribution in e-commerce. However, they depend on the availability of real user feedback, which may be delayed by hours or even days, such as item purchases, leading to a lag in model enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of online learning methods for re-ranking modeling, which we term LAST, an acronym for Learning At Serving Time. It circumvents the requirement of user feedback by using a surrogate model to provide the instructional signal needed to steer model improvement. Upon receiving an online request, LAST finds and applies a model modification on the fly before generating a recommendation result for the request. The modification is request-specific and transient. It means the modification is tailored to and only to the current request to capture the specific context of the request. After a request, the modification is discarded, which helps to prevent error propagation and stabilizes the online learning procedure since the predictions of the surrogate model may be inaccurate. Most importantly, as a complement to feedback-based online learning methods, LAST can be seamlessly integrated into existing online learning systems to create a more adaptive and responsive recommendation experience. Comprehensive experiments, both offline and online, affirm that LAST outperforms state-of-the-art re-ranking models.</description>

      <title>EAGER: Two-Stream Generative Recommender with Behavior-Semantic Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative retrieval has recently emerged as a promising approach to sequential recommendation, framing candidate item retrieval as an autoregressive sequence generation problem. However, existing generative methods typically focus solely on either behavioral or semantic aspects of item information, neglecting their complementary nature and thus resulting in limited effectiveness. To address this limitation, we introduce EAGER, a novel generative recommendation framework that seamlessly integrates both behavioral and semantic information. Specifically, we identify three key challenges in combining these two types of information: a unified generative architecture capable of handling two feature types, ensuring sufficient and independent learning for each type, and fostering subtle interactions that enhance collaborative information utilization. To achieve these goals, we propose (1) a two-stream generation architecture leveraging a shared encoder and two separate decoders to decode behavior tokens and semantic tokens with a confidence-based ranking strategy; (2) a global contrastive task with summary tokens to achieve discriminative decoding for each type of information; and (3) a semantic-guided transfer task designed to implicitly promote cross-interactions through reconstruction and estimation objectives. We validate the effectiveness of EAGER on four public benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy-Guided Zero-Shot Recommendations with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and their ability to perform a variety of tasks, their application in recommender systems (RecSys) has shown promise. However, we are facing significant challenges when deploying LLMs into RecSys, such as limited prompt length, unstructured item information, and un-constrained generation of recommendations, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel method using a taxonomy dictionary. This method provides a systematic framework for categorizing and organizing items, improving the clarity and structure of item information. By incorporating the taxonomy dictionary into LLM prompts, we achieve efficient token utilization and controlled feature generation, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant recommendations. Our Taxonomy-guided Recommendation (TaxRec) approach features a two-step process: one-time taxonomy categorization and LLM-based recommendation, enabling zero-shot recommendations without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate TaxRec significantly enhances recommendation quality compared to traditional zero-shot approaches, showcasing its efficacy as personal recommender with LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/yueqingliang1/TaxRec.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Prompt Variations for Zero-shot LLM-based Rankers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a systematic understanding of the impact of specific components and wordings used in prompts on the effectiveness of rankers based on zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs). Several zero-shot ranking methods based on LLMs have recently been proposed. Among many aspects, methods differ across (1) the ranking algorithm they implement, e.g., pointwise vs. listwise, (2) the backbone LLMs used, e.g., GPT3.5 vs. FLAN-T5, (3) the components and wording used in prompts, e.g., the use or not of role-definition (role-playing) and the actual words used to express this. It is currently unclear whether performance differences are due to the underlying ranking algorithm, or because of spurious factors such as better choice of words used in prompts. This confusion risks to undermine future research. Through our large-scale experimentation and analysis, we find that ranking algorithms do contribute to differences between methods for zero-shot LLM ranking. However, so do the LLM backbones -- but even more importantly, the choice of prompt components and wordings affect the ranking. In fact, in our experiments, we find that, at times, these latter elements have more impact on the ranker's effectiveness than the actual ranking algorithms, and that differences among ranking methods become more blurred when prompt variations are considered.</description>

      <title>DIRAS: Efficient LLM-Assisted Annotation of Document Relevance in Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely employed to ground responses to queries on domain-specific documents. But do RAG implementations leave out important information or excessively include irrelevant information? To allay these concerns, it is necessary to annotate domain-specific benchmarks to evaluate information retrieval (IR) performance, as relevance definitions vary across queries and domains. Furthermore, such benchmarks should be cost-efficiently annotated to avoid annotation selection bias. In this paper, we propose DIRAS (Domain-specific Information Retrieval Annotation with Scalability), a manual-annotation-free schema that fine-tunes open-sourced LLMs to annotate relevance labels with calibrated relevance probabilities. Extensive evaluation shows that DIRAS fine-tuned models achieve GPT-4-level performance on annotating and ranking unseen (query, document) pairs, and is helpful for real-world RAG development.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Novelty of Top-k Recommendations using Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an input query, a recommendation model is trained using user feedback data (e.g., click data) to output a ranked list of items. In real-world systems, besides accuracy, an important consideration for a new model is novelty of its top-k recommendations w.r.t. an existing deployed model. However, novelty of top-k items is a difficult goal to optimize a model for, since it involves a non-differentiable sorting operation on the model's predictions. Moreover, novel items, by definition, do not have any user feedback data. Given the semantic capabilities of large language models, we address these problems using a reinforcement learning (RL) formulation where large language models provide feedback for the novel items. However, given millions of candidate items, the sample complexity of a standard RL algorithm can be prohibitively high. To reduce sample complexity, we reduce the top-k list reward to a set of item-wise rewards and reformulate the state space to consist of &lt;query, item&gt; tuples such that the action space is reduced to a binary decision; and show that this reformulation results in a significantly lower complexity when the number of items is large. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on improving novelty for a query-ad recommendation task on a large-scale search engine. Compared to supervised finetuning on recent &lt;query, ad&gt; pairs, the proposed RL-based algorithm leads to significant novelty gains with minimal loss in recall. We obtain similar results on the ORCAS query-webpage matching dataset and a product recommendation dataset based on Amazon reviews.</description>

      <title>LARP: Language Audio Relational Pre-training for Cold-Start Playlist Continuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As online music consumption increasingly shifts towards playlist-based listening, the task of playlist continuation, in which an algorithm suggests songs to extend a playlist in a personalized and musically cohesive manner, has become vital to the success of music streaming. Currently, many existing playlist continuation approaches rely on collaborative filtering methods to perform recommendation. However, such methods will struggle to recommend songs that lack interaction data, an issue known as the cold-start problem. Current approaches to this challenge design complex mechanisms for extracting relational signals from sparse collaborative data and integrating them into content representations. However, these approaches leave content representation learning out of scope and utilize frozen, pre-trained content models that may not be aligned with the distribution or format of a specific musical setting. Furthermore, even the musical state-of-the-art content modules are either (1) incompatible with the cold-start setting or (2) unable to effectively integrate cross-modal and relational signals. In this paper, we introduce LARP, a multi-modal cold-start playlist continuation model, to effectively overcome these limitations. LARP is a three-stage contrastive learning framework that integrates both multi-modal and relational signals into its learned representations. Our framework uses increasing stages of task-specific abstraction: within-track (language-audio) contrastive loss, track-track contrastive loss, and track-playlist contrastive loss. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the efficacy of LARP over uni-modal and multi-modal models for playlist continuation in a cold-start setting. Code and dataset are released at: https://github.com/Rsalganik1123/LARP.</description>

      <title>GLiNER multi-task: Generalist Lightweight Model for Various Information Extraction Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information extraction tasks require both accurate, efficient, and generalisable models. Classical supervised deep learning approaches can achieve the required performance, but they need large datasets and are limited in their ability to adapt to different tasks. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate good generalization, meaning that they can adapt to many different tasks based on user requests. However, LLMs are computationally expensive and tend to fail to generate structured outputs. In this article, we will introduce a new kind of GLiNER model that can be used for various information extraction tasks while being a small encoder model. Our model achieved SoTA performance on zero-shot NER benchmarks and leading performance on question-answering, summarization and relation extraction tasks. Additionally, in this article, we will cover experimental results on self-learning approaches for named entity recognition using GLiNER models.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Complex Disease Treatment through Network Medicine and GenAI: A Case Study on Drug Repurposing for Breast Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this research is to introduce a network specialized in predicting drugs that can be repurposed by investigating real-world evidence sources, such as clinical trials and biomedical literature. Specifically, it aims to generate drug combination therapies for complex diseases (e.g., cancer, Alzheimer's). We present a multilayered network medicine approach, empowered by a highly configured ChatGPT prompt engineering system, which is constructed on the fly to extract drug mentions in clinical trials. Additionally, we introduce a novel algorithm that connects real-world evidence with disease-specific signaling pathways (e.g., KEGG database). This sheds light on the repurposability of drugs if they are found to bind with one or more protein constituents of a signaling pathway. To demonstrate, we instantiated the framework for breast cancer and found that, out of 46 breast cancer signaling pathways, the framework identified 38 pathways that were covered by at least two drugs. This evidence signals the potential for combining those drugs. Specifically, the most covered signaling pathway, ID hsa:2064, was covered by 108 drugs, some of which can be combined. Conversely, the signaling pathway ID hsa:1499 was covered by only two drugs, indicating a significant gap for further research. Our network medicine framework, empowered by GenAI, shows promise in identifying drug combinations with a high degree of specificity, knowing the exact signaling pathways and proteins that serve as targets. It is noteworthy that ChatGPT successfully accelerated the process of identifying drug mentions in clinical trials, though further investigations are required to determine the relationships among the drug mentions.</description>

      <title>Can Long-Context Language Models Subsume Retrieval, RAG, SQL, and More?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-context language models (LCLMs) have the potential to revolutionize our approach to tasks traditionally reliant on external tools like retrieval systems or databases. Leveraging LCLMs' ability to natively ingest and process entire corpora of information offers numerous advantages. It enhances user-friendliness by eliminating the need for specialized knowledge of tools, provides robust end-to-end modeling that minimizes cascading errors in complex pipelines, and allows for the application of sophisticated prompting techniques across the entire system. To assess this paradigm shift, we introduce LOFT, a benchmark of real-world tasks requiring context up to millions of tokens designed to evaluate LCLMs' performance on in-context retrieval and reasoning. Our findings reveal LCLMs' surprising ability to rival state-of-the-art retrieval and RAG systems, despite never having been explicitly trained for these tasks. However, LCLMs still face challenges in areas like compositional reasoning that are required in SQL-like tasks. Notably, prompting strategies significantly influence performance, emphasizing the need for continued research as context lengths grow. Overall, LOFT provides a rigorous testing ground for LCLMs, showcasing their potential to supplant existing paradigms and tackle novel tasks as model capabilities scale.</description>

Abstract: Federated Knowledge Graphs Embedding learning (FKGE) encounters challenges in communication efficiency stemming from the considerable size of parameters and extensive communication rounds. However, existing FKGE methods only focus on reducing communication rounds by conducting multiple rounds of local training in each communication round, and ignore reducing the size of parameters transmitted within each communication round. To tackle the problem, we first find that universal reduction in embedding precision across all entities during compression can significantly impede convergence speed, underscoring the importance of maintaining embedding precision. We then propose bidirectional communication-efficient FedS based on Entity-Wise Top-K Sparsification strategy. During upload, clients dynamically identify and upload only the Top-K entity embeddings with the greater changes to the server. During download, the server first performs personalized embedding aggregation for each client. It then identifies and transmits the Top-K aggregated embeddings to each client. Besides, an Intermittent Synchronization Mechanism is used by FedS to mitigate negative effect of embedding inconsistency among shared entities of clients caused by heterogeneity of Federated Knowledge Graph. Extensive experiments across three datasets showcase that FedS significantly enhances communication efficiency with negligible (even no) performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Evaluation: A Comprehensive Taxonomy of Datasets and Metrics for Open Domain Question Answering in the Era of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open Domain Question Answering (ODQA) within natural language processing involves building systems that answer factual questions using large-scale knowledge corpora. Recent advances stem from the confluence of several factors, such as large-scale training datasets, deep learning techniques, and the rise of large language models. High-quality datasets are used to train models on realistic scenarios and enable the evaluation of the system on potentially unseen data. Standardized metrics facilitate comparisons between different ODQA systems, allowing researchers to objectively track advancements in the field. Our study presents a thorough examination of the current landscape of ODQA benchmarking by reviewing 52 datasets and 20 evaluation techniques across textual and multimodal modalities. We introduce a novel taxonomy for ODQA datasets that incorporates both the modality and difficulty of the question types. Additionally, we present a structured organization of ODQA evaluation metrics along with a critical analysis of their inherent trade-offs. Our study aims to empower researchers by providing a framework for the robust evaluation of modern question-answering systems. We conclude by identifying the current challenges and outlining promising avenues for future research and development.</description>

      <title>R^2AG: Incorporating Retrieval Information into Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has been applied in many scenarios to augment large language models (LLMs) with external documents provided by retrievers. However, a semantic gap exists between LLMs and retrievers due to differences in their training objectives and architectures. This misalignment forces LLMs to passively accept the documents provided by the retrievers, leading to incomprehension in the generation process, where the LLMs are burdened with the task of distinguishing these documents using their inherent knowledge. This paper proposes R$^2$AG, a novel enhanced RAG framework to fill this gap by incorporating Retrieval information into Retrieval Augmented Generation. Specifically, R$^2$AG utilizes the nuanced features from the retrievers and employs a R$^2$-Former to capture retrieval information. Then, a retrieval-aware prompting strategy is designed to integrate retrieval information into LLMs' generation. Notably, R$^2$AG suits low-source scenarios where LLMs and retrievers are frozen. Extensive experiments across five datasets validate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of R$^2$AG. Our analysis reveals that retrieval information serves as an anchor to aid LLMs in the generation process, thereby filling the semantic gap.</description>

      <title>Converging Dimensions: Information Extraction and Summarization through Multisource, Multimodal, and Multilingual Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to new summarization strategies, offering an extensive toolkit for extracting important information. However, these approaches are frequently limited by their reliance on isolated sources of data. The amount of information that can be gathered is limited and covers a smaller range of themes, which introduces the possibility of falsified content and limited support for multilingual and multimodal data. The paper proposes a novel approach to summarization that tackles such challenges by utilizing the strength of multiple sources to deliver a more exhaustive and informative understanding of intricate topics. The research progresses beyond conventional, unimodal sources such as text documents and integrates a more diverse range of data, including YouTube playlists, pre-prints, and Wikipedia pages. The aforementioned varied sources are then converted into a unified textual representation, enabling a more holistic analysis. This multifaceted approach to summary generation empowers us to extract pertinent information from a wider array of sources. The primary tenet of this approach is to maximize information gain while minimizing information overlap and maintaining a high level of informativeness, which encourages the generation of highly coherent summaries.</description>

      <title>Towards Holistic Language-video Representation: the language model-enhanced MSR-Video to Text Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A more robust and holistic language-video representation is the key to pushing video understanding forward. Despite the improvement in training strategies, the quality of the language-video dataset is less attention to. The current plain and simple text descriptions and the visual-only focus for the language-video tasks result in a limited capacity in real-world natural language video retrieval tasks where queries are much more complex. This paper introduces a method to automatically enhance video-language datasets, making them more modality and context-aware for more sophisticated representation learning needs, hence helping all downstream tasks. Our multifaceted video captioning method captures entities, actions, speech transcripts, aesthetics, and emotional cues, providing detailed and correlating information from the text side to the video side for training. We also develop an agent-like strategy using language models to generate high-quality, factual textual descriptions, reducing human intervention and enabling scalability. The method's effectiveness in improving language-video representation is evaluated through text-video retrieval using the MSR-VTT dataset and several multi-modal retrieval models.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility in Machine Learning-based Research: Overview, Barriers and Drivers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research in various fields is currently experiencing challenges regarding the reproducibility of results. This problem is also prevalent in machine learning (ML) research. The issue arises primarily due to unpublished data and/or source code and the sensitivity of ML training conditions. Although different solutions have been proposed to address this issue, such as using ML platforms, the level of reproducibility in ML-driven research remains unsatisfactory. Therefore, in this article, we discuss the reproducibility of ML-driven research with three main aims: (i) identify the barriers to reproducibility when applying ML in research as well as categorize the barriers to different types of reproducibility (description, code, data, and experiment reproducibility), (ii) identify potential drivers such as tools, practices, and interventions that support ML reproducibility as well as distinguish between technology-driven drivers, procedural drivers, and drivers related to awareness and education, and (iii) map the drivers to the barriers. With this work, we hope to provide insights and contribute to the decision-making process regarding the adoption of different solutions to support ML reproducibility.</description>

Abstract: In practice, users of a Recommender System (RS) fall into a few clusters based on their preferences. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on user-cluster targeted data poisoning attacks on Matrix Factorisation (MF) based RS, where an adversary injects fake users with falsely crafted user-item feedback to promote an item to a specific user cluster. We analyse how user and item feature matrices change after data poisoning attacks and identify the factors that influence the effectiveness of the attack on these feature matrices. We demonstrate that the adversary can easily target specific user clusters with minimal effort and that some items are more susceptible to attacks than others. Our theoretical analysis has been validated by the experimental results obtained from two real-world datasets. Our observations from the study could serve as a motivating point to design a more robust RS.</description>

      <title>Advancing continual lifelong learning in neural information retrieval: definition, dataset, framework, and empirical evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual learning refers to the capability of a machine learning model to learn and adapt to new information, without compromising its performance on previously learned tasks. Although several studies have investigated continual learning methods for information retrieval tasks, a well-defined task formulation is still lacking, and it is unclear how typical learning strategies perform in this context. To address this challenge, a systematic task formulation of continual neural information retrieval is presented, along with a multiple-topic dataset that simulates continuous information retrieval. A comprehensive continual neural information retrieval framework consisting of typical retrieval models and continual learning strategies is then proposed. Empirical evaluations illustrate that the proposed framework can successfully prevent catastrophic forgetting in neural information retrieval and enhance performance on previously learned tasks. The results indicate that embedding-based retrieval models experience a decline in their continual learning performance as the topic shift distance and dataset volume of new tasks increase. In contrast, pretraining-based models do not show any such correlation. Adopting suitable learning strategies can mitigate the effects of topic shift and data augmentation.</description>

      <title>Multi-Resolution Diffusion for Privacy-Sensitive Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03488v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While recommender systems have become an integral component of the Web experience, their heavy reliance on user data raises privacy and security concerns. Substituting user data with synthetic data can address these concerns, but accurately replicating these real-world datasets has been a notoriously challenging problem. Recent advancements in generative AI have demonstrated the impressive capabilities of diffusion models in generating realistic data across various domains. In this work we introduce a Score-based Diffusion Recommendation Module (SDRM), which captures the intricate patterns of real-world datasets required for training highly accurate recommender systems. SDRM allows for the generation of synthetic data that can replace existing datasets to preserve user privacy, or augment existing datasets to address excessive data sparsity. Our method outperforms competing baselines such as generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, and recently proposed diffusion models in synthesizing various datasets to replace or augment the original data by an average improvement of 4.30% in Recall@k and 4.65% in NDCG@k.</description>

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) has shown great competence in image and audio generation tasks. However, there exist few attempts to employ DDPM in the text generation, especially review generation under recommendation systems. Fueled by the predicted reviews explainability that justifies recommendations could assist users better understand the recommended items and increase the transparency of recommendation system, we propose a Diffusion Model-based Review Generation towards EXplainable Recommendation named Diffusion-EXR. Diffusion-EXR corrupts the sequence of review embeddings by incrementally introducing varied levels of Gaussian noise to the sequence of word embeddings and learns to reconstruct the original word representations in the reverse process. The nature of DDPM enables our lightweight Transformer backbone to perform excellently in the recommendation review generation task. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that Diffusion-EXR can achieve state-of-the-art review generation for recommendation on two publicly available benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Multi-Behavior Collaborative Filtering with Partial Order Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Representing information of multiple behaviors in the single graph collaborative filtering (CF) vector has been a long-standing challenge. This is because different behaviors naturally form separate behavior graphs and learn separate CF embeddings. Existing models merge the separate embeddings by appointing the CF embeddings for some behaviors as the primary embedding and utilizing other auxiliaries to enhance the primary embedding. However, this approach often results in the joint embedding performing well on the main tasks but poorly on the auxiliary ones. To address the problem arising from the separate behavior graphs, we propose the concept of Partial Order Recommendation Graphs (POG). POG defines the partial order relation of multiple behaviors and models behavior combinations as weighted edges to merge separate behavior graphs into a joint POG. Theoretical proof verifies that POG can be generalized to any given set of multiple behaviors. Based on POG, we propose the tailored Partial Order Graph Convolutional Networks (POGCN) that convolute neighbors' information while considering the behavior relations between users and items. POGCN also introduces a partial-order BPR sampling strategy for efficient and effective multiple-behavior CF training. POGCN has been successfully deployed on the homepage of Alibaba for two months, providing recommendation services for over one billion users. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that POGCN outperforms state-of-the-art multi-behavior baselines across all types of behaviors. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of POGCN in billion-scale recommender systems.</description>

      <title>LLM-Ensemble: Optimal Large Language Model Ensemble Method for E-commerce Product Attribute Value Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Product attribute value extraction is a pivotal component in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the contemporary e-commerce industry. The provision of precise product attribute values is fundamental in ensuring high-quality recommendations and enhancing customer satisfaction. The recently emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in numerous attribute extraction tasks, without the need for domain-specific training data. Nevertheless, varying strengths and weaknesses are exhibited by different LLMs due to the diversity in data, architectures, and hyperparameters. This variation makes them complementary to each other, with no single LLM dominating all others. Considering the diverse strengths and weaknesses of LLMs, it becomes necessary to develop an ensemble method that leverages their complementary potentials. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called LLM-ensemble to ensemble different LLMs' outputs for attribute value extraction. We iteratively learn the weights for different LLMs to aggregate the labels with weights to predict the final attribute value. Not only can our proposed method be proven theoretically optimal, but it also ensures efficient computation, fast convergence, and safe deployment. We have also conducted extensive experiments with various state-of-the-art LLMs, including Llama2-13B, Llama2-70B, PaLM-2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, on Walmart's internal data. Our offline metrics demonstrate that the LLM-ensemble method outperforms all the state-of-the-art single LLMs on Walmart's internal dataset. This method has been launched in several production models, leading to improved Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), Click-Through Rate (CTR), Conversion Rate (CVR), and Add-to-Cart Rate (ATC).</description>

      <title>ERASE: Benchmarking Feature Selection Methods for Deep Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Recommender Systems (DRS) are increasingly dependent on a large number of feature fields for more precise recommendations. Effective feature selection methods are consequently becoming critical for further enhancing the accuracy and optimizing storage efficiencies to align with the deployment demands. This research area, particularly in the context of DRS, is nascent and faces three core challenges. Firstly, variant experimental setups across research papers often yield unfair comparisons, obscuring practical insights. Secondly, the existing literature's lack of detailed analysis on selection attributes, based on large-scale datasets and a thorough comparison among selection techniques and DRS backbones, restricts the generalizability of findings and impedes deployment on DRS. Lastly, research often focuses on comparing the peak performance achievable by feature selection methods, an approach that is typically computationally infeasible for identifying the optimal hyperparameters and overlooks evaluating the robustness and stability of these methods. To bridge these gaps, this paper presents ERASE, a comprehensive bEnchmaRk for feAture SElection for DRS. ERASE comprises a thorough evaluation of eleven feature selection methods, covering both traditional and deep learning approaches, across four public datasets, private industrial datasets, and a real-world commercial platform, achieving significant enhancement. Our code is available online for ease of reproduction.</description>

      <title>Multi-Level Sequence Denoising with Cross-Signal Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommender systems (SRSs) aim to suggest next item for a user based on her historical interaction sequences. Recently, many research efforts have been devoted to attenuate the influence of noisy items in sequences by either assigning them with lower attention weights or discarding them directly. The major limitation of these methods is that the former would still prone to overfit noisy items while the latter may overlook informative items. To the end, in this paper, we propose a novel model named Multi-level Sequence Denoising with Cross-signal Contrastive Learning (MSDCCL) for sequential recommendation. To be specific, we first introduce a target-aware user interest extractor to simultaneously capture users' long and short term interest with the guidance of target items. Then, we develop a multi-level sequence denoising module to alleviate the impact of noisy items by employing both soft and hard signal denoising strategies. Additionally, we extend existing curriculum learning by simulating the learning pattern of human beings. It is worth noting that our proposed model can be seamlessly integrated with a majority of existing recommendation models and significantly boost their effectiveness. Experimental studies on five public datasets are conducted and the results demonstrate that the proposed MSDCCL is superior to the state-of-the-art baselines. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/lalunex/MSDCCL/tree/main.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, motivating researchers to investigate their potential use in recommendation systems. However, directly applying LLMs to recommendation tasks has proven challenging due to the significant disparity between the data used for pre-training LLMs and the specific requirements of recommendation tasks. In this study, we introduce Direct Multi-Preference Optimization (DMPO), a streamlined framework designed to bridge the gap and enhance the alignment of LLMs for recommendation tasks. DMPO enhances the performance of LLM-based recommenders by simultaneously maximizing the probability of positive samples and minimizing the probability of multiple negative samples. We conducted experimental evaluations to compare DMPO against traditional recommendation methods and other LLM-based recommendation approaches. The results demonstrate that DMPO significantly improves the recommendation capabilities of LLMs across three real-world public datasets in few-shot scenarios. Additionally, the experiments indicate that DMPO exhibits superior generalization ability in cross-domain recommendations. A case study elucidates the reasons behind these consistent improvements and also underscores DMPO's potential as an explainable recommendation system.</description>

Abstract: Text embedding methods have become increasingly popular in both industrial and academic fields due to their critical role in a variety of natural language processing tasks. The significance of universal text embeddings has been further highlighted with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) applications such as Retrieval-Augmented Systems (RAGs). While previous models have attempted to be general-purpose, they often struggle to generalize across tasks and domains. However, recent advancements in training data quantity, quality and diversity; synthetic data generation from LLMs as well as using LLMs as backbones encourage great improvements in pursuing universal text embeddings. In this paper, we provide an overview of the recent advances in universal text embedding models with a focus on the top performing text embeddings on Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). Through detailed comparison and analysis, we highlight the key contributions and limitations in this area, and propose potentially inspiring future research directions.</description>

      <title>A Gradient Accumulation Method for Dense Retriever under Memory Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: InfoNCE loss is commonly used to train dense retriever in information retrieval tasks. It is well known that a large batch is essential to stable and effective training with InfoNCE loss, which requires significant hardware resources. Due to the dependency of large batch, dense retriever has bottleneck of application and research. Recently, memory reduction methods have been broadly adopted to resolve the hardware bottleneck by decomposing forward and backward or using a memory bank. However, current methods still suffer from slow and unstable training. To address these issues, we propose Contrastive Accumulation (ContAccum), a stable and efficient memory reduction method for dense retriever trains that uses a dual memory bank structure to leverage previously generated query and passage representations. Experiments on widely used five information retrieval datasets indicate that ContAccum can surpass not only existing memory reduction methods but also high-resource scenario. Moreover, theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm that ContAccum provides more stable dual-encoder training than current memory bank utilization methods.</description>

      <title>LLM-enhanced Reranking in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reranking is a critical component in recommender systems, playing an essential role in refining the output of recommendation algorithms. Traditional reranking models have focused predominantly on accuracy, but modern applications demand consideration of additional criteria such as diversity and fairness. Existing reranking approaches often fail to harmonize these diverse criteria effectively at the model level. Moreover, these models frequently encounter challenges with scalability and personalization due to their complexity and the varying significance of different reranking criteria in diverse scenarios. In response, we introduce a comprehensive reranking framework enhanced by LLM, designed to seamlessly integrate various reranking criteria while maintaining scalability and facilitating personalized recommendations. This framework employs a fully connected graph structure, allowing the LLM to simultaneously consider multiple aspects such as accuracy, diversity, and fairness through a coherent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. A customizable input mechanism is also integrated, enabling the tuning of the language model's focus to meet specific reranking needs. We validate our approach using three popular public datasets, where our framework demonstrates superior performance over existing state-of-the-art reranking models in balancing multiple criteria. The code for this implementation is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Improving Neural Topic Models with Wasserstein Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topic modeling is a dominant method for exploring document collections on the web and in digital libraries. Recent approaches to topic modeling use pretrained contextualized language models and variational autoencoders. However, large neural topic models have a considerable memory footprint. In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation framework to compress a contextualized topic model without loss in topic quality. In particular, the proposed distillation objective is to minimize the cross-entropy of the soft labels produced by the teacher and the student models, as well as to minimize the squared 2-Wasserstein distance between the latent distributions learned by the two models. Experiments on two publicly available datasets show that the student trained with knowledge distillation achieves topic coherence much higher than that of the original student model, and even surpasses the teacher while containing far fewer parameters than the teacher's. The distilled model also outperforms several other competitive topic models on topic coherence.</description>

      <title>Human Action Co-occurrence in Lifestyle Vlogs using Graph Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06219v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the task of automatic human action co-occurrence identification, i.e., determine whether two human actions can co-occur in the same interval of time. We create and make publicly available the ACE (Action Co-occurrencE) dataset, consisting of a large graph of ~12k co-occurring pairs of visual actions and their corresponding video clips. We describe graph link prediction models that leverage visual and textual information to automatically infer if two actions are co-occurring. We show that graphs are particularly well suited to capture relations between human actions, and the learned graph representations are effective for our task and capture novel and relevant information across different data domains. The ACE dataset and the code introduced in this paper are publicly available at https://github.com/MichiganNLP/vlog_action_co-occurrence.</description>

      <title>Prompt Perturbation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The robustness of large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly important as their use rapidly grows in a wide range of domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is considered as a means to improve the trustworthiness of text generation from LLMs. However, how the outputs from RAG-based LLMs are affected by slightly different inputs is not well studied. In this work, we find that the insertion of even a short prefix to the prompt leads to the generation of outputs far away from factually correct answers. We systematically evaluate the effect of such prefixes on RAG by introducing a novel optimization technique called Gradient Guided Prompt Perturbation (GGPP). GGPP achieves a high success rate in steering outputs of RAG-based LLMs to targeted wrong answers. It can also cope with instructions in the prompts requesting to ignore irrelevant context. We also exploit LLMs' neuron activation difference between prompts with and without GGPP perturbations to give a method that improves the robustness of RAG-based LLMs through a highly effective detector trained on neuron activation triggered by GGPP generated prompts. Our evaluation on open-sourced LLMs demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods.</description>

      <title>MSynFD: Multi-hop Syntax aware Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of social media platforms has fueled the rapid dissemination of fake news, posing threats to our real-life society. Existing methods use multimodal data or contextual information to enhance the detection of fake news by analyzing news content and/or its social context. However, these methods often overlook essential textual news content (articles) and heavily rely on sequential modeling and global attention to extract semantic information. These existing methods fail to handle the complex, subtle twists in news articles, such as syntax-semantics mismatches and prior biases, leading to lower performance and potential failure when modalities or social context are missing. To bridge these significant gaps, we propose a novel multi-hop syntax aware fake news detection (MSynFD) method, which incorporates complementary syntax information to deal with subtle twists in fake news. Specifically, we introduce a syntactical dependency graph and design a multi-hop subgraph aggregation mechanism to capture multi-hop syntax. It extends the effect of word perception, leading to effective noise filtering and adjacent relation enhancement. Subsequently, a sequential relative position-aware Transformer is designed to capture the sequential information, together with an elaborate keyword debiasing module to mitigate the prior bias. Extensive experimental results on two public benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness and superior performance of our proposed MSynFD over state-of-the-art detection models.</description>

      <title>Generation of Asset Administration Shell with Large Language Model Agents: Towards Semantic Interoperability in Digital Twins in the Context of Industry 4.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research introduces a novel approach for achieving semantic interoperability in digital twins and assisting the creation of Asset Administration Shell (AAS) as digital twin model within the context of Industry 4.0. The foundational idea of our research is that the communication based on semantics and the generation of meaningful textual data are directly linked, and we posit that these processes are equivalent if the exchanged information can be serialized in text form. Based on this, we construct a "semantic node" data structure in our research to capture the semantic essence of textual data. Then, a system powered by large language models is designed and implemented to process the "semantic node" and generate standardized digital twin models from raw textual data collected from datasheets describing technical assets. Our evaluation demonstrates an effective generation rate of 62-79%, indicating a substantial proportion of the information from the source text can be translated error-free to the target digital twin instance model with the generative capability of large language models. This result has a direct application in the context of Industry 4.0, and the designed system is implemented as a data model generation tool for reducing the manual effort in creating AAS model. In our evaluation, a comparative analysis of different LLMs and an in-depth ablation study of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanisms provide insights into the effectiveness of LLM systems for interpreting technical concepts and translating data. Our findings emphasize LLMs' capability to automate AAS instance creation and contribute to the broader field of semantic interoperability for digital twins in industrial applications. The prototype implementation and evaluation results are presented on our GitHub Repository: https://github.com/YuchenXia/AASbyLLM.</description>

      <title>Ranking with Ties based on Noisy Performance Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of ranking a set of objects based on their performance when the measurement of said performance is subject to noise. In this scenario, the performance is measured repeatedly, resulting in a range of measurements for each object. If the ranges of two objects do not overlap, then we consider one object as 'better' than the other, and we expect it to receive a higher rank; if, however, the ranges overlap, then the objects are incomparable, and we wish them to be assigned the same rank. Unfortunately, the incomparability relation of ranges is in general not transitive; as a consequence, in general the two requirements cannot be satisfied simultaneously, i.e., it is not possible to guarantee both distinct ranks for objects with separated ranges, and same rank for objects with overlapping ranges. This conflict leads to more than one reasonable way to rank a set of objects. In this paper, we explore the ambiguities that arise when ranking with ties, and define a set of reasonable rankings, which we call partial rankings. We develop and analyse three different methodologies to compute a partial ranking. Finally, we show how performance differences among objects can be investigated with the help of partial ranking.</description>

      <title>KU-DMIS at EHRSQL 2024:Generating SQL query via question templatization in EHR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transforming natural language questions into SQL queries is crucial for precise data retrieval from electronic health record (EHR) databases. A significant challenge in this process is detecting and rejecting unanswerable questions that request information beyond the database's scope or exceed the system's capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel text-to-SQL framework that robustly handles out-of-domain questions and verifies the generated queries with query execution.Our framework begins by standardizing the structure of questions into a templated format. We use a powerful large language model (LLM), fine-tuned GPT-3.5 with detailed prompts involving the table schemas of the EHR database system. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on the EHRSQL-2024 benchmark benchmark, a shared task in the ClinicalNLP workshop. Although a straightforward fine-tuning of GPT shows promising results on the development set, it struggled with the out-of-domain questions in the test set. With our framework, we improve our system's adaptability and achieve competitive performances in the official leaderboard of the EHRSQL-2024 challenge.</description>

      <title>"It answers questions that I didn't know I had": Ph.D. Students' Evaluation of an Information Sharing Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary PhD programs can be challenging as the vital information needed by students may not be readily available, it is scattered across university's websites, while tacit knowledge can be obtained only by interacting with people. Hence, there is a need to develop a knowledge management model to create, query, and maintain a knowledge repository for interdisciplinary students. We propose a knowledge graph containing information on critical categories and their relationships, extracted from multiple sources, essential for interdisciplinary PhD students. This study evaluates the usability of a participatory designed knowledge graph intended to facilitate information exchange and decision-making. The usability findings demonstrate that interaction with this knowledge graph benefits PhD students by notably reducing uncertainty and academic stress, particularly among newcomers. Knowledge graph supported them in decision making, especially when choosing collaborators in an interdisciplinary setting. Key helpful features are related to exploring student faculty networks, milestones tracking, rapid access to aggregated data, and insights into crowdsourced fellow students' activities. The knowledge graph provides a solution to meet the personalized needs of doctoral researchers and has the potential to improve the information discovery and decision-making process substantially. It also includes the tacit knowledge exchange support missing from most current approaches, which is critical for this population and establishing interdisciplinary collaborations. This approach can be applied to other interdisciplinary programs and domains globally.</description>
