      <title>Harnessing Piezoelectric Shear Actuators for Vibration Control in Sandwich Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study found that integrating shear piezo-transducers inside the beam offers a compact and efficient solution that enables localized damping control without compromising structural integrity. However, the conventional approach of placing the piezos outside the substrate faces challenges and limited accessibility to industrial applications. We determine damping performance for long and slender sandwich beam structures utilizing active vibration control by internally placed piezoelectric shear sensors and actuators. Experimental and numerical results are presented for a clamped-free sandwich beam structure constructed with two stainless steel facings composed of a core layer of foam and a piezoelectric shear-actuator and sensor. This approach of internal actuator and sensor tends to tackle the problems within (high-tech) systems, i.e. mechanical vibrations, a limited amount of design volume, and vulnerability of externally placed piezoelectric transducers to outside conditions. By this new internal sensor-actuator approach, this study addresses a significant gap in the literature. The location of the sensor and actuator has been defined by numerical investigation of the \textit{modal shear strain} and the \textit{effective electro-mechanical coupling coefficient}. The frequency response of the sandwich beam structure has been evaluated using both numerical and experimental investigation. Positive Position Feedback has been employed on the numerical response to simulate the damping performance for the fundamental mode. Different controller gains have been used to analyze the trade-off between effective resonance suppression and increased low-frequency gain. The tip vibrations at the fundamental mode have been reduced from 5.01 mm to 0.34 mm amplitude at steady state, which represents a significant reduction.</description>

      <title>Flat band excitons in a three-dimensional supertwisted spiral transition metal dichalcogenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new frontier in van der Waals twistronics is the development of three-dimensional (3D) supertwisted materials, where each successive atomic layer rotates by the same angle. While two-dimensional (2D) moire systems have been extensively studied, the unique phenomena arising from 3D twistronics remain largely unexplored. In this work, we report the discovery of flat-band excitons in 3D supertwisted WS2, revealed by systematic photoluminescence (PL) experiments and electronic structure calculations. These excitons retain key features of 2D moire transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)-such as layer confinement, moire-driven localization, and strong Coulomb interactions-while also offering advantages in scalability and enhanced optical responses in three dimensions. Beyond the PL signatures reminiscent of 2D A excitons, we observe novel direct and indirect exciton emission uniquely tied to the supertwist geometry. Using generalized Bloch band theory and local density of states calculations that incorporate screw rotational symmetry, we uncovered the coexistence of 2D and 3D flatband gaps. These flat-band excitons serve as sensitive probes of the electronic properties of 3D supertwisted semiconductors and open new pathways for applications in quantum optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>A Review on Improving PSC Performance through Charge Carrier Management: Where We Stand and What's Next?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) represent a breakthrough in photovoltaic technology, combining high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), ease of fabrication, and tunable optoelectronic properties. However, their commercial viability is limited by critical issues such as charge carrier recombination, interfacial defects, instability under environmental stress, and toxicity of lead-based components. This review systematically examines recent advancements in charge carrier management strategies aimed at overcoming these limitations. Initially, fundamental mechanisms governing carrier generation, separation, transport, and recombination are outlined to provide a clear foundation. The study then delves into an in-depth analysis of carrier lifetime and mobility, evaluating recent methodologies for their enhancement through compositional engineering and structural optimization. Subsequently, trap state passivation techniques and interface engineering approaches are reviewed, with a particular focus on their impact on device stability and efficiency. The review also discusses long-term stability strategies and emerging trends in lead-free and scalable PSC technologies. In this work, recent strategies for charge carrier management are systematically categorized, comparative analyses are provided and synergistic solutions with high potential for real-world implementation are highlighted. By synthesizing data and perspectives from over thirty recent studies, this article offers a comprehensive roadmap for researchers seeking to optimize PSC performance and accelerate their transition toward commercial application.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable nanophotonic microcavities via integrated thermometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated photonic devices that can be co-packaged with electronics and can operate in real-world environments will enable many important applications, such as optical interconnects, quantum information processing, precision measurements, spectroscopy, and microwave generation. Significant progress has been made over the past two decades on increasing the functional complexity of photonic chips. However, the most critical challenge that remains is the lack of scalable techniques to overcome perturbations arising from environmental thermal noise and thermal crosstalk from co-packaged electronics and other photonic devices sharing the same substrate. Here, we propose and demonstrate a fully-integrated scheme to monitor and stabilize the temperature of a high-Q microresonator in a Si-based chip. We show that when stabilized, the microresonator exhibits remarkable resilience against external thermal noise and can serve as a fully-integrated photonic frequency reference. By simply changing the temperature set-point, the cavity resonance frequency can be repeatably tuned without any hysteresis over several hours. We also show that the frequency of a distributed feedback (DFB) laser can be stabilized to this microresonator and realize a 48 dB reduction in its frequency drift, resulting in its center wavelength staying within +-0.5 pm of the mean over the duration of 50 hours in the presence of significant ambient fluctuations. This performance is superior to many commercial DFB systems and is highly suitable for use in data-communication systems. Finally, we demonstrate that the technique can be implemented to stabilize a soliton modelocked Kerr comb against significant ambient and crosstalk thermal noise, without the need for photodetection, paving the way for Kerr-comb-based photonic devices that can operate in the desired modelocked state indefinitely.</description>

      <title>2D semiconductors as integrated light sources for plasmonic waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 2D materials are compatible with many material platforms as they adhere to other materials strictly by van der Waals interactions. This, together with the variety of band gaps found among transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), makes them uniquely interesting to study for on-chip light sources, as the photonic integrated circuit (PIC) industry is developing into several material platforms depending on the application (gold, silicon, silicon nitride, indium phosphide, etc). 2D materials could thus potentially provide a universal on-chip light source (and detector) scheme for all PIC platforms in the future. Here we show recent results on how exfoliated monolayer TMDC flakes can be integrated with plasmonic slot-waveguides and plasmonic dipole antenna couplers to inject their photoluminescence into plasmonic waveguides as a first step towards future on-chip light sources for such systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable Etch-Free Transfer of Low-Dimensional Materials from Metal Films to Diverse Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-dimensional materials hold great promises for exploring emergent physical phenomena, nanoelectronics, and quantum technologies. Their synthesis often depends on catalytic metal films, from which the synthesized materials must be transferred to insulating substrates to enable device functionality and minimize interfacial interactions during quantum investigations. Conventional transfer methods, such as chemical etching or electrochemical delamination, degrade material quality, limit scalability, or prove incompatible with complex device architectures. Here, a scalable, etch-free transfer technique is presented, employing Field's metal (51% In, 32.5% Bi, and 16.5% Sn by weight) as a low-melting-point mechanical support to gently delaminate low-dimensional materials from metal films without causing damage. Anchoring the metal film during separation prevents tearing and preserves material integrity. As a proof of concept, atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are transferred from Au(111)/mica to dielectric substrates, including silicon dioxide (SiO_2) and single-crystalline lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl). Comprehensive characterization confirms the preservation of structural and chemical integrity throughout the transfer process. Wafer-scale compatibility and device integration are demonstrated by fabricating GNR-based field-effect transistors (GNRFETs) that exhibit room-temperature switching with on/off current ratios exceeding 10^3. This method provides a scalable and versatile platform for integrating low-dimensional materials into advanced low-dimensional materials-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed network paradigm with data generation and background noise removal for diverse distributed acoustic sensing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has attracted considerable attention across various fields and artificial intelligence (AI) technology plays an important role in DAS applications to realize event recognition and denoising. Existing AI models require real-world data (RWD), whether labeled or not, for training, which is contradictory to the fact of limited available event data in real-world scenarios. Here, a physics-informed DAS neural network paradigm is proposed, which does not need real-world events data for training. By physically modeling target events and the constraints of real world and DAS system, physical functions are derived to train a generative network for generation of DAS events data. DAS debackground net is trained by using the generated DAS events data to eliminate background noise in DAS data. The effectiveness of the proposed paradigm is verified in event identification application based on a public dataset of DAS spatiotemporal data and in belt conveyor fault monitoring application based on DAS time-frequency data, and achieved comparable or better performance than data-driven networks trained with RWD. Owing to the introduction of physical information and capability of background noise removal, the paradigm demonstrates generalization in same application on different sites. A fault diagnosis accuracy of 91.8% is achieved in belt conveyor field with networks which transferred from simulation test site without any fault events data of test site and field for training. The proposed paradigm is a prospective solution to address significant obstacles of data acquisition and intense noise in practical DAS applications and explore more potential fields for DAS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model and a rigorous method to calculate the transmission coefficient of silicon micro-rings with complex waveguide cross-section including non-linear effects and self-heating, with very short simulation times. The method is applied to the design of MRRs in the SISCAP platform with high Q and reduced non-linearity, namely due to two photon absorption and free carrier absorption. We demonstrate that the free carrier diffusion in rib waveguides and Shockely-Read-Hall recombination play a fundamental role in reducing the impact of non-linearities in the ring.</description>

      <title>Narrow beam and low-sidelobe two-dimensional beam steering on thin-film lithium niobate optical phased array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical beam steering has become indispensable in free-space optical communications, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), mapping, and projection. Optical phased array (OPA) leads this field, yet conventional versions still suffer from a narrow steering field of view (FOV), insufficient sidelobe suppression, and limited angular resolution. Thin-film lithium niobate (LN), with its strong Pockels electro-optic (EO) effect, offers a powerful integrated-photonics platform to overcome these limitations. Here we present a two-dimensional (2D) EO-steered OPA based on a non-uniformly spaced X-cut thin-film LN ridge-waveguide array. A superlattice ridge design suppresses optical crosstalk to -20 dB, enabling low-sidelobe far-field radiation. Using particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, we transform a uniformly spaced array into an optimized non-uniform design, largely improving angular resolution while maintaining sidelobe suppression. When combined with a single-radiating trapezoidal end-fire emitter incorporating an etched grating, the device produces a main-lobe beam width of 0.99 degree*0.63 degree from an aperture of only 140 um*250 um, achieving a wide 2D steering range of 47 degree*9.36 degree with a 20 dB sidelobe-suppression ratio. These results highlight thin-film LN OPA as a compelling route toward heterogeneous, compact, and high-performance EO beam-steering modules and ultra-miniaturized optical modulators.</description>

      <title>Wurtzite AlScN/AlN Superlattice Ferroelectrics Enable Endurance Beyond 1010 Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wurtzite ferroelectrics are rapidly emerging as a promising material class for next-generation non-volatile memory technologies, owing to their large remanent polarization, intrinsically ordered three-dimensional crystal structure, and full compatibility with CMOS processes and back-end-of-line (BEOL) integration. However, their practical implementation remains critically constrained by a severe endurance bottleneck: under conditions where the remanent polarization (2Pr) reaches or exceeds 200 uC/cm^2, devices typically undergo catastrophic failure before reaching 10^8 cycles. Here, we report a vacancy-confining superlattice strategy that addresses this limitation, achieving reliable ferroelectric switching beyond 10^10 cycles while preserving saturated polarization (2Pr &gt;= 200 uC/cm^2). This is achieved by embedding periodic ultrathin AlN layers within AlScN films, forming wurtzite AlScN/AlN superlattices, in conjunction with a dynamic recovery protocol that actively stabilizes the defect landscape throughout repeated cycling. Atomic-resolution imaging and EELS spectrum imaging technique, supported by first-principles calculations, reveal a self-regulated defect topology in which nitrogen vacancies are spatially confined by heterostructure energy barriers and dynamically re-trapped into energetically favorable lattice sites. This dual spatial-energetic confinement mechanism effectively inhibits both long-range percolative migration and local defect clustering, enabling such an ultrahigh endurance exceeding 10^10 cycles and limiting polarization degradation to below 3% after 10^9 cycles. These findings establish nitrogen vacancy topology stabilization as a foundational design principle for reliable operation of wurtzite ferroelectrics, providing a scalable and CMOS-compatible platform for future high-endurance ferroelectric memory technologies.</description>

Abstract: The propagation and attenuation characteristics of ground vibrations are of significant importance for assessing the interference of environmental factors, such as vehicles, on vibration-sensitive structures such as precision instruments. To investigate the impact of ground vibrations on the Beijing High Energy Photon Source (HEPS). This study conducted swept-frequency excitation tests at the HEPS site using an electrodynamic vibrator operating within the 1-100 Hz frequency range. Based on the experimental data, a hybrid iterative fitting method combining machine learning and formulaic intelligent generation is proposed, utilizing the Bornitz formula as the foundation. Through a data-driven approach, the propagation and attenuation laws of ground vibrations are formulated. The computational error of the formula is estimated using probabilistic analysis, and. And the physical rationality of the formula is elucidated. Finally, by comparing the proposed method with empirical formulas from previous studies and black-box machine learning models, it is demonstrated that the method introduced in this research offers substantial advantages in terms of accuracy and interpretability. This method holds universal value for the discovery of the propagation and attenuation laws of ground vibrations.</description>

      <title>Information Dynamics in Quantum Harmonic Systems: Insights from Toy Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores quantum information dynamics using a toy model of coupled harmonic oscillators, focusing on the interplay between mutual information, synchronization, and circuit complexity. We examine how variations in coupling strength, detuning and external factors, such as a magnetic field, influence information flow and computational metrics. Through exact Gaussian methods we determine the circuit depth for generating target states, examine time-dependent effects, and show that increased fidelity corresponds to more regular behavior. In the context of ion transport, we compare sudden and adiabatic protocols, quantifying their fidelity-complexity through a nonadiabaticity metric. This analysis demonstrates the superior performance of smooth control sequences in minimizing operational errors. We also establish synchronization and mutual information as complementary but distinct measures of quantum correlations, with particularly divergent behavior in nonlinear regimes.</description>

Abstract: Membranes of complex oxides like perovskite SrTiO3 extend the multi-functional promise of oxide electronics into the nanoscale regime of two-dimensional materials. Here we demonstrate that free-standing oxide membranes supply a reconfigurable platform for nano-photonics based on propagating surface phonon polaritons. We apply infrared near-field imaging and -spectroscopy enabled by a tunable ultrafast laser to study pristine nano-thick SrTiO3 membranes prepared by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. As predicted by coupled mode theory, we find that strong coupling of interfacial polaritons realizes symmetric and antisymmetric hybridized modes with simultaneously tunable negative and positive group velocities. By resolving reflection of these propagating modes from membrane edges, defects, and substrate structures, we quantify their dispersion with position-resolved nano-spectroscopy. Remarkably, we find polariton negative dispersion is both robust and tunable through choice of membrane dielectric environment and thickness and propose a novel design for in-plane Veselago lensing harnessing this control. Our work lays the foundation for tunable transformation optics at the nanoscale using polaritons in a wide range of freestanding complex oxide membranes.</description>

      <title>An accurate measurement of parametric array using a spurious sound filter topologically equivalent to a half-wavelength resonator</title>

Abstract: Parametric arrays (PA) offer exceptional directivity and compactness compared to conventional loudspeakers, facilitating various acoustic applications. However, accurate measurement of audio signals generated by PA remains challenging due to spurious ultrasonic sounds arising from microphone nonlinearities. Existing filtering methods, including Helmholtz resonators, phononic crystals, polymer films, and grazing incidence techniques, exhibit practical constraints such as size limitations, fabrication complexity, or insufficient attenuation. To address these issues, we propose and demonstrate a novel acoustic filter based on the design of a half-wavelength resonator. The developed filter exploits the nodal plane in acoustic pressure distribution, effectively minimizing microphone exposure to targeted ultrasonic frequencies. Fabrication via stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing ensures high dimensional accuracy, which is crucial for high-frequency acoustic filters. Finite element method (FEM) simulations guided filter optimization for suppression frequencies at 40 kHz and 60 kHz, achieving high transmission loss (TL) around 60 dB. Experimental validations confirm the filter's superior performance in significantly reducing spurious acoustic signals, as reflected in frequency response, beam pattern, and propagation curve measurements. The proposed filter ensures stable and precise acoustic characterization, independent of measurement distances and incidence angles. This new approach not only improves measurement accuracy but also enhances reliability and reproducibility in parametric array research and development.</description>

      <title>Alternating Spintronics: Capacitive Behavior of Spin Valves and Resonator Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the time-dependent spin transport phenomena in magnetic heterostructures under alternating currents (AC), advancing the relatively underdeveloped field of alternating spintronics. Employing a time-dependent spin diffusion model, we show that the interplay of AC frequencies and spin relaxation times reveals significant differences in spin accumulation patterns compared to conventional direct current (DC) scenarios. Of particular interest is the emergence of capacitive-like impedance in a spin valve under AC conditions, which is especially pronounced in antiparallel spin configurations. These findings open up possibilities for developing high-frequency spintronic devices, including the proposed "spin resonator", which functions like a standard LC resonator but without a traditional capacitor.</description>
