      <title>Simulation and inference methods for non-Markovian stochastic biochemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic models of biochemical reaction networks are widely used to capture intrinsic noise in cellular systems. The typical formulation of these models are based on Markov processes for which there is extensive research on efficient simulation and inference. However, there are biological processes, such as gene transcription and translation, that introduce history dependent dynamics requiring non-Markovian processes to accurately capture the stochastic dynamics of the system. This greater realism comes with additional computational challenges for simulation and parameter inference. We develop efficient stochastic simulation algorithms for well-mixed non-Markovian stochastic biochemical reaction networks with delays that depend on system state and time. Our methods generalize the next reaction method and $\tau$-leaping method to support arbitrary inter-event time distributions while preserving computational scalability. We also introduce a coupling scheme to generate exact non-Markovian sample paths that are positively correlated to an approximate non-Markovian $\tau$-leaping sample path. This enables substantial computational gains for Bayesian inference of model parameters though multifidelity simulation-based inference schemes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a gene regulation model with delayed auto-inhibition, showing substantial gains in both simulation accuracy and inference efficiency of two orders of magnitude. These results extend the practical applicability of non-Markovian models in systems biology and beyond.</description>

      <title>Imperfect molecular detection renormalizes apparent kinetic rates in stochastic gene regulatory networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imperfect molecular detection in single-cell experiments introduces technical noise that obscures the true stochastic dynamics of gene regulatory networks. While binomial models of molecular capture provide a principled description of imperfect detection, they have so far been analyzed only for simple gene-expression models that do not explicitly account for regulation. Here, we extend binomial models of capture to general gene regulatory networks to understand how imperfect capture reshapes the observed time-dependent statistics of molecular counts. Our results reveal when capture effects correspond to a renormalization of a subset of the kinetic rates and when they cannot be absorbed into effective rates, providing a systematic basis for interpreting noisy single-cell measurements. In particular, we show that rate renormalization emerges either under significant transcription factor abundance or when promoter-state transitions occur on a distinct (much slower or faster) timescale than other reactions. In these cases, technical noise causes the apparent mean burst size of synthesized gene products to appear reduced while transcription factor binding reactions appear faster. These effects hold for gene regulatory networks of arbitrary connectivity and remain valid under time-dependent kinetic rates.</description>

      <title>MoRSAIK: Sequence Motif Reactor Simulation, Analysis and Inference Kit in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Origins of life research investigates how life could emerge from prebiotic chemistry only. One possible explanation provides the RNA world hypothesis. It states that life could emerge from RNA strands only, storing and transferring biological information, as well as catalyzing reactions as ribozymes. Before this state could have emerged, however, the prebiotic world was probably a purely chemical pool of short RNA strands with random sequences and without biological function performing hybridization and dehybridization, as well as ligation and cleavage. In this context relevant questions are what are the conditions that allow longer RNA strands to be built and how can information carrying in RNA sequence emerge?
  In order to investigate such RNA reactors, efficient simulations are needed because the space of possible RNA sequences increases exponentially with the length of the strands, as well as the number of reactions between two strands. In addition, simulations have to be compared to experimental data for validation and parameter calibration. Here, we present the MoRSAIK python package for sequence motif (or k-mer) reactor simulation, analysis and inference. It enables users to simulate RNA sequence motif dynamics in the mean field approximation as well as to infer the reaction parameters from data with Bayesian methods and to analyze results by computing observables and plotting. MoRSAIK simulates an RNA reactor by following the reactions and the concentrations of all strands inside up to a certain length (of four nucleotides by default). Longer strands are followed indirectly, by tracking the concentrations of their containing sequence motifs of that maximum length.</description>
