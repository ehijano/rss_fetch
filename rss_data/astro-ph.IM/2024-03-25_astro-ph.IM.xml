      <title>Self-Consistent Atmosphere Representation and Interaction in Photon Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a self-consistent representation of the atmosphere and implement the interactions of light with the atmosphere using a photon Monte Carlo approach. We compile global climate distributions based on historical data, self-consistent vertical profiles of thermodynamic quantities, spatial models of cloud variation and cover, and global distributions of four kinds of aerosols. We then implement refraction, Rayleigh scattering, molecular interactions, Tyndall-Mie scattering to all photons emitted from astronomical sources and various background components using physics first principles. This results in emergent image properties that include: differential astrometry and elliptical point spread functions predicted completely to the horizon, arcminute-scale spatial-dependent photometry variations at 20 mmag for short exposures, excess background spatial variations at 0.2% due the atmosphere, and a point spread function wing due to water droplets. We reproduce the well-known correlations in image characteristics: correlations in altitude with absolute photometry (overall transmission) and relative photometry (spectrally-dependent transmission), anti-correlations of altitude with differential astrometry (non-ideal astrometric patterns) and background levels, and an anti-correlation in absolute photometry with cloud depth. However, we also find further subtle correlations including an anti-correlation of temperature with background and differential astrometry, a correlation of temperature with absolute and relative photometry, an anti-correlation of absolute photometry with humidity, a correlation of humidity with Lunar background, a significant correlation of PSF wing with cloud depth, an anti-correlation of background with cloud depth, and a correlation of lunar background with cloud depth.</description>

      <title>Radiation Effects on Scientific CMOS Detectors for X-ray Astronomy: II. Total Ionizing Dose Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) detectors are a competitive choice for current and upcoming astronomical missions. To understand the performance variations of CMOS detectors in space environment, we investigate the total ionizing dose effects on custom-made large-format X-ray CMOS detectors. Three CMOS detector samples were irradiated with a Co-60 source with a total dose of 70 krad and 105 krad. We test and compare the performance of these detectors before and after irradiation. After irradiation, the dark current increases by roughly 20 to 100 times, and the readout noise increases from 3 e- to 6 e-. The bias level at 50 ms integration time decreases by 13 to 18 Digital Number (DN) at -30 degree. The energy resolution increases from about 150 eV to about 170 eV at 4.5 keV at -30 degree. The conversion gain of the detectors varies for less than 2% after the irradiation. Furthermore, there are about 50 pixels whose bias at 50 ms has changed by more than 20 DN after the exposure to the radiation and about 30 to 140 pixels whose readout noise has increased by over 20 e- at -30 degree at 50 ms integration time. These results demonstrate that the performances of large-format CMOS detectors do not suffer significant degeneration in space environment.</description>

      <title>Large-scale Array for Radio Astronomy on the Farside</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the Royal Society meeting in 2023, we have mainly presented our lunar orbit array concept called DSL, and also briefly introduced a concept of a lunar surface array, LARAF. As the DSL concept had been presented before, in this article we introduce the LARAF. We propose to build an array in the far side of the Moon, with a master station which handles the data collection and processing, and 20 stations with maximum baseline of 10 km. Each station consists 12 membrane antenna units, and the stations are connected to the master station by power line and optical fiber. The array will make interferometric observation in the 0.1-50 MHz band during the lunar night, powered by regenerated fuel cells (RFCs). The whole array can be carried to the lunar surface with a heavy rocket mission, and deployed with a rover in 8 months. Such an array would be an important step in the long term development of lunar based ultralong wavelength radio astronomy. It has a sufficiently high sensitivity to observe many radio sources in the sky, though still short of the dark age fluctuations. We discuss the possible options in the power supply, data communication, deployment, etc.</description>

      <title>Calibration of detector time constant with a thermal source for the POLARBEAR-2A CMB polarization experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Simons Array (SA) project is a ground-based Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization experiment. The SA observes the sky using three telescopes, and POLARBEAR-2A (PB-2A) is the receiver system on the first telescope. For the ground-based experiment, atmospheric fluctuation is the primary noise source that could cause polarization leakage. In the PB-2A receiver system, a continuously rotating half-wave plate (HWP) is used to mitigate the polarization leakage. However, due to the rapid modulation of the polarization signal, the uncertainty in the time constant of the detector results in an uncertainty in the polarization angle. For PB-2A, the time constant of each bolometer needs to be calibrated at the sub-millisecond level to avoid introducing bias to the polarization signal. We have developed a new calibrator system that can be used to calibrate the time constants of the detectors. In this study, we present the design of the calibration system and the preliminary results of the time constant calibration for PB-2A.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provides the observatory with a huge advance in mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy covering the wavelength range of 5 to 28 microns. This paper describes the performance and characteristics of the MIRI imager as understood during observatory commissioning activities, and through its first year of science operations. We discuss the measurements and results of the imager's point spread function, flux calibration, background, distortion and flat fields as well as results pertaining to best observing practices for MIRI imaging, and discuss known imaging artefacts that may be seen during or after data processing. Overall, we show that the MIRI imager has met or exceeded all its pre-flight requirements, and we expect it to make a significant contribution to mid-infrared science for the astronomy community for years to come.</description>

      <title>The first cut is the cheapest: optimizing Athena/X-IFU-like TES detectors resolution by filter truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) instrument on the future ESA mission Athena X-ray Observatory is a cryogenic micro-calorimeter array of Transition Edge Sensor (TES) detectors designed to provide spatially-resolved high-resolution spectroscopy. The onboard reconstruction software provides energy, spatial location and arrival time of incoming X-ray photons hitting the detector. A new processing algorithm based on a truncation of the classical optimal filter and called 0-padding, has been recently proposed aiming to reduce the computational cost without compromising energy resolution. Initial tests with simple synthetic data displayed promising results. This study explores the slightly better performance of the 0-padding filter and assess its final application to real data. The goal is to examine the larger sensitivity to instrumental conditions that was previously observed during the analysis of the simulations. This 0-padding technique is thoroughly tested using more realistic simulations and real data acquired from NASA and NIST laboratories employing X-IFU-like TES detectors. Different fitting methods are applied to the data, and a comparative analysis is performed to assess the energy resolution values obtained from these fittings. The 0-padding filter achieves energy resolutions as good as those obtained with standard filters, even with those of larger lengths, across different line complexes and instrumental conditions. This method proves to be useful for energy reconstruction of X-ray photons detected by the TES detectors provided proper corrections for baseline drift and jitter effects are applied. The finding is highly promising especially for onboard processing, offering efficiency in computational resources and facilitating the analysis of sources with higher count rates at high resolution.</description>

      <title>Straightforward mode hierarchy in eccentric binary black hole mergers and associated waveform model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing publicly available non-spinning eccentric binary black hole (BBH) merger simulations (\href{https://data.black-holes.org/waveforms/catalog.html}{https://data.black-holes.org/waveforms/catalog.html}) from the SXS collaboration~\cite{Hinder:2017sxy}, we present convincing evidence that the waveform phenomenology in eccentric BBH mergers is significantly simpler than previously thought. We find that the eccentric modulations in the amplitudes, phases, and frequencies in different spherical harmonic modes are all related and can be modeled using a single time series modulation. Using this universal eccentric modulation, we provide a model named \texttt{gwNRHME} to seamlessly convert a multi-modal (i.e with several spherical harmonic modes) quasi-circular waveform into multi-modal eccentric waveform if the quadrupolar eccentric waveform is known. This reduces the modelling complexity of eccentric BBH mergers drastically as we now have to model only a single eccentric modulation time-series instead of modelling the effect of eccentricity in all modes. When compared with the NR simulations, our model mismatches are mostly $\sim 10^{-3}$ and are comparable to the numerical errors in the NR simulations. Our method is modular and can be readily added to any quadrupolar non-spinning eccentric waveform model. We make our model publicly available through the \texttt{gwModels} (\href{https://github.com/tousifislam/gwModels}{https://github.com/tousifislam/gwModels}) waveform package.</description>

      <title>The First High-Contrast Images of Near High-Mass X-Ray Binaries with Keck/NIRC2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the study of X-ray binaries has led to major breakthroughs in high-energy astrophysics, their circumbinary environment at scales of $\sim$100--10,000 astronomical units has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we undertake a novel and exploratory study by employing direct and high-contrast imaging techniques on a sample of X-ray binaries, using adaptive optics and the vortex coronagraph on Keck/NIRC2. High-contrast imaging opens up the possibility to search for exoplanets, brown dwarfs, circumbinary companion stars, and protoplanetary disks in these extreme systems. Here, we present the first near-infrared high-contrast images of 13 high-mass X-ray binaries located within $\sim$2--3 kpc. The key results of this campaign involve the discovery of several candidate circumbinary companions ranging from sub-stellar (brown dwarf) to stellar masses. By conducting an analysis based on galactic population models, we discriminate sources that are likely background/foreground stars and isolate those that have a high probability ($\gtrsim 60 - 99\%$) of being gravitationally bound to the X-ray binary. This publication seeks to establish a preliminary catalog for future analyses of proper motion and subsequent observations. With our preliminary results, we calculate the first estimate of the companion frequency and the multiplicity frequency for X-ray binaries: $\approx$0.6 and 1.8 $\pm$ 0.9 respectively, considering only the sources that are most likely bound to the X-ray binary. In addition to extending our comprehension of how brown dwarfs and stars can form and survive in such extreme systems, our study opens a new window to our understanding of the formation of X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Probing $H_0$ and resolving AGN disks with ultrafast photon counters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intensity interferometry is a technique developed many decades ago, that has recently enjoyed a renaissance thanks in part to advances in photodetector technology. We investigate the potential for long-baseline optical intensity interferometry to observe bright, active galactic nuclei (AGN) associated with rapidly accreting supermassive black holes. We argue that realistic telescope arrays similar in area to existing Cherenkov arrays, if equipped with modern high-precision single photon detectors, can achieve a sufficiently high signal to noise ratio not only to detect distant AGN, but also to study them in great detail. We explore the science potential of such observations by considering two examples. First, we find that intensity interferometric observations of bright nearby AGN can allow detailed studies of the central accretion disks powering the AGN, allowing reconstruction of many disk properties like the radial profile. Next, we argue that intensity interferometers can spatially resolve the broad-line regions of AGN at cosmological distances, and thereby provide a geometric determination of the angular diameter distances to those AGN when combined with reverberation mapping. Since this measurement can be performed for AGN at distances of hundreds of megaparsecs, this directly measures the Hubble expansion rate $H_0$, with a precision adequate to resolve the recent Hubble tension. Finally, we speculate on future applications that would be enabled by even larger intensity interferometer arrays.</description>

      <title>Parallax Effect in Microlensing Events due to Free-Floating Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of most important applications of microlensing observations is detecting free-floating planets(FFPs). The time scale of microlensing due to FFPs ($t_{\rm E}$) is short (a few days). Discerning the annual parallax effect in observations from these short-duration events by one observer is barely possible, though their parallax amplitude is larger than that in common events. In microlensing events due to FFPs, the lens-source relative trajectory alters because of the observer's motion by $\boldsymbol{\delta u}$. This deviation is a straight line if $t_{\rm E} \ll P_{\oplus}$, and its size is $\delta u\propto \pi_{\rm{rel}}$ ($P_{\oplus}$ is the observer's orbital period). So, most of observed microlensing events due to close FFPs have simple Paczy\'nsky lightcurves with indiscernible and valuable parallax. To evaluate destructive effects of invisible parallax in such events, we simulate $\sim9650$ microlensing events due to FFPs with $t_{\rm E}&lt;10$ days that are observed only by The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope(\wfirst). We conclude that in half of these microlensing events the missing parallax alters the real lightcurves, changing their shape and derived properties(by $\Delta \chi^{2}\gtrsim100$). By fitting Paczy\'nski lightcurves to these affected events we evaluate the relative and dimensionless deviations in the lensing parameters from their real values ($\delta t_{\rm E}, \delta \rho_{\star}, ...$). We conclude that around $46$ FFPs which are discovered by \wfirst\ have lightcurves highly affected by invisible parallax with $\delta t_{\rm E}&gt;0.1~\rm{and}~\delta \rho_{\star}&gt;0.1$. Our study reveals the importance of simultaneous and dense observations of microlensing events viewed by \wfirst\ by other observers rotating the Sun in different orbits.</description>

      <title>Towards multi-messenger observations of core-collapse supernovae harboring choked jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, choked jets have attracted particular attention as potential sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos. Testing this hypothesis is challenging because of the missing gamma-ray counterpart, hence the identification of other electromagnetic signatures is crucial. A choked-jet source is expected harboring in core-collapse supernovae with extended hydrogen envelopes, leading to the release of ultraviolet and optical emission for a few days. The ultraviolet band will be visible with an unprecedentedly large field of view by the future mission satellite ULTRASAT, for which we investigate the detection prospects in relation to the chocked source visibility in the optical band with the currently operating telescope ZTF. As these sources can produce neutrinos via hadronic and photohadronic interactions in choked jets, we also investigate how neutrino observations by existing Cherenkov high-energy neutrino telescopes (as IceCube and KM3NeT) can be used in association with electromagnetic signals coming from shock breakout events. By considering fiducial parameters of the source population and instruments performances, we estimate the maximum redshift up to which ULTRASAT and ZTF are able to detect ultraviolet and optical signals from these explosions, respectively. Furthermore, we discuss coordinated multi-messenger observations among those instruments and high-energy neutrino telescopes. ULTRASAT will be able to double the volume of sky currently visible by ZTF for the same emitting sources enlarging the sample of observed Type II supernovae by around 60%. For optimized multi-messenger detections, the delay between neutrino produced at the shock breakout occurrence (during the jet propagation inside the stellar envelope) and ULTRASAT observations should be of around 4(5) days, with a subsequent follow-up by instruments like ZTF about one week after.</description>

      <title>ethraid: A simple method for characterizing long-period companions using Doppler, astrometric, and imaging constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present \texttt{ethraid}, an open source Python package designed to measure the mass ($m_c$) and separation ($a$) of a bound companion from measurements covering a fraction of the orbital period. \texttt{ethraid} constrains $m_c$ and $a$ by jointly modeling radial velocity (RV), astrometric, and/or direct imaging data in a Bayesian framework. Partial orbit data sets, especially those with highly limited phase coverage, are well-represented by a few method-specific summary statistics. By modeling these statistics rather than the original data, \texttt{ethraid} optimizes computational efficiency with minimal reduction in accuracy. \texttt{ethraid} uses importance sampling to efficiently explore the often broad posteriors that arise from partial orbits. The core computations of \texttt{ethraid} are implemented in Cython for speed. We validate \texttt{ethraid}'s performance by using it to constrain the masses and separations of the planetary companions to HD 117207 and TOI-1694. We designed \texttt{ethraid} to be both fast and simple, and to give broad, "quick look" constraints on companion parameters using minimal data. \texttt{ethraid} is pip installable and available on Github.</description>

Abstract: Context. Observing the radio emission from exoplanets is among the most promising methods to detect their magnetic fields and a measurement of an exoplanetary magnetic field will help constrain the planet's interior structure, star-planet interactions, atmospheric escape and dynamics, and habitability. Recently, circularly polarized bursty and slow emission from the $\tau$ Bo\"{o}tis ($\tau$ Boo) exoplanetary system was tentatively detected using LOFAR (LOW-Frequency ARray) beamformed observations. If confirmed, this detection will be a major contribution to exoplanet science. However, follow-up observations are required to confirm this detection.
  Aims. Here, we present such follow-up observations of the $\tau$ Boo system using LOFAR. These observations cover 70$\%$ of the orbital period of $\tau$ Boo b including the orbital phases of the previous tentative detections.
  Methods. We used the BOREALIS pipeline to mitigate radio frequency interference and to search for bursty and slowing varying radio signals. BOREALIS was previously used to find the tentative radio signals from $\tau$ Boo.
  Results. Our new observations do not show any signs of bursty or slow emission from the $\tau$ Bo\"{o}tis exoplanetary system.
  Conclusions. The cause for our non-detection is currently degenerate. It is possible that the tentative radio signals were an unknown instrumental systematic or that we are observing variability in the planetary radio emission due to changes in its host star. More radio data (preferably multi-site) and ancillary observations (e.g. magnetic maps) are required to further investigate the potential radio emission from the $\tau$ Bo\"{o}tis exoplanetary system.</description>

      <title>Wide-Spectral-Band Nuller Insensitive to Finite Stellar Angular Diameter with a One-Dimensional Diffraction-Limited Coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potentially habitable planets around nearby stars less massive than solar-type stars could join targets of the spectroscopy of the planetary reflected light with future space telescopes. However, the orbits of most of these planets occur near the diffraction limit for 6-m-diameter telescopes. Thus, while securing contrast-mitigation ability under a broad spectral bandwidth and a finite stellar angular diameter, we must maintain planetary throughput even at the diffraction-limited angles to be able to reduce the effect of the photon noise within a reasonable observation time. A one-dimensional diffraction-limited coronagraph (1DDLC) observes planets near the diffraction limit with undistorted point spread functions but has a finite-stellar diameter problem in wideband use. This study presents a method for wide-spectral-band nulling insensitive to stellar-angular-diameter by adding a fiber nulling with a Lyot-plane phase mask to the 1DDLC. Designing the pattern of the Lyot-plane mask function focuses on the parity of the amplitude spread function of light. Our numerical simulation shows that the planetary throughput (including the fiber-coupling efficiency) can reach about 11% for about 1.35-$\lambda/D$ planetary separation almost independently of the spectral bandwidth. The simulation also shows the raw contrast of about $4\times10^{-8}$ (the spectral bandwidth of 25%) and $5\times10^{-10}$ (the spectral bandwidth of 10%) for $3\times 10^{-2}$ $\lambda/D$ stellar angular diameter. The planetary throughput depends on the planetary azimuthal angle, which may degrade the exploration efficiency compared to an isotropic throughput but is partially offset by the wide spectral band.</description>

      <title>CHIANTI -- an atomic database for emission lines -- Paper XVIII. Version 11, advanced ionization equilibrium models: density and charge transfer effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Version 11 of the CHIANTI database and software package is presented. Advanced ionization equilibrium models have been added for low charge states of seven elements (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si and S), and represent a significant improvement especially when modelling the solar transition region. The models include the effects of higher electron density and charge transfer on ionization and recombination rates. As an illustration of the difference these models make, a synthetic spectrum is calculated for an electron pressure of 7$\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ K and compared with an active region observation from HRTS. Increases are seen of factors of two to five in the predicted radiances of the strongest lines in the UV from Si IV, C IV, and N V, compared to the previous modelling using the coronal approximation. Much better agreement (within 20\%) with the observation is found for the majority of the lines. The new atomic models better equip both those who are studying the transition region and those who are interpreting emission from higher density astrophysical and laboratory plasma. In addition to the advanced models, several ion datasets have been added or updated, and data for the radiative recombination energy loss rate have been updated.</description>

      <title>Generic gravito-magnetic clock effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity predicts that two counter-orbiting clocks around a spinning mass differ in the time required to complete the same orbit. The difference in these two values for the orbital period is generally referred to as the gravito-magnetic (GM) clock effect. It has been proposed to measure the GM clock effect using atomic clocks carried by satellites in prograde and retrograde orbits around the Earth. The precision and stability required for satellites to accurately perform this measurement remains a challenge for current instrumentation. One of the most accurate clocks in the Universe is a millisecond pulsar, which emits periodic radio pulses with high stability. Timing of the pulsed signals from millisecond pulsars has proven to be very successful in testing predictions of general relativity and the GM clock effect is potentially measurable in binary systems. In this work we derive the generic GM clock effect by considering a slowly-spinning binary system on an elliptical orbit, with both arbitrary mass ratio and arbitrary spin orientations. The spin-orbit interaction introduces a perturbation to the orbit, causing the orbital plane to precess and nutate. We identify several different contributions to the clock effects: the choice of spin supplementary condition and the observer-dependent definition of a full revolution and "nearly-identical" orbits. We discuss the impact of these subtle definitions on the formula for GM clock effects and show that most of the existing formulae in the literature can be recovered under appropriate assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for obtaining unbiased signal estimates in the presence of a significant unknown background, eliminating the need for a parametric model for the background itself. Our approach is based on a minimal set of conditions for observation and background estimators, which are typically satisfied in practical scenarios. To showcase the effectiveness of our method, we apply it to simulated data from the planned dielectric axion haloscope MADMAX.</description>

      <title>Probing the Anisotropy and Non-Gaussianity in the Redshift Space through the Conditional Moments of the First Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Focusing on the redshift space observations with plane-parallel approximation and relying on the rotational dependency of the general definition of excursion sets, we introduce the so-called conditional moments of the first derivative ($cmd$) measures for the smoothed matter density field in three dimensions. We derive the perturbative expansion of $cmd$ for the real space and redshift space where peculiar velocity disturbs the galaxies' observed locations. Our criteria can successfully recognize the contribution of linear Kaiser and Finger-of-God effects. Our results demonstrate that the $cmd$ measure has significant sensitivity for pristine constraining the redshift space distortion parameter $\beta=f/b$ and interestingly, the associated normalized quantity in the Gaussian linear Kaiser limit has only $\beta$ dependency. Implementation of the synthetic anisotropic Gaussian field approves the consistency between the theoretical and numerical results. Including the first-order contribution of non-Gaussianity perturbatively in the $cmd$ criterion implies that the N-body simulations for the Quijote suite in the redshift space have been mildly skewed with a higher value for the threshold greater than zero. The non-Gaussianity for the perpendicular direction to the line of sight in the redshift space for smoothing scales $R\gtrsim 20$ Mpc h$^{-1}$ is almost the same as the real space. In contrast, the non-Gaussianity along the line of sight direction in redshift space is magnified. The Fisher forecasts indicate an almost significant enhancement in constraining the cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and $n_s$ when using $cmd+cr$ jointly.</description>

      <title>Direct detection and characterization of exoplanets using imaging Fourier transform spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space-based direct imaging provides prospects for detection and spectral characterization of exoplanets at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Integral field spectrographs (IFS) have been historically baselined for these mission concepts. However, multiple studies have revealed that detector noise is a serious obstacle for such instruments when observing extremely faint targets such as Earth-like planets. Imaging Fourier transform spectrographs (iFTS) are generally less sensitive to detector noise, and have several other compelling features such as simultaneous imaging and spectroscopy, smaller-format detector requirements, and variable spectral resolution. To date, they have not been studied as options for such missions.
  In this work, we compare the capabilities of integral field spectrographs and imaging Fourier transform spectrographs to directly obtain spectra from an Earth-like planet using analytic and numerical models. Specifically, we compare the required exposure time to achieve the same signal-to-noise ratio of the two architectures over a range of detector and optical system parameters. We find that for a 6-meter telescope, an IFS outperforms an iFTS at optical wavelengths. In the near-IR, the relative efficiency of an IFS and iFTS depends on the instrument design and detector noise. An iFTS will be more efficient than an IFS if the readout noise of near-IR detector is above 2-3 e-/pix/frame (t_frame=1000s), which correspond to half to one-third of detector noise of the state-of-art. However, if the readout noise is further reduced to below this threshold, the performance of an IFS will experience a substantial improvement and become more efficient. These results motivate consideration of an iFTS as an alternative option for future direct imaging space missions in the near-IR.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the evidence for precession in GW200129 with machine learning noise mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GW200129 is claimed to be the first-ever observation of the spin-disk orbital precession detected with gravitational waves (GWs) from an individual binary system. However, this claim warrants a cautious evaluation because the GW event coincided with a broadband noise disturbance in LIGO Livingston caused by the 45 MHz electro-optic modulator system. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art neural network that is able to model and mitigate the broadband noise from the LIGO Livingston interferometer. We also demonstrate that our neural network mitigates the noise better than the algorithm used by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Finally, we re-analyse GW200129 with the improved data quality and show that the evidence for precession is still observed.</description>

      <title>High-precision astrometry with VVV -- II. A near-infrared extension of Gaia into the Galactic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims. We use near-infrared, ground-based data from the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey to indirectly extend the astrometry provided by the Gaia catalog to objects in heavily-extincted regions towards the Galactic bulge and plane that are beyond Gaia's reach. Methods. We make use of the state-of-the-art techniques developed for high-precision astrometry and photometry with the Hubble Space Telescope to process the VVV data. We employ empirical, spatially-variable, effective point-spread functions and local transformations to mitigate the effects of systematic errors, like residual geometric distortion and image motion, and to improve measurements in crowded fields and for faint stars. We also anchor our astrometry to the absolute reference frame of the Gaia Data Release 3. Results. We measure between 20 and 60 times more sources than Gaia in the region surrounding the Galactic center, obtaining an single-exposure precision of about 12 mas and a proper-motion precision of better than 1 mas yr$^{-1}$ for bright, unsaturated sources. Our astrometry provides an extension of Gaia into the Galactic center. We publicly release the astro-photometric catalogs of the two VVV fields considered in this work, which contain a total of $\sim$ 3.5 million sources. Our catalogs cover $\sim$ 3 sq. degrees, about 0.5% of the entire VVV survey area.</description>

      <title>Global Analysis of LISA Data with Galactic Binaries and Massive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a planned space-based observatory to measure gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band. This frequency band is expected to be dominated by signals from millions of Galactic binaries and tens of merging massive black hole binaries. The LISA Data Challenge 2a is focused on robust signal extraction from a blend of these two types of gravitational wave signals. Here, we introduce a novel high performance and cost-effective global fit pipeline extracting and characterizing galactic binary and massive black hole binary signals and estimate the noise of the residual. We perform the pipeline in a time-evolving weekly analysis starting with an observation time of 1 week until we reach a full year. As expected we detect more galactic binaries and massive black hole binaries bringing the noise estimate of the residual closer to the instrument noise with each week of additional observation time. Furthermore, we present a novel maximum likelihood estimate-based algorithm for extracting multiple massive black hole binaries. Additionally, we demonstrate a massive black hole binary signal extraction with a more accurate LISA response, considering higher harmonic modes, in a noisy data set.</description>
