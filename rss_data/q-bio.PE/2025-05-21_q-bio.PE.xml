      <title>Analysis of COVID-19 Infection Dynamics: Extended SIR Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a detailed mathematical investigation into the dynamics of COVID-19 infections through extended Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiological models. By incorporating demographic factors such as birth and death rates, we enhance the classical Kermack-McKendrick framework to realistically represent long-term disease progression. Using empirical data from four COVID-19 epidemic waves in Orange County, California, between January 2020 and March 2022, we estimate key parameters and perform stability and bifurcation analyses. Our results consistently indicate endemic states characterized by stable spiral equilibria due to reproduction numbers (R0) exceeding unity across all waves. Additionally, the inclusion of vaccination demonstrates the potential to reduce the effective reproduction number below one, shifting the system towards a stable disease-free equilibrium. Our analysis underscores the critical role of latency periods in shaping epidemic dynamics and highlights actionable insights for public health interventions aimed at COVID-19 control and eventual eradication.</description>

      <title>Functional bottlenecks can emerge from non-epistatic underlying traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein fitness landscapes frequently exhibit epistasis, where the effect of a mutation depends on the genetic context in which it occurs, \textit{i.e.}, the rest of the protein sequence. Epistasis increases landscape complexity, often resulting in multiple fitness peaks. In its simplest form, known as global epistasis, fitness is modeled as a non-linear function of an underlying additive trait. In contrast, more complex epistasis arises from a network of (pairwise or many-body) interactions between residues, which cannot be removed by a single non-linear transformation. Recent studies have explored how global and network epistasis contribute to the emergence of functional bottlenecks - fitness landscape topologies where two broad high-fitness basins, representing distinct phenotypes, are separated by a bottleneck that can only be crossed via one or a few mutational paths. Here, we introduce and analyze a simple model of global epistasis with an additive underlying trait. We demonstrate that functional bottlenecks arise with high probability if the model is properly calibrated. Our results underscore the necessity of sufficient heterogeneity in the mutational effects selected by evolution for the emergence of functional bottlenecks. Moreover, we show that the model agrees with experimental findings, at least in small enough combinatorial mutational spaces.</description>

      <title>The Problematic Hoover Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hoover index H, derived from the distribution of population density, has a long history in population geography. But it is prone to misinterpretation and serious measurement artifacts, some of which have been recognized for years. Here its problems, old and new, are put in a common framework and quantitatively dissected with thought-experiments, experimental reaggregation over a thousand-fold range, modeling, and simulation. H has long been interpreted as urbanization, which simple examples show is incorrect. Values of H near zero are taken as an ideal or primordial state, but the mechanism and distributions of settlement growth show that H can be expected in the range 0.4-0.7 and remain nearly constant across continents, centuries of time, and wide ranges of population density. Technically, the measurement of H is confounded by choices of aggregation scale, inclusion of unpopulated areas, and truncated input data, which produce wide swings in its value. Spatially isotropic modeling and simulation reproduce its trends with aggregation scale and time, nullifying many frontier- or nation-specific interpretations. I suggest methods to recognize and address its major artifacts and point out several trends with valid interpretations.</description>

      <title>Credible Sets of Phylogenetic Tree Topology Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Credible intervals and credible sets, such as highest posterior density (HPD) intervals, form an integral statistical tool in Bayesian phylogenetics, both for phylogenetic analyses and for development. Readily available for continuous parameters such as base frequencies and clock rates, the vast and complex space of tree topologies poses significant challenges for defining analogous credible sets. Traditional frequency-based approaches are inadequate for diffuse posteriors where sampled trees are often unique. To address this, we introduce novel and efficient methods for estimating the credible level of individual tree topologies using tractable tree distributions, specifically Conditional Clade Distributions (CCDs). Furthermore, we propose a new concept called $\alpha$ credible CCD, which encapsulates a CCD whose trees collectively make up $\alpha$ probability. We present algorithms to compute these credible CCDs efficiently and to determine credible levels of tree topologies as well as of subtrees. We evaluate the accuracy of these credible set methods leveraging simulated and real datasets. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of our methods, we use well-calibrated simulation studies to evaluate the performance of different CCD models. In particular, we show how the credible set methods can be used to conduct rank-uniformity validation and produce Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) plots, supplementing standard coverage analyses for continuous parameters.</description>

      <title>Inferring birth versus death dynamics for ecological interactions in stochastic heterogeneous populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the significance of ecological interactions and separation of birth and death dynamics in heterogeneous stochastic populations via general birth-death processes. Interactions can manifest through the birth dynamics, the death dynamics, or some combination of the two. The underlying mechanisms are important but often implicit in population-level data. We propose an inference method for disambiguating the types of interaction and the birth and death processes from population size time series data of a stochastic $n$-type heterogeneous population. The interspecies interactions considered can be competitive, antagonistic, or mutualistic. We show that different pairs of birth and death rates with the same net growth rate result in different time series statistics. Then, the inference method is validated in the example of a birth-death process inspired by the two-type Lotka-Volterra interaction dynamics. Utilizing stochastic fluctuations enables us to estimate additional parameters in this stochastic Lotka-Volterra model, which are not identifiable in a deterministic model.</description>

      <title>Coexistence vs collapse in transposon populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transposons are small, self-replicating DNA sequences found in every branch of life. Often, one transposon will parasitize another, forming a tiny intracellular ecosystem. In some species these ecosystems thrive, while in others they go extinct, yet little is known about when or why this occurs. Here, we present a stochastic model for these ecosystems and discover a transition from stable coexistence to population collapse when the propensity for a transposon to replicate comes to exceed that of its parasites. Our model also predicts that replication rates should be low in equilibrium, which appears to be true of many transposons in nature.</description>

      <title>To Be a Truster or Not to Be: Evolutionary Dynamics of a Symmetric N-Player Trust Game in Well-Mixed and Networked Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trust and reciprocation of it form the foundation of economic, social and other interactions. While the Trust Game is widely used to study these concepts for interactions between two players, often alternating different roles (i.e., investor and trustee), its extensions to multi-player scenarios have been restricted to instances where players assume only one role. We propose a symmetric N-player Trust Game, in which players alternate between two roles, and the payoff of the player is defined as the average across their two roles and drives the evolutionary game dynamics. We find that prosocial strategies are harder to evolve with the present symmetric N-player Trust Game than with the Public Goods Game, which is well studied. In particular, trust fails to evolve regardless of payoff function nonlinearity in well-mixed populations in the case of the symmetric N-player trust game. In structured populations, nonlinear payoffs can have strong impacts on the evolution of trust. The same nonlinearity can yield substantially different outcomes, depending on the nature of the underlying network. Our results highlight the importance of considering both payoff structures and network topologies in understanding the emergence and maintenance of prosocial behaviours.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Abiogenesis: Thermodynamic Selection and the Emergence of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17975v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of life is often approached through the lens of replication, heredity, or molecular specificity. This paper proposes a thermodynamic framework in which the emergence of life is driven by the persistence of reaction pathways that align energetically with fluctuating environmental inputs. We define a reaction viability inequality based on energy input, return, resilience, and expenditure, which selects for persistent chemical configurations without invoking heredity or genetic encoding.
  We further incorporate entropic dynamics and spatial constraints into an augmented persistence function, showing that systems far from equilibrium can simultaneously increase global entropy while supporting localized chemical order. These refinements lead to the development of the Thermodynamic Abiogenesis Likelihood Model (TALM), a probabilistic extension that estimates the likelihood of persistence-driven selection under various prebiotic and planetary scenarios.
  This framework redefines the conditions under which life-like organization may emerge and provides a testable, general theory for abiogenesis grounded in physical law.</description>
