      <title>The zonal-flow residual does not tend to zero in the limit of small mirror ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intensity of the turbulence in tokamaks and stellarators depends on its ability to excite and sustain zonal flows. Insight into this physics may be gained by studying the ''residual'', i.e. the late-time linear response of the system to an initial perturbation. We investigate this zonal-flow residual in the limit of a small magnetic mirror ratio, where we find that the typical quadratic approximation to RH (Rosenbluth &amp; Hinton, 1998) breaks down. Barely passing particles are in this limit central in determining the resulting level of the residual, which we estimate analytically. The role played by the population with large orbit width provides valuable physical insight into the response of the residual beyond this limit. Applying this result to tokamak, quasi-symmetric and quasi-isodynamic equilibria, using a near-axis approximation, we identify the effect to be more relevant (although small) in the core of quasi-axisymmetric fields, where the residual is smallest. The analysis in the paper also clarifies the relationship between the residual and the geodesic acoustic mode, whose typical theoretical set-ups are similar.</description>

      <title>Interaction of driven "cold" electron plasma wave with thermal bulk mediated by spatial ion inhomogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using high resolution Vlasov - Poisson simulations, evolution of driven ``cold" electron plasma wave (EPW) in the presence of stationary inhomogeneous background of ions is studied. Mode coupling dynamics between ``cold'' EPW with phase velocity $v_{\phi}$ greater than thermal velocity i.e $v_{\phi} \gg v_{thermal}$ and its inhomogeneity induced sidebands is illustrated as an initial value problem. In driven cases, formation of BGK like phase space structures corresponding to sideband modes due to energy exchange from primary mode to bulk particles via wave-wave and wave-particle interactions leading to particle trapping is demonstrated for inhomogeneous plasma. Qualitative comparison studies between initial value perturbation and driven problem is presented, which examines the relative difference in energy transfer time between the interacting modes. Effect of variation in background ion inhomogeneity amplitude as well as ion inhomogeneity scale length on the driven EPWs is reported.</description>

      <title>Reduction of the downward energy flux of non-thermal electrons in the solar flare corona due to co-spatial return current losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High energy electrons carry much of a solar flare's energy. Therefore, understanding changes in electron beam distributions during their propagation is crucial. A key focus of this paper is how the co-spatial return current reduces the energy flux carried by these accelerated electrons. We systematically compute this reduction for various beam and plasma parameters relevant to solar flares. Our 1D model accounts for collisions between beam and plasma electrons, return current electric-field deceleration, thermalization in a warm target approximation, and runaway electron contributions. The results focus on the classical (Spitzer) regime, offering a valuable benchmark for energy flux reduction and its extent. Return current losses are only negligible for the lowest nonthermal fluxes. We calculate the conditions for return current losses to become significant and estimate the extent of the modification to the beam's energy flux density. We also calculate two additional conditions which occur for higher injected fluxes: (1) where runaway electrons become significant, and (2) where current-driven instabilities might become significant, requiring a model that self-consistently accounts for them. Condition (2) is relaxed and the energy flux losses are reduced in the presence of runaway electrons. All results are dependent on beam and co-spatial plasma parameters. We also examine the importance of the reflection of beam electrons by the return-current electric field. We show that the interpretation of a number of flares needs to be reviewed to account for the effects of return currents.</description>

      <title>A higher-level large-eddy filtering strategy for general relativistic fluid simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear simulations of neutron star mergers are complicated by the need to represent turbulent dynamics. As we cannot (yet) perform simulations that resolve accurately both the gravitational-wave scale and the smallest scales at which magneto/hydrodynamic turbulence plays a role, we need to rely on approximations. Addressing this problem in the context of large-eddy models, we outline a coherent Lagrangian filtering framework that allows us to explore the many issues that arise, linking conceptual problems to practical implementations and the interpretation of the results. We develop understanding crucial for quantifying unavoidable uncertainties in current and future numerical relativity simulations and consider the implications for neutron-star parameter estimation and constraints on the equation of state of matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Ponderomotive electron physics captured in single-fluid extended MHD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known ponderomotive force, arising from the interaction of matter and light, has critical implications across a broad range of fields from laser fusion and astrophysics to laser diagnostics and even pulsed-power experiments. This pseudo-potential pushes electrons, which through coulomb forces causes ion density modulations that can steepen with profound implications. When used intentionally, density modulations can be used for plasma gratings, which are essential for optical components operating in extreme conditions for next generation lasers. They can also be important for plasma confinement and particle trapping, which can even impact magnetic confinement in fusion devices. The ponderomotive potential also leads to laser self-focusing, complicating laser diagnostics. In laser fusion, the force exacerbates challenges posed by stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and crossed beam energy transfer (CBET), both of which destabilize the fusion process. It even plays an astrophysical role in the filamentation of fast radio bursts in the relativistic winds of magnetars. Since the ponderomotive force primarily effects electron dynamics, multi-fluid/particle codes or additional ansatz are required to include its effects. This paper demonstrates that by including electron effects on an ion timescale with a 1-fluid, 2-energy extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) model, ponderomotive effects are also naturally present. We introduce the theory for these dynamics and demonstrate their presence with 1-D pencil-like simulations.</description>

      <title>Energy Depletion and Re-Acceleration of Driver Electrons in a Plasma-Wakefield Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For plasma-wakefield accelerators to fulfil their potential for cost effectiveness, it is essential that their energy-transfer efficiency be maximized. A key aspect of this efficiency is the near-complete transfer of energy, or depletion, from the driver electrons to the plasma wake. Achieving full depletion is limited by the process of re-acceleration, which occurs when the driver electrons decelerate to non-relativistic energies, slipping backwards into the accelerating phase of the wakefield and being subsequently re-accelerated. Such re-acceleration is unambiguously observed here for the first time. At this re-acceleration limit, we measure a beam driver depositing (57 $\pm$ 3)\% of its energy into a 195-mm-long plasma. Combining this driver-to-plasma efficiency with previously measured plasma-to-beam and expected wall-plug-to-driver efficiencies, our result suggests that plasma-wakefield accelerators can in principle reach or even exceed the energy-transfer efficiency of conventional accelerators.</description>
