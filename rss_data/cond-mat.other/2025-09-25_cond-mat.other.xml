      <title>Harmonic and Subharmonic Magnon Generation in a Surface Acoustic Wave Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally observe the generation of magnon harmonics and subharmonics in an on-chip surface acoustic wave resonator incorporating a thin Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ film, using micro-focused Brillouin light scattering. In our devices, rotating the in-plane magnetic field allows continuous tuning of the magnon-phonon coupling from weak to strong within the same resonator. In the weak coupling regime, we only observe fundamental magnetoelastic wave signal at $f_{1}$. Conversely, in the strong coupling regime, in addition to the fundamental magnetoelastic wave, we observe subharmonic and harmonic signals at $3/2f_{1}$, $2f_{1}$, and $3f_{1}$, which are well reproduced by our analytical model. Our results establish phonons as a means to generate and control nonlinear magnons in the strong coupling regime, providing a new route for magnonic signal processing.</description>

      <title>Exact Solvability and Integrability Signatures in a Periodically Driven Infinite-Range Spin Chain: The Case of Floquet interval $\pi/2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the signatures of quantum integrability (QI) in a spin chain model, having infinite-range Ising interaction and subjected to a periodic pulse of an external magnetic field. We analyze the unitary operator, its eigensystem, the single-qubit reduced density matrix, and the entanglement dynamics for arbitrary initial state for any $N$. The QI in our model can be identified through key signatures such as the periodicity of entanglement dynamics and the time-evolved unitary operator, and highly degenerated spectra or Poisson statistics. In our previous works, these signatures were observed in the model for parameters $\tau=\pi/4$ and $J=1,1/2$, where we provided exact analytical results up to $12$ qubits and numerically for large $N$ [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}; arXiv:2411.16670 (2024)}]. In this paper, we extend the analysis to $\tau=m\pi/2$, and arbitrary $J$ and $N$. We show that the signatures of QI persist for the rational $J$, whereas for irrational $J$, these signatures are absent for any $N$. Further, we perform spectral statistics and find that for irrational $J$, as well as for rational $J$ with perturbations, the spacing distributions of eigenvalues follow Poisson statistics. The average adjacent gap ratio is obtained as $\langle r \rangle=0.386$, consistent with Poisson statistics. Additionally, we compute the ratio of eigenstate entanglement entropy to its maximum value ($\langle S \rangle /S_{Max}$) and find that it remains significantly below $1$ in the limit $N\rightarrow \infty$, which further confirms the QI. We discuss some potential experimental realizations of our model.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of symmetry constraint in Floquet topological superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological superconductor is regarded as an ideal candidate for topological quantum computing due to its ability to simulate the enigmatic Majorana fermions that satisfy non-Abelian statistics. Previous studies revealed that symmetry exerts an unbreakable constraint on the existence, classes, and orders of Majorana modes. It severely limits the controllability and application of Majorana modes. Here, we propose a Floquet-engineering method to break this symmetry-imposed constraint on topological phases. By applying periodic driving on a system belonging to a symmetry class that prohibits the existence of first-order topological phases, we find that rich first-order Majorana modes are created. Interestingly, exotic hybrid-order topological superconductors with coexisting first-order Majorana boundary modes and second-order Majorana corner modes not only in two different quasienergy gaps but also in one single gap are generated at ease by the periodic driving. Refreshing the prevailing understanding of symmetry constraint on topological phases, our result opens an avenue for the creation of exotic topological superconductors without altering symmetries. It greatly expands the scope of the fabricated materials that host topological superconductor.</description>
