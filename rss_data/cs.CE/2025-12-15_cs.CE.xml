      <title>Integrated Prediction and Multi-period Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11273v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-period portfolio optimization is important for real portfolio management, as it accounts for transaction costs, path-dependent risks, and the intertemporal structure of trading decisions that single-period models cannot capture. Classical methods usually follow a two-stage framework: machine learning algorithms are employed to produce forecasts that closely fit the realized returns, and the predicted values are then used in a downstream portfolio optimization problem to determine the asset weights. This separation leads to a fundamental misalignment between predictions and decision outcomes, while also ignoring the impact of transaction costs. To bridge this gap, recent studies have proposed the idea of end-to-end learning, integrating the two stages into a single pipeline. This paper introduces IPMO (Integrated Prediction and Multi-period Portfolio Optimization), a model for multi-period mean-variance portfolio optimization with turnover penalties. The predictor generates multi-period return forecasts that parameterize a differentiable convex optimization layer, which in turn drives learning via portfolio performance. For scalability, we introduce a mirror-descent fixed-point (MDFP) differentiation scheme that avoids factorizing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) systems, which thus yields stable implicit gradients and nearly scale-insensitive runtime as the decision horizon grows. In experiments with real market data and two representative time-series prediction models, the IPMO method consistently outperforms the two-stage benchmarks in risk-adjusted performance net of transaction costs and achieves more coherent allocation paths. Our results show that integrating machine learning prediction with optimization in the multi-period setting improves financial outcomes and remains computationally tractable.</description>

      <title>Task-Specific Sparse Feature Masks for Molecular Toxicity Prediction with Chemical Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable in silico molecular toxicity prediction is a cornerstone of modern drug discovery, offering a scalable alternative to experimental screening. However, the black-box nature of state-of-the-art models remains a significant barrier to adoption, as high-stakes safety decisions demand verifiable structural insights alongside predictive performance. To address this, we propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework designed to jointly enhance accuracy and interpretability. Our architecture integrates a shared chemical language model with task-specific attention modules. By imposing an L1 sparsity penalty on these modules, the framework is constrained to focus on a minimal set of salient molecular fragments for each distinct toxicity endpoint. The resulting framework is trained end-to-end and is readily adaptable to various transformer-based backbones. Evaluated on the ClinTox, SIDER, and Tox21 benchmark datasets, our approach consistently outperforms both single-task and standard MTL baselines. Crucially, the sparse attention weights provide chemically intuitive visualizations that reveal the specific fragments influencing predictions, thereby enhancing insight into the model's decision-making process.</description>

      <title>Contiguous Storage of Grid Data for Heterogeneous Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured Cartesian grids are a fundamental component in numerical simulations. Although these grids facilitate straightforward discretization schemes, their na\"{i}ve use in sparse domains leads to excessive memory overhead and inefficient computation. Existing frameworks address are primarily optimized for CPU execution and exhibit performance bottlenecks on GPU architectures due to limited parallelism and high memory access latency. This work presents a redesigned storage architecture optimized for GPU compatibility and efficient execution across heterogeneous platforms. By abstracting low-level GPU-specific details and adopting a unified programming model based on SYCL, the proposed data structure enables seamless integration across host and device environments. This architecture simplifies GPU programming for end-users while improving scalability and portability in sparse-grid and gird-particle coupling numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Generative Parametric Design (GPD): A framework for real-time geometry generation and on-the-fly multiparametric approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel paradigm in simulation-based engineering sciences by introducing a new framework called Generative Parametric Design (GPD). The GPD framework enables the generation of new designs along with their corresponding parametric solutions given as a reduced basis. To achieve this, two Rank Reduction Autoencoders (RRAEs) are employed, one for encoding and generating the design or geometry, and the other for encoding the sparse Proper Generalized Decomposition (sPGD) mode solutions. These models are linked in the latent space using regression techniques, allowing efficient transitions between design and their associated sPGD modes. By empowering design exploration and optimization, this framework also advances digital and hybrid twin development, enhancing predictive modeling and real-time decision-making in engineering applications. The developed framework is demonstrated on two-phase microstructures, in which the multiparametric solutions account for variations in two key material parameters.</description>

      <title>AI-Trader: Benchmarking Autonomous Agents in Real-Time Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential as autonomous agents, approaching human-expert performance through advanced reasoning and tool orchestration. However, decision-making in fully dynamic and live environments remains highly challenging, requiring real-time information integration and adaptive responses. While existing efforts have explored live evaluation mechanisms in structured tasks, a critical gap remains in systematic benchmarking for real-world applications, particularly in finance where stringent requirements exist for live strategic responsiveness. To address this gap, we introduce AI-Trader, the first fully-automated, live, and data-uncontaminated evaluation benchmark for LLM agents in financial decision-making. AI-Trader spans three major financial markets: U.S. stocks, A-shares, and cryptocurrencies, with multiple trading granularities to simulate live financial environments. Our benchmark implements a revolutionary fully autonomous minimal information paradigm where agents receive only essential context and must independently search, verify, and synthesize live market information without human intervention. We evaluate six mainstream LLMs across three markets and multiple trading frequencies. Our analysis reveals striking findings: general intelligence does not automatically translate to effective trading capability, with most agents exhibiting poor returns and weak risk management. We demonstrate that risk control capability determines cross-market robustness, and that AI trading strategies achieve excess returns more readily in highly liquid markets than policy-driven environments. These findings expose critical limitations in current autonomous agents and provide clear directions for future improvements. The code and evaluation data are open-sourced to foster community research: https://github.com/HKUDS/AI-Trader.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of multi-path propagation artefacts in acoustic targets with cepstral adaptive filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive acoustic sensing is a cost-effective solution for monitoring moving targets such as vessels and aircraft, but its performance is hindered by complex propagation effects like multi-path reflections and motion-induced artefacts. Existing filtering techniques do not properly incorporate the characteristics of the environment or account for variability in medium properties, limiting their effectiveness in separating source and reflection components. This paper proposes a method for separating target signals from their reflections in a spectrogram. Temporal filtering is applied to cepstral coefficients using an adaptive band-stop filter, which dynamically adjusts its bandwidth based on the relative intensity of the quefrency components. The method improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), log-spectral distance (LSD), and Itakura-Saito (IS) distance across velocities ranging from 10 to 100 metres per second in aircraft noise with simulated motion. It also enhanced the performance of ship-type classification in underwater tasks by 2.28 and 2.62 Matthews Correlation Coefficient percentage points for the DeepShip and VTUAD v2 datasets, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed pipeline to improve acoustic target classification and time-delay estimation in multi-path environments, with future work aimed at amplitude preservation and multi-sensor applications.</description>
