      <title>When evolution realizes large deviations of fitness: from speciation to dynamical phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the connection between evolution and large-deviation theory. To do so, we study evolutionary dynamics in which individuals experience mutations, reproduction, and selection using variants of the Moran model. We show that, in the large population size limit, the impact of reproduction and selection amounts to realizing a large-deviation dynamics for the non-interacting random walk in which individuals simply explore the genome landscape due to mutations. This mapping, which holds at all times, allows us to recast transitions in the population genome distribution as dynamical phase transitions, which can then be studied using the toolbox of large-deviation theory. Finally, we show that the mapping extends beyond the class of Moran models.</description>

      <title>Cell size control in bacteria is modulated through extrinsic noise, single-cell- and population-growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living cells maintain size homeostasis by actively compensating for size fluctuations. Here, we present two stochastic maps that unify phenomenological models by integrating fluctuating single-cell growth rates and size-dependent noise mechanisms with cell size control. One map is applicable to mother machine lineages and the other to lineage trees of exponentially-growing cell populations, which reveals that population dynamics alter size control measured in mother machine experiments. For example, an adder can become more sizer-like or more timer-like at the population level depending on the noise statistics. Our analysis of bacterial data identifies extrinsic noise as the dominant mechanism of size variability, characterized by a quadratic conditional variance-mean relationship for division size across growth conditions. This finding contradicts the reported independence of added size relative to birth size but is consistent with the adder property in terms of the independence of the mean added size. Finally, we derive a trade-off between population-growth-rate gain and division-size noise. Correlations between size control quantifiers and single-cell growth rates inferred from data indicate that bacteria prioritize a narrow division-size distribution over growth rate maximisation.</description>

      <title>A disease-spread model on hypergraphs with distinct droplet and aerosol transmission modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the spread of an infectious disease, such as one that is caused by a respiratory virus, with two distinct modes of transmission. To do this, we consider a susceptible--infected--susceptible (SIS) disease on a hypergraph, which allows us to incorporate the effects of both dyadic (i.e., pairwise) and polyadic (i.e., group) interactions on disease propagation. This disease can spread either via large droplets through direct social contacts, which we associate with edges (i.e., hyperedges of size 2), or via infected aerosols in the environment through hyperedges of size at least 3 (i.e., polyadic interactions). We derive mean-field approximations of our model for two types of hypergraphs, and we obtain threshold conditions that characterize whether the disease dies out or becomes endemic. Additionally, we numerically simulate our model and a mean-field approximation of it to examine the impact of various factors, such as hyperedge size (when the size is uniform), hyperedge-size distribution (when the sizes are nonuniform), and hyperedge-recovery rates (when the sizes are nonuniform) on the disease dynamics.</description>

      <title>Where do We Poop? City-Wide Simulation of Defecation Behavior for Wastewater-Based Epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wastewater surveillance, which regularly examines the pathogen biomarkers in wastewater samples, is a valuable tool for monitoring infectious diseases circulating in communities. Yet, most wastewater-based epidemiology methods, which use wastewater surveillance results for disease inferences, implicitly assume that individuals excrete only at their residential locations and that the population contribute to wastewater samples are static. These simplifying assumptions ignore daily mobility, social interactions, and heterogeneous toilet use behavior patterns, which can lead to biased interpretation of wastewater results, especially at upstream sampling locations such as neighborhoods, institutions, or buildings. Here, we introduce an agent-based geospatial simulation framework: Building on an established Patterns of Life model, we simulate daily human activities, mobility, and social contacts within a realistic urban environment and extend this agent-based framework with a physiologically motivated defecation cycle and toilet usage patterns. We couple this behavioral model with an infectious disease model to simulate transmissions through spatial and social interactions. When a defecation occurs for an infected agent, we use a pathogen shedding model to determine the amount of pathogen shed in the feces. Such a framework, integrating population mobility, disease transmission, toilet use behavior, and pathogen shedding models, is capable to simulate the Spatial-temporal dynamics of wastewater signals for a city. Using a case study of 10,000 simulated agents in Fulton County, Georgia, we examine how varying infection rates alter epidemic trajectories, pathogen loads in wastewater, and the spatial distribution of contamination across time.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing MSM Sexual Networks to Guide PrEP Distribution Strategies for HIV Prevention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Men who have sex with men (MSM) remain disproportionately affected by HIV, yet optimizing the distribution of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in this population remains a major public health challenge. Current PrEP eligibility guidelines and most modelling studies do not incorporate sociodemographic or network-level factors that shape transmission. We present a novel network reconstruction framework that generates MSM sexual contact networks from individual-level behavioral data, incorporating clustering and demographic assortativity by age, race, and sexual activity. Using data from 4667 MSM participants, we reconstructed networks with varying topological properties and simulated HIV transmission over 50 years. Network structure strongly influenced outcomes: assortative by degree networks showed 18% lower equilibrium prevalence (63% vs 80% in assortative by race networks) due to hub isolation within communities. Targeted PrEP strategies based on degree or k-shell centrality achieved similar reductions with 20 to 40% coverage, matching random allocation at 60 to 80% coverage, particularly in assortative by age and race networks where hubs bridge demographic groups. Empirical PrEP distribution was suboptimal, underperforming by up to 30% compared with network-based strategies. Our findings demonstrate that integrating demographic mixing patterns into network reconstruction fundamentally alters optimal intervention design, offering a practical framework for improving HIV prevention in MSM populations where complete contact data are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory Regimes in a Game-Theoretic Model for Mosquito Population Dynamics under Breeding Site Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mosquito-borne diseases remain a major public-health threat, and the effective control of mosquito populations requires sustained household participation in removing breeding sites. While environmental drivers of mosquito oscillations have been extensively studied, the influence of spontaneous household decision-making on the dynamics of mosquito populations remains poorly understood. We introduce a game-theoretic model in which the fraction of households performing breeding site control evolves through imitation dynamics driven by perceived risks. Household behavior regulates the carrying capacity of the aquatic mosquito stage, creating a feedback between control actions and mosquito population growth. For a simplified model with constant payoffs, we characterize four locally stable equilibria, corresponding to full or no household control and the presence or absence of mosquito populations. When the perceived risk of not controlling breeding sites depends on mosquito prevalence, the system admits an additional equilibrium with partial household engagement. We derive conditions under which this equilibrium undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, yielding sustained oscillations arising solely from the interaction between mosquito abundance and household behavior. Numerical simulations and parameter explorations further describe the amplitude and phase properties of these oscillatory regimes.</description>

      <title>Towards a compleat theory of ecosystem size spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00023v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The regularity of ecosystem size spectra is one of the most intriguing and relevant phenomena on our planet. Such size spectra generally show a log-linearly downtrending shape, following a power-law distribution. A constant log-linear slope has been reported for many marine pelagic ecosystems, often being approximately b = -1. Conversely, there are variable trophic-level-biomass relationships (trophic pyramids). The contrasting observations of a constant size spectrum and highly variable trophic pyramids may be defined as the constant size spectrum - variable trophic dynamics paradox. Here, a mass-specific predator-prey-efficiency theory of size spectra (PETS) is presented and discussed. A thorough analysis of available data, literature, and models resulted in the conclusion that most pelagic marine ecosystems are controlled by trophic processes such as resource-limit stress (bottom-up control) and top-down regulation, with a key role of the carrying capacity spectrum. This has relevant consequences for the prediction and interpretation of size spectra in the context of fisheries, whaling, and the introduction of exotic predators (e.g., lionfish). The complete size spectrum obtained in situ, including living organisms and non-living particles (e.g., with UVP data) is discussed. This paper is intended as a plea for the integration of modeling approaches, to understand and integrate data and processes across communities, including bacteria, phytoplankton, fish, and mammals, considering the effects of non-organismic particles.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Re-Analysis of the Phylogenetic Topology of Early SARS-CoV-2 Case Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01484v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A much-cited 2022 paper by Pekar et al. claimed that Bayesian analysis of the molecular phylogeny of early SARS-CoV-2 cases indicated that it was more likely that two successful introductions to humans had occurred than that just one had. Here I show that after correcting a fundamental error in Bayesian reasoning the results in that paper give larger likelihood for a single introduction than for two.</description>

      <title>A new stochastic SIS-type modelling framework for analysing epidemic dynamics in continuous space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new stochastic epidemiological model defined in a continuous space of arbitrary dimension, based on SIS dynamics implemented in a spatial $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot (SLFV) process. The model can be described by as little as three parameters, and is dual to a spatial branching process with competition linked to genealogies of infected individuals. Therefore, it is a possible modelling framework to develop computationally tractable inference tools for epidemics in a continuous space using demographic and genetic data.We provide mathematical constructions of the process based on well-posed martingale problems as well as driving space-time Poisson point processes. With these devices and the duality relation in hand, we unveil some of the drivers of the transition between extinction and survival of the epidemic. In particular, we show that extinction is in large parts independent of the initial condition, and identify a strong candidate for the reproduction number R 0 of the epidemic in such a model.</description>
