      <title>Exploring the Magnetotail from Low Altitudes: Evolution of Energetic Electron Flux During the Substorm Growth Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetospheric substorm, which plays a crucial role in flux and energy transport across Earth's magnetosphere, features the formation of a thin, elongated current sheet in the magnetotail during its growth phase. This phase is characterized by a decrease in the equatorial magnetic field Bz and the stretching of magnetic field lines. Observing these large-scale magnetic field reconfigurations is challenging with single-point satellite measurements, which provides only spatially-localized snapshots of system dynamics. Conversely, low-altitude spacecraft measurements of energetic electron fluxes, such as those from ELFIN, offer a unique opportunity to remotely sense the equatorial magnetic field in the magnetotail during substorms by measuring the latitudinal variations of energetic electron isotropic fluxes. Because of strong scattering caused by the curvature of magnetic field lines, energetic electrons in the magnetotail are mostly isotropic. Consequently, variations in their fluxes at low altitudes are expected to reflect the reconfiguration of the magnetotail magnetic field. To better understand the connection of electron flux variation at low altitudes and magnetic field reconfiguration during substorms, we compared low-altitude ELFIN observations with simulations from the Rice Convection Model (RCM). The RCM, which assumes fully isotropic electron distributions, provides a robust framework for describing energetic electron dynamics in the plasma sheet and determining the self-consistent magnetic field configuration during substorms. The comparison of ELFIN observations and RCM simulations confirms our interpretation of electron flux dynamics at low altitudes during the substorm growth phase and validates the use of such observations to infer magnetotail dynamics during substorms.</description>

      <title>Upper Limit of Electron Energization in the Near-Earth Plasma Sheet during Substorm Injections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Earth's magnetotail, located on the night side of the magnetosphere, is a dynamic region where magnetic field energy is released and converted into plasma heating, particle acceleration, and kinetic energy through magnetic reconnection. Recent low-altitude observations from the CIRBE CubeSat reveal that the efficiency of particle acceleration in the magnetotail can be high enough to produce relativistic and ultra-relativistic electrons with energies reaching several MeV. To investigate the underlying acceleration mechanisms, we used the Rice Convection Model (RCM) to simulate the observed magnetotail electron populations. The simulations successfully reproduced key features of CIRBE observations, including the spectral shape and energy range of accelerated electrons. This agreement between RCM results and CIRBE observations offers crucial insights into the physical processes responsible for extreme electron acceleration events in the magnetotail.</description>

      <title>Understanding the IBEX ribbon using the kinetic model of pickup proton transport in a scatter-free limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most remarkable discoveries by the IBEX is the ribbon - a narrow band of enhanced ENA fluxes observed in the sky. The prevailing explanation attributes the IBEX ribbon to the secondary ENA mechanism. In this process, primary H ENAs, produced via charge exchange between solar wind (SW) protons and interstellar H atoms within the heliosphere, travel beyond the heliopause (HP) and undergo further charge exchange with protons of the LISM, generating pickup protons. Some of these pickup protons subsequently experience charge exchange with interstellar H atoms, forming secondary ENAs, some of which travel back toward the Sun and are detected by the IBEX. This paper presents a kinetic model developed to simulate secondary ENA fluxes. Ribbon simulations are performed using global distributions of plasma and H atoms in the heliosphere derived from a kinetic-MHD model of the SW/LISM interaction. The model accounts for all relevant primary ENA populations, including neutralized thermal SW protons, neutralized pickup protons, and ENAs originating in the inner heliosheath (IHS). The transport of pickup protons beyond the HP is described by the focused transport equation for a gyrotropic velocity distribution in the scatter-free limit, assuming no pitch-angle scattering or energy diffusion. Our simulations qualitatively reproduce IBEX-Hi ribbon observations and exhibit good quantitative agreement at low heliolatitudes. However, the model underestimates fluxes at high heliolatitudes, likely due to the omission of non-stationary SW behavior in the stationary framework used in this work. The study highlights the importance of ENAs from the IHS, a population considered for the ribbon production in the frame of the kinetic model of pickup proton transport in the heliosphere for the first time, for accurately reproducing ribbon fluxes observed by IBEX-Hi at the highest energy steps.</description>

      <title>The CHIMERAS Project: Design Framework for the Collisionless HIgh-beta Magnetized Experiment Researching Astrophysical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the near-Earth solar wind to the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters, collisionless, high-beta, magnetized plasmas pervade our universe. Energy and momentum transport from large-scale fields and flows to small scale motions of plasma particles is ubiquitous in these systems, but a full picture of the underlying physical mechanisms remains elusive. The transfer is often mediated by a turbulent cascade of Alfv{\'e}nic fluctuations as well as a variety of kinetic instabilities; these processes tend to be multi-scale and/or multi-dimensional, which makes them difficult to study using spacecraft missions and numerical simulations alone (Dorfman et al. 2023; Lichko et al. 2020, 2023). Meanwhile, existing laboratory devices struggle to produce the collisionless, high ion beta ($\beta_i \gtrsim 1$), magnetized plasmas across the range of scales necessary to address these problems. As envisioned in recent community planning documents (Carter et al. 2020; Milchberg and Scime 2020; Baalrud et al. 2020; Dorfman et al. 2023; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2024, it is therefore important to build a next generation laboratory facility to create a $\beta_i \gtrsim 1$, collisionless, magnetized plasma in the laboratory for the first time. A Working Group has been formed and is actively defining the necessary technical requirements to move the facility towards a construction-ready state. Recent progress includes the development of target parameters and diagnostic requirements as well as the identification of a need for source-target device geometry. As the working group is already leading to new synergies across the community, we anticipate a broad community of users funded by a variety of federal agencies (including NASA, DOE, and NSF) to make copious use of the future facility.</description>

      <title>Decimetric Type-IV Radio Bursts of Solar Flares Induced by Electron Cyclotron Maser Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radiation mechanism of decimetric wideband and pulsating radio bursts from the Sun (in terms of decimetric type-IV (t-IVdm) burst) and other flaring stars is a long-standing problem. Early investigations were based on the leading-spot hypothesis for the sun and yielded contradictory results. Here we provide essential evidence to support the scenario that these bursts are induced by the electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) driven by energetic electrons mirrored in converging sunspot fields. This is done by analyzing 2 flare-associated t-IVdm bursts that are selected from a larger sample of 60 bursts recorded during 2010-2014, according to the levels of polarization and whether the source-field orientation can be unambiguously determined. We further modeled the transport of downward-streaming energetic electrons along a coronal loop and found most electrons get mirrored within the specific altitude range of 20-100 Mm. This explains why such bursts tend to have well-defined spectral ranges. The study greatly expands the application of ECME in solar radio astronomy and provides solar samples for similar bursts from other flaring stars.</description>

      <title>Satellites promise global-scale quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Academia, governments, and industry around the world are on a quest to build long-distance quantum communication networks for a future quantum internet. Using air and fiber channels, quantum communication quickly faced the daunting challenge of exponential photon loss with distance. Quantum repeaters were invented to solve the loss problem by probabilistically establishing entanglement over short distances and using quantum memories to synchronize the teleportation of such entanglement to long distances. However, due to imperfections and complexities of quantum memories, ground-based proof-of-concept repeater demonstrations have been restricted to metropolitan-scale distances. In contrast, direct photon transmission from satellites through empty space faces almost no exponential absorption loss and only quadratic beam divergence loss. A single satellite successfully distributed entanglement over more than 1,200 km. It is becoming increasingly clear that quantum communication over large intercontinental distances (e.g. 4,000-20,000 km) will likely employ a satellite-based architecture. This could involve quantum memories and repeater protocols in satellites, or memory-less satellite-chains through which photons are simply reflected, or some combination thereof. Rapid advancements in the space launch and classical satellite communications industry provide a strong tailwind for satellite quantum communication, promising economical and easier deployment of quantum communication satellites.</description>

      <title>Variability in Footpoint Mapping of BBFs Using Tsyganenko Models: Impact on Swarm Conjunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetospheric-ionospheric coupling studies often rely on multi-spacecraft conjunctions, which require accurate magnetic field mapping tools. For example, linking measurements from the magnetotail with those in the ionosphere involves determining when the orbital magnetic footpoint of THEMIS or MMS intersects with the footpoint of Swarm. One of the most commonly used tools for tracing magnetic field lines are the Tsyganenko models. In this study, we aim to analyze how the footpoint locations are impacted by the inputs parameters of these models, including solar wind conditions, geomagnetic activity, and the location in the magnetotail. A dataset of 2394 bursty bulk flows (BBFs) detected by MMS was mapped to Earth's ionosphere with four different Tsyganenko models. The MLT position showed a variability of approximately +/-1 MLT across the models. Footpoint locations were linked to the dawn-dusk position of the BBFs, with differences between models associated with variations in the interplanetary magnetic field clock angle. The MLAT values exhibited greater variability of approximately +/-2{\deg} around the mean value, with a systematic shift toward higher latitudes observed in two of the four models. This position is also influenced by the the input parameter of the model representing the dynamics of Earth's magnetosphere, with larger values corresponding to lower latitudes. The uncertainty on the footpoint location impacts the number of conjunctions. Generally, Swarm B exhibited more conjunctions than Swarm A or C in the northern hemisphere, and less than half of these conjunctions had Tsyganenko footpoint distances below the typical BBF footprint size in the ionosphere.</description>
