      <title>Acceleration of enzymatic reaction-diffusion kinetics by intermediate state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological molecular motors are high-performance nanomachines that convert chemical energy into mechanical motion via chemomechanical coupling. Their reaction cycles typically comprise a series of intermediate chemical states between the initial and final primary states. However, the influence of these intermediate states on motor performance has not yet been fully explored. In this study, we investigate the impact of intermediate states on the motor kinetics using a reaction-diffusion model. In most cases, the intermediate states accelerate the motor by lowering the effective barrier height. This acceleration is particularly pronounced when an external load is applied to the motor, implying the practical importance of the intermediate states. The intermediate states can also slow down the reaction in some cases, such as the slow reaction limit with asymmetric kinetics. Our findings provide practical insights into the design principles behind the high performance of biological molecular motors, as well as the development of efficient artificial molecular motors.</description>

      <title>Membrane-Associated Self-Assembly for Cellular Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular decision-making based on information received from the external environment is frequently initiated by transmembrane receptors. These receptors are known to propagate such information by triggering a series of irreversible, energy-consuming reactions. While this active mechanism ensures switch-like responses, here we show how spontaneous molecular self-assembly on a two-dimensional substrate can similarly act as a tunable and robust switch for detecting receptors at physiological concentrations. This mechanism is much more sensitive than other passive mechanisms for receptor detection. We derive analytical expressions for critical receptor densities that switch on nucleation and growth of assemblies, in close agreement with equilibrium stochastic reaction-diffusion simulations. The theory developed provides testable predictions for how each component controls decision thresholds and magnitude of response.</description>

      <title>A Magnetic-like description of Oscillatory Behavior in Chemotactic Ants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of chemotaxis in the movement dynamics of Aphaenogaster Senilis ants. To do so, we design an experimental setup in which individual ants are exposed to a narrow pheromone trail to guide their motion. As expected, ants locate and navigate the trail by detecting chemical scents, exhibiting a characteristic zigzag pattern, moving at a nearly constant speed while oscillating perpendicularly to the trail. The zigzagging motion is common across many species yet its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we propose a physical framework based on the Inertial Spin Model as an approach to quantitatively describe and explain this behavior. So, we implement chemotaxis resembling magnetic-like interactions between the ant's velocity and the pheromone gradient. Under specific approximations, the model yields an analytical expression for the velocity correlations perpendicular to the trail, predicting a characteristic oscillatory decay. This prediction closely matches our experimental data, suggesting that the model captures the essential ingredients of ant dynamics. By fitting the model parameters to individual experimental trajectories, we further explore their potential biological significance and validate our assumptions. Overall, our findings contribute to the understanding of chemotaxis in ant motion and its physical features.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Anti-chemotactic Flocking in Active Biomimetic Colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Competition for resources is a fundamental constraint that guides the self-organization of natural, biological, and human systems, ranging from urban planning and ecosystem development to intracellular pattern formation. Here, we reveal that competition for resources is at the origin of the collective dynamics that emerge in a population of colloids propelled by actin treadmilling, an out-of-equilibrium process where filaments grow from one end while shrinking from the other. Using a combination of experiments and theory, we show that symmetry-breaking, self-propulsion, and flocking emerge from the local competition for actin monomers. We demonstrate that beads propelled by actin treadmilling are anti-chemotactic and spontaneously generate asymmetric actin gradients that trigger and sustain directed motility. Flocking emerges from the combined effects of anti-chemotaxis and local competition for monomers. The flocking transition depends on the actin polymerization rate, actin monomer diffusivity, and the bead's motility, whose interplay controls the emergence of short-range attractive interactions between the colloids. Our findings demonstrate that active stress generation coupled to reaction-diffusion is a generic mechanism that can lead to a multiscale cascade of behaviors when active agents remodel their environment. Actin treadmilling offers a platform to study how motile agents that interact through a field self-organize in novel dynamical phases, with potential applications in non-reciprocal and trainable active matter.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Modeling of Protein Conformation and Dynamics via Autoregression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is critical for elucidating their biological functions. The increasing availability of molecular dynamics (MD) data enables the training of deep generative models to efficiently explore the conformational space of proteins. However, existing approaches either fail to explicitly capture the temporal dependencies between conformations or do not support direct generation of time-independent samples. To address these limitations, we introduce ConfRover, an autoregressive model that simultaneously learns protein conformation and dynamics from MD trajectories, supporting both time-dependent and time-independent sampling. At the core of our model is a modular architecture comprising: (i) an encoding layer, adapted from protein folding models, that embeds protein-specific information and conformation at each time frame into a latent space; (ii) a temporal module, a sequence model that captures conformational dynamics across frames; and (iii) an SE(3) diffusion model as the structure decoder, generating conformations in continuous space. Experiments on ATLAS, a large-scale protein MD dataset of diverse structures, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in learning conformational dynamics and supporting a wide range of downstream tasks. ConfRover is the first model to sample both protein conformations and trajectories within a single framework, offering a novel and flexible approach for learning from protein MD data.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning the dispersion of active suspensions with oscillatory flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combined impact of axial stretching and cross-stream diffusion on the downstream transport of solute is termed Taylor dispersion. The dispersion of active suspensions is qualitatively distinct: viscous and external torques can establish non-uniform concentration fields with weighted access to shear, modifying mean drift and effective diffusivity. It would be advantageous to fine-tune the dispersion for systems such as bioreactors, where mixing or particle separation can improve efficacy. Here, we investigate the dispersion of active suspensions in a vertical channel driven by an oscillatory pressure gradient - Womersley flow - using gyrotactic swimmers (bottom-heavy cells subject to viscous torques). Preliminary experimental results reveal interesting dispersion phenomena, highly dependent on the oscillation parameters, motivating theoretical investigation. Employing Lagrangian simulations, we find that oscillatory flows can induce drift and increase lateral and downstream dispersion, with periodic mixing between left and right sides. Such flows can also be used to separate species with different motile behaviour. Eulerian numerical schemes typically require an approach to averaging in orientational space, such as generalised Taylor dispersion, with assumptions on translational and rotational time scales. For an oscillatory timescale commensurate with cell dynamics, we reveal the limitations of such approximations, beyond which the averaging techniques collapse.</description>

      <title>Recovering Hidden Degrees of Freedom Using Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction represents a crucial step in extracting meaningful insights from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Conventional approaches, including linear methods such as principal component analysis as well as various autoencoder architectures, typically operate under the assumption of independent and identically distributed data, disregarding the sequential nature of MD simulations. Here, we introduce a physics-informed representation learning framework that leverages Gaussian Processes combined with variational autoencoders to exploit the temporal dependencies inherent in MD data. Time-dependent kernel functions--such as the Mat\'ern kernel--directly impose impose the temporal correlation structure of the input coordinates onto a low-dimensional space, preserving Markovianity in the reduced representation while faithfully capturing the essential dynamics. Using a three-dimensional toy model, we demonstrate that this approach can successfully identify and separate dynamically distinct states that are geometrically indistinguishable due to hidden degrees of freedom. The resulting embedding features enhance metastability, facilitating the construction of Markov state models with smaller lag times and better convergence of implied timescales. This time-aware perspective provides a promising framework for understanding complex biomolecular systems, in which conventional collective variables may fail to capture the full dynamical picture.</description>

      <title>Material properties of biomolecular condensates emerge from nanoscale dynamics</title>

Abstract: Biomolecular condensates form by phase separation of biological polymers and have important functions in the cell $-$ functions that are inherently connected to their physical properties. A remarkable aspect of such condensates is that their viscoelastic properties can vary by orders of magnitude, but it has remained unclear how these pronounced differences are rooted in the nanoscale dynamics at the molecular level. Here we investigate a series of condensates formed by complex coacervation that span about two orders of magnitude in molecular dynamics, diffusivity, and viscosity. We find that the nanoscale chain dynamics on the nano- to microsecond timescale can be accurately related to both translational diffusion and mesoscale condensate viscosity by analytical relations from polymer physics. Atomistic simulations reveal that the observed differences in friction $-$ a key quantity underlying these relations $-$ are caused by differences in inter-residue contact lifetimes, leading to the vastly different dynamics among the condensates. The rapid exchange of inter-residue contacts we observe may be a general mechanism for preventing dynamic arrest in compartments densely packed with polyelectrolytes, such as the cell nucleus.</description>

      <title>Theory of cell size regulation during migration in adhered cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell migration is closely linked to cell shape, yet cell size is often assumed to remain constant. This assumption is challenged by recent experiments showing that cells undergo volume loss during spreading and swelling upon activation, with migration velocity correlated to cell size. In this Letter, we present a minimal theoretical framework for cellular size regulation and its influence on migration velocity. We connect cell size to membrane potential and active, actin-driven forces. Spatial inhomogeneities in these forces establish cell polarization and drive migration. Crucially, inhomogeneity is easier to establish over larger sizes, giving rise to a critical contact area, above which migration is possible. Our theory captures the coupled dynamics of cell volume, surface area, and motility and explains recent experiments on neutrophils.</description>

      <title>Active Healing of Microtubule-Motor Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cytoskeletal networks have a self-healing property where networks can repair defects to maintain structural integrity. However, both the mechanisms and dynamics of healing remain largely unknown. Here we report a healing mechanism in microtubule-motor networks by active crosslinking. We directly generate defects using a light-controlled microtubule-motor system in O-shaped and V-shaped networks, and observe that the defects can self-heal. Combining theory and experiment, we find that the V-shaped networks must overcome internal elastic resistance in order to heal cracks, giving rise to a bifurcation of dynamics dependent on the initial opening angle of the crack: the crack merges below a critical angle and opens up at larger angles. Simulation of a continuum model reproduces the bifurcation dynamics, revealing the importance of a boundary layer where free motors and microtubules can actively crosslink and thereby heal the defects. We also formulate a simple elastic-rod model that can qualitatively predict the critical angle, which is found to be tunable by the network geometry.</description>

      <title>Acoustic signaling enables collective perception and control in active matter systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emergent cooperative functionality in active matter systems plays a crucial role in various applications of active swarms, ranging from pollutant foraging and collective threat detection to tissue embolization. In nature, animals like bats and whales use acoustic signals to communicate and enhance their evolutionary competitiveness. Here, we show that information exchange by acoustic waves between active agents creates a large variety of multifunctional structures. In our realization of collective swarms, each unit is equipped with an acoustic emitter and a detector. The swarmers respond to the resulting acoustic field by adjusting their emission frequency and migrating toward the strongest signal. We find self-organized structures with different morphology, including snake-like self-propelled entities, localized aggregates, and spinning rings. These collective swarms exhibit emergent functionalities, such as phenotype robustness, collective decision-making, and environmental sensing. For instance, the collectives show self-regeneration after strong distortion, allowing them to penetrate through narrow constrictions. Additionally, they exhibit a population-scale perception of reflecting objects and a collective response to acoustic control inputs. Our results provide insights into fundamental organization mechanisms in information-exchanging swarms. They may inspire design principles for technical implementations in the form of acoustically or electromagnetically communicating microrobotic swarms capable of performing complex tasks and concerting collective responses to external cues.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Based 3D Multistage Transformer for Aberration Correction in Multicellular Specimens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-resolution tissue imaging is often compromised by sample-induced optical aberrations that degrade resolution and contrast. While wavefront sensor-based adaptive optics (AO) can measure these aberrations, such hardware solutions are typically complex, expensive to implement, and slow when serially mapping spatially varying aberrations across large fields of view. Here, we introduce AOViFT (Adaptive Optical Vision Fourier Transformer) -- a machine learning-based aberration sensing framework built around a 3D multistage Vision Transformer that operates on Fourier domain embeddings. AOViFT infers aberrations and restores diffraction-limited performance in puncta-labeled specimens with substantially reduced computational cost, training time, and memory footprint compared to conventional architectures or real-space networks. We validated AOViFT on live gene-edited zebrafish embryos, demonstrating its ability to correct spatially varying aberrations using either a deformable mirror or post-acquisition deconvolution. By eliminating the need for the guide star and wavefront sensing hardware and simplifying the experimental workflow, AOViFT lowers technical barriers for high-resolution volumetric microscopy across diverse biological samples.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Temporal Characterization of Living Mycelium through Dispersion Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mycelium, a natural and sustainable material, possesses unique electrical, mechanical, and biological properties that make it a promising candidate for biosensor applications. These properties include its ability to conduct electrical signals, respond to external stimuli such as humidity and mechanical stress, and grow integrally within structures to form a natural network. Such characteristics suggest its potential for integration into self-sensing systems to monitor vibrations, deformations, and environmental conditions in buildings and infrastructure. To understand the output voltage generated by these biomaterials in response to an applied electrical input, it is essential to characterize their spatial and temporal properties. This study introduces an electrical impedance network model to describe signal transmission through mycelium. In combination with the inhomogeneous wave correlation (IWC) method, commonly used in elastic wave propagation, we demonstrate the dispersion behavior of living mycelium both theoretically and experimentally. We reveal the frequency-dependent and spatial attenuation of electrical signals in living, dehydrated, and rehydrated mycelium, emphasizing the critical role of humidity in enabling effective signal sensing. Furthermore, dispersion analysis is used to assess the homogeneity of mycelium, underscoring its feasibility as a living, green sensing material. This research lays the groundwork for innovative applications of mycelium in sustainable structural health monitoring.</description>
