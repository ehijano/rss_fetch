      <title>Error and Resource Estimates of Variational Quantum Algorithms for Solving Differential Equations Based on Runge-Kutta Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A focus of recent research in quantum computing has been on developing quantum algorithms for differential equations solving using variational methods on near-term quantum devices. A promising approach involves variational algorithms, which combine classical Runge-Kutta methods with quantum computations. However, a rigorous error analysis, essential for assessing real-world feasibility, has so far been lacking. In this paper, we provide an extensive analysis of error sources and determine the resource requirements needed to achieve specific target errors. In particular, we derive analytical error and resource estimates for scenarios with and without shot noise, examining shot noise in quantum measurements and truncation errors in Runge-Kutta methods. Our analysis does not take into account representation errors and hardware noise, as these are specific to the instance and the used device. We evaluate the implications of our results by applying them to two scenarios: classically solving a $1$D ordinary differential equation and solving an option pricing linear partial differential equation with the variational algorithm, showing that the most resource-efficient methods are of order 4 and 2, respectively. This work provides a framework for optimizing quantum resources when applying Runge-Kutta methods, enhancing their efficiency and accuracy in both solving differential equations and simulating quantum systems. Further, this work plays a crucial role in assessing the suitability of these variational algorithms for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The results may also be of interest to the numerical analysis community as they involve the accumulation of errors in the function description, a topic that has hardly been explored even in the context of classical differential equation solvers.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Debugging Quantum Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing software are gradually increasing the scope and size of quantum programs being developed. At the same time, however, these larger programs provide more possibilities for functional errors that are harder to detect and resolve. Meanwhile, debugging tools that could aid developers in resolving these errors are still barely existent and far from what we take for granted in classical design automation and software engineering. As a result, even if one manages to identify the incorrect behavior of a developed quantum program, detecting and resolving the underlying errors in the program remains a time-consuming and tedious task. Moreover, the exponential growth of the state space in quantum programs makes the efficient manual investigation of errors radically difficult even for respectively simple algorithms, and almost impossible as the number of qubits increases. To address this problem, this work proposes a debugging framework, available as an open-source implementation at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-debugger. It assists developers in debugging errors in quantum programs, allowing them to efficiently identify the existence of errors and diagnose their causes. Users are given the ability to place assertions in the code that test for the correctness of a given algorithm and are evaluated using classical simulations of the underlying quantum program. Once an assertion fails, the proposed framework employs different diagnostic methods to point towards possible error causes. This way, the debugging workload for quantum programs is drastically reduced.</description>

      <title>Coherent information as a mixed-state topological order parameter of fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction protects quantum information against decoherence provided the noise strength remains below a critical threshold. This threshold marks the critical point for the decoding phase transition. Here we connect this transition in the toric code to a topological phase transition in disordered Majorana fermions at high temperatures. A quantum memory in the error correctable phase is captured by the presence of a Majorana zero mode, trapped in vortex defects associated with twisted boundary conditions. These results are established by expressing the coherent information, which measures the amount of recoverable quantum information in a given noisy code, in terms of a mixed-state topological order parameter of fermions. Our work hints at a broader connection of the robustness of quantum information in stabilizer codes and mixed-state topological phase transitions in symmetry protected fermion matter.</description>

      <title>Selective and noise-resilient wave estimation with quantum sensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the selective sensing of planar waves in the presence of noise. We present different methods to control the sensitivity of a quantum sensor network, which allow one to decouple it from arbitrarily selected waves while retaining sensitivity to the signal. Comparing these methods with classical (non-entangled) sensor networks we demonstrate two advantages. First, entanglement increases precision by enabling the Heisenberg scaling. Second, entanglement enables the elimination of correlated noise processes corresponding to waves with different propagation directions, by exploiting decoherence-free subspaces. We then provide a theoretical and numerical analysis of the advantage offered by entangled quantum sensor networks, which is not specific to waves and can be of general interest. We demonstrate an exponential advantage in the regime where the number of sensor locations is comparable to the number of noise sources. Finally, we outline a generalization to other waveforms, e.g., spherical harmonics and general time-dependent fields.</description>

      <title>The effect of curvature on local observables in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the leading order corrections to the expected value of the squared field amplitude of a massless real scalar quantum field due to curvature in a localized region of spacetime. We use Riemann normal coordinates to define localized field operators in a curved spacetime that are analogous to their flat space counterparts, and the Hadamard condition to find the leading order curvature corrections to the field correlations. We then apply our results to particle detector models, quantifying the effect of spacetime curvature in localized field probes.</description>

      <title>Positivity of state, trace, and moment polynomials, and applications in quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State, trace, and moment polynomials are polynomial expressions in several operator or random variables and positive functionals on their products (states, traces or expectations). While these concepts, and in particular their positivity and optimization, arose from problems in quantum information theory, yet they naturally fit under the umbrella of multivariate operator theory. This survey presents state, trace, and moment polynomials in a concise and unified way, and highlights their similarities and differences. The focal point is their positivity and optimization. Sums of squares certificates for unconstrained and constrained positivity (Positivstellens\"atze) are given, and parallels with their commutative and freely noncommutative analogs are discussed. They are used to design a convergent hierarchy of semidefinite programs for optimization of state, trace, and moment polynomials. Finally, circling back to the original motivation behind the derived theory, multiple applications in quantum information theory are outlined.</description>

      <title>Coherent enhancement of collection of light from linear ion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient detection of light from trapped ions in free space is paramount for most of their applications. We propose a scheme to enhance the photon collection from linear ion strings. It employs the constructive interference of light scattered from ions along the axial direction in linear Paul traps. The coherent enhancement of photon collection is numerically optimized for a range of feasible spatial angles and realistic ion positions in a single harmonic Coulomb potential. Despite the large mutual distance of scatterers on the order of many wavelengths of scattered light, presented experimental tests confirm the feasibility of enhancements by a factor of $3.05 \pm 0.09$ with a crystal of nine $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions. Further significant improvements using different ion species, which allow for suppression of the sensitivity to the residual thermal motion, are predicted. The proposed collection geometry is intrinsic to diverse linear ion trap designs and the methodology can be directly applied to an observation of scattering from ion crystals prepared in collective electronic excitations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing continues to advance, the development of quantum-secure neural networks is crucial to prevent adversarial attacks. This paper proposes three quantum-secure design principles: (1) using post-quantum cryptography, (2) employing quantum-resistant neural network architectures, and (3) ensuring transparent and accountable development and deployment. These principles are supported by various quantum strategies, including quantum data anonymization, quantum-resistant neural networks, and quantum encryption. The paper also identifies open issues in quantum security, privacy, and trust, and recommends exploring adaptive adversarial attacks and auto adversarial attacks as future directions. The proposed design principles and recommendations provide guidance for developing quantum-secure neural networks, ensuring the integrity and reliability of machine learning models in the quantum era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum memory devices with high storage efficiency and bandwidth are essential elements for future quantum networks. Here, we report a storage efficiency greater than 28% in a Tm$^{3+}$: YAG crystal in elevated temperatures and without compromising the memory bandwidth. Using various pumping and optimization techniques, we demonstrate multi-frequency window storage with a high memory bandwidth of 630 MHz. Moreover, we propose a general method for large-bandwidth atomic-frequency memory with non-Kramers rare-earth-ion (REI) in solids enabling significantly higher storage efficiency and bandwidth. Our study advances the practical applications of quantum memory devices based on REI-doped crystals.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy Preserving Distributed Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing quantum computers can only operate with hundreds of qubits in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) state, while quantum distributed computing (QDC) is regarded as a reliable way to address this limitation, allowing quantum computers to achieve their full computational potential. However, similar to classical distributed computing, QDC also faces the problem of privacy leakage. Existing research has introduced quantum differential privacy (QDP) for privacy protection in central quantum computing, but there is no dedicated privacy protection mechanisms for QDC. To fill this research gap, our paper introduces a novel concept called quantum R\'enyi differential privacy (QRDP), which incorporates the advantages of classical R\'enyi DP and is applicable in the QDC domain. Based on the new quantum R\'enyi divergence, QRDP provides delicate and flexible privacy protection by introducing parameter $\alpha$. In particular, the QRDP composition is well suited for QDC, since it allows for more precise control of the total privacy budget in scenarios requiring multiple quantum operations. We analyze a variety of noise mechanisms that can implement QRDP, and derive the lowest privacy budget provided by these mechanisms. Finally, we investigate the impact of different quantum parameters on QRDP. Through our simulations, we also find that adding noise will make the data less usable, but increase the level of privacy protection.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Hyperparameters for Quantum Data Re-Uploaders in Calorimetric Particle Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an application of a single-qubit Data Re-Uploading (QRU) quantum model for particle classification in calorimetric experiments. Optimized for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, this model requires minimal qubits while delivering strong classification performance. Evaluated on a novel simulated dataset specific to particle physics, the QRU model achieves high accuracy in classifying particle types. Through a systematic exploration of model hyperparameters -- such as circuit depth, rotation gates, input normalization and the number of trainable parameters per input -- and training parameters like batch size, optimizer, loss function and learning rate, we assess their individual impacts on model accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we apply global optimization methods, uncovering hyperparameter correlations that further enhance performance. Our results indicate that the QRU model attains significant accuracy with efficient computational costs, underscoring its potential for practical quantum machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Polynomially efficient quantum enabled variational Monte Carlo for training neural-network quantum states for physico-chemical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a versatile and expressive alternative to traditional variational ans\"atze for simulating physical systems. Energy-based frameworks, like Hopfield networks and Restricted Boltzmann Machines, leverage statistical physics to map quantum states onto an energy landscape, functioning as memory descriptors. Here, we show that such models can be efficiently trained using Monte Carlo techniques enhanced by quantum devices. Our algorithm scales linearly with circuit width and depth, requires constant measurements, avoids mid-circuit measurements, and is polynomial in storage, ensuring optimal efficiency. It applies to both phase and amplitude fields, significantly expanding the trial space compared to prior methods. Quantum-assisted sampling accelerates Markov Chain convergence and improves sample fidelity, offering advantages over classical approaches. We validate our method by accurately learning ground states of local spin models and non-local electronic structure Hamiltonians, even in distorted molecular geometries with strong multi-reference correlations. Benchmark comparisons show robust agreement with traditional methods. This work highlights the potential of combining machine learning protocols with near-term quantum devices for quantum state learning, with promising applications in theoretical chemistry and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Perturbation theory scope for predicting vibronic selectivity by entangled two photon absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using second-order perturbation theory in the light-matter interaction, we derive an analytical approximation for the vibronic populations of a diatomic system excited by ultrabroadband frequency entangled photons and evaluate the population dynamics for different degrees of entanglement between photon pairs. Our analytical approach make the same predictions as previously derived via numerical solutions of the complete Schr\"odinger equation [H. Oka, Physical Review A 97, 063859 (2018)], with the added advantage of providing clear physical insights into the vibronic selectivity as a function of the degree of photon correlations while requiring significantly reduced computational effort. Specifically, our analytical expression for the probability of vibronic excitation includes a factor which predicts the enhancement of vibrational selectivity as a function of the degree correlation between the entangled photon pairs, the targeted vibrational energy level, and the vibrational molecular structure encoded in the Franck-Condon factors. Our results illustrate the importance of going beyond the usual approximations in second-order perturbation theory to capture the relevance of the vibrational structure of the molecular system of interest in order to gain a deeper understanding of the possible quantum-enhancement provided by the interaction between quantum light and matter.</description>

      <title>Completely characterizing multimode nonlinear-optical quantum processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complete characterization of a multimode optical process has paved the way for understanding complex optical phenomena, leading to the development of novel optical technologies. Until now, however, characterizations have mainly focused on a linear-optical process, despite the plethora of multimode nonlinear-optical processes crucial for photonic technologies. Here we report the experimental characterization of multimode nonlinear-optical quantum processes by obtaining the full information needed to describe them while satisfying the necessary physical condition. Specifically, to characterize a second-order nonlinear-optical process of parametric downconversion, we determine the amplification and noise matrices of multimode field quadratures. The full information allows us to factorize the multimode process, leading to the identification of eigenquadratures and their associated amplification and noise properties. Moreover, we demonstrate the broad applicability of our method by characterizing various nonlinear-optical quantum processes, including cluster state generation, mode-dependent loss with nonlinear interaction, and a quantum noise channel. Our method, by providing a versatile technique for characterizing a nonlinear-optical process, will be beneficial for developing scalable photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>The suboptimality ratio of projective measurements restricted to low-rank subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limitations in measurement instruments can hinder the implementation of some quantum algorithms. Understanding the suboptimality of such measurements with restrictions may then lead to more efficient measurement policies. In this paper, we theoretically examine the suboptimality arising from a Procrustes problem for minimizing the average distance between two fixed quantum states when one of the states has been measured by a Projective Measurement (PM). Specifically, we compare optima when we can only use PMs that are aligned with a low-rank subspace where the quantum states are supported, and when we can measure with the full set of PMs. For this problem, we show that the suboptimality ratio is independent of the dimension of the full space, and is at most polylogarithmic in the dimension of the low-rank subspace. In the proof of this result, we use a probabilistic approach and the main techniques include trace inequalities related to projective measurements, and operator norm bounds for equipartitions of Parseval frames, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Entropic probability and context states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we introduced an axiomatic system for information thermodynamics, deriving an entropy function that includes both thermodynamic and information components. From this function we derived an entropic probability distribution for certain uniform collections of states. Here we extend the concept of entropic probability to more general collections, augmenting the states by reservoir and context states. This leads to an abstract concept of free energy and establishes a relation between free energy, information erasure, and generalized work.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermal machine as a rectifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a chain of interacting individual quantum systems connected to heat baths at different temperatures on both ends. Starting with the two-system case, we thoroughly investigate the conditions for heat rectification (asymmetric heat conduction), compute thermal conductance, and generalize the results to longer chains. We find that heat rectification in the weak coupling regime can be independent of the chain length and that negative differential thermal conductance occurs. We also examine the relationship between heat rectification with entanglement and the entropy production. In the strong coupling regime, the system exhibits an asymmetric Rabi-type splitting in the thermal conductance, leading to enhanced heat transport and improved rectification inaccessible in the weak coupling. This setup represents the simplest quantum thermal machine that consumes incoherent resources and delivers entanglement while acting as a rectifier and heat valve.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Optimization for Designing Variational Quantum Circuits with High Model Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have garnered significant attention, leading to substantial efforts toward the development of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a variety of complex challenges. The design of high-performance QML models, however, requires expert-level knowledge, posing a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of QML. Key challenges include the design of data encoding mechanisms and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which critically impact the generalization capabilities of QML models. We propose a novel method that encodes quantum circuit architecture information to enable the evolution of quantum circuit designs. In this approach, the fitness function is based on the effective dimension, allowing for the optimization of quantum circuits towards higher model capacity. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of discovering variational quantum circuit architectures that offer improved learning capabilities, thereby enhancing the overall performance of QML models for complex tasks.</description>

      <title>Fully quantum stochastic entropy production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the approach of stochastic thermodynamics, we define entropy production for arbitrary quantum processes, using Bayesian tools to capture the inherent subjective element. First, we show that the classical expression for average entropy production involves only comparisons of statistics at the input or output, and thus can be formally generalized by replacing probability distributions by quantum states. To go beyond the mere average, we construct an entropy production operator, that generalizes the value of entropy to the non-commutative case. The operator is Hermitian; its average is non-negative, so that the Second Law takes its usual form $\langle\Sigma\rangle\geq 0$; it formally satisfies the Jarzynski equality; and recovers the classical expression for classical processes. We also present features whose fully quantum version is not a straightforward translation of the classical one: these may point to the core difference between classical and quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant Quantum Computation without Distillation on a 2D Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how looped pipeline architectures - which use short-range shuttling of physical qubits to achieve a finite amount of non-local connectivity - can be used to efficiently implement the fault-tolerant non-Clifford gate between 2D surface codes described in (Sci. Adv. 6, eaay4929 (2020)). The shuttling schedule needed to implement this gate is only marginally more complex than is required for implementing the standard 2D surface code in this architecture. We compare the resource cost of this operation with the cost of magic state distillation and find that, at present, this comparison is heavily in favour of distillation. The high cost of the non-Clifford gate is almost entirely due to the relatively low performance of the just-in-time decoder used as part of this process, which necessitates very large code distances in order to achieve suitably low logical error rates. We argue that, as very little attention has previously been given to the study and optimisation of these decoders, there are potentially significant improvements to be made in this area.</description>

      <title>The Jacobi Factoring Circuit: Quantum Factoring with Near-Linear Gates and Sublinear Space and Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compact quantum circuit for factoring a large class of integers, including some whose classical hardness is expected to be equivalent to RSA (but not including RSA integers themselves). To our knowledge, it is the first polynomial-time circuit to achieve sublinear qubit count for a classically-hard factoring problem; the circuit also achieves sublinear depth and nearly linear gate count. We build on the quantum algorithm for squarefree decomposition discovered by Li, Peng, Du and Suter (Nature Scientific Reports 2012), which relies on computing the Jacobi symbol in quantum superposition. Our circuit completely factors any number $N$, whose prime decomposition has distinct exponents, and finds at least one non-trivial factor if not all exponents are the same. In particular, to factor an $n$-bit integer $N=P^2 Q$ (with $P$ and $Q$ prime, and $Q&lt;2^m$ for some $m$), our circuit uses $\tilde{O}(m)$ qubits and has depth at most $\tilde{O}(m + n/m)$, with $\tilde{O}(n)$ quantum gates. When $m=\Theta(n^a)$ with $2/3 &lt; a &lt; 1$, the space and depth are sublinear in $n$, yet no known classical algorithms exploit the relatively small size of $Q$ to run faster than general-purpose factoring algorithms. We thus believe that factoring such numbers has potential to be the most concretely efficient classically-verifiable proof of quantumness currently known.
  The technical core of our contribution is a new space-efficient and parallelizable quantum algorithm to compute the Jacobi symbol of $A$ mod $B$, in the regime where $B$ is classical and much larger than $A$. In the context of the larger Jacobi algorithm for factoring $N = P^2Q$, this reduces the overall qubit count to be roughly proportional to the length of $Q$, rather than the length of $N$. Finally, we note that our circuit for computing the Jacobi symbol generalizes to related problems, such as computing the GCD.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast high-fidelity state readout of single neutral atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capability to measure the state of a quantum system is vital to a practical quantum network, for applications including distributed quantum computing and long-distance quantum communication. As a thriving platform for quantum information technology, single neutral atoms suffer from low achievable photon scattering rate and shallow trapping potential, which limits the fidelity and speed of state readout process. Here, by coupling an single neutral atom with a high-finesse fiber-based Fabry-P\'erot microcavity (FFPC) in Purcell regime, we realize strong enhancement of the atomic photoemission rate, which enables ultrafast and high-fidelity discrimination of bright and dark hyperfine states of the atom. The readout fidelity can reach 99.1(2)% within 200 ns and 99.985(8)% within 9 $\mu$s. Furthermore, we demonstrate that state preparation via optical pumping can be efficiently accelerated by real-time decision protocol based on ultrafast state readout. This work paves the way to the implementation of quantum networking protocols with high communication rate and high fidelity.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric protocols for mode pairing quantum key distribution with finite-key analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mode pairing quantum key distribution (MP-QKD) protocol has attracted considerable attention for its capability to ensure high secure key rates over long distances without requiring global phase locking. However, ensuring symmetric channels for the MP-QKD protocol is challenging in practical quantum communication networks. Previous studies on the asymmetric MP-QKD protocol have relied on ideal decoy state assumptions and infinite-key analysis, which are unattainable for real-world deployment. In this paper, we conduct a security analysis of asymmetric MP-QKD protocol with the finite-key analysis, where we discard the previously impractical assumptions made in the decoy-state method. Combined with statistical fluctuation analysis, we globally optimized the 12 independent parameters in the asymmetric MP-QKD protocol by employing our modified particle swarm optimization. The simulation results demonstrate that our work can achieve significantly enhanced secure key rates and transmission distances compared to the original strategy with adding extra attenuation. We further investigate the relationship between the intensities and probabilities of signal, decoy, and vacuum states with transmission distance, facilitating its more efficient deployment in future quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Control of open quantum systems: Manipulation of a qubit coupled to a thermal bath by an external driving field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and reliable manipulation with qubits is fundamental for any quantum technology. The implementation of these manipulations in physical systems is the focus of studies involving optimal control theory. Realistic physical devices are open quantum systems. So far, studies in optimal control theory have primarily utilized the Redfield/Lindblad quantum master equation to simulate the dynamics of such systems. However, this Markov description is not always sufficient. Here, we present a study of qubit control utilizing the nonequilibrium Green's function method. We compare the traditional master equation with more general Green's function results and demonstrate that even in the parameter regime suitable for the application of the Redfield/Lindblad approach, the two methods yield drastically different results when addressing evolution involving mixed states. In particular, we find that, in addition to predicting different optimal driving profiles, a more accurate description of system evolution enables the system to reach the desired final state much more quickly. We argue that the primary reason for this is the significance of the non-Markov description of driven system dynamics due to the effect of time-dependent driving on dissipation.</description>

      <title>Fisher information and quantum entropies of a 2D system under a non-central scalar and a vector potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two dimensional system influenced by a non-central potential consisting of a Kratzer potential with a dipole moment, along with a vector potential of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect. We explore various information theoretic measures, including Fisher information, Shannon entropy, Tsallis entropy and Renyi entropy. our numerical results show that the Fisher information increases with an increase in dissociation energy and decreases with rinsing dipole moment, AB potential strength, and both radial and angular quantum numbers. In contrast, the Shannon entropy, the Tsallis entropy and the Renyi entropy decrease with rising dissociation energy, while they increase with an increase in dipole moment, AB potential strength, as well as radial and angular quantum numbers. These observations collectively indicate that both precision and localization of particles in space are enhanced by the increasing of the dissociation energy while they are reduced when we increase the dipole moment, the AB potential strength, and both the radial and angular quantum numbers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonics represents one of the most promising approaches to large-scale quantum computation with millions of qubits and billions of gates, owing to the potential for room-temperature operation, high clock speeds, miniaturization of photonic circuits, and repeatable fabrication processes in commercial photonic foundries. We present an end-to-end architecture for fault-tolerant continuous variable (CV) quantum computation using only passive on-chip components that can produce photonic qubits above the fault tolerance threshold with probabilities above 90%, and encodes logical qubits using physical qubits sampled from a distribution around the fault tolerance threshold. By requiring only low photon number resolution, the architecture enables the use of high-bandwidth photodetectors in CV quantum computing. Simulations of our qubit generation and logical encoding processes show a Gaussian cluster squeezing threshold of 12 dB to 13 dB. Additionally, we present a novel magic state generation protocol which requires only 13 dB of cluster squeezing to produce magic states with an order of magnitude higher probability than existing approaches, opening up the path to universal fault-tolerant quantum computation at less than 13 dB of cluster squeezing.</description>

      <title>QNN-VRCS: A Quantum Neural Network for Vehicle Road Cooperation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating complexity of urban transportation systems, exacerbated by factors such as traffic congestion, diverse transportation modalities, and shifting commuter preferences, necessitates the development of more sophisticated analytical frameworks. Traditional computational approaches often struggle with the voluminous datasets generated by real-time sensor networks, and they generally lack the precision needed for accurate traffic prediction and efficient system optimization. This research integrates quantum computing techniques to enhance Vehicle Road Cooperation Systems (VRCS). By leveraging quantum algorithms, specifically $UU^{\dagger}$ and variational $UU^{\dagger}$, in conjunction with quantum image encoding methods such as Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI) and Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR), we propose an optimized Quantum Neural Network (QNN). This QNN features adjustments in its entangled layer structure and training duration to better handle the complexities of traffic data processing. Empirical evaluations on two traffic datasets show that our model achieves superior classification accuracies of 97.42% and 84.08% and demonstrates remarkable robustness in various noise conditions. This study underscores the potential of quantum-enhanced 6G solutions in streamlining complex transportation systems, highlighting the pivotal role of quantum technologies in advancing intelligent transportation solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Specific types of decoherence applied to typical quantum many-body states can induce a novel kind of mixed state accompanying characteristic symmetry orders, which has no counterparts in pure many-body states. We study phenomena generated by interplay between two types of decoherence applied to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We show that in the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decoherence can be described by filtering operation applied to matrix product states (MPS) defined in the doubled Hilbert system. The filtering operation induces specific deformation of the MPS, which approximates the ground state of a certain parent Hamiltonian in the doubled Hilbert space. In the present case, such a parent Hamiltonian is the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, having a rich phase diagram with a critical lines and quantum phase transitions. By investigating the deformed MPS, we find various types of mixed states emergent from the ground states of the TFIM, and clarify phase transitions between them. In that study, strong and weak $Z_2$ symmetries play an important role, for which we introduce efficient order parameters, such as R\'{e}nyi-2 correlators, entanglement entropy, etc., in the doubled Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Galilean decoherence and quantum measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a modified quantum theory, denoted as $QT^\ast$, which introduces mass-dependent decoherence effects. These effects are derived by averaging the influence of a proposed global quantum fluctuation in position and velocity. While $QT^\ast$ is initially conceived as a conceptual framework - a ``toy theory" - to demonstrate the internal consistency of specific perspectives in the measurement process debate, it also exhibits physical features worthy of serious consideration. The introduced decoherence effects create a distinction between micro- and macrosystems, determined by a characteristic mass-dependent decoherence timescale, $\tau(m)$. For macrosystems, $QT^\ast$ can be approximated by classical statistical mechanics (CSM), while for microsystems, the conventional quantum theory $QT$ remains applicable. The quantum measurement process is analyzed within the framework of $QT^\ast$, where Galilean decoherence enables the transition from entangled states to proper mixtures. This transition supports an ignorance-based interpretation of measurement outcomes, aligning with the ensemble interpretation of quantum states. To illustrate the theory's application, the Stern-Gerlach spin measurement is explored. This example demonstrates that internal consistency can be achieved despite the challenges of modeling interactions with macroscopic detectors.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of quantum operators written as a linear combination of permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider matrices given as a linear combination of permutations and analyze the impact of bit and phase flips on the perturbation of the eigenvalues. When the coefficients in the linear combination are positive, we observe that the eigenvalues of the resulting matrices are resilient to quantum bit-flip errors. In addition, we analyze the bit flips in combination with positive and negative coefficients and the phase flips. Although they are not much resilient to the errors, the numerical evidence shows that the perturbation of the eigenspectrum is very small when the rate of these errors is small. We also discuss the situation when this matrix is implemented through block encoding and there is a control register. Since any square matrix can be written as a sum of permutations with some coefficients, this paper gives a framework to study matrix computations in quantum algorithms related to numerical linear algebra. In addition, it can give ideas to design more error-resilient algorithms that may involve quantum registers with different error characteristics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of multi-mode optical systems driven by two-photon processes and subject to non-local losses, incorporating quantum noise at the Gaussian level. Our findings show that the statistics retrieved from a single Gaussian quantum trajectory exhibits emergent thermal equilibrium governed by an Ising Hamiltonian, encoded in the dissipative coupling between modes. The system's effective temperature is set by the driving strength relative to the oscillation threshold. Given the ultra-short time scales typical of all-optical devices, our study demonstrates that such multi-mode optical systems can operate as ultra-fast Boltzmann samplers, paving the way towards the realization of efficient hardware for combinatorial optimization, with promising applications in machine learning and beyond.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Flight Routes: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for the Tail Assignment Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tail Assignment Problem (TAP) is a critical optimization challenge in airline operations, requiring the optimal assignment of aircraft to scheduled flights to maximize efficiency and minimize costs. To address the TAP, this work applies the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), a promising quantum computing algorithm developed for tackling complex combinatorial optimization problems. A detailed formulation of the TAP is provided and QAOA's performance is evaluated on realistic problem instances, examining its strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, QAOA is compared with classical methods such as brute force and branch-and-price, as well as Quantum Annealing (QA), another quantum approach. The analysis reveals the current limitations of quantum hardware but suggests potential advantages as technology advances.</description>

      <title>High quality quasinormal modes of phononic crystals for quantum acoustodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phononic crystals are a promising platform for the study of quantum acoustodynamics. In a recent experiment, the interaction of a superconducting quantum bit with modes of a phononic crystal has been demonstrated. The field of these modes is localized in a compact area, providing high values of the coupling constant with the qubit. However, the Q-factor of phononic crystal modes is strongly limited (1050) due to a phonon emission from the crystal ends. For further use of phononic crystals in research in the field of quantum acoustodynamics, it is desirable to overcome this limitation in the quality factor. In this work, we have proposed a structure consisting of a phononic crystal placed between the Bragg mirrors. Our simulations predict that the Q-factor in such a structure can reach (100000). We demonstrate experimental results in which this structure has a Q-factor (60,000), which is 60 times higher than that of an acoustic crystal of the same size.</description>

      <title>Memory-minimal quantum generation of stochastic processes: spectral invariants of quantum hidden Markov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic processes abound in nature and accurately modeling them is essential across the quantitative sciences. They can be described by hidden Markov models (HMMs) or by their quantum extensions (QHMMs). These models explain and give rise to process outputs in terms of an observed system interacting with an unobserved memory. Although there are infinitely many models that can generate a given process, they can vary greatly in their memory requirements. It is therefore of great fundamental and practical importance to identify memory-minimal models. This task is complicated due to both the number of generating models, and the lack of invariant features that determine elements of the set. In general, it is forbiddingly difficult to ascertain that a given model is minimal. Addressing this challenge, we here identify spectral invariants of a process that can be calculated from any model that generates it. This allows us to determine strict bounds on the quantum generative complexity of the process -- its minimal memory requirement. We then show that the bound is raised quadratically when we restrict to classical operations. This is an entirely quantum-coherent effect, as we express precisely, using the resource theory of coherence. Finally, we demonstrate that the classical bound can be violated by quantum models.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of non-Gaussianity and nonclassicality of pair coherent states with postselected von Neumann measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of postselected von Neumann measurements on the nonclassical properties of pair coherent states (PCS). We calculated key quantum characteristics, such as squeezing, photon statistics, and entanglement between the two PCS modes. Our results demonstrate that postselected von Neumann measurements enhance both the non-Gaussianity and nonclassicality of PCS. These findings are validated by analyzing the scaled joint Wigner function across various system parameters. The theoretical optimization scheme offers an alternative approach for improving PCS-based quantum information efficiency and facilitates practical implementations in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherent State Transform on Continuous-Variable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While continuous-variable (CV) quantum systems are believed to be more efficient for quantum sensing and metrology than their discrete-variable (DV) counterparts due to the infinite spectrum of their native operators, our toolkit of manipulating CV systems is still limited. We introduce the quantum coherent state transform~(QCST) and a framework for implementing it in CV quantum systems with two ancilla CV states and six two-mode SUM gates. Measurement of the resulting quantum state under the momentum eigenbasis is equivalent to a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) with elements $\left\{\frac{1}{\pi} \left|\alpha\right\rangle \left\langle\alpha\right| \right\}_{\alpha \in \mathbb{C}}$ , which provides an efficient way to learn the original CV state. Our protocol makes it possible to estimate the coherent state parameter within minimum-uncertainty precision using a single copy of the state, which finds applications in single-shot gate calibration of beam splitter and rotation gates to arbitrary precision. With repeated runs of our protocol, one can also estimate the parameters of any Gaussian state, which helps to calibrate other Gaussian gates, such as squeezing. For non-Gaussian states, our protocols can be used to perform Husimi Q-function tomography efficiently. With DV systems as ancilla instead, we can realize QCST approximately, which can be used to transfer CV states to DV states and back. The simplicity and broad applicability of the quantum coherent state transform make it an essential tool in continuous-variable quantum information science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Near-Term Spin-Qubit Architecture Design via Multipartite Maximally-Entangled States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and benchmarking of quantum computer architectures traditionally rely on practical hardware restrictions, such as gate fidelities, control, and cooling. At the theoretical and software levels, numerous approaches have been proposed for benchmarking quantum devices, ranging from, inter alia, quantum volume to randomized benchmarking. In this work, we utilize the quantum information-theoretic properties of multipartite maximally-entangled quantum states, in addition to their correspondence with quantum error correction codes, permitting us to quantify the entanglement generated on near-term bilinear spin-qubit architectures. For this aim, we introduce four metrics which ascertain the quality of genuine multipartite quantum entanglement, along with circuit-level fidelity measures. As part of the task of executing a quantum circuit on a device, we devise simulations which combine expected hardware characteristics of spin-qubit devices with appropriate compilation techniques; we then analyze three different architectural choices of varying lattice sizes for bilinear arrays, under three increasingly realistic noise models. We find that if the use of a compiler is assumed, sparsely-connected spin-qubit lattices can approach comparable values of our metrics to those of the most highly-connected device architecture. Even more surprisingly, by incorporating crosstalk into our last noise model, we find that, as error rates for crosstalk approach realistic values, the benefits of utilizing a bilinear array with advanced connectivity vanish. Our results highlight the limitations of adding local connectivity to near-term spin-qubit devices, and can be readily adapted to other qubit technologies. The framework developed here can be used for analyzing quantum entanglement on a device before fabrication, informing experimentalists on concomitant realistic expectations.</description>

      <title>Microwave-to-Optical Quantum Transduction with Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the performance of quantum hardware is crucial for comparing different platforms and predicting the performance and feasibility of quantum algorithms and applications. In this paper, we tackle the problem of benchmarking a quantum register based on the NV center in diamond operating at room temperature. We define the connectivity map as well as single qubit performance. Thanks to an all-to-all connectivity the 2 and 3 qubit gates performance is promising and competitive among other platforms. We experimentally calibrate the error model for the register and use it to estimate the quantum volume, a metric used for quantifying the quantum computational capabilities of the register, of 8. Our results pave the way towards the unification of different architectures of quantum hardware and evaluation of the joint metrics.</description>

      <title>Prepare-and-measure scenarios with photon-number constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study correlations in the prepare-and-measure scenario when quantum communication is constrained by photon-number statistics. Such constraints are natural and practical control parameters for semi-device-independent certification in optical platforms. To analyse these scenarios, we show how semidefinite programming relaxations for non-commutative polynomial optimization can be used to bound the set of quantum correlations under restrictions on the photon-number distribution. The practicality of this method is demonstrated by computing optimal performance bounds on several well-known communication tasks. We then apply the method to the certification of semi-device-inpependent random number generation protocols and show how to bound the conditional Shannon entropy. We showcase this versatile tool by improving randomness extraction in established protocols based on coherent states and homodyne measurements.</description>

      <title>All non-Gaussian states are advantageous for channel discrimination: Robustness of non-convex continuous variable quantum resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories provide a mathematical framework for quantifying the advantage given by quantum phenomena in various tasks. The generalized robustness is one such quantifier, and enjoys an operational interpretation in the setting of channel discrimination. It is a well studied resource monotone in finite-dimensional or convex resource theories, however as of yet it has not been studied in the setting of infinite-dimensional resource theories with a non-convex set of free states. In this work, we define the generalized robustness for an arbitrary resource theory, without restricting to convex sets or to finite dimensions. We show it has two operational interpretations: firstly, it provides an upper bound on the maximal advantage in a multi-copy channel discrimination task. Secondly, in many relevant theories, it quantifies the worst-case advantage in single-copy channel discrimination when considering a decomposition of the free states into convex subsets. Finally, we apply our results to the resource theory of non-Gaussianity, thus showing that all non-Gaussian states can provide an advantage in some channel discrimination task, even those that are simply mixtures of Gaussian states. To illustrate our findings, we provide exact formulas for the robustness of non-Gaussianity of Fock states, along with an analysis of the robustness for a family of non-Gaussian states within the convex hull of Gaussian states.</description>

      <title>Assessing Quantum and Classical Approaches to Combinatorial Optimization: Testing Quadratic Speed-ups for Heuristic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many recent investigations conclude, based on asymptotic complexity analyses, that quantum computers could accelerate combinatorial optimization (CO) tasks relative to a purely classical computer. However, asymptotic analysis alone cannot support a credible claim of quantum advantage. Here, we highlight the challenges involved in benchmarking quantum and classical heuristics for combinatorial optimization (CO), with a focus on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick problem. Whereas hope remains that a quadratic quantum advantage is possible,our numerical analysis casts doubt on the idea that current methods exhibit any quantum advantage at all. This doubt arises because even a simple classical approach can match with quantum methods we investigated. We conclude that more careful numerical investigations are needed to evaluate the potential for quantum advantage in CO, and we give some possible future directions for such investigations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying unknown Hamiltonians from their quantum dynamics is a pivotal challenge in quantum technologies and fundamental physics. In this paper, we introduce Hamiltonian recognition, a framework that bridges quantum hypothesis testing and quantum metrology, aiming to identify the Hamiltonian governing quantum dynamics from a known set of Hamiltonians. To identify $H$ for an unknown qubit quantum evolution $\exp(-iH\theta)$ with unknown $\theta$, from two or three orthogonal Hamiltonians, we develop a quantum algorithm for coherent function simulation, built on two quantum signal processing (QSP) structures. It can simultaneously realize a target polynomial based on measurement results regardless of the chosen signal unitary for the QSP. Utilizing semidefinite optimization and group representation theory, we prove that our methods achieve the optimal average success probability, taken over possible Hamiltonians $H$ and parameters $\theta$, decays as $O(1/k)$ with $k$ queries of the unknown unitary transformation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the validity of our protocol on a superconducting quantum processor. This work presents an efficient method to recognize Hamiltonians from limited queries of the dynamics, opening new avenues in composite channel discrimination and quantum metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose powering a quantum clock with the non-thermal resources offered by the stationary state of an integrable quantum spin chain, driven out of equilibrium by a quench in a parameter of our choice. Analyzing the bias conditions of the clock, we establish a direct connection with the negativity of the steady-state response function. Using experimentally relevant examples of quantum spin chains, we suggest crossing a phase transition point is crucial for optimal performance. The coupling takes place through a global observable and, even in this case, the battery lifespan is found to be extensive in its size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classically simulating circuits with bosonic codes is a challenging task due to the prohibitive cost of simulating quantum systems with many, possibly infinite, energy levels. We propose an algorithm to simulate circuits with encoded Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, specifically for odd-dimensional encoded qudits. Our approach is tailored to be especially effective in the most challenging but practically relevant regime, where the codeword states exhibit high (but finite) squeezing. Our algorithm leverages the Zak-Gross Wigner function introduced by J. Davis et al. [arXiv:2407.18394], which represents infinitely squeezed encoded stabilizer states positively. The runtime of the algorithm scales with the amount of negativity of this Wigner function, enabling fast simulation of certain large-scale circuits with a high degree of squeezing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancements of quantum processors offer a promising new window to study exotic states of matter. One striking example is the possibility of non-ergodic behaviour in systems with a large number of local degrees of freedom. Here we use a trapped-ion qudit quantum processor to study a disorder-free $S=1$ Floquet model, which becomes prethermal by dynamic localization due to local spin interactions. We theoretically describe and experimentally observe an emergent $3T$ subharmonic response, demonstrating the ability to witness non-ergodic dynamics beyond qubit systems. Our numerical simulations reveal the role played by multipartite entanglement through the Quantum Fisher Information, showing how this quantity successfully reflects the transition between ergodic and localized regimes in a non-equilibrium context. These results pave the way for the study of ergodicity-breaking mechanisms in higher-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are a number of emerging quantum technologies that have the potential to be disruptive in application areas such as computation, communication and sensing. In such a rapidly emerging field, there is a need for: transparency and accountability pertaining to devices, their performance, and limitations; the ability to assess new entities for integration into existing systems; sufficient information to undertake technology selection; share knowledge within and across institutions and discipline domains; manage risk and assure compliance with regulatory frameworks; drive innovation. Here we propose Model Cards for documentation detailing use-cases and performance characteristics of entities for use in quantum technologies. Purpose of this document is therefore to stimulate discussion and begin to motivate the community to build a sufficient body of knowledge so that the most useful form of Model Cards can be developed and standardised.</description>

      <title>Quantum community detection via deterministic elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm for calculating the structural properties of complex networks and graphs. The corresponding protocol -- deteQt -- is designed to perform large-scale community and botnet detection, where a specific subgraph of a larger graph is identified based on its properties. We construct a workflow relying on ground state preparation of the network modularity matrix or graph Laplacian. The corresponding maximum modularity vector is encoded into a $\log(N)$-qubit register that contains community information. We develop a strategy for ``signing'' this vector via quantum signal processing, such that it closely resembles a hypergraph state, and project it onto a suitable linear combination of such states to detect botnets. As part of the workflow, and of potential independent interest, we present a readout technique that allows filtering out the incorrect solutions deterministically. This can reduce the scaling for the number of samples from exponential to polynomial. The approach serves as a building block for graph analysis with quantum speed up and enables the cybersecurity of large-scale networks.</description>

      <title>Factoring an integer with three oscillators and a qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common starting point of traditional quantum algorithm design is the notion of a universal quantum computer with a scalable number of qubits. This convenient abstraction mirrors classical computations manipulating finite sets of symbols, and allows for a device-independent development of algorithmic primitives. Here we advocate an alternative approach centered on the physical setup and the associated set of natively available operations. We show that these can be leveraged to great benefit by sidestepping the standard approach of reasoning about computation in terms of individual qubits. As an example, we consider hybrid qubit-oscillator systems with linear optics operations augmented by certain qubit-controlled Gaussian unitaries. The continuous-variable (CV) Fourier transform has a native realization in such systems in the form of homodyne momentum measurements. We show that this fact can be put to algorithmic use. Specifically, we give a polynomial-time quantum algorithm in this setup which finds a factor of an $n$-bit integer $N$. Unlike Shor's algorithm, or CV implementations thereof based on qubit-to-oscillator encodings, our algorithm relies on the CV (rather than discrete) Fourier transform. The physical system used is independent of the number $N$ to be factored: It consists of a single qubit and three oscillators only.</description>

      <title>Strong Structural Bounds for MaxSAT: The Fine Details of Using Neuromorphic and Quantum Hardware Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hardware accelerators like quantum annealers or neuromorphic chips are capable of finding the ground state of a Hamiltonian. A promising route in utilizing these devices is via methods from automated reasoning: The problem at hand is first encoded into MaxSAT; then MaxSAT is reduced to Max2SAT; and finally, Max2SAT is translated into a Hamiltonian. It was observed that different encodings can dramatically affect the efficiency of the hardware accelerators. Yet, previous studies were only concerned with the size of the encodings rather than with syntactic or structural properties.
  We establish structure-aware reductions between MaxSAT, Max2SAT, and the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem (QUBO) that underlies such hardware accelerators. All these problems turn out to be equivalent under linear-time, treewidth-preserving reductions. As a consequence, we obtain tight lower bounds under ETH and SETH for Max2SAT and QUBO, as well as a new time-optimal fixed-parameter algorithm for QUBO. While our results are tight up to a constant additive factor for the primal treewidth, we require a constant multiplicative factor for the incidence treewidth. To close the emerging gap, we supplement our results with novel time-optimal algorithms for fragments of MaxSAT based on model counting.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Transformers for Electronic Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural-network-based variational quantum states in general, and more recently autoregressive models in particular, have proven to be powerful tools to describe complex many-body wave functions. However, their performance crucially depends on the computational basis chosen and they often lack physical interpretability. To mitigate these issues, we here propose a modified variational Monte-Carlo framework which leverages prior physical information to construct a computational second-quantized basis containing a reference state that serves as a rough approximation to the true ground state. In this basis, a Transformer is used to parametrize and autoregressively sample the corrections to the reference state, giving rise to a more interpretable and computationally efficient representation of the ground state. We demonstrate this approach using a non-sparse fermionic model featuring a metal-insulator transition and employing Hartree-Fock and a strong-coupling limit to define physics-informed bases. We also show that the Transformer's hidden representation captures the natural energetic order of the different basis states. This work paves the way for more efficient and interpretable neural quantum-state representations.</description>

      <title>Mixture equivalence principles and post-quantum theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the mixture equivalence principle (MEP), which states that proper and improper mixed states with the same density matrix are always experimentally indistinguishable, and a weaker version, which states that this is sometimes true in gravity theories. We point out that Moller-Rosenfeld semiclassical gravity violates the weak MEP and that nonlinear extensions of quantum mechanics violate the MEP. We further demonstrate that modifications of the Born rule in quantum theory also typically violate the MEP. We analyse such violations in the context of thermal baths, where proper and improper thermal states induce different physical situations. This has significant implications in the context of black hole physics. We argue that Moller-Rosenfeld semiclassical gravity is not the semiclassical limit of quantum gravity in the context of black hole spacetimes, even in the presence of $N\gg1$ matter fields.</description>

      <title>Brickwall One-Loop Determinant: Spectral Statistics &amp; Krylov Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon -- a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon -- within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.</description>

      <title>Laser-Induced Quenching of the Th-229 Nuclear Clock Isomer in Calcium Fluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 10-minute radiative lifetime of the first excited $^{229}$Th$^{4+}$ nuclear state in ionic crystals provides narrow spectroscopic linewidths, enabling the realization of a solid-state nuclear clock. Due to the 4+ noble gas configuration, electronic readout or state initialization schemes known from atomic clocks are inaccessible. This elongates the interrogation cycle, which will deteriorate the clock performance. To address this limitation we demonstrate laser-induced quenching (LIQ) as a method of depumping the $^{229}$Th isomer population in CaF$_2$. We provide experimental evidence for LIQ at different wavelengths (148 - 420 nm) and temperatures (100 - 350 K), achieving a threefold reduction in the isomer lifetime with 20 mW of laser power.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Aharonov-Bohm cages and tight meson confinement in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-loop gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the finite-density phases of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) of interconnected loops and dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges. The gauge-invariant Wilson terms, accounting for the magnetic flux threading each loop, correspond to simple two-body Ising interactions in this setting. Such terms control the interference of charges tunneling around the loops, leading to dynamical Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cages that are delimited by loops threaded by a $\pi$-flux. The latter can be understood as $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortices, the analog of visons in two dimensional LGTs, which become mobile by adding quantum fluctuations through an external electric field. In contrast to a semi-classical regime of static and homogeneous AB cages, the mobile visons can self-assemble leading to AB cages of different lengths depending on the density of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges and the interplay of magnetic and electric terms. Inside these cages, the individual charges get confined into tightly-bound charge-neutral pairs, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ analogue of mesons. Depending on the region of parameter space, these tightly-bound mesons can propagate within dilute AB-dimers that virtually expand and contract, or else move by virtually stretching and compressing an electric field string. Both limits lead to a Luttinger liquid described by a constrained integrable model. This phase is separated from an incompressible Mott insulator where mesons belong to closely-packed AB-trimers. In light of recent trapped-ion experiments for a single $\mathbb{Z}_2$ loop, these phases could be explored in future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potential disorder in 1D leads to Anderson localization of the entire spectrum. Upon sacrificing hermiticity by adding non-reciprocal hopping, the non-Hermitian skin effect competes with localization. We find another route for delocalization, which involves imaginary potential disorder. While an entirely random potential generally still leads to localization, imposing minimal spatial structure to the disorder can protect delocalization: it endows the concomitant transfer matrix with an SU(2) structure, whose compactness in turn translates into an infinite localization length. The fraction of delocalized states can be tuned by the choice of boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unitarity provides mathematical and physical constraints on quantum information systems. e.g., in entanglement swapping, unitarity requires that the same entanglement generation occurs for either an act of measurement or particle interaction. The article's presentation allows particle physicists to readily begin calculating quantum information metrics for any particle interaction. The language of non-relativistic quantum mechanics is presented to derive the density matrix for hard scattering. Unitarity allows for finding the latter's cross section without using the scattering amplitude or the Lippmann-Schwinger equation plus Green's function. For the inelastic scattering of an electron from a proton, the language of relativistic quantum mechanics is used to derive the momentum entropy or Sackur-Tetrode equation. The latter entropy derives from a Shannon entropy and another entropy that evokes the uncertainty principle.</description>

      <title>SentiQNF: A Novel Approach to Sentiment Analysis Using Quantum Algorithms and Neuro-Fuzzy Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential component of natural language processing, used to analyze sentiments, attitudes, and emotional tones in various contexts. It provides valuable insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and user experiences. Researchers have developed various classical machine learning and neuro-fuzzy approaches to address the exponential growth of data and the complexity of language structures in sentiment analysis. However, these approaches often fail to determine the optimal number of clusters, interpret results accurately, handle noise or outliers efficiently, and scale effectively to high-dimensional data. Additionally, they are frequently insensitive to input variations. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach for sentiment analysis called the Quantum Fuzzy Neural Network (QFNN), which leverages quantum properties and incorporates a fuzzy layer to overcome the limitations of classical sentiment analysis algorithms. In this study, we test the proposed approach on two Twitter datasets: the Coronavirus Tweets Dataset (CVTD) and the General Sentimental Tweets Dataset (GSTD), and compare it with classical and hybrid algorithms. The results demonstrate that QFNN outperforms all classical, quantum, and hybrid algorithms, achieving 100% and 90% accuracy in the case of CVTD and GSTD, respectively. Furthermore, QFNN demonstrates its robustness against six different noise models, providing the potential to tackle the computational complexity associated with sentiment analysis on a large scale in a noisy environment. The proposed approach expedites sentiment data processing and precisely analyses different forms of textual data, thereby enhancing sentiment classification and insights associated with sentiment analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous scaling of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) has led to device geometries where charged carriers are increasingly confined to ever smaller channel cross sections. This development is associated with reduced screening of long-range Coulomb interactions. To accurately predict the behavior of such ultra-scaled devices, electron-electron (e-e) interactions must be explicitly incorporated in their quantum transport simulation. In this paper, we present an \textit{ab initio} atomistic simulation framework based on density functional theory, the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, and the self-consistent GW approximation to perform this task. The implemented method is first validated with a carbon nanotube test structure before being applied to calculate the transfer characteristics of a silicon nanowire MOSFET in a gate-all-around configuration. As a consequence of e-e scattering, the energy and spatial distribution of the carrier and current densities both significantly change, while the on-current of the transistor decreases owing to the Coulomb repulsion between the electrons. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the resulting bandgap modulation of the nanowire channel as a function of the gate-to-source voltage could potentially improve the device performance. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first one reporting large-scale atomistic quantum transport simulations of nano-devices under non-equilibrium conditions and in the presence of e-e interactions within the GW approximation.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity is among the most important problems in physics, for which quantum simulation can provide new insights. However, it remains challenging to characterize superconductivity in existing cold-atom quantum simulation platforms. Here, we introduce a protocol for measuring a broad class of observables in fermionic quantum gas microscopes, including long-range superconducting pairing correlations (after a repulsive-to-attractive mapping). The protocol only requires global controls followed by site-resolved particle number measurements -- capabilities that have been already demonstrated in multiple experiments -- and is designed by analyzing the Hilbert-space structure of dimers of two sites. The protocol is sample efficient and we further optimize our pulses for robustness to experimental imperfections such as lattice inhomogeneity. Our work introduces a general tool for manipulating quantum states on optical lattices, enhancing their ability to tackle problems such as that of high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides a concise overview of the comprehensive version of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) derived from nonlocal quantum mechanics and extensively addressed by S. Masood, et al. We utilize the specific constraint of this GUP formulation to compute the energy correction and the modified wave function for the linear potential in one dimension. In addition, we examine the impact of deformation on a one-dimensional delta potential well and a one-dimensional delta potential barrier. Furthermore, we specifically focus on the impact of deformation on hydrogen atoms existing in one dimension, and we conduct a distinct investigation into the Stark effect on the atom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.01173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a spin chain governed by a local Hamiltonian, we consider a microcanonical ensemble in the middle of the energy spectrum and a contiguous subsystem whose length is a constant fraction of the system size. We prove that if the bandwidth of the ensemble is greater than a certain constant, then the average entanglement entropy (between the subsystem and the rest of the system) of eigenstates in the ensemble deviates from the maximum entropy by at least a positive constant. This result highlights the difference between the entanglement entropy of mid-spectrum eigenstates of (chaotic) local Hamiltonians and that of random states. We also prove that the former deviates from the thermodynamic entropy at the same energy by at least a positive constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14969v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Boltzmann machines (QBMs) are machine-learning models for both classical and quantum data. We give an operational definition of QBM learning in terms of the difference in expectation values between the model and target, taking into account the polynomial size of the data set. By using the relative entropy as a loss function this problem can be solved without encountering barren plateaus. We prove that a solution can be obtained with stochastic gradient descent using at most a polynomial number of Gibbs states. We also prove that pre-training on a subset of the QBM parameters can only lower the sample complexity bounds. In particular, we give pre-training strategies based on mean-field, Gaussian Fermionic, and geometrically local Hamiltonians. We verify these models and our theoretical findings numerically on a quantum and a classical data set. Our results establish that QBMs are promising machine learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06763v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the applicability of hybrid quantum-classical heuristics for practical railway rescheduling management problems. We build an integer linear programming model and solve it with D-Wave's quantum-classical hybrid solver as well as with CPLEX for comparison. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a real-life heterogeneous urban network in Poland, including both single- and multi-track segments. All the requirements posed by the operator of the network are modeled. The computational results demonstrate the readiness for application and benefits of quantum-classical hybrid solvers in the realistic railway scenario: they yield acceptable solutions on time, which is a critical requirement in a rescheduling situation. In particular, CQM as a probabilistic heuristic solver provides a number of feasible, close-to-optimal solutions the dispatcher can choose from.</description>

      <title>Heralded Optical Entanglement Generation via the Graph Picture of Linear Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-destructive heralded entanglement with photons is a valuable resource for quantum information processing. However, they generally entail ancillary particles and modes that amplify the circuit intricacy. To address this challenge, a recent work (\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-024-00845-6}{npj Quantum Information 10, 67 (2024)}) introduced a graph approach for creating multipartite entanglements with boson subtractions. Nonetheless, it remains an essential intermediate step toward practical heralded schemes: the proposition of heralded subtraction operators in bosonic linear quantum networks. This research establishes comprehensive translation rules from subtraction operators to linear optical operators, which provides a seamless path to design heralded schemes with single photons. Our method begets enhanced or previously unreported schemes for the $N$-partite GHZ state with $2N$ photons, $N$-partite W state with $2N+1$ photons and superposition of $N=3$ GHZ and W states with 9 photons. Our streamlined approach can straightforwardly design heralded schemes for multipartite entangled states by assembling the operators according to the guidence of sculpting bigraphs, hence significantly simplifies the quantum circuit design process.</description>

      <title>Chirality-induced emergent spin-orbit coupling in topological atomic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling is of fundamental interest in both quantum optical and condensed matter systems alike. In this work, we show that optically induced electronic excitations in lattices of V-type atoms exhibit an emergent spin-orbit coupling when the geometry is chiral. This spin-orbit coupling arises naturally from the electric dipole interaction between the atomic sites and leads to a nontrivial topology for the lattice band structure. Using a general quantum optical model, we determine analytically the conditions that give rise to spin-orbit coupling and characterize the behavior under various symmetry transformations. We demonstrate that chirality-induced spin-orbit coupling can result from either the chirality of the underlying lattice geometry or the combination of an achiral lattice with a suitably chosen external quantization axis. We then discuss how these results are influenced by dissipation, which breaks time-reversal symmetry and illuminates the distinction between true and false chirality. Our results demonstrate that chiral atom arrays are a robust platform for realizing spin-orbit-coupled topological states of matter.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum algorithm to simulate open systems through a single environmental qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient algorithm for simulating open quantum systems dynamics described by the Lindblad master equation on quantum computers, addressing key challenges in the field. In contrast to existing approaches, our method achieves two significant advancements. First, we employ a repetition of unitary gates on a set of $n$ system qubits and, remarkably, only a single ancillary bath qubit representing the environment. It follows that, for the typical case of $m$-locality of the Lindblad operators, we reach an exponential improvement of the number of ancilla in terms of $m$ and up to a polynomial improvement in ancilla overhead for large $n$ with respect to other approaches. Although stochasticity is introduced, requiring multiple circuit realizations, the sampling overhead is independent of the system size. Secondly, we show that, under fixed accuracy conditions, our algorithm enables a reduction in the number of trotter steps compared to other approaches, substantially decreasing circuit depth. These advancements hold particular significance for near-term quantum computers, where minimizing both width and depth is critical due to inherent noise in their dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The Schmidt number represents the genuine entanglement dimension of a bipartite quantum state. We derive simple criteria for the Schmidt number of a density matrix in arbitrary local dimensions. They are based on the trace norm of correlations obtained from seminal families of quantum measurements, specifically symmetric informationally complete measurements and mutually unbiased bases. Our criteria are strictly stronger than both the well-known fidelity witness criterion and the computable cross-norms or realignment criterion.</description>

This framework permits novel insights within the usual description of the complex autonomous particle, particulaly concening the energy of a non-stationary motion. Through the appraisal of the physical role played by a fully quaternionic scalar potential, a original self-interaction within the quaternionic autonomous particle has been determined as well. Scattering processes are considered to illustrate these novel features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Level spectroscopy stands as a powerful method for identifying the transition point that delineates distinct quantum phases. Since each quantum phase exhibits a characteristic sequence of excited states, the crossing of energy levels between low-lying excited states offers a reliable mean to estimate the phase transition point. While approaches like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver are useful for approximating ground states of interacting systems using quantum computing, capturing low-energy excitations remains challenging. In our study, we introduce an equivariant quantum circuit that preserves the total spin and the translational symmetry to accurately describe singlet and triplet excited states in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a chain, which are crucial for characterizing its transition point. Additionally, we assess the impact of noise on the variational state, showing that conventional mitigation techniques like Zero Noise Extrapolation reliably restore its physical properties.</description>

Abstract: Optimized quantum control can enhance the performance and noise resilience of quantum metrology. However, the optimization quickly becomes intractable when multiple control operations are applied sequentially. In this work, we propose efficient tensor network algorithms for optimizing strategies of quantum metrology enhanced by a long sequence of control operations. Our approach covers a general and practical scenario where the experimenter applies $N-1$ interleaved control operations between $N$ queries of the channel to estimate and uses no or bounded ancilla. Tailored to different experimental capabilities, these control operations can be generic quantum channels or variational unitary gates. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm has a good performance in optimizing the metrological strategy for as many as $N=100$ queries. In particular, our algorithm identifies a strategy that can outperform the state-of-the-art strategy when $N$ is finite but large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon loss represents a major challenge for the implementation of quantum communication protocols with untrusted devices, e.g. in the device-independent (DI) or semi-DI approaches. Determining critical loss thresholds is usually done in case-by-case studies. In the present work, we develop a general framework for characterizing the admissible levels of loss and noise in a wide range of scenarios and protocols with untrusted measurement devices. In particular, we present general bounds that apply to prepare-and-measure protocols for the semi-DI approach, as well as to Bell tests for DI protocols. A key step in our work is to establish a general connection between quantum protocols with untrusted measurement devices and the fundamental notions of channel extendibility and joint-measurability, which capture essential aspects of the communication and measurement of quantum information. In particular, this leads us to introduce the notion of partial joint-measurability, which naturally arises within quantum cryptography.</description>

Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme to realize the controllable non-Hermitian qubit-qubit coupling by adding a high-loss resonator in tunable coupling superconducting quantum circuit.
  By changing the effective qubit-qubit coupling, phase and amplitude of resonator-qubit interaction, and the
  qubits' quantum states, we can continually tune the energy level attraction, position of EP (exceptional point),
  and the nonreciprocity in the non-Hermitian superconducting circuit.
  The EPs and non-reciprocity can affect the quantum states' evolutions and
  exchange efficiencies for two qubits in the non-Hermitian superconducting circuit.
  The controllable non-Hermitian and nonreciprocal interactions between
  two qubits provide a new insights and methods for exploring
  the unconventional quantum effects in superconducting quantum circuit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms provide a potential strategy for solving computational problems that are intractable by classical means. Computing the topological invariants of topological matter is one central problem in research on quantum materials, and a variety of numerical approaches for this purpose have been developed. However, the complexity of quantum many-body Hamiltonians makes calculations of topological invariants challenging for interacting systems. Here, we present two quantum circuits for calculating Chern numbers of two-dimensional quantum matter on quantum computers. Both circuits combine a gate-based adiabatic time-evolution over the discretized Brillouin zone with particular phase estimation techniques. The first algorithm uses many qubits, and we analyze it using a tensor-network simulator of quantum circuits. The second circuit uses fewer qubits, and we implement it experimentally on a quantum computer based on superconducting qubits. Our results establish a method for computing topological invariants with quantum circuits, taking a step towards characterizing interacting topological quantum matter using quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Studying quantum circuits through the lens of approximation theory is crucial to upper bound the computational complexity of such circuits to approximate various mathematical functions. In this paper, we construct quantum circuits that can approximate $d$-dimensional functions in the Korobov function space using quantum signal processing and linear combinations of unitaries algorithms. We provide error bounds and complexity estimates for these circuits. Since the Korobov space is a subspace of Sobolev spaces, our work establishes a theoretical foundation for implementing a broad class of functions on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Hermitian Topology of Multiband Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complex eigenenergies and non-orthogonal eigenstates of non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique topological phenomena that cannot appear in Hermitian systems. Representative examples are the non-Hermitian skin effect and exceptional points. In a two-dimensional parameter space, topological classifications of non-separable bands in multiband non-Hermitian systems can be established by invoking a permutation group, where the product of the permutation represents state exchange due to exceptional points in the space. We unveil in this work the role of pseudo-Hermitian lines in non-Hermitian topology for multiple bands. In particular, the non-separability of non-Hermitian multibands can be topologically non-trivial without exceptional points in two-dimensional space. As a physical illustration of the role of pseudo-Hermitian lines, we examine a multiband structure of a photonic crystal system with lossy materials. Our work builds on the fundamental and comprehensive understanding of non-Hermitian multiband systems and also offers versatile applications and realizations of non-Hermitian systems without the need to consider exceptional points.</description>

      <title>Parallel transport in rotating frames and projective holonomic quantum computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation is a promising approach for implementing quantum gates that offers both efficiency and robustness against certain types of errors. A key element of this approach is a geometric constraint known as the parallel transport condition. According to the principle of covariance, this condition must be appropriately modified when changing reference frames. In this paper, we detail how to adjust the parallel transport condition when transitioning from the laboratory frame to a rotating reference frame. Furthermore, building on gauge invariance considerations, we develop a framework for nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation with projective gates. The parallel transport condition of this framework effectively addresses the problem of global dynamical phases inherent in conventional nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation. We extend the isoholonomic inequality, which provides a fundamental bound on the efficiency of protocols used to implement holonomic quantum gates, to encompass projective quantum gates. We also determine a minimum execution time for projective holonomic quantum gates and show that this time can be attained when the codimension of the computational space is sufficiently large.</description>

Abstract: Work extraction is one of the most central processes in quantum thermodynamics. However, the prior analysis of optimal extractable work has been restricted to a limited operational scenario where complete information about the initial state is given. Here, we introduce a general framework of black box work extraction, which addresses the inaccessibility of information on the initial state. We show that the optimal extractable work in the black box setting is completely characterized by the performance of a composite hypothesis testing task, a fundamental problem in information theory.We employ this general relation to reduce the asymptotic black box work extraction to the quantum Stein's lemma in composite hypothesis testing, allowing us to provide their exact characterization in terms of the Helmholtz free energy. We also show a new quantum Stein's lemma motivated in this physical setting, where a composite hypothesis contains a certain correlation. Our work exhibits the importance of information about the initial state and gives a new interpretation of the quantities in the composite quantum hypothesis testing, encouraging the interplay between the physical settings and the information theory.</description>

      <title>The binarisation loophole in high-dimensional quantum correlation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many experiments with high-dimensional quantum systems aim at observing physical properties without having to assume that all measurement devices are perfectly characterised. To implement high-dimensional measurements, it is a common practice to separately project the system onto each of the possible eigenstates followed by post-processing. Here, we argue that such measurement binarisation procedures are flawed and open a loophole in black-box correlation experiments. We point out how binarised measurements can lead to meaningless results unless artificial assumptions are introduced. We then propose a method to faithfully analyse correlations from binarised measurements. We apply this approach to well-known examples of quantum correlations in Bell, prepare-and-measure and steering experiments. For the former two, we find that binarisation permits reduced-but-yet-significant quantum advantage, while for the latter we find that binarisation can sometimes lead to undiminished quantum correlations. Our discussion emphasises the importance of both more careful data analysis and for developing genuine multi-outcome quantum measurements.</description>

      <title>Driving of an open quantum system at finite temperature across first- and second-order quantum phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00635v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An open fully connected system of qubits at nonzero temperature is driven within a finite time interval along various paths in the space of its control parameters. The driving leads across finite-size precursors of first- and second-order quantum phase transition from factorized to entangled ground-state phases, aiming at the preparation of the complex ground state of the system at the final parameter point with maximal fidelity. During the drive, the system is coupled to a heat bath at a constant temperature, the dynamics being determined in a nonperturbative way by the method of Hierarchical Equations of Motion. It is shown that the presence of the heat bath in combination with specific patterns of avoided crossings affecting the ground and excited states in the parameter region around the quantum phase transition may considerably improve the fidelity of preparation of the target ground state.</description>

      <title>Microwave-optics entanglement via coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microwave-optics entanglement plays a crucial role in building hybrid quantum networks with quantum nodes working in the microwave and optical frequency bands. However, there are limited efficient ways to produce such entanglement due to the large frequency mismatch between the two regimes. Here, we present a new mechanism to prepare microwave-optics entanglement based on a hybrid system of two coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres, i.e., a YIG sphere and a silica sphere. The YIG sphere holds a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction, while the silica sphere supports an optical whispering-gallery mode and a mechanical mode coupled via an optomechanical interaction. The two mechanical modes are close in frequency and directly coupled via physical contact of the two microspheres. We show that by simultaneously activating the magnomechanical (optomechanical) Stokes (anti-Stokes) scattering, stationary entanglement can be established between the magnon and optical modes via mechanics-mechanics coupling. This leads to stationary microwave-optics entanglement by further coupling the YIG sphere to a microwave cavity and utilizing the magnon-microwave state swapping. Our protocol is within reach of current technology and may become a promising new approach for preparing microwave-optics entanglement, which finds unique applications in hybrid quantum networks and quantum information processing with hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum delocalization of a 1-milligram torsional pendulum for gravity experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconciling gravity and quantum mechanics has posed significant challenges in contemporary physics. Even the seemingly simple question of whether gravitational fields should obey the quantum superposition principle remains unanswered. Unlocking the answer experimentally necessitates a quantum-unfriendly regime with large masses and low-frequency dynamics to maximize the dimensionless figure-of-merit in the problem, quantifying the ability to generate quantum entanglement gravitationally. To this end, we develop a 1-milligram torsional pendulum operating at 18 Hz. Laser cooling its motion to an unprecedented 240~microkelvins for this mass range, we boost its quantum delocalization and benchmark a state-of-the-art quantum-gravity figure-of-merit with an unparalleled improvement potential. The results open a frontier for explorations of quantum aspects of gravity, establishing milligram-scale torsional pendulums as a leading platform.</description>

      <title>On the Relativistic Zero Knowledge Quantum Proofs of Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of relativistic zero-knowledge quantum proof of knowledge systems with classical communication, formally defining a number of useful concepts and constructing appropriate knowledge extractors for all the existing protocols in the relativistic setting which satisfy a weaker variant of the special soundness property due to Unruh (EUROCRYPT 2012). We show that there exists quantum proofs of knowledge with knowledge error 1/2 + negl({\eta}) for all relations in NP via a construction of such a system for the Hamiltonian cycle relation using a general relativistic commitment scheme exhibiting the fairly-binding property due to Fehr and Fillinger (EUROCRYPT 2016). We further show that one can construct quantum proof of knowledge extractors for proof systems which do not exhibit special soundness, and therefore require an extractor to rewind multiple times. We develop a new multi-prover quantum rewinding technique by combining ideas from monogamy of entanglement and gentle measurement lemmas that can break the quantum rewinding barrier. Finally, we prove a new bound on the impact of consecutive measurements and use it to significantly improve the soundness bound of some existing relativistic zero knowledge proof systems, such as the one due to Chailloux and Leverrier (EUROCRYPT 2017).</description>

      <title>Symmetry operations and Critical Behaviour in Classical to Quantum Stochastic Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a novel construction scheme for generating quantum analogs of classical stochastic processes has been introduced. Here, we use this scheme in order to generate a large class of self-contained quantum extensions of a classical Markov chain process using symmetry operations. We show that the relaxation processes unfold very differently for the different quantum extensions. This is supported by monitoring the coherence, the probability of reaching the equilibrium, the decay of the number of domain walls and the purity. Unexpectedly, we find a rather ambiguous relation between the coherence measure based on the L1-norm and the speed of the relaxation process. Finally we find that the finite size scaling of the coherence measure exists for both short and long times and the value of the critical exponent is different for the short and long time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) for bipartite quantum systems represented by commuting von Neumann algebras. Our central result is the extension of Nielsen's Theorem, stating that the LOCC ordering of bipartite pure states is equivalent to the majorization of their restrictions, to arbitrary factors. As a consequence, we find that in bipartite system modeled by commuting factors in Haag duality, a) all states have infinite single-shot entanglement if and only if the local factors are not of type I, b) type III factors are characterized by LOCC transitions of arbitrary precision between any two pure states, and c) the latter holds even without classical communication for type III$_{1}$ factors. In the case of semifinite factors, the usual construction of pure state entanglement monotones carries over. Together with recent work on embezzlement of entanglement, this gives a one-to-one correspondence between the classification of factors into types and subtypes and operational entanglement properties. In the appendix, we provide a self-contained treatment of majorization on semifinite von Neumann algebras and $\sigma$-finite measure spaces.</description>

Abstract: We study the spectrum, eigenstates and transport properties of a simple $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric model consisting in a finite, complex, square well potential with a delta potential at the origin. We show that as the strength of the delta potential increases, the system exhibits exceptional points accompanied by an accumulation of density associated with the break in the $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetry. We also obtain the density and energy density fluxes and analyze their transport properties. We find that in the $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}-$ symmetric phase transport is efficient, in the sense that all the density that flows into the system at the source, flows out at the sink, which is sufficient to derive a generalized unitary relation for the transmission and reflection coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) heavily depends on statistical inference. For a broad class of protocols, the central statistical task is a random sampling problem, customarily addressed using exponential tail bounds on the hypergeometric distribution. Here we devise a strikingly simple exponential bound for this task, of unprecedented tightness among QKD security analyses. As a by-product, confidence intervals for the average of non-identical Bernoulli parameters follow too. These naturally fit in statistical analyses of decoy-state QKD and also outperform standard tools. Lastly, we show that, in a vast parameter regime, the use of tail bounds is not enforced because the cumulative mass function of the hypergeometric distribution is accurately computable. This sharply decreases the minimum block sizes necessary for QKD, and reveals the tightness of our simple analytical bounds when moderate-to-large blocks are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically and computationally investigate the role that the spatial spread of atoms plays in the transmission and reflection of weak light from atom arrays. In particular, we investigate whether coherent wave functions for the atoms' positions leads to different results from a thermal distribution with the same spatial spread. We find that the coherence is not relevant when the light is weak and the electronic states evolve on time scales shorter than the oscillation period of the atoms in their traps. Full numerical calculations and derivations using the sudden approximation show that reflection and transmission agree with the simple averaging over atom positions for these conditions. For parameters outside these restrictions, the simple spatial averaging may lead to inaccurate results.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the geometry of the ground-state manifold in parameter-dependent many-body systems with quantum phase transitions (QPTs) and describe finite-size precursors of the singular geometry emerging at the QPT boundary in the infinite-size limit. In particular, we elucidate the role of diabolic points in the formation of first-order QPTs, showing that these isolated geometric singularities represent seeds generating irregular behavior of geodesics in finite systems. We also demonstrate that established approximations, namely the mean field approximation in many-body systems composed of mutually interacting bosons and the two-level approximation near a diabolic point, are insufficient to provide a reliable description of geometry. The outcomes of the general analysis are tested and illustrated by a specific bosonic model from the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick family.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Annealing Protocol to Solve the Nuclear Shell Model</title>

Abstract: The nuclear shell model accurately describes the structure and dynamics of atomic nuclei. However, the exponential scaling of the basis size with the number of degrees of freedom hampers a direct numerical solution for heavy nuclei. In this work, we present a quantum annealing protocol to obtain nuclear ground states. We propose a tailored driver Hamiltonian that preserves a large gap and validate our approach in a dozen nuclei with basis sizes up to $10^5$ using classical simulations of the annealing evolution. We explore the relation between the spectral gap and the total time of the annealing protocol, assessing its accuracy by comparing the fidelity and energy relative error to classical benchmarks. While the nuclear Hamiltonian is non-local and thus challenging to implement in current setups, the estimated computational cost of our annealing protocol on quantum circuits is polynomial in the many-body basis size, paving the way to study heavier nuclei.</description>

      <title>On the application of the Rayleigh-Ritz method to a projected Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the well known Rayleigh-Ritz method (RRM) to the projection of a Hamiltonian operator chosen recently for the extension of the variational principle to ensemble states. By means of a toy model we show that the RRM eigenvalues approach to those of the projected Hamiltonian from below in most cases but a few ones. We also discuss the effect of an energy shift and the projection of the identity operator.</description>

      <title>The composition rule for quantum systems is not the only possible one</title>

Abstract: Quantum theory provides a significant example of two intermingling hallmarks of science: the ability to consistently combine physical systems and study them compositely; and the power to extract predictions in the form of correlations. A striking consequence of this facet is the violation of a principle termed $\textit{local realism}$, which has been experimentally demonstrated via so-called $\textit{Bell tests}$. The prediction of this phenomenon originates as quantum systems are prescribed to combine according to the $\textit{composition postulate}$, i.e. the tensor-product rule. This rule has also an operationally sound formulation -- rather than just a purely mathematical one -- given in terms of discriminability of states via local measurements. Yet, both the theoretical and the empirical status of such postulate has been constantly challenged over the decades: is it possible to deduce it from the remaining postulates? Here, we solve this long-standing problem by answering in the negative. We formulate a family of operational theories that are solely distinguished from standard quantum theory by their system-composition rule, while, at the same time, they cannot be told apart by Bell-like experiments. Quantum theory is thus established to genuinely embody more content than quantum correlations. As a result, foundational programmes based on single-system principles only, or on mere Bell-like correlations, are operationally incomplete. On the experimental side, ascertaining the independence of postulates is a fundamental step to adjudicate between quantum theory and alternative physical theories: hence, the composition postulate deserves to be experimentally scrutinised independently of the other features of quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Sphere Packing on a Quantum Computer for Chromatography Modeling</title>

Abstract: Column chromatography is an important process in downstream biopharmaceutical manufacturing that enables high-selectivity separation of proteins through various modalities, such as affinity, ion exchange, hydrophobic interactions, or a combination of the aforementioned modes. Current mechanistic models of column chromatography typically abstract particle-level phenomena, in particular adsorption kinetics. A mechanistic model capable of incorporating particle-level phenomena would increase the value derived from mechanistic models. To this end, we model column chromatography via sphere packing, formulating three versions, each with increasing complexity. The first, homogeneous circle packing, is recast as maximum independent set and solved by the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm on a quantum computer. The second, heterogeneous circle packing, is formulated as a graphical optimization problem and solved via classical simulations, accompanied by a road map to a quantum solution. An extension to the third, heterogeneous sphere packing, is formulated mathematically in a manner suitable to a quantum solution. Finally, detailed resource scaling is conducted to estimate the quantum resources required to simulate the most realistic model, providing a pathway to quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Quantum trails and memory effects in the phase space of chaotic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eigenstates of a chaotic system can be enhanced along underlying unstable periodic orbits in so-called quantum scars, making it more likely for a particle launched along one such orbits to be found still there at long times. Unstable periodic orbits are however a negligible part of the phase space, and a question arises regarding the structure of the wavefunction elsewhere. Here, we address this question and show that a weakly-dispersing dynamics of a localized wavepacket in phase space leaves a "quantum trail" on the eigenstates, that is, makes them vary slowly when moving along a trajectories in phase space, even if not periodic. The quantum trails underpin a remarkable dynamical effect: for a system initialized in a localized wavepacket, the long-time phase-space distribution is enhanced along the short-time trajectory, which can result in ergodicity breaking. We provide the general intuition for these effects and prove them in the stadium billiard, for which an unwarping procedure allows to visualize the phase space on the two-dimensional space of the page.</description>

      <title>Rapid optimal work extraction from a quantum-dot information engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conversion of thermal energy into work is usually more efficient in the slow-driving regime, where the power output is vanishingly small. Efficient work extraction for fast driving protocols remains an outstanding challenge at the nanoscale, where fluctuations play a significant role. In this Letter, we use a quantum-dot Szilard engine to extract work from thermal fluctuations with maximum efficiency over two decades of driving speed. We design and implement a family of optimised protocols ranging from the slow- to the fast-driving regime, and measure the engine's efficiency as well as the mean and variance of its power output in each case. These optimised protocols exhibit significant improvements in power and efficiency compared to the naive approach. Our results also show that, when optimising for efficiency, boosting the power output of a Szilard engine inevitably comes at the cost of increased power fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous SU(2) symmetries in homogeneous integrable U(1) circuits and transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study symmetries of quantum circuits with nearest-neighbor U(1) gates discovering new inhomogeneous screw SU(2) and ${\rm U}_q({\rm sl}_2)$ symmetries. Despite the model being homogeneous -- all gates are the same -- symmetry generators are not. Rather, they exhibit an even-odd staggering and a nonzero quasi-momentum, and depend on gate parameters. Such parameter-dependent symmetries can be identified by the Ruelle-Pollicott spectrum of a momentum-resolved truncated propagator. They can be thought of as a generalization of the standard SU(2) symmetry of the XXZ model that uppon introducing the staggered field splits into a local SU(2) symmetry and a non-local ${\rm U}_q({\rm sl}_2)$. Picking an arbitrary U(1) gate and varying the gate duration one will transition through different phases: fractal ballistic transport, Kardar-Parisi-Zhang superdiffusion at the critical manifold including superdiffusive helix states, and diffusion within which there is also localization. To correctly explain transport the non-local SU(2) symmetries do not matter, while the inhomogeneous local ones that almost commute with the propagator do.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Suppression of Errors in Quantum Random Access Memory under Extended Noise Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum random access memory (QRAM) is required for numerous quantum algorithms and network architectures. Previous work has shown that the ubiquitous bucket-brigade QRAM is highly resilient to arbitrary local incoherent noise channels occurring during the operation of the QRAM [PRX Quantum 2, 020311 (2021)], with query infidelities growing only polylogarithmically with memory width when errors are assumed to only occur on individual routers. We extend this result to a large class of generalized settings that arise in realistic situations, including arbitrary initialization errors, spatially correlated errors, as well as coherent errors, maintaining the polylogarithmic scaling in all instances. Fully quantifying the extent to which QRAM's noise resilience holds may provide a guide for the design of QRAM architectures - for instance, the resilience to initialization errors indicates that a reset protocol between successive queries may not be necessary. In the case of coherent errors, we find an up-to-quadratic increase in the infidelity bound, and therefore discuss generalizations to randomized compiling schemes, which usually are rendered inapplicable in the QRAM setting, to tailor these errors into more favorable stochastic noise.</description>

      <title>Computable Cross Norm in Tensor Networks and Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Computable Cross Norm (CCNR) was recently discussed in Ref.~\cite{Yin:2022toc} as a measure of multipartite entanglement in a condensed matter context. In this short note, we point out that it is closely related to the $(2,n)$-R\'enyi reflected entropy, which has been studied in the context of AdS/CFT. We discuss the calculation of the CCNR in random tensor networks as well as holographic CFTs. The holographic dual involves a backreacted entanglement wedge cross section in a geometry sourced by R\'enyi-2 cosmic branes. We perform explicit calculations for two intervals in a hyperbolic random tensor network as well the vacuum state of a 2D holographic CFT, and analyze the occurence of a connected-to-disconnected phase transition. The example illustrates the validity of the proposal for analytic continuation in holography for arbitrary values of R\'enyi parameter $n$. We comment on a symmetry-resolved generalization of this quantity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically study quantum avalanches in one-dimensional disordered spin systems by attaching two XXZ spin chains. One chain has low disorder representing a rare Griffith's region, or thermal inclusion, and the second has larger disorder, i.e., disorder larger than the observed finite-size crossover. Comparing dynamics of this system to identical systems with uniformly large disorder, we find evidence for exponentially slow thermalization (in disorder) within the many-body localized regime when the rare region is present. We observe a decay of the spin imbalance in the bulk of the large disorder region that persists to long times ($\sim10^{4}$) and find a universal behavior of the spectral function.</description>

Abstract: We study the global forms of class $\mathcal{S}[A_{N-1}]$ 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ theories by deriving their defect groups (charges of line operators up to screening by local operators) from Coulomb branch data. Specifically, we employ an explicit construction of the BPS quiver for the case of full regular punctures to show that the defect group is $(\mathbb{Z}_N)^{2g}$, where $g$ is the genus of the associated Riemann surface. This determines a sector of surface operators in the 5d symmetry TFT. We show how these can also be identified from dimensional reduction of M-theory. We discuss connections to the theory of cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Closed-channel parameters of Feshbach resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14962v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates how the closed channel of a Feshbach resonance is characterised by experimental observables. Surprisingly, it is found that the two-body observables associated with the Feshbach resonance can be insensitive to the properties of the closed channel. In particular, it is impossible in this situation to determine the energy of the bound state causing the resonance from the usual experimental data. This is the case for all magnetic Feshbach resonances in ultracold atoms, due to their deep two-body interaction potentials. This insensitivity highlights a major difference with Feshbach resonances that involve shallow interaction potentials, such as hadron resonances. It appears however that short-range two-body correlations and three-body observables are affected by a parameter of the closed channel called the "closed-channel scattering length". A photoassociation experiment is proposed to measure this parameter in ultracold atom systems.</description>

      <title>Fractional domain wall statistics in spin chains with anomalous symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the statistics of domain wall excitations in quantum spin chains. We focus on systems with finite symmetry groups represented by matrix product unitaries (MPUs), i.e. finite depth quantum circuits. Such symmetries can be anomalous, in which case gapped phases which they support must break the symmetry. The lowest lying excitations of those systems are thus domain wall excitations. We investigate the behavior of these domain walls under exchange, and find that they can exhibit non-trivial exchange statistics. This statistics is completely determined by the anomaly of the symmetry, and we provide a direct relation between the known classification of MPU symmetry actions on ground states and the domain wall statistics. Already for the simplest case of a $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry, we obtain that the presence of an anomalous MPU symmetry gives rise to domain wall excitations which behave neither as bosons nor as fermions, but rather exhibit fractional statistics. Finally, we show that the exchange statistics of domain walls is a physically accessible quantity, by devising explicit measurement operators through which it can be determined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement properties in non-equilibrium quantum systems with the SU(1, 1) structure. Through M\"obius transformation, we map the dynamics of these systems following a sudden quench or a periodic drive onto three distinct trajectories on the Poincar\'e disc, corresponding the heating, non-heating, and a phase boundary describing these non-equilibrium quantum states. We consider two experimentally feasible systems where their quantum dynamics exhibit the SU(1, 1) structure: the quench dynamics of the Bose-Einstein condensates and the periodically driven coupled oscillators. In both cases, the heating, non-heating phases, and their boundary manifest through distinct signatures in the phonon population where exponential, oscillatory, and linear growths classify these phases. Similarly, the entanglement entropy and negativity also exhibit distinct behaviors (linearly, oscillatory, and logarithmic growths) characterizing these phases, respectively. Notibly, for the periodically driven coupled oscillators, the non-equilibrium properties are characterized by two sets of SU(1, 1) generators. The corresponding two sets of the trajectories on two Poincar\'e discs lead to a more complex phase diagram. We identify two distinct phases within the heating region discernible solely by the growth rate of the entanglement entropy, where a discontinuity is observed when varying the parameters across the phase boundary within in heating region. This discontinuity is not observed in the phonon population.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00954v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To account for neutrino oscillations, it was postulated that the neutrino has nonvanishing mass and each flavor eigenstate is formed by a quantum superposition of three distinct mass eigenstates, whose probability amplitudes interfere with each other during its propagation. However, I find that a neutrino or antineutrino produced by the decay of an unstable particle cannot be in such a superposition, as different mass eigenstates, if they exist, are necessarily correlated with different momentum states of the composite system produced by the decay, which would destroy the quantum coherence among these mass eigenstates. I further find that the states of a neutrino and an electron become nonseparable after their charged-current interaction. This nonseparability leads to decoherence for neutrinos propagating in matter, but was not taken into consideration in previous investigations of the matter effect. Due to this decoherence, the deficit of solar electron neutrinos cannot exceed 1/2 based on the aforementioned postulation even if the corresponding superposition of mass eigenstates can be produced. These results unambiguously show that the origin of neutrino flavor transformations needs to be revisited. I propose an alternative mechanism that can reasonably account for neutrino transformations. It is based on virtual excitation of the Z bosonic field diffusing over the space. During the propagation, the neutrino can continually excite and then immediately re-absorb a virtual Z boson. This virtual bosonic excitation produces a backaction on the neutrino, enabling it to oscillate among three flavors. When the neutrino propagates in matter, its behavior is determined by the competition between the coherent flavor transformation and decoherence effect resulting from scatterings.</description>

      <title>Entanglement scaling and charge fluctuations in a Fermi liquid of composite fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The composite fermion Fermi liquid (CFL) state at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a Landau level is a paradigmatic non-Fermi liquid borne out purely by Coulomb interactions. But in what ways is this exotic state of matter different from a Fermi liquid? The CFL entanglement entropy was indeed found to exhibit a significant enhancement compared to free electrons [Shao et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 206402 (2015)], which was subsequently ruled out as a finite-size effect by the study of a lattice CFL analog [Mishmash and Motrunich, Phys. Rev. B 94, 081110 (2016)]. Moreover, the enhancement was not observed in a quasi-one-dimensional limit of the Coulomb ground state at $\nu=1/2$ [Geraedts et al., Science 352, 197 (2016)]. Here, we revisit the problem of entanglement scaling in the CFL state realized in a two-dimensional electron gas. Using Monte Carlo evaluation of the second R\'enyi entropy $S_2$ for the CFL variational wave function, we show that the entanglement enhancement is present not only at $\nu=1/2$ but also at $\nu=1/4$, as well as in bosonic CFL states at $\nu=1$ and $\nu=1/3$ fillings. In all cases, we find the scaling of $S_2$ with subsystem size to be enhanced compared to the non-interacting case, and insensitive to the choice of geometry and projection to the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that, for CFL states, the variance of the particle number in a subsystem obeys area-law scaling with a universal subleading corner contribution, in stark contrast with free fermions. Our results establish the enhanced entanglement scaling and suppressed charge fluctuations as fingerprints of non-Fermi-liquid correlations in CFL states.</description>

      <title>Dephasing and error dynamics affecting a singlet-triplet qubit during coherent spin shuttling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information transport over micron to millimeter scale distances is critical for the operation of practical quantum processors based on spin qubits. One method of achieving a long-range interaction is by coherent electron spin shuttling through an array of silicon quantum dots. In order to execute many shuttling operations with high fidelity, it is essential to understand the dynamics of qubit dephasing and relaxation during the shuttling process in order to mitigate them. However, errors arising after many repeated shuttles are not yet well documented. Here, we probe decay dynamics contributing to dephasing and relaxation of a singlet-triplet qubit during coherent spin shuttling over many $N$ repeated shuttle operations. We find that losses are dominated by magnetic dephasing for small $N&lt;10^3$ and by incoherent shuttle errors for large $N&gt;10^3$. Additionally, we estimate shuttle error rates below $1\times10^{-4}$ out to at least $N=10^3$, representing an encouraging figure for future implementations of spin shuttling to entangle distant qubits.</description>

      <title>Thermal Pure States for Systems with Antiunitary Symmetries and Their Tensor Network Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal pure state algorithms, which employ pure quantum states representing thermal equilibrium states instead of statistical ensembles, are useful both for numerical simulations and for theoretical analysis of thermal states. However, their inherently large entanglement makes it difficult to represent efficiently and limits their use in analyzing large systems. Here, we propose a new tensor network algorithm for constructing thermal pure states for systems with certain antiunitary symmetries, such as time-reversal or complex conjugate symmetry. Our method utilizes thermal pure states that, while exhibiting volume-law entanglement, can be mapped to tensor network states through simple transformations. Furthermore, our approach does not rely on random sampling and thus avoids statistical uncertainty. Moreover, we can compute not only thermal expectation values of local observables but also thermodynamic quantities. We demonstrate the validity and utility of our method by applying it to the one-dimensional XY model and the two-dimensional Ising model on a triangular lattice. Our results suggest a new class of variational wave functions for volume-law states that are not limited to thermal equilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Regimes of Steady-State Turbulence in a Quantum Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to model the development of turbulence in a quantum fluid confined by a cuboid box potential, and forced by shaking along one axis. We observe the development of isotropic turbulence from anisotropic forcing for a broad range of forcing amplitudes, and characterise the states through their Fourier spectra, vortex distributions, and spatial correlations. For weak forcing the steady-state wave-action spectrum exhibits a $k^{-3.5}$ scaling over wavenumber $k$; further decomposition uncovers the same power law in both compressible kinetic energy and quantum pressure, while the bulk superfluid remains phase coherent and free from extended vortices. As the forcing energy exceeds the chemical potential, extended vortices develop in the bulk, disrupting the $k^{-3.5}$ scaling. The spectrum then transitions to a $k^{-7/3}$ regime for compressible kinetic energy only, associated with dense vortex turbulence, and phase coherence limited to the healing length. The strong forcing regime is consistent with an inverse cascade of compressible energy driven by small-scale vortex annihilation.</description>

      <title>A note on the holographic time-like entanglement entropy in Lifshitz theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the holographic time-like entanglement entropy (TEE) in the boundary theory of three-dimensional Lifshitz spacetime. There have been various holographic proposals for TEE in recent years and we test those proposals in the Lifshitz background. We obtain the analytic result for TEE in each proposal, compare the results, and analyze how the anisotropic scaling affects the TEE. We find that different holographic proposals give the same result for TEE in the Lifshitz background. Our analysis further suggests that the TEE of the Lifshitz system contains real and imaginary parts, both of which depend on the anisotropic parameter.</description>

      <title>Extending the European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies: new proficiency triangle and qualification profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing industrial relevance of quantum technologies (QTs), a new quantum workforce with special qualification will be needed. Building this workforce requires educational efforts, ranging from short term training to degree programs. In order to plan, map and compare such efforts, personal qualifications or job requirements, standardization is necessary. The European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies (CFQT) provides a common language for QT education. The 2024 update to version~2.5 extends it by the new proficiency triangle and qualification profiles: The proficiency triangle proposes six proficiency levels for three proficiency areas, specifying knowledge and skills for each level. Nine qualification profiles show prototypical qualifications or job roles relevant to the quantum industry, with the required proficiency, examples, and suggestions. This is an important step towards the standardization of QT education. The CFQT update is based on the results of an analysis of 34 interviews on industry needs. The initial findings from the interviews were complemented by iterative refinement and expert consultation.</description>

      <title>Relative volume of comparable pairs under semigroup majorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ of stochastic matrices induces a semigroup majorization relation $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$ on the set $\Delta_{n-1}$ of probability $n$-vectors. Pick $X,Y$ at random in $\Delta_{n-1}$: what is the probability that $X$ and $Y$ are comparable under $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$? We review recent asymptotic ($n\to\infty$) results and conjectures in the case of majorization relation (when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of doubly stochastic matrices), discuss natural generalisations, and prove a new asymptotic result in the case of majorization, and new exact finite-$n$ formulae in the case of UT-majorization relation, i.e. when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of upper-triangular stochastic matrices.</description>

      <title>Architectural Patterns for Designing Quantum Artificial Intelligence Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilising quantum computing technology to enhance artificial intelligence systems is expected to improve training and inference times, increase robustness against noise and adversarial attacks, and reduce the number of parameters without compromising accuracy. However, moving beyond proof-of-concept or simulations to develop practical applications of these systems while ensuring high software quality faces significant challenges due to the limitations of quantum hardware and the underdeveloped knowledge base in software engineering for such systems. In this work, we have conducted a systematic mapping study to identify the challenges and solutions associated with the software architecture of quantum-enhanced artificial intelligence systems. The results of the systematic mapping study reveal several architectural patterns that describe how quantum components can be integrated into inference engines, as well as middleware patterns that facilitate communication between classical and quantum components. Each pattern realises a trade-off between various software quality attributes, such as efficiency, scalability, trainability, simplicity, portability, and deployability. The outcomes of this work have been compiled into a catalogue of architectural patterns.</description>

      <title>Two-photon coupling via Josephson element I: Breaking the symmetry with magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a coupling element based on a symmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and show that it mediates a two-photon interaction. This and other inductive interactions due to the SQUID can be switched off in situ. We derive the system Hamiltonian for coupled resonator and rf SQUID. The rf SQUID dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of energy states and acts as an artificial atom. We discuss how the Josephson symmetry breaks owing to magnetic fields in the superconducting loops. We assess that the two-photon coupling strength reaches 18 MHz which can exceed the single-photon capacitive interaction in the coupler.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Multi-Entropy Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the multi-partite entanglement structure of an evaporating black hole and its Hawking radiation by dividing the radiation into finer subsystems. Using the multi-entropy of these configurations, we define a black hole multi-entropy curve, which describes how the multi-entropy changes during the black hole evaporation. This black hole multi-entropy curve is a natural generalization of the Page curve since the multi-entropy reduces to the entanglement entropy for the bi-partite case. The multi-entropy curve keeps increasing in the early time. It reaches the maximum value at the multi-entropy time, which is later than the Page time, and starts to decrease. However, it does not decrease to zero at the end of the black hole evaporation. This non-zero value of the multi-entropy represents the secret entanglement between Hawking particles.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative features in the Lie-algebraic K\"ahler sigma model with fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the trans-series structure of a quantum mechanical system originating from a Lie-algebraic K\"ahler sigma model with multiple right-handed chiral fermions, extending previous results for the standard onecomplex projective ($\mathbb{CP}^1$) model [1],[2] to its deformed counterpart. We identify and analyze saddle point solutions and examine their contributions within the perturbative expansions of the ground state energy, revealing that the ambiguity structure observed in the $\mathbb{CP}^1$ model persists in the deformed model as well. Additionally, we explore the role of the elongation parameter and its potential impact on higher-loop corrections, and propose that it becomes relevant in shaping the system's quantum behavior from the three-loop level. This verifies that the trans-series framework provides a comprehensive approach to capturing the structure of quantum fluctuations and ambiguities in these deformed sigma models.</description>
