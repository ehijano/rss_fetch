      <title>MOND as a transformation between non-inertial reference frames via Sciama's interpretation of Mach's Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19007</link>

Abstract: Milgrom's Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) correction to Newtonian gravity or inertia is shown to be equivalent to a more fundamental transformation between a non-inertial local reference frame and the fixed background of the observable universe, complying with Mach's principle. Both Newton's gravitational constant and Milgrom's MOND acceleration parameter or scale constant are substituted for two varying, measurable, physical, and cosmological parameters under the justification of Sciama's interpretation of Mach's principle: causally connected mass and size of the universe. This Machian interpretation, scale-invariant and free from fundamental constants and free parameters with the exception of the speed of light as the speed of causality and gravity, is based on relative field intensities of the small and large scale of the universe. It respects the Machian effect from Sciama's model, by which, in absence of a background, rotational speed is undefined up to the speed of light. The Machian MOND approximation is a necessary feature of a phenomenological nonlinear theory of modified inertia or nonlinear theory of modified gravity which incorporates Mach's principle in agreement with galaxy rotation curves.</description>

      <title>Generalized formulation for ideal light-powered systems through energy and entropy flow analysis Part 2: Beyond the first-order evaluation under realistic conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For photosynthetic systems under irradiation not limited to blackbody radiation, this study formulates the ideal efficiency and Boltzmann factor in a general form based on energy-entropy flow analysis, assuming zero entropy generation within the system as the ideal condition. The non-equilibrium contribution between the radiation and system, which increases with the absorption rate and reduces the ideal efficiency, is quantitatively analyzed, first for monochromatic light. Based on these results, a unified formula for the ideal efficiency of a light-powered system with an absorption rate |$\varepsilon$| for non-monochromatic light diluted with a dilution factor d after being emitted by blackbody radiation at temperature T is derived in the most compact form. This formulation is then extended to include cases wherein entropy was discarded from the system via radiation simultaneously with waste heat. This leads to a unified reclassification of several previously proposed ideal efficiencies, such as the Jeter, Spanner, and Petela, as the basis of practical efficiency, based on flow conditions. Furthermore, in this study, previous frameworks on light-powered systems are classified into piston-cylinder (closed photon gas) and flowing radiation (open photon gas) models, demonstrating that the latter better suits microscopic light-powered systems. Finally, two issues related to the ideal efficiency derived from the prior flowing radiation model (Landsberg and Tonge, 1980), often referred to as the Landsberg limit, have been resolved using a simplified mathematical model constructed in this study based on Einstein's absorption and radiation theory. The ideal efficiency obtained is found to be very similar to Carnot efficiency.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetism from relativistic fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a matter-space framework characterizing particles and establish its compatibility with electromagnetism. In this approach, matter, such as photons, is considered to reside in a three-dimensional matter space, with the electromagnetic fields observed in four-dimensional spacetime interpreted as projections from this space. By imposing gauge symmetry through constraint equations, we derive the relationship between the vector field $A_a$ and the antisymmetric tensor $F_{ab}$, forming part of Maxwell's equations. The remaining Maxwell equation is obtained through the action principle in relativistic fluid dynamics. Notably, we demonstrate that this imposition of the gauge symmetry and constraints develop the dynamics. This framework offers a fresh perspective on particle-field interactions and deepens the theoretical foundation of relativistic fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Cartan cosmology and the S8 problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurements of cluster abundances, gravitational lensings, redshift space distortions and peculiar velocities at lower redshifts point out to much smaller sigma_8 than its value deduced from the measurements of the CMB fluctuations assuming the standard LCDM cosmology. We examine and compare the sigma_8 redshift dependence calculated within the gauge invariant formalism in the LCDM and the Einstein-Cartan cosmology. It appears that the Einstein-Cartan cosmology provides systematically larger sigma_8(z) for higher redshifts compared to the LCDM. Because the CMB fluctuations comprise a cosmological data from the recombination era to the present, the S8 problem of the LCDM cosmology is not a surprise from the standpoint of the Einstein-Cartan cosmology.</description>

Abstract: The results of an experiment with a generator of a stream of charged drops are reported. The glow of subjects placed in the stream is observed. The volume of the glowing region reaches 20 cm$^3$ at a current less than 20 $\mu$A through the object. Ideas are expressed concerning the connection between St.Elmo fire and the observed glow.</description>

      <title>Canonical quantization of the complex scalar field without making use of its real and imaginary parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We proceed to the canonical quantization of the complex scalar field without making use of its real and imaginary parts. Our motivation is to formally connect, as tightly as possible, the quantum-field notions of particle and antiparticle - most prominently represented, formally, by creation and annihilation operators - to the initial classical field theory - whose main formal object is the field amplitude at a given spacetime point. Our point of view is that doing this via the use of the real and imaginary parts of the field is not satisfying. The derivation demands to consider, just before quantization, the field and its complex conjugate as independent fields, which yields a system of two copies of independent complex scalar fields. One then proceeds to quantization with these two copies, which leads to the introduction of two families of creation and annihilation operators, corresponding to particles on the one hand, and antiparticles on the other hand. One realizes that having two such families is the only hope for being able to "invert" the definitions of the creation and annihilation in terms of the Fourier quantized fields, so as to obtain an expression of the direct-space fields in terms of these creation and annihilation operators, because the real-field condition used in the case of a real scalar field does not hold for a complex scalar field. This hope is then met by introducing the complex-conjugate constraint at the quantum level, that is, that the second independent field copy is actually the complex conjugate of the first. All standard results are then recovered in a rigorous and purely deductive way. While we reckon our derivation exists in the literature, we have not found it.</description>
