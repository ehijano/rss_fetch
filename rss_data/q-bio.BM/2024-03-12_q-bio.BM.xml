      <title>Extracting Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) from Biomedical Literature using Attention-based Relational Context Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are crucial to understand living systems, harvesting these data is essential to probe disease development and discern gene/protein functions and biological processes. Some curated datasets contain PPI data derived from the literature and other sources (e.g., IntAct, BioGrid, DIP, and HPRD). However, they are far from exhaustive, and their maintenance is a labor-intensive process. On the other hand, machine learning methods to automate PPI knowledge extraction from the scientific literature have been limited by a shortage of appropriate annotated data. This work presents a unified, multi-source PPI corpora with vetted interaction definitions augmented by binary interaction type labels and a Transformer-based deep learning method that exploits entities' relational context information for relation representation to improve relation classification performance. The model's performance is evaluated on four widely studied biomedical relation extraction datasets, as well as this work's target PPI datasets, to observe the effectiveness of the representation to relation extraction tasks in various data. Results show the model outperforms prior state-of-the-art models. The code and data are available at: https://github.com/BNLNLP/PPI-Relation-Extraction</description>

      <title>Membrane Interactions in Alzheimer`s Treatment Strategies with Multitarget Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires innovative strategies beyond current single-target drugs. This Letter to the Editor suggests that multitarget molecules, especially those targeting neuronal membrane protection, could offer a comprehensive approach to AD therapy, advocating for further research into their mechanisms and therapeutic potential.</description>

      <title>Study of the mechanism of electroacupuncture regulating ferroptosis, inhibiting bladder neck fibrosis, and improving bladder urination function after suprasacral spinal cord injury using proteomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose The aim of this study was to explore whether electroacupuncture regulates phenotypic transformation of smooth muscle cells by inhibiting ferroptosis and inhibiting fibrosis, thereby improving bladder urination function after suprasacral spinal cord injury (SSCI). Methods The experiment was divided into sham, model, and electroacupuncture group. After 10 days of electroacupuncture intervention, urodynamic examination was performed, and bladder neck was taken for HE staining, tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics analysis, Western blot(WB) detection, ferrous ion concentration detection and Masson staining. Conclusion Electroacupuncture may prevent the phenotype of bladder neck smooth muscle cells from transforming from contraction type to synthesis type by inhibiting ferroptosis, inhibit bladder neck fibrosis, improve bladder neck compliance, and thus improve bladder urination function after SSCI.</description>

      <title>Assembly Theory is a weak version of algorithmic complexity based on LZ compression that does not explain or quantify selection or evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Assembly Theory, pathway complexity, the assembly index, and the assembly number are subsumed and constitute a weak version of algorithmic (Kolmogorov-Solomonoff-Chaitin) complexity reliant on an approximation method based upon statistical compression, their results obtained due to the use of methods strictly equivalent to the LZ family of compression algorithms used in compressing algorithms such as ZIP, GZIP, or JPEG. Such popular algorithms have been shown to empirically reproduce the results of AT's assembly index and their use had already been reported in successful application to separating organic from non-organic molecules, and the study of selection and evolution. Here we exhibit and prove the connections and full equivalence of Assembly Theory to Shannon Entropy and statistical compression, and AT's disconnection as a statistical approach from causality. We demonstrate that formulating a traditional statistically compressed description of molecules, or the theory underlying it, does not imply an explanation or quantification of biases in generative (physical or biological) processes, including those brought about by selection and evolution, when lacking in logical consistency and empirical evidence. We argue that in their basic arguments, the authors of AT conflate how objects may assemble with causal directionality, and conclude that Assembly Theory does nothing to explain selection or evolution beyond known and previously established connections, some of which are reviewed here, based on sounder theory and better experimental evidence.</description>

      <title>Application of Quantum Tensor Networks for Protein Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that protein sequences can be thought of as sentences in natural language processing and can be parsed using the existing Quantum Natural Language framework into parameterized quantum circuits of reasonable qubits, which can be trained to solve various protein-related machine-learning problems. We classify proteins based on their subcellular locations, a pivotal task in bioinformatics that is key to understanding biological processes and disease mechanisms. Leveraging the quantum-enhanced processing capabilities, we demonstrate that Quantum Tensor Networks (QTN) can effectively handle the complexity and diversity of protein sequences. We present a detailed methodology that adapts QTN architectures to the nuanced requirements of protein data, supported by comprehensive experimental results. We demonstrate two distinct QTNs, inspired by classical recurrent neural networks (RNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), to solve the binary classification task mentioned above. Our top-performing quantum model has achieved a 94% accuracy rate, which is comparable to the performance of a classical model that uses the ESM2 protein language model embeddings. It's noteworthy that the ESM2 model is extremely large, containing 8 million parameters in its smallest configuration, whereas our best quantum model requires only around 800 parameters. We demonstrate that these hybrid models exhibit promising performance, showcasing their potential to compete with classical models of similar complexity.</description>
