      <title>Giant Hyperfine Interaction between a Dark Exciton Condensate and Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interaction of a dark exciton Bose-Einstein condensate with the nuclei in GaAs/AlGaAs coupled quantum wells and find clear evidence for nuclear polarization buildup that accompanies the appearance of the condensate. We show that the nuclei are polarized throughout the mesa area, extending to regions which are far away from the photoexcitation area, and persisting for seconds after the excitation is switched off. Photoluminescence measurements in the presence of RF radiation reveal that the hyperfine interaction between the nuclear and electron spins is enhanced by two orders of magnitude. We suggest that this large enhancement manifests the collective nature of the N-excitons condensate, which amplifies the interaction by a factor of sqrt{N}.</description>

      <title>Topology and $\mathcal{PT}$ Symmetry in a Non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain with Periodic Hopping Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of periodic hopping modulation on a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain that exhibits non-Hermiticity in presence of an onsite staggered imaginary potential. This dissipative, non-Hermitian (NH) extension amply modifies the features of the topological trivial phase (TTP) and the topological nontrivial phase (TNP) of the SSH chain. Though a weak potential can respect the parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry keeping the energy eigenvalues real, a strong potential breaks $\mathcal{PT}$ conservation leading to imaginary end state and complex bulk state energies in the system. Furthermore for large commensurate periodicity of the hopping, in-gap states appear that take either purely real or purely imaginary eigenvalues depending on the strenth of both NH potential and hopping modulation. In particular, this paper is engaged with hopping periodicities of 2, 4 and 8 lattice spacings. The localization of end states and in-gap states at the boundaries are investigated for those hopping periodicities. Though we find that topology and $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry are not very directly connected, distinguishing distribution of $\mathcal{PT}$ broken and unbroken phases are clearly observed within TNP and TTP in our systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-Hall effect in topological materials: Evaluating the proper spin current in systems with arbitrary degeneracies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-Hall effect underpins some of the most active topics in modern physics, including spin torques and the inverse spin-Hall effect, yet it lacks a proper theoretical description. This makes it difficult to differentiate the SHE from other mechanisms, as well as differentiate band structure and disorder contributions. Here, by exploiting recent analytical breakthroughs in the understanding of the intrinsic spin-Hall effect, we devise a density functional theory method for evaluating the conserved (proper) spin current in a generic system. Spin non-conservation makes the conventional spin current physically meaningless, while the conserved spin current has been challenging to evaluate since it involves the position operator between Bloch bands. The novel method we introduce here can handle band structures with arbitrary degeneracies and incorporates all matrix elements of the position operator, including the notoriously challenging diagonal elements, which are associated with Fermi surface, group velocity, and dipolar effects but often diverge if not treated correctly. We apply this method to the most important classes of spin-Hall materials: topological insulators, 2D quantum spin-Hall insulators, non-collinear antiferromagnets, and strongly spin-orbit coupled metals. We demonstrate that the torque dipole systematically suppresses contributions to the conventional spin current such that, the proper spin current is generally smaller in magnitude and often has a different sign. Remarkably, its energy-dependence is relatively flat and featureless, and its magnitude is comparable in all classes of materials studied. These findings will guide the experiment in characterizing charge-to-spin interconversion in spintronic and orbitronic devices. We also discuss briefly a potential generalisation of the method to calculate extrinsic spin currents generated by disorder scattering.</description>

      <title>Cross-Platform Autonomous Control of Minimal Kitaev Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary quantum devices are reaching new limits in size and complexity, allowing for the experimental exploration of emergent quantum modes. However, this increased complexity introduces significant challenges in device tuning and control. Here, we demonstrate autonomous tuning of emergent Majorana zero modes in a minimal realization of a Kitaev chain. We achieve this task using cross-platform transfer learning. First, we train a tuning model on a theory model. Next, we retrain it using a Kitaev chain realization in a two-dimensional electron gas. Finally, we apply this model to tune a Kitaev chain realized in quantum dots coupled through a semiconductor-superconductor section in a one-dimensional nanowire. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we predict the tunneling and Cooper pair splitting rates from differential conductance measurements, employing these predictions to adjust the electrochemical potential to a Majorana sweet spot. The algorithm successfully converges to the immediate vicinity of a sweet spot (within 1.5 mV in 67.6% of attempts and within 4.5 mV in 80.9% of cases), typically finding a sweet spot in 45 minutes or less. This advancement is a stepping stone towards autonomous tuning of emergent modes in interacting systems, and towards foundational tuning machine learning models that can be deployed across a range of experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of surface electron spectrum and cyclotron motion in the CDW phase of Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW) instability drastically affects the surface electron spectrum of a Weyl semimetal. We show that in the CDW phase, the Fermi arcs reconnect into either closed Fermi loops or Frieze patterns traversing the reconstructed surface mini-Brillouin zone. For the closed reconnection topology, the application of an out-of-plane magnetic field leads to a cyclotron motion of the surface electrons. We determine the cyclotron frequency as a function of the electron energy and the magnitude of the CDW gap $\Delta$ for various orientations of the Fermi arcs. For weak coupling, the period of cyclotron motion is dominated by the time of traversal of the arc reconnection regions and is inversely proportional to $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Transverse Cooper-Pair Rectifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal devices like diodes are key components in modern electronics covering broad applications ranging from transistors to logic circuits thanks to the output rectified signal in the direction parallel to the input. In this work, we predict a transverse Cooper-pair rectifier in which a non-reciprocal current is driven perpendicular to the driving field, when inversion, time reversal, and mirror symmetries are broken simultaneously. The Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism is developed to describe the transverse current-voltage relation in a normal-metal/superconductor tunneling junction with an effective built-in supercurrent which leads to an asymmetric and anisotropic Andreev reflection due to the lack of symmetry constraints. The asymmetry in the Andreev reflection is induced when inversion and time reversal symmetry are broken by the supercurrent component parallel to the junction while the anisotropy occurs when the mirror symmetry with respect to the normal of the junction interface is broken by the perpendicular supercurrent component to the junction. Compared to the conventional longitudinal one, the transverse rectifier supports fully polarized diode efficiency and colossal nonreciprocal conductance rectification, completely decoupling the path of the input excitation from the output rectified signal. This work provides a formalism for realizing transverse non-reciprocity in superconducting junctions, which is expected to be achieved after some modification to the current experimental setups and may pave the way for future low-dissipation and fast superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Braiding of Topological Edge Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Braiding is a geometric concept that manifests itself in a variety of scientific contexts from biology to physics, and has been employed to classify bulk band topology in topological materials. Topological edge states can also form braiding structures, as demonstrated recently in a type of topological insulators known as M\"obius insulators, whose topological edge states form two braided bands exhibiting a M\"obius twist. While the formation of M\"obius twist is inspiring, it belongs to the simple Abelian braid group $\mathbb{B}_2$. The most fascinating features about topological braids rely on the non-Abelianness in the higher-order braid group $\mathbb{B}_N$ ($N \geq 3$), which necessitates multiple edge bands, but so far it has not been discussed. Here, based on the gauge enriched symmetry, we develop a scheme to realize non-Abelian braiding of multiple topological edge bands. We propose tight-binding models of topological insulators that are able to generate topological edge states forming non-Abelian braiding structures. Experimental demonstrations are conducted in two acoustic crystals, which carry three and four braided acoustic edge bands, respectively. The observed braiding structure can correspond to the topological winding in the complex eigenvalue space of projective translation operator, akin to the previously established point-gap winding topology in the bulk of the Hatano-Nelson model. Our work also constitutes the realization of non-Abelian braiding topology on an actual crystal platform, but not based on the "virtual" synthetic dimensions.</description>

      <title>Tunable nonlinear excitonic optical response in biased bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biased bilayer graphene (BBG) is an important system for studies of excitonic effects in graphene--based systems, with its easily tunable bandgap. This bandgap is governed by an external gate voltage, allowing one to tune the optical response of the system. In this paper, we study the excitonic linear and nonlinear optical response of Bernal stacked BBG as a function of the gate voltage, both for in--plane (IP) and out--of--plane (OOP) directions. Based on a semi-analytical model of the electronic structure of BBG describing the influence of gate voltage on excitonic binding energies, we focus our discussion on both the IP and OOP excitonic response. Both linear and second harmonic generation (SHG) nonlinear responses are shown to be very sensitive to the gate voltage, as both the interband momentum matrix elements and the bandgap of the system will vary greatly with bias potential.</description>

      <title>Negative-energy spin waves in antiferromagnets for spin-current amplification and analogue gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnonic black holes-analogue event horizons for the spin-wave collective excitations of ordered magnets-can be used for fundamental research, for example for investigating Hawking radiation, but also for technological applications of spin waves. Here we show how to engineer a horizon for spin waves in antiferromagnets, which have the attractive feature of fast magnetization dynamics and linear dispersion relation. We propose a set-up with spatially varying exchange interaction with spin transfer torque to implement the horizon and a second set-up for the amplification of spin waves consisting of an antiferromagnet subject to a spatially varying external magnetic field that is driven by spin orbit torque. We compute the values of parameters needed to implement the horizon and to have amplification of spin waves. We develop the corresponding Klein-Gordon equation and quantify the amplification. Our work paves the way for investigation of Hawking radiation of spin waves and for antiferromagnet-based spin-waves amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Equivalence analysis between Quasi-coarse-grained and Atomistic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, simulation methods based on the scaling of atomic potential functions, such as quasi-coarse-grained dynamics and coarse-grained dynamics, have shown promising results for modeling crystalline systems at multiple scales. However, this letter presents evidence suggesting that the spatiotemporal trajectories of coarse-grained systems generated by such simulation methods exhibit a complete correspondence with those of specific molecular dynamics systems. In essence, current coarse-grained simulation methods involve a direct amplification of the results obtained from molecular dynamics simulations across spatial and temporal scales, yet they may lack the capability to adequately capture authentic scale effects. Consequently, the findings of related studies warrant careful re-evaluation. Furthermore, this study underscores the importance of not only verifying the consistency of mesoscale simulation methods with microscopic simulations but also meticulously assessing their capability to accurately forecast mesoscale physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Crystal Thermal Hall Effect in Insulating Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that magnetic insulators with a collinear and compensated order can exhibit a thermal Hall effect even at zero magnetic field if they have altermagnetic symmetries. We predict a finite thermal Hall conductivity vector $\boldsymbol{\kappa}_\text{H}$ for a rutile-inspired effective spin model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Within the linear spin-wave theory, we identify two magnon branches that carry identical Berry curvature and give rise to a finite $\boldsymbol{\kappa}_\text{H}$, which can be controlled by the N\'eel vector orientation and by strain. The thermal Hall response is further complemented with a spin Nernst response to contrast spin and heat transport in altermagnetic insulators with those in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Our results establish the crystal thermal Hall effect of magnons and we discuss material candidates for experimental realization, such as MnF$_2$, CoF$_2$, and NiF$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integer quantized Hall effect reveals a state of scattering-free carrier transport and quantized resistance in a two-dimensional conductor exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field. The quantized resistance is observed for the Hall bar geometry, i.e., if the current carrying contacts are connected by sample edges. A widely accepted model is the Landauer-Buttiker picture, which assumes an incompressible, i.e., electrically insulating bulk state surrounded by one-dimensional edge channels giving rise to quantized resistance. This model is challenged by the screening theory, which takes into account electron-electron interaction and predicts for the quantized Hall plateaus current flow in incompressible strips, which gradually shifts from the sample edges into the bulk with increasing magnetic field. We present direct proof of the predicted scattering-free bulk transport by exploring a Hall bar augmented with an additional contact placed in its center away from the Hall bar edges. Our result supports the screening theory.</description>

      <title>Disorder-resilient transport through dopant arrays in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chains and arrays of phosphorus donors in silicon have recently been used to demonstrate dopant-based quantum simulators. The dopant disorder present in fabricated devices must be accounted for. Here, we theoretically study transport through disordered donor-based $3\times 3$ arrays that model recent experimental results. We employ a theory that combines the exact diagonalization of an extended Hubbard model of the array with a non-equilibrium Green's function formalism to model transport in interacting systems. We show that current flow through the array and features of measured stability diagrams are highly resilient to disorder. We interpret this as an emergence of uncomplicated behavior in the multi-electron system dominated by strong correlations, regardless of array filling, where the current follows the shortest paths between source and drain sites that avoid possible obstacles. The reference $3\times 3$ array has transport properties very similar to three parallel 3-site chains coupled only by interchain Coulomb interaction, which indicates a challenge in characterizing such devices.</description>

      <title>Raman-phonon-polariton condensation in a transversely pumped cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons are hybrid states of light and matter that are typically realised when optically active phonons couple strongly to photons. We suggest a new approach to realising phonon polaritons, by employing a transverse-pumping Raman scheme, as used in experiments on cold atoms in optical cavities. This approach allows hybridisation between an optical cavity mode and any Raman-active phonon mode. Moreover, this approach enables one to tune the effective phonon-photon coupling by changing the strength of the transverse pumping light. We show that such a system may realise a phonon-polariton condensate. To do this, we find the stationary states and use Floquet theory to determine their stability. We thus identify distinct superradiant and lasing states in which the polariton modes are macroscopically populated. We map out the phase diagram of these states as a function of pump frequencies and strengths. Using parameters for transition metal dichalcogenides, we show that realisation of these phases may be practicably obtainable. The ability to manipulate phonon mode frequencies and attain steady-state populations of selected phonon modes provides a new tool for engineering correlated states of electrons.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions in thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are promising candidates for magnetic memory and logic devices, making the development of ways to transport skyrmions efficiently and precisely of significant interest. Here, we investigate the transport of skyrmions by surface acoustic waves (SAWs) via several modalities using micromagnetic simulations. We show skyrmion pinning sites created by standing SAWs at anti-nodes and skyrmion Hall-like motion without pinning driven by travelling SAWs. We also show how orthogonal SAWs formed by combining a longitudinal travelling SAW and a transverse standing SAW can be used for the 2D positioning of skyrmions. Our results also suggest SAWs offer a viable approach to the transport of multiple skyrmions along multichannel racetrack.</description>

Abstract: Topological semimetals, such as the Weyl and Dirac semimetals, represent one of the most active research fields in modern condensed matter physics. The peculiar physical properties of these systems mainly originate from their underlying symmetries, emergent relativistic dispersion, and band topology. In this Letter, we present a different class of gapless systems in three dimensions, dubbed $\textit{geometric semimetals}$. These semimetals are protected by the generalized chiral and rotation symmetries, but are topologically trivial. Nevertheless, we show that their band geometry is nontrivial, as evidenced by the nonzero quantum metric trace with possible quantization. The possible realization in synthetic-matter experiments is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Orbitronics harnesses non-equilibrium densities and flows of electrons orbital angular momentum (OAM). Although the OAM must be long lived to be useful in information processing, the mechanisms leading to OAM non-conservation remain unknown. Here we show that an electric field induces an intrinsic torque on the OAM mediated by the quantum metric tensor, without spin-orbit coupling or magnetic fields. The torque vanishes in pseudospin-1/2 systems with particle-hole symmetry but is nonzero in the presence of nontrivial textures. We discuss implications for topological materials and strategies for experimental observation.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry dictated topology in periodic gauge fields and realization in strained and twisted 2D materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersymmetry (SUSY) of Hamiltonian dictates double degeneracy between a pair of superpartners (SPs) transformed by supercharge, except at zero energy where modes remain unpaired in many cases. Here we explore a SUSY of complete isospectrum between SPs -- with paired zero modes -- realized by 2D electrons in zero-flux periodic gauge fields, which can describe twisted or periodically strained 2D materials. We find their low-energy sector containing zero (or threshold) modes must be topologically non-trivial, by proving that Chern numbers of the two SPs have a finite difference dictated by the number of zero modes and energy dispersion in their vicinity. In $30^\circ$ twisted bilayer (double bilayer) transition metal dichalcogenides subject to periodic strain, we find one SP is topologically trivial in its lowest miniband, while the twin SP of identical dispersion has a Chern number of $1$ ($2$), in stark contrast to time-reversal partners that have to be simultaneously trivial or nontrivial. For systems whose physical Hamiltonian corresponds to the square root of a SUSY Hamiltonian, such as twisted or strained bilayer graphene, we reveal that topological properties of the two SUSY SPs are transferred respectively to the conduction and valence bands, including the contrasted topology in the low-energy sector and identical topology in the high-energy sector. This offers a unified perspective for understanding topological properties in many flat-band systems described by such square-root models. Both types of SUSY systems provide unique opportunities for exploring correlated and topological phases of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: N\'eel ordered antiferromagnets exhibit two-mode squeezing such that their ground state is a nonclassical superposition of magnon Fock states. Here we theoretically demonstrate that antiferromagnets can couple to spin qubits via direct dispersive interaction stemming from, e.g., interfacial exchange. We demonstrate that this kind of coupling induces a magnon number dependent level splitting of the excited state resulting in multiple system excitation energies. This series of level splittings manifests itself as nontrivial excitation peaks in qubit spectroscopy thereby revealing the underlying nonclassical magnon composition of the antiferromagnetic quantum state. By appropriately choosing the drive or excitation energy, the magnonic state can be controlled via the qubit, suggesting that Fock states of magnon pairs can be generated deterministically. This enables achieving states useful for quantum computing and quantum information science protocols.</description>

      <title>Preservation of scalar spin chirality across a metallic spacer in synthetic antiferromagnets with chiral interlayer interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral magnetic textures are highly attractive for the development of spintronic devices, due to their properties to store and transport information in an energy efficient manner. In multilayered systems, these are typically stabilized via the interfacial intralayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which leads to configurations with both vector and scalar spin chirality. Additionally, it has been recently observed that DMI may also promote interlayer vector spin chirality, coupling spins in different magnetic layers via non-magnetic spacer layers, an effect referred to as interlayer DMI (IL-DMI).
  Here, we present evidence of the preservation of interlayer scalar spin chirality across the non-magnetic metallic spacer of a synthetic antiferromagnet (SAF) with orthogonal anisotropy axes and IL-DMI. We draw this conclusion from a combined comprehensive experimental and computational study using scattering and imaging X-ray techniques. We find a direct relationship between the sign of the net out-of plane orientation of one of the layers, and the preferential in-plane vector spin chirality in the other layer after its demagnetization. Current IL-DMI models and other mechanisms which could potentially yield such chiral configurations fail in explaining these experimental results. This work thus uncovers a new flavor of chiral interlayer interactions, demanding the further development of theoretical models in order to describe the microscopic origin of the effect.</description>

      <title>Revealing the spatial nature of sublattice symmetry</title>

Abstract: The sublattice symmetry on a bipartite lattice is commonly regarded as the chiral symmetry in the AIII class of the tenfold Altland-Zirnbauer classification. Here, we reveal the spatial nature of sublattice symmetry, and show that this assertion holds only if the periodicity of primitive unit cells agrees with that of the sublattice labeling. In cases where the periodicity does not agree, sublattice symmetry is represented as a glide reflection in energy-momentum space, which inverts energy and simultaneously translates some $k$ by $\pi$, leading to substantially different physics. Particularly, it introduces novel constraints on zero modes in semimetals and completely alters the classification table of topological insulators compared to class AIII. Notably, the dimensions corresponding to trivial and nontrivial classifications are switched, and the nontrivial classification becomes $\mathbb{Z}_2$ instead of $\mathbb{Z}$. We have applied these results to several models, including the Hofstadter model both with and without dimerization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose multi-layer moire structures in strong external magnetic fields as a novel platform for realizing highly-tunable, frustrated Hubbard physics with topological order. Identifying the layer degree of freedom as a pseudo spin, allows us to retain SU(2) symmetry while controlling ring-exchange processes and concurrently quenching the kinetic energy by large external magnetic fields. This way, a broad class of interacting Hubbard-Hofstadter states and their transitions can be studied. Remarkably, in the limit of strong interactions the system becomes Mott insulating and we find chiral pseudo spin liquid phases which are induced by the magnetic field. We find that this topologically ordered state remains exceptionally stable towards relevant perturbations. We discuss how layer pseudo-spin can be probed in near-term experiments. As the magnetic flux can be easily tuned in moire systems, our approach provides a promising route towards the experimental realization and control of topologically ordered phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Nanocavity enhanced photon coherence of solid-state quantum emitters operating up to 30 K</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid-state emitters such as epitaxial quantum dots have emerged as a leading platform for efficient, on-demand sources of indistinguishable photons, a key resource for many optical quantum technologies. To maximise performance, these sources normally operate at liquid helium temperatures ($\sim 4~\mathrm{K}$), introducing significant size, weight and power requirements that can be impractical for proposed applications. Here we experimentally resolve the two distinct temperature-dependent phonon interactions that degrade indistinguishability, allowing us to demonstrate that coupling to a photonic nanocavity can greatly improve photon coherence at elevated temperatures up to $30~\mathrm{K}$ that are compatible with compact cryocoolers. We derive a polaron model that fully captures the temperature-dependent influence of phonons observed in our experiments, providing predictive power to further increase the indistinguishability and operating temperature of future devices through optimised cavity parameters.</description>

      <title>Telling different unravelings apart via nonlinear quantum-trajectory averages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation (ME) governs the density matrix of open quantum systems (OQSs). When an OQS is subjected to weak continuous measurement, its state evolves as a stochastic quantum trajectory, whose statistical average solves the ME. The ensemble of such trajectories is termed an unraveling of the ME. We propose a method to operationally distinguish unravelings produced by the same ME in different measurement scenarios, using nonlinear averages of observables over trajectories. We apply the method to the paradigmatic quantum nonlinear system of resonance fluorescence in a two-level atom. We compare the Poisson-type unraveling, induced by direct detection of photons scattered from the two-level emitter, and the Wiener-type unraveling, induced by phase-sensitive detection of the emitted field. We show that a quantum-trajectory-averaged variance is able to distinguish these measurement scenarios. We evaluate the performance of the method, which can be readily extended to more complex OQSs, under a range of realistic experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Surface quantum critical phenomena in disordered Dirac semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a non-Anderson disorder driven quantum phase transition in a semi-infinite Dirac semimetal with a flat boundary. The conformally invariant boundary conditions, which include those that are time-reversal invariant, lead to nodal-like surface states on the boundary. In this case the boundary becomes metallic at a critical disorder that is weaker than that for the semimetal-diffusive metal transition in the bulk. The latter transition takes place in the presence of a metallic surface; in the language of surface critical phenomena this corresponds to the so-called extraordinary transition. The lines of the surface and the extraordinary transitions meet at the special transition point. To elucidate universal properties at different transitions on the phase diagram, we employ renormalization group methods and compute the corresponding surface critical exponents using $\varepsilon$-expansion.</description>

      <title>A multi-module silicon-on-insulator chip assembly containing quantum dots and cryogenic radio-frequency readout electronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum processing units will be modules of larger information processing systems containing also digital and analog electronics modules. Silicon-based quantum computing offers the enticing opportunity to manufacture all the modules using the same technology platform. Here, we present a cryogenic multi-module assembly for multiplexed readout of silicon quantum devices where all modules have been fabricated using the same fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS process. The assembly is constituted by three chiplets: (i) a low-noise amplifier (LNA), (ii) a single-pole eight-throw switch (SP8T), and (iii) a silicon quantum dot (QD) array. We characterise each module individually and show (i) a gain over 35 dB, a bandwidth of 118 MHz, a minimum noise temperature of 4.2 K, (ii) an insertion loss smaller than 1.1 dB, a noise temperature smaller than 1.1 K across 0-2 GHz, and (iii) single-electron box (SEB) charge sensors. Finally, we combine all elements into a single demonstration showing time-domain radio-frequency multiplexing of two SEBs paving the way to an all-silicon quantum computing system.</description>
