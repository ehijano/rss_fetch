      <title>Solving The Dynamic Volatility Fitting Problem: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The volatility fitting is one of the core problems in the equity derivatives business. Through a set of deterministic rules, the degrees of freedom in the implied volatility surface encoding (parametrization, density, diffusion) are defined. Whilst very effective, this approach widespread in the industry is not natively tailored to learn from shifts in market regimes and discover unsuspected optimal behaviors. In this paper, we change the classical paradigm and apply the latest advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning(DRL) to solve the fitting problem. In particular, we show that variants of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Soft Actor Critic (SAC) can achieve at least as good as standard fitting algorithms. Furthermore, we explain why the reinforcement learning framework is appropriate to handle complex objective functions and is natively adapted for online learning.</description>

      <title>FinDKG: Dynamic Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models for Detecting Global Trends in Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic knowledge graphs (DKGs) are popular structures to express different types of connections between objects over time. They can also serve as an efficient mathematical tool to represent information extracted from complex unstructured data sources, such as text or images. Within financial applications, DKGs could be used to detect trends for strategic thematic investing, based on information obtained from financial news articles. In this work, we explore the properties of large language models (LLMs) as dynamic knowledge graph generators, proposing a novel open-source fine-tuned LLM for this purpose, called the Integrated Contextual Knowledge Graph Generator (ICKG). We use ICKG to produce a novel open-source DKG from a corpus of financial news articles, called FinDKG, and we propose an attention-based GNN architecture for analysing it, called KGTransformer. We test the performance of the proposed model on benchmark datasets and FinDKG, demonstrating superior performance on link prediction tasks. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of the KGTransformer on FinDKG for thematic investing, showing it can outperform existing thematic ETFs.</description>
