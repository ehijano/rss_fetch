      <title>Superconductivity in Magnetars: Exploring Type-I and Type-II States in Toroidal Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first two-dimensional general-relativistic analysis of superconducting regions in axially symmetric highly magnetized neutron star (magnetar) models with toroidal magnetic fields. We investigate the topology and distribution of type-II and type-I superconducting regions for varying toroidal magnetic field strengths and stellar masses by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations using the XNS code. Our results reveal that the outer cores of low- to intermediate-mass magnetars sustain superconductivity over larger regions compared to higher-mass stars with non-trivial distribution of type-II and type-I regions. Consistent with previous one-dimensional (1D) models, we find that regardless of the gravitational mass, the inner cores of magnetars with toroidal magnetic fields are devoid of $S$-wave proton superconductivity. Furthermore, these models contain non-superconducting, torus-shaped regions - a novel feature absent in previous 1D studies. Finally, we speculate on the potential indirect effects of superconductivity on continuous gravitational wave emissions from millisecond pulsars, such as PSR J1843-1113, highlighting their relevance for future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>A 7-Day Multi-Wavelength Flare Campaign on AU Mic. II: Electron Densities and Kinetic Energies from High-Frequency Radio Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M dwarfs are the most common type of star in the solar neighborhood, and many exhibit frequent and highly energetic flares. To better understand these events across the electromagnetic spectrum, a campaign observed AU Mic (dM1e) over 7 days from the X-ray to radio regimes. Here, we present high-time-resolution light curves from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) Ku band (12--18 GHz) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) K band (16--25 GHz), which observe gyrosynchrotron radiation and directly probe the action of accelerated electrons within flaring loops. Observations reveal 16 VLA and 3 ATCA flares of varying shapes and sizes, from a short (30 sec) spiky burst to a long-duration ($\sim$5 hr) decaying exponential. The Ku-band spectral index is found to often evolve during flares. Both rising and falling spectra are observed in the Ku-band, indicating optically thick and thin flares, respectively. Estimations from optically thick radiation indicate higher loop-top magnetic field strengths ($\sim$1 kG) and sustained electron densities ($\sim$10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) than previous observations of large M-dwarf flares. We estimate the total kinetic energies of gyrating electrons in optically thin flares to be between 10$^{32}$ and 10$^{34}$ erg when the local magnetic field strength is between 500 and 700 G. These energies are able to explain the combined radiated energies from multi-wavelength observations. Overall, values are more aligned with modern radiative-hydrodynamic simulations of M-dwarf flares, and future modeling efforts will better constrain findings.</description>

      <title>Probing interplanetary scintillation using broadband VLBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in VLBI instrumentation, driven by the geodetic community's goal of achieving positioning accuracy of 1 mm and stability of 0.1 mm/y, have led to the development of new broadband systems. Here, we assess the potential of these new capabilities for space weather monitoring. These enhanced VLBI capabilities were used to investigate interplanetary scintillation (IPS), a phenomenon caused by the scattering of radio waves due to density irregularities in the solar wind. Compact radio sources near the Sun were observed using the AuScope VLBI array in Australia, which consists of 12-meter telescopes at Hobart, Katherine, and Yarragadee. The baseline lengths between these telescopes are approximately 3400 km (Hobart-Katherine), 3200 km (Hobart-Yarragadee), and 2400 km (Katherine-Yarragadee). The observations covered solar elongations from 6.5$^\circ$ to 11.3$^\circ$ and frequencies between 3 and 13 GHz. The study focused on phase scintillation as an indicator of turbulence in the solar wind. As the solar elongation decreased, we observed an increase in the phase scintillation index, consistent with theoretical models. Importantly, the broadband system also detected IPS using relatively weak radio sources. Additionally, the phase scintillation increased with baseline length, in agreement with Kolmogorov turbulence with an index of 11/3. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of geodetic broadband VLBI in capturing detailed features of the solar wind. This capability enables continuous space weather monitoring and advances our understanding of solar and interplanetary dynamics.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: massive stars at low metallicity: XII. The clumped winds of O-type (super)giants in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass loss governs the evolution of massive stars and shapes the stellar surroundings. To quantify the impact of the stellar winds we need to know the exact mass-loss rates; however, empirical constraints on the rates are hampered by limited knowledge of their small-scale wind structure or 'wind clumping'. We aim to improve empirical constraints on the mass loss of massive stars by investigating the clumping properties of their winds, in particular the relation between stellar parameters and wind structure. We analyse the optical and ultraviolet spectra of 25 O-type (super)giants in the LMC, using the model atmosphere code Fastwind and a genetic algorithm. We derive stellar and wind parameters including detailed clumping properties, such as the amount of clumping, the density of the interclump medium, velocity-porosity of the medium, and wind turbulence. We obtain stellar and wind parameters for 24 of our sample stars and find that the winds are highly clumped, with an average clumping factor of $f_{\rm cl}=33\pm14$, an interclump density factor of $f_{\rm ic}=0.2\pm0.1$, and moderate to strong velocity-porosity effects. The scatter around the average values of the wind-structure parameters is large. With the exception of a significant, positive correlation between the interclump density factor and mass loss, we find no dependence of clumping parameters on either mass-loss rate or stellar properties. In the luminosity range that we investigate, the empirical and theoretical mass-loss rates both have a scatter of about 0.5~dex, or a factor 3. Within this uncertainty, the empirical rates and the theoretical predictions agree. The origin of the scatter of the empirical mass-loss rates requires further investigation. It is possible that our description of wind clumping is still not sufficient to capture effects of the structured wind; this could contribute to the scatter.</description>

      <title>Analyses of anomalous lensing events detected from the UKIRT microlensing survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) microlensing survey was conducted over four years, from 2016 to 2019, with the goal of serving as a precursor to future near-infrared microlensing surveys (Shvartzvald et al. 2017). Focusing on stars in the Galactic center and utilizing near-infrared passbands, the survey identified approximately one thousand microlensing events, 27 of which displayed anomalies in their light curves (Wen et al. 2023). This paper presents an analysis of these anomalous events, aiming to uncover the underlying causes of the observed anomalies. The events were analyzed under various configurations, considering the potential binarity of both the lens and the source. For 11 events that were additionally observed by other optical microlensing surveys, including those conducted by the OGLE, KMTNet, and MOA collaborations, we incorporated their data into our analysis. Among the reported anomalous events, we revealed the nature of 24 events except for three events, in which one was likely to be a transient variable, and two were were difficult to accurately characterize their nature due to the limitations of the available data. We confirmed the binary lens nature of the anomalies in 22 events. Among these, we verified the earlier discovery that the companion in the binary lens system UKIRT11L is a planetary object. Accurately describing the anomaly in UKIRT21 required a model that accounted for the binarity of both the lens and the source. For two events UKIRT01 and UKIRT17, the anomalies could be interpreted using either a binary-source or a binary-lens model.</description>

      <title>Using Lithium and Beryllium to Study Structure and Evolution of Rotating Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical composition of the Sun is still a highly controversial issue. No solar model has yet been able to simultaneously reproduce the solar lithium and beryllium abundances, along with helioseismic results, including the rotation profile. Lithium and beryllium are fragile elements that are highly sensitive to the physical conditions, as well as to transport and mixing processes within and below the convective zone (CZ). Uncovering the transport mechanisms responsible for the depletion of Li and Be in the Sun is crucial for using them as tools to understand stellar interiors and the associated transport and mixing processes. We constructed rotating solar models based on Magg's abundance scale, incorporating the effects of convective overshoot and magnetic fields. The rotating model exhibits superior sound speed and density profile and successfully reproduces the observed ratios $r_{02}$ and $r_{13}$. It also matches the seismically inferred CZ depth, surface helium abundance, and rotation profile, as well as the detected Li and Be abundances and neutrino fluxes within $1\sigma$. The depletion of Li is dominated by convective overshoot and rotational mixing, while Be depletion is primarily driven by gravitational settling and rotational mixing. The presence of the tachocline accelerates Li depletion but slows down Be depletion. These distinct depletion mechanisms result in the surface abundances of Li and Be evolving differently over time.</description>

      <title>V1047 Cen: The first Z And-type outburst observed in the classical nova binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2019, the classical nova V1047 Cen experienced an unusual outburst, the nature of which has not yet been clearly determined. In this paper, we show that the 2019 V1047~Cen outburst is of Z And-type -- a type that is characteristic and has so far been observed only in symbiotic binaries. We support our claim by modeling the near-ultraviolet to near-infrared spectral energy distribution, which revealed a close similarity between the fundamental parameters and the mass-loss rate of the burning white dwarf during the 2019 V1047 Cen outburst and those measured during Z And-type outbursts in symbiotic stars. All parameters are in agreement with the theoretical prediction when the accretion rate exceeds the stable burning limit for white dwarfs with masses less than 0.7 solar units. Our analysis showed that after a nova explosion, the Z And-type outburst can occur not only in symbiotic binaries but also in short-period cataclysmic variables, when the accretion-powered system changes to a nuclear-powered one, as a consequence of the donor's reaction to the nova explosion. Such a development promotes the production of Type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Radial flow component of Sun's high frequency retrograde inertial waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar inertial modes have the potential to surpass the diagnostic capabilities of acoustic waves in probing the deep interior of the Sun. The fulfillment of this potential requires an accurate identification and characterization of these modes. Among the set of detected inertial modes, the equatorially anti-symmetric "high-frequency retrograde'' (HFR) modes has attracted special interest because numerical studies have suggested that they are not purely toroidal, as initial observations suggested, and predicted that they would possess a significant radial flow signal at depth. Here, we analyze $\sim$13 years of HMI/SDO 5$^\circ$ ring tiles, and discover a horizontal-divergence signal, directly connected to radial flows, in the near surface layers of the Sun. We demonstrate that this signal is indeed part of the HFR modes and not spatial leakage from prograde flows associated with magnetic regions. The amplitudes of the horizontal divergence are approximately half that associated with radial vorticity. We also report the presence of a ridge of enhanced power, although with a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.3, in the retrograde frequencies that coincides with the HFR latitudinal overtones reported by models. Using numerical linear models we find reasonable agreement with observations, though future work on boundary considerations and the inclusion of the near-surface may improve future inferences. This is the first instance where numerical studies of solar inertial modes have guided observations, giving further confidence to past inferences that rely upon numerical models.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Quick Data Release (Q1) -- Photometric studies of known transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on serendipitous Euclid observations of previously known transients, using the Euclid Q1 data release. By cross-matching with the Transient Name Server (TNS) we identify 164 transients that coincide with the data release. Although the Euclid Q1 release only includes single-epoch data, we are able to make Euclid photometric measurements at the location of 161 of these transients. Euclid obtained deep photometric measurements or upper limits of these transients in the $I_E$, $Y_E$, $J_E$, and $H_E$ bands at various phases of the transient light-curves, including before, during, and after the observations of ground-based transient surveys. Approximately 70\% of known transients reported in the six months before the Euclid observation date and with discovery magnitude brighter than 24 were detected in Euclid $\IE$ images. Our observations include one of the earliest near-infrared detections of a Type~Ia supernova (SN 2024pvw) 15 days prior to its peak brightness, and the late-phase (435.9 days post peak) observations of the enigmatic core-collapse SN 2023aew. Euclid deep photometry provides valuable information on the nature of these transients such as their progenitor systems and power sources, with late time observations being a uniquely powerful contribution. In addition, Euclid is able to detect the host galaxies of some transients that were previously classed as hostless. The Q1 data demonstrate the power of the Euclid data even with only single-epoch observations available, as will be the case for much larger areas of sky in the Euclid Wide Survey.</description>

      <title>Connecting a Magnetized Disk to a Convective Low-mass Protostar: A Global Three-dimensional Model of Boundary Layer Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early stages of star formation, boundary layer accretion, where protostars accrete material from disks extending down to their surfaces, plays a crucial role. Understanding how a magneto-rotational-instability (MRI)-active disk connects to a protostar's surface remains a significant challenge. To investigate the mechanisms of mass and angular momentum transfer, we develop a global, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model of boundary layer accretion around a magnetized, convective low-mass protostar. Our results reveal that angular momentum transport mechanisms transition significantly from the outer MRI-active disk to the protostellar surface. Various mechanisms--MRI, spiral shocks, coronal accretion, jets, and disk winds--contribute to angular momentum transfer, resulting in three distinct disk structures: (1) the MRI-active disk, (2) the transition layer, and (3) the boundary layer. The simulated protostar is strongly magnetized due to the accumulation of the disk fields, wrapping by disk toroidal fields, and stellar dynamo activity. Magnetic concentrations analogous to starspots form on the protostar and interact with the rotating disk gas to generate spiral shocks. These shocks play a key role in driving accretion. These findings demonstrate the necessity of global MHD models for a comprehensive understanding of angular momentum transport. Additionally, we identify explosive events triggered by magnetic reconnection in both the protostar and the disk atmosphere. We also find decretion flows in the disk midplane, which may be important for the radial transport of refractory materials, such as Calcium-Aluminium-rich Inclusions (CAIs) precursor gas, to the outer disk.</description>

      <title>Turbulent power: a discriminator between sheaths and CMEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) directed at the Earth often drive large geomagnetic storms. Here we use velocity, magnetic field and proton density data from 152 CMEs that were sampled in-situ at 1 AU by the WIND spacecraft. We Fourier analyze fluctuations of these quantities in the quiescent pre-CME solar wind, sheath and magnetic cloud. We quantify the extent by which the power in turbulent (magnetic field, velocity and density) fluctuations in the sheath exceeds that in the solar wind background and in the magnetic cloud. For instance, the mean value of the power per unit volume in magnetic field fluctuations in the sheath is 76.7 times that in the solar wind background, while the mean value of the power per unit mass in velocity fluctuations in the sheath is 9 times that in the magnetic cloud. Our detailed results show that the turbulent fluctuation power is a useful discriminator between the ambient solar wind background, sheaths and magnetic clouds and can serve as a useful input for space weather prediction.</description>

      <title>The La Silla Schmidt Southern Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the La Silla Schmidt Southern Survey (LS4), a new wide-field, time-domain survey to be conducted with the 1 m ESO Schmidt telescope. The 268 megapixel LS4 camera mosaics 32 2k$\times$4k fully depleted CCDs, providing a $\sim$20 deg$^2$ field of view with $1''$ pixel$^{-1}$ resolution. The LS4 camera will have excellent performance at longer wavelengths: in a standard 45 s exposure the expected 5$\sigma$ limiting magnitudes in $g$, $i$, $z$ are $\sim$21.5, $\sim$20.9, and $\sim$20.3 mag (AB), respectively. The telescope design requires a novel filter holder that fixes different bandpasses over each quadrant of the detector. Two quadrants will have $i$ band, while the other two will be $g$ and $z$ band and color information will be obtained by dithering targets across the different quadrants. The majority (90%) of the observing time will be used to conduct a public survey that monitors the extragalactic sky at both moderate (3 d) and high (1 d) cadence, as well as focused observations within the Galactic bulge and plane. Alerts from the public survey will be broadcast to the community via established alert brokers. LS4 will run concurrently with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The combination of LS4+LSST will enable detailed holistic monitoring of many nearby transients: high-cadence LS4 observations will resolve the initial rise and peak of the light curve while less-frequent but deeper observations by LSST will characterize the years before and after explosion. Here, we summarize the primary science objectives of LS4 including microlensing events in the Galaxy, extragalactic transients, the search for electromagnetic counterparts to multi-messenger events, and cosmology.</description>

      <title>IMF slope derived from a pure probabilistic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar initial mass function is of great significance for the study of star formation and galactic structure. Observations indicate that the IMF follows a power-law form. This work derived that when the expected number of stars formed from a spherical molecular cloud is much greater than 1, there is a relationship between the slope $\alpha$ of the IMF and $r^n$ in the radius-density relation of spherically symmetric gas clouds, given by $\alpha = 3/(n+3)$ ($\Gamma_{\mathrm {IMF}} = n/(n+3)$). This conclusion is close to the results of numerical simulations and observations, but it is derived from a pure probabilistic model, which may have underlying reasons worth pondering.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Hall Effect Implementations in Hall-Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is no standard numerical implementation of the Hall effect, which is one of the non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects. Numerical instability arises when a simple implementation is used, in which the Hall electric field is added to the electric field to update magnetic fields without further modifications to the numerical scheme. In this paper, several implementations proposed in the literature are compared to identify an approach that provides stable and accurate results. We consider two types of implementations of the Hall effect. One is a modified version of the Harten-Lax-van Leer method (Hall-HLL) in which the phase speeds of whistler waves are adopted as the signal speeds; the other involves adding a fourth-order hyper-resistivity to a Hall-MHD code. Based on an extensive series of test calculations, we found that hyper-resistivity yields more accurate results than the Hall-HLL, particularly in problems where the whisler-wave timescale is shorter than the the timescale of physical processes of interest. Through both von Neumann stability analysis and numerical experiments, an appropriate coefficient for the hyper-resistivity is determined.</description>

      <title>The Herbig-Haro Outflow Content and Star-Forming Environment of Circinus West and East</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results of a spatially compete, high-sensitivity survey for Herbig-Haro (HH) outflows in the Western and Eastern Circinus molecular clouds. We have detected 28 new HH objects in Circinus West, doubling the number known in this dark nebula. We have also discovered 9 outflows in Circinus East, the first to be identified here. Although both Circinus West and East appear to be located at ~800 pc, their morphologies are distinct. Circinus West shows filamentary structure, while Circinus East is dominated by amorphous dark clouds. North-east of Circinus East, an extended distribution of young stars is centered on the ~6 Myr-old open cluster ASCC 79, which may have triggered the sequential formation of younger surrounding populations. New transverse velocities from Gaia show two dynamically distinct stellar populations in Circinus East; their velocity distribution is consistent with an active cloud-cloud collision between material ejected by the formation of O and B stars in ASCC~79 and a dynamically similar interloping cloud. Given the similar distances to Circinus West and East, and the presence in both of HH objects -- a phenomenon associated with stellar ages of ~1 Myr -- it is likely that these clouds are nominally related, but only Circinus East is subject to substantial feedback from the central cluster in the parent complex. This feedback appears to guide the morphology and evolution of Circinus East, resulting in a complex and possibly disruptive dynamical environment rich in star formation potential that contrasts with the relatively quiescent environment in Circinus West.</description>

      <title>A method of Extracting Flat Field from Real Time Solar Observation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15094v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for obtaining flat field rely on observed data collected under specific observation conditions to determine the flat field. However, the telescope pointing and the column fixed pattern noise of the CMOS detector change during actual observations, causing residual signals in real time observation data after flat field correction, such as interference fringes and column fixed pattern noise. In actual observations, the slight wobble of the telescope caused by the wind leads to shifts in the observed data. In this paper, a method of extracting the flat field from the real time solar observation data is proposed. Firstly, the average flat field obtained by multi-frame averaging is used as the initial value. A set of real-time observation data is input into the KLL method to calculate the correction amount for the average flat field. Secondly, the average flat field is corrected using the calculated correction amount to obtain the real flat field for the current observation conditions. To overcome the residual solar structures caused by atmospheric turbulence in the correction amount, real-time observation data are grouped to calculate the correction amounts. These residual solar structures are suppressed by averaging multiple groups, improving the accuracy of the correction amount. The test results from space and ground-based simulated data demonstrate that our method can effectively calculate the correction amount for the average flat field. The NVST 10830 A/Ha data were also tested. High-resolution reconstruction confirms that the correction amount effectively corrects the average flat field to obtain the real flat field for the current observation conditions. Our method works for chromosphere and photosphere data.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the fine-tunings of nuclear reactions in the Big Bang and in stars and draw some conclusions on the emergence of the light elements and the life-relevant elements carbon and oxygen. We also stress how to improve these calculations in the future. This requires a concerted effort of different communities, especially in nuclear reaction theory, lattice QCD for few-nucleon systems, stellar evolution calculations, particle physics and philosophy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that two prominent theories of ion heating in low-$\beta$ collisionless plasmas -- stochastic and quasi-linear heating -- represent similar physical processes in turbulence with different normalized cross helicities. To capture both, we propose a simple phenomenology based on the power in scales at which critically balanced fluctuations reach their smallest parallel scale. Simulations of test ions interacting with turbulence confirm our scalings across a wide range of different ion and turbulence properties, including with a steep ion-kinetic transition range as relevant to the solar wind.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy particles may be accelerated widely in stellar coronae; probably by the same processes we find in the Sun. Here, we have learned of two physical mechanisms that dominate the acceleration of solar energetic particles (SEPs). The highest energies and intensities are produced in "gradual" events at shock waves driven from the Sun by fast, wide coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Smaller, but more numerous, "impulsive" events with unusual particle composition are produced during magnetic reconnection in solar jets and flares. Jets provide open magnetic field lines where SEPs escape; closed magnetic loops contain this energy to produce bright, hot flares, perhaps even contributing to heating the low corona in profuse nanoflares. Streaming protons amplify Alfven waves upstream of the shocks. These waves scatter and trap SEPs and, in large events, modify the element abundances and flatten the low-energy spectra upstream. Shocks also reaccelerate residual ions from earlier impulsive events, when available, that characteristically dominate the energetic heavy-ion abundances. The large CME-driven shock waves develop an extremely wide longitude span, filling much of the inner heliosphere with energetic particles.</description>

      <title>Free-floating planetary mass objects in LDN 1495 from Euclid Early Release Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Substellar objects, including brown dwarfs and free-floating planetary-mass objects, are a significant product of star formation. Their sensitivity to initial conditions and early dynamical evolution makes them especially valuable for studying planetary and stellar formation processes. Aims. We search for brown dwarfs and isolated planetary mass objects in a young star-forming region to better constrain their formation mechanisms. Methods. We took advantage of the Euclid unprecedented sensitivity, spatial resolution and wide field of view to search for brown dwarfs and free-floating planetary mass objects in the LDN 1495 region of the Taurus molecular clouds. We combined the recent Euclid Early Release Observations with older very deep ground-based images obtained over more than 20 yr to derive proper motions and multiwavelength photometry and to select members based on their morphology and their position in a proper motion diagram and in nine color-magnitude diagrams. Results. We identified 15 point sources whose proper motions, colors, and luminosity are consistent with being members of LDN 1495. Six of these objects were already known M9-L1 members. The remaining nine are newly identified sources whose spectral types might range from late-M to early-T types, with masses potentially as low as 1~2 MJup based on their luminosity and according to evolutionary models. However, follow-up observations are needed to confirm their nature, spectral type, and membership. When it is extrapolated to the entire Taurus star-forming region, this result suggests the potential presence of several dozen free-floating planetary mass objects.</description>

      <title>On Using Gradient Dynamic Spectra (GraDS) to Study Type-II Solar Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar type-II radio bursts are coherent plasma emissions arising from magnetohydrodynamic shocks produced by either coronal mass ejections (CMEs) or flares. Type-II bursts sometimes show split-band emissions in the dynamic spectrum. When these split-band emissions come from regions just upstream and downstream of the shock, type-II band-splitting can be used as an important tool for estimating magnetic fields at the shock front. Earlier studies have shown that only $\sim$20\% of the type-IIs show morphologically similar split-bands. Imaging studies can unambiguously identify such instances, though they remain very rare. Here we suggest a useful approach to augment dynamic spectra-based studies by also examining the Gradient Dynamic Spectra (GraDS) of type-II emission. We also verified the conclusions of this approach against those from an imaging study.</description>

      <title>Propagation Times and Energy Losses of Cosmic Protons and Antiprotons in Interplanetary Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the heliospheric modulation of cosmic rays in interplanetary space, focusing on their propagation times and energy losses over the solar cycle. To perform the calculations, we employed a data-driven model based on the stochastic method. Our model was calibrated using time-resolved and energy-resolved data from several missions including AMS-02, PAMELA, EPHIN/SOHO, BESS, and data from Voyager-1. This approach allows us to calculate probability density functions for the propagation time and energy losses of cosmic protons and antiprotons in the heliosphere. Furthermore, we explore the temporal evolution of these probabilities spanning from 1993 to 2018, covering a full 22-year cycle of magnetic polarity, which includes two solar minima and two magnetic reversals. Our calculations were carried out for cosmic protons and antiprotons, enabling us to investigate the role of charge-sign dependent effects in cosmic ray transport. These findings provide valuable insights into the physical processes of cosmic-ray propagation in the heliosphere and contribute to a deeper understanding of the solar modulation phenomenon.</description>
