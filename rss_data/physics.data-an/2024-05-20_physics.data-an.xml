      <title>Model orthogonalization and Bayesian forecast mixing via Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One can improve predictability in the unknown domain by combining forecasts of imperfect complex computational models using a Bayesian statistical machine learning framework. In many cases, however, the models used in the mixing process are similar. In addition to contaminating the model space, the existence of such similar, or even redundant, models during the multimodeling process can result in misinterpretation of results and deterioration of predictive performance. In this work we describe a method based on the Principal Component Analysis that eliminates model redundancy. We show that by adding model orthogonalization to the proposed Bayesian Model Combination framework, one can arrive at better prediction accuracy and reach excellent uncertainty quantification performance.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning of Accurate Surrogates for Simulations of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly used to build computationally inexpensive surrogates for complex physical models. The predictive capability of these surrogates suffers when data are noisy, sparse, or time-dependent. As we are interested in finding a surrogate that provides valid predictions of any potential future model evaluations, we introduce an online learning method empowered by optimizer-driven sampling. The method has two advantages over current approaches. First, it ensures that all turning points on the model response surface are included in the training data. Second, after any new model evaluations, surrogates are tested and "retrained" (updated) if the "score" drops below a validity threshold. Tests on benchmark functions reveal that optimizer-directed sampling generally outperforms traditional sampling methods in terms of accuracy around local extrema, even when the scoring metric favors overall accuracy. We apply our method to simulations of nuclear matter to demonstrate that highly accurate surrogates for the nuclear equation of state can be reliably auto-generated from expensive calculations using a few model evaluations.</description>

      <title>Active Learning with Fully Bayesian Neural Networks for Discontinuous and Nonstationary Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active learning optimizes the exploration of large parameter spaces by strategically selecting which experiments or simulations to conduct, thus reducing resource consumption and potentially accelerating scientific discovery. A key component of this approach is a probabilistic surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process (GP), which approximates an unknown functional relationship between control parameters and a target property. However, conventional GPs often struggle when applied to systems with discontinuities and non-stationarities, prompting the exploration of alternative models. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in physical science problems, which are often characterized by abrupt transitions between different system states and rapid changes in physical property behavior. Fully Bayesian Neural Networks (FBNNs) serve as a promising substitute, treating all neural network weights probabilistically and leveraging advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for direct sampling from the posterior distribution. This approach enables FBNNs to provide reliable predictive distributions, crucial for making informed decisions under uncertainty in the active learning setting. Although traditionally considered too computationally expensive for 'big data' applications, many physical sciences problems involve small amounts of data in relatively low-dimensional parameter spaces. Here, we assess the suitability and performance of FBNNs with the No-U-Turn Sampler for active learning tasks in the 'small data' regime, highlighting their potential to enhance predictive accuracy and reliability on test functions relevant to problems in physical sciences.</description>
