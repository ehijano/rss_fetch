      <title>Revisiting the hydrodynamic modulation of short surface waves by longer waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic modulation of short ocean surface waves by longer ambient waves is a well-known ocean surface process that affects remote sensing, the interpretation of in situ wave measurements, and numerical wave forecasting. In this paper, we revisit the linear wave theory and derive higher-order steady solutions for the change of short-wave wavenumber, action density, and gravitational acceleration due to the presence of longer waves. We validate the analytical solutions with numerical simulations of the full wave crest and action conservation equations. The nonlinear analytical solutions of short-wave wavenumber, amplitude, and steepness modulation significantly deviate from the linear analytical solutions of Longuet-Higgins &amp; Stewart (1960), and are similar to the nonlinear numerical solutions by Longuet-Higgins (1987) and Zhang &amp; Melville (1990). The short-wave steepness modulation is attributed to be 5/8 due to the wavenumber, 1/4 due to the wave action, and 1/8 due to the effective gravity. We further examine the result of Peureux et al. (2021) who found through numerical simulations that the short-wave modulation grows unsteadily with each long-wave passage. We show that this unsteady growth only occurs only for homogeneous initial conditions as a special case and does not generally occur, for example in more realistic long-wave groups. The proposed steady solutions are a good approximation of the fully nonlinear numerical solutions in long-wave steepness up to ~0.2. Except for a subset of initial conditions, the solutions to the fully nonlinear crest-action conservation equations are mostly steady in the reference frame of the long waves.</description>

      <title>How thermally-induced secondary motions in offshore hybrid wind-solar farms improve wind-farm efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating floating photovoltaic (FPV) installations into offshore wind farms has been proposed as a major opportunity to scale up offshore renewable energy generation. The interaction between these hybrid wind-solar farms and the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is for the first time addressed in the present study. Idealized large-eddy simulations (LES) are used to investigate the flow through both isolated wind and solar farms, as well as combined wind-solar farms, in varying configurations and under different atmospheric conditions. When the FPV modules are arranged in long strips parallel to the flow direction, secondary motions arise due to the temperature difference between the warm FPV modules and colder sea surface, significantly affecting the horizontal distribution of mean wind speed in the ABL. Associated downdrafts between the strips increase entrainment of high-speed momentum from above, thereby increasing the wind speed at these locations. LES of hybrid wind-solar farms reveals that this is beneficial for wind turbines when they are located between the FPV arrays, leading, for the cases that we considered, to a farm-averaged power increase of up to 30% compared to an isolated wind farm. It is shown that the ratio between inertial and buoyancy forces, quantified by a heterogeneity Richardson number $Ri_h$, plays a crucial role in the formation of secondary flows and the resulting wind-farm power enhancement. We further show that no significant power gains, but also no losses emerge in situations when the solar panels are aligned perpendicular to the flow. Although the present results suggest a large potential for wind-solar hybridization, future research should focus on a wider range of scenarios, obtained from a realistic distribution of wind directions and speeds to quantify the potential beneficial impact on real annual power production.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Stochastic Modeling and Regularity in Turbulent Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative framework for analyzing the regularity of solutions to the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations by integrating Sobolev-Besov hybrid spaces with fractional operators and quantum-inspired dynamics. We propose new regularity theorems that address the multiscale and chaotic nature of fluid flows, offering novel insights into energy dissipation mechanisms. The introduction of a Schr\"odinger-like operator into the fluid dynamics model captures quantum-scale turbulence effects, enhancing our understanding of energy redistribution across different scales. The results also include the development of anisotropic stochastic models that account for direction-dependent viscosity, improving the representation of real-world turbulent flows. These advances in stochastic modeling and regularity analysis provide a comprehensive toolset for tackling complex fluid dynamics problems. The findings are applicable to fields such as engineering, quantum turbulence, and environmental sciences. Future directions include the numerical implementation of the proposed models and the use of machine learning techniques to optimize parameters for enhanced simulation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Conservative discontinuous Galerkin method for supercritical, real-fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a conservative discontinuous Galerkin method for the simulation of supercritical and transcritical real-fluid flows without phase separation. A well-known issue associated with the use of fully conservative schemes is the generation of spurious pressure oscillations at contact interfaces, which are exacerbated when a cubic equation of state and thermodynamic relations appropriate for this high-pressure flow regime are considered. To reduce these pressure oscillations, which can otherwise lead to solver divergence in the absence of additional dissipation, an L2-projection of primitive variables is performed in the evaluation of the flux. We apply the discontinuous Galerkin formulation to a variety of test cases. The first case is the advection of a sinusoidal density wave, which is used to verify the convergence of the scheme. The next two involve one- and two-dimensional advection of a nitrogen/n-dodecane thermal bubble, in which the ability of the methodology to reduce pressure oscillations and maintain solution stability is assessed. The final test cases consist of two- and three-dimensional injection of an n-dodecane jet into a nitrogen chamber.</description>

      <title>Effect of ozone sensitization on the reflection patterns and stabilization of standing detonation waves induced by curved ramps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standing detonation engines are a promising detonation-based propulsion technology. The most commonly studied standing detonation configuration involves a straight-sided wedge that induces an oblique detonation wave. A recently introduced standing-detonation-engine concept entails a curved ramp that leads to formation of a curved detonation wave. The continuous compression or expansion induced by the ramp curvature can have significant influence on the flow characteristics and wave patterns of the detonation wave, offering greater flexibility in engine design than conventional wedge geometries. This study aims to further explore this relatively new standing-detonation-engine concept by examining the effect of ignition promoters, namely ozone, on the flow characteristics and reflection patterns of curved detonation waves induced by convex or concave ramps inside a confined combustion chamber. Simulations are performed using a positivity-preserving and entropy-bounded discontinuous Galerkin method with curved elements to exactly represent the ramp geometries. In the context of wedge-induced oblique detonation waves, ozone addition has been found to decrease the initiation length and lead to a smoother shock-detonation transition. This can then attenuate the detonation and reduce stagnation-pressure losses, thus improving the potential propulsion performance. In the context of detonation waves induced by curved ramps, although ozone addition similarly shortens the initiation zone, the curvature of the ramp introduces additional effects that can amplify or counteract both the ozone-induced contraction of the initiation zone and the aforementioned detonation attenuation. Furthermore, specific examples are presented wherein ozone addition changes the type of reflection pattern (e.g., regular reflection, stationary Mach reflection, and non-stationary Mach reflection).</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigation of Radiative Transfers Interactions with Material Ablative Response for Hypersonic Atmospheric Entry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative transfer interactions with material ablation are critical contributors to vehicle heating during high-altitude, high-velocity atmospheric entry. However, the inherent complexity of fully coupled multi-physics models often necessitates simplifying assumptions, which may overlook key phenomena that significantly affect heat loads, particularly radiative heating. Common approximations include neglecting the contribution of ablation products, applying simplified frozen wall boundary conditions, or treating radiative transfer in a loosely coupled manner. This study introduces a high-fidelity, tightly coupled multi-solver framework designed to accurately capture the multi-physics challenges of hypersonic flow around an ablative body. The proposed approach consistently accounts for the interactions between shock-heated gases, surface material response, and radiative transfer. Our results demonstrate that including radiative heating in the surface energy balance substantially influences the ablation rate. Ablation products are shown to absorb radiative heat flux in the vacuum-ultraviolet spectrum along the stagnation line, while strongly emitting in off-stagnation regions. These findings emphasize the necessity of a tightly coupled multiphysics framework to faithfully capture the complex, multidimensional interactions in hypersonic flow environments, which conventional, loosely coupled models fail to represent accurately.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A framework for numerical evaluation of entropy-conservative volume fluxes in gas flows with internal energies is developed, for use with high-order discretization methods. The novelty of the approach lies in the ability to use arbitrary expressions for the internal degrees of freedom of the constituent gas species. The developed approach is implemented in an open-source discontinuous Galerkin code for solving hyperbolic equations. Numerical simulations are carried out for several model 2-D flows and the results are compared to those obtained with the finite volume-based solver DLR TAU.</description>

      <title>Deformation and breakup of a ferrofluid compound droplet migrating in a microchannel under a magnetic field: A phase-field-based multiple-relaxation time lattice Boltzmann study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Though ubiquitous in many engineering applications, including drug delivery, the compound droplet hydrodynamics in confined geometries have been barely surveyed. For the first time, this study thoroughly investigates the hydrodynamics of a ferrofluid compound droplet (FCD) during its migration in a microchannel under the presence of a pressure-driven flow and a uniform external magnetic field (UEMF) to manipulate its morphology and retard its breakup. Finite difference and phase-field multiple-relaxation time lattice Boltzmann approaches are coupled to determine the magnetic field and ternary flow system, respectively. Firstly, the influence of the magnetic Bond number (Bo) on the FCD morphology is explored depending on whether the core or shell is ferrofluid when the UEMF is applied along {\alpha}=0{\deg} and {\alpha}=90{\deg} relative to the fluid flow. It is ascertained that imposing the UEMF at {\alpha}=0{\deg} when the shell is ferrofluid can postpone the breakup. Intriguingly, when the core is ferrofluid, strengthening the UEMF enlarges the shell deformation. Afterward, the effects of the Capillary number (Ca), density ratio, viscosity ratio, radius ratio, and surface tension coefficients are scrutinized on the FCD deformation and breakup. The results indicate that augmenting the core-to-shell viscosity and density ratios accelerates the breakup process. Additionally, surface tension between the core and shell suppresses the core deformation. Moreover, increasing the Ca number intensifies the viscous drag force exerted on the shell, flattening its rear side, which causes a triangular-like configuration. Ultimately, by varying Bo and Ca numbers, five distinguished regimes are observed, whose regime map is established.</description>

      <title>Enhancing machine learning turbulence models via prediction of tensor basis normalized coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques, their application in developing turbulence models has become increasingly prevalent. Numerous machine learning turbulence models have recently been founded on Pope's general eddy-effective hypothesis. However, most of these models directly predict the non-dimensional Reynolds deviatoric tensor, treating tensor basis coefficients as intermediate variables. This approach presents three primary drawbacks. Firstly, it conflates the training error of the machine learning regression algorithm with the modeling error inherent in Pope's general eddy-effective hypothesis. Secondly, by treating tensor basis coefficients as intermediary values, researchers often overlook their significance and physical interpretation, particularly in black-box models such as neural networks. Thirdly, this method introduces numerical interdependence among tensor basis coefficients, violating the orthogonality of the tensor basis. Yin et al. (2022) proposed a neural network-based turbulence model that utilizes tensor basis coefficients as prediction labels. However, their framework employs a regularization method with numerous hyperparameters to achieve convergence and smooth results by leveraging information from the linear-eddy viscosity hypothesis. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and realizability of machine learning turbulence models by predicting tensor basis normalized coefficients. This method's fundamental principle is the normalization and bounding of prediction labels for machine learning algorithms. Utilizing periodic hills direct numerical simulation (DNS) data for training and testing, we demonstrate that our innovative method improves accuracy and realizability in neural network-based and symbolic regression-based turbulence models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Graph U-Nets for Mesh-Agnostic Spatio-Temporal Flow Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study aims to overcome the limitations of conventional deep-learning approaches based on convolutional neural networks in complex geometries and unstructured meshes by exploring the potential of Graph U-Nets for unsteady flow-field prediction. We present a comprehensive investigation of Graph U-Nets, originally developed for classification tasks, now tailored for mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal forecasting of fluid dynamics. Our focus is on enhancing their performance through systematic hyperparameter tuning and architectural modifications. We propose novel approaches to improve mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal prediction of transient flow fields using Graph U-Nets, enabling accurate prediction on diverse mesh configurations. Key enhancements to the Graph U-Net architecture, including the Gaussian-mixture-model convolutional operator and noise injection approaches, provide increased flexibility in modeling node dynamics: the former reduces prediction error by 95\% compared to conventional convolutional operators, while the latter improves long-term prediction robustness, resulting in an error reduction of 86\%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these enhancements in both transductive and inductive learning settings, showcasing the adaptability of Graph U-Nets to various flow conditions and mesh structures. This work contributes to the field of reduced-order modeling for computational fluid dynamics by establishing Graph U-Nets as a viable and flexible alternative to convolutional neural networks, capable of accurately and efficiently predicting complex fluid flow phenomena across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Flow and clogging of capillary droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Capillary droplets form due to surface tension when two immiscible fluids are mixed. We describe the motion of gravity-driven capillary droplets flowing through narrow constrictions and obstacle arrays in both simulations and experiments. Our new capillary deformable particle model recapitulates the shape and velocity of single oil droplets in water as they pass through narrow constrictions in microfluidic chambers. Using this experimentally validated model, we simulate the flow and clogging of single capillary droplets in narrow channels and obstacle arrays and find several important results. First, the capillary droplet speed profile is nonmonotonic as the droplet exits the narrow orifice, and we can tune the droplet properties so that the speed overshoots the terminal speed far from the constriction. Second, in obstacle arrays, we find that extremely deformable droplets can wrap around obstacles, which leads to decreased average droplet speed in the continuous flow regime and increased probability for clogging in the regime where permanent clogs form. Third, the wrapping mechanism causes the clogging probability in obstacle arrays to become nonmonotonic with surface tension $\Gamma$. At large $\Gamma$, the droplets are nearly rigid and the clogging probability is large since the droplets can not squeeze through the gaps between obstacles. With decreasing $\Gamma$, the clogging probability decreases as the droplets become more deformable. However, in the small-$\Gamma$ limit the clogging probability increases, since the droplets are extremely deformable and cause clogs as they wrap around the obstacles. The results from these studies are important for developing a predictive understanding of capillary droplet flows through complex and confined geometries.</description>

      <title>Palabos Turret: A Particle-Resolved Numerical Framework for Settling Dynamics of Arbitrary-Shaped Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particles transported in fluids are everywhere, occurring for example in indoor air, the atmosphere, the oceans, and engineering applications. In this study, a novel three-dimensional numerical framework -- the Palabos Turret is presented, which allows fully resolved simulations of the settling dynamics of heavy particles with arbitrary shapes over a wide range of particle Reynolds numbers. The numerical solver is based on the lattice Boltzmann method utilizing immersed-boundary approach and a recursive-regularized collision model to fully resolve the particle-fluid interactions. A predictor-corrector scheme is applied for the robust time integration of the six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) rigid-body motion. Finally, the multi-scale nature arising from the long free-fall distances of a particle is addressed through a dynamic memory allocation scheme allowing for a virtually infinite falling distance. This solver allows for the simulation of particles of any arbitrary shape. The proposed framework is validated using the analytical and experimental data of freely-falling spheres, ellipsoids, and an irregular particle in a wide range of Reynolds numbers between $5\times10^{-1}$ and $4\times10^4$. For different Reynolds numbers and particle shapes considered, the Palabos Turret shows excellent agreement compared to theoretical and experimental values with a median relative deviation of $\pm1.5\%$ and a maximum deviation of $\pm5\%$. The Palabos Turret enables an in-depth analysis of the translational and rotational dynamics of particles with complex geometries.</description>
