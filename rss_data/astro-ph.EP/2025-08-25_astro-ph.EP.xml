      <title>Terrestrial Exoplanet Internal Structure Constraints Enabled by Comprehensive Host Star Characterization Reveal that Terrestrial Planets in Mean-motion Resonances are Water Rich</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanet mass and radius inferences fundamentally rely on host star mass and radius inferences. Despite the importance of host star mass, radius, and elemental abundance inferences for the derivation of exoplanet internal structure constraints, published constraints have often been based on inferences that are not self-consistent. For 24 dwarf stars hosting terrestrial exoplanets, we use astrometric and photometric data plus high-resolution spectroscopy to infer accurate, precise, homogeneous, and physically self-consistent photospheric and fundamental stellar parameters as well as elemental abundances. We infer updated planetary masses and radii using these data plus Doppler and transit observables, then use the complete data set to derive constraints on the core-mass fractions of these terrestrial exoplanets. We find that the population of resonant or likely formerly resonant terrestrial exoplanets represented by Kepler-36 b and Kepler-105 c has a significantly lower mean core-mass fraction than the rest of the terrestrial exoplanets in our sample. Their resonant configurations suggest that they migrated inwards from more distant formation locations, and we attribute their low densities to the incorporation and retention of significant amounts of water during their formation. We confirm that the ultra-short-period exoplanets 55 Cnc e and WASP-47 e have densities inconsistent with pure-rock compositions. We propose that they are both the stripped cores of mini-Neptunes and associate their low densities with the presence of significant amounts of hydrogen, helium, water, and/or other volatiles in their interiors. We verify that our results are independent of stellar parameter and elemental abundance inference approach and therefore robust.</description>

      <title>Thermal-orbital evolution of Eris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large Kuiper Belt object (KBO) Eris is nearly as big as Pluto and has a small moon, Dysnomia. Constraints on the system's spin and orbit characteristics were recently used to argue for a dissipative Eris, requiring a differentiated structure but not necessarily a subsurface ocean. Here, we model the thermal history of Eris coupled to its spin-orbital evolution, finding a subsurface ocean is preferred in order for Eris to be sufficiently dissipative. Spinning down Eris without an ocean is difficult, requiring a warm convecting ice shell protected by a thick insulating layer and very dissipative anelastic behavior in ice. Oceans make up 77-100% of successful thermal-orbital evolution models, depending on the parameters assumed, which increases to &gt;98% when the Andrade $\beta$ parameter for ice is restricted to $\beta\leq3\times10^{-11}$ Pa$^{-1}$ s$^{-0.25}$. Oceans freeze over by the present day unless insulation (porosity, gas clathrates) or antifreeze are present.</description>

      <title>Extreme Lithium Depletion in Solar Twins: Challenging Non-Standard Mixing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium (Li) is a powerful tracer of stellar mixing, gradually depleted in solar twins by non-standard transport below the convective zone. Here, we identify six new solar twins with exceptionally low Li levels that are not explained by current non-standard mixing models and, together with our previously reported anomalous solar twin HIP 8522, suggest a distinct population marked by a violent evolutionary past. Employing high-resolution spectra ($R=60,000 - 165,000$), we infer precise stellar parameters and chemical compositions, including Li abundances. We consider possible scenarios generating enhanced mixing, including planetary engulfment, blue straggler stars (BSSs), and early episodic accretion. Our planet engulfment simulations indicate that only one star may have engulfed an exoplanet, rapidly depleting Li via thermohaline convection. In the BSS scenario, radial velocity data rule out binary mass transfer, revealing no stellar companions but instead two new exoplanets. If these stars are field BSSs, a binary merger is likely though uncertain given that current BSS models focus mostly on stars in open clusters. Using pre-main-sequence episodic accretion models, we find that solar-mass stars can experience enhanced Li depletion without significant beryllium (Be) depletion. This is consistent with the Be abundances measured in two of our stars and represents the most plausible scenario, pending Be measurements for the remaining stars. These unique stars, together with HIP 8522, represent exceptional cases for testing stellar evolution models and probing internal mixing processes in Sun-like stars.</description>

      <title>Pushing the limits of eccentricity in planet-disc interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19917</link>

Abstract: Modelling the gravitational interaction between an eccentric perturber and a differentially shearing gas disc is a longstanding problem with various astrophysical applications, ranging from the evolution of planetary systems to the migration of black holes embedded in AGN discs. Recent work has advanced a global, linear, modal approach for calculating the excited wake and the resulting feedback on the perturber's orbital evolution. In this work we perform a complementary suite of targeted hydrodynamic simulations to test this linear framework across a range of disc temperature and density profiles. In particular, we push from circular orbits to highly eccentric trajectories for which the perturber moves supersonically with respect to the background gas. We find remarkable agreement between our simulations and the linear methodology across a range of diagnostics -- lending support to the predicted wake morphologies, complex radial torque density profiles, and torque reversal phenomena, which occur when the eccentricity exceeds the local aspect ratio. In contrast, comparison with previous fitting functions exposes noticeable discrepancies, cautioning against their indiscriminate use in studies which explore a wide range of perturber eccentricities, in varied disc structures. Our simulations also probe the fundamentally nonlinear effects of shock induced angular momentum deposition and coorbital horseshoe drags, which exhibit clear variations with eccentricity. Finally, this careful comparison between linear theory and numerics provides a detailed benchmark for planet-disc interaction problems and therefore we have provided a repository of our linear calculations for use as a rigorous test of future numerical investigations.</description>

      <title>Temporal Evolution of the Third Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: Spin, Color, Spectra and Dust Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to characterize the physical and activity properties of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS through spectroscopic and photometric observations during the first month after its discovery. We performed time-series photometry and long-slit spectroscopy between 2 and 29 July 2025 using multiple ground-based telescopes. Photometric data were calibrated against field stars from the ATLAS and APASS catalogs, and Fourier analysis was applied to derive the comet's rotational period. Spectral data were obtained using SALT and Nordic Optical Telescope. We report a spin period of $16.16 \pm 0.01$ h with a lightcurve amplitude of approximately 0.3 mag. The comet exhibits increasing dust activity and reddening colors during the observation period, with no visible tail detected, likely due to viewing geometry and low dust production. Dust mass loss rates are estimated between 0.3 and 4.2 kg s^-1, consistent with weakly active distant comets. Spectral colors are similar to those of outer Solar System comets and differ from previously reported values for 3I/ATLAS. The morphological and photometric properties of 3I/ATLAS are consistent with a weakly active comet of outer Solar System origin, despite its interstellar provenance. Continued monitoring around perihelion is necessary to track changes in activity, color, which will provide insights into the evolution of interstellar materials under solar radiation.</description>
