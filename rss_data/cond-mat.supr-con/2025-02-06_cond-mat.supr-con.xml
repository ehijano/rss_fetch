      <title>Enhanced Cooper pairing in nano-patterned metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nano-patterning has been shown to be a powerful tool for manipulating the vibrational modes of elastic structures, with applications such as optical-mechanical mode coupling. Inspired by these recent developments in phononic band engineering, we propose a nano-patterning scheme to enhance the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in phonon-mediated nano-film superconductors, such as aluminum. Using the finite element method, we simulate the lattice vibrational modes of nano-patterned films within the Debye model. Our results show that periodic nano-patterning softens the lattice vibrational modes compared to bulk films. It also increases the density of states at high energies, resulting in a couple of percent enhancement in $T_c$. Moreover, we investigate connections to random matrix theory and provide an experimental design prescription to optimize nano-patterning for further enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Critical Current, Lengthwise Fluctuations, and Flux Jumps in REBCO CC: A Torque Magnetometry Study up to 45 T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: REBCO (Rare Earth Barium Copper Oxide) coated conductors (CCs) have emerged for future high field magnets in fields and temperatures inaccesible for Nb based superconductors. However, their exceptionally high current densities pose challenges for characterization at low temperatures. This paper presents the design and implementation of a simple torque magnetometer especially suitable for characterizing REBCO CC. It details the construction and underlying physics, with particular emphasis on its capability to assess angular critical currents Ic in high magnetic fields and low temperatures. The study includes characterizations of multiple REBCO samples from different manufacturers, performed under magnetic fields up to 45 T, demonstrating the exceptional capabilities of REBCO CCs in extreme fields. The results reveal significant lengthwise Ic variations, especially in tapes cut from the edges of 12 mm-wide production tapes compared to those cut from the center. These variations are most pronounced when the field is in the vicinity of the ab-plane. Importantly, flux jumps are observed in samples with thick REBCO layers and thin stabilizers, underscoring potential thermal instabilities. These findings provide valuable insights into REBCO tape performance under extreme magnetic fields, highlighting their relevance for high-field magnet and nuclear fusion applications.</description>

      <title>Revealing the orbital origins of exotic electronic states with Ti substitution in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiband kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5 exhibits complex orbital textures on the Fermi surface, making the orbital origins of its cascade of correlated electronic states and superconductivity a major scientific puzzle. Chemical doping of the kagome plane can simultaneously tune the exotic states and the Fermi-surface orbital texture, and thus offers a unique opportunity to correlate the given states with specific orbitals. In this Letter, by substituting V atoms with Ti in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, we reveal the orbital origin of a cascade of its correlated electronic states through the orbital-resolved quasiparticle interference (QPI). We analyze the QPI changes associated with different orbitals, aided by first-principles calculations. We have observed that the in-plane and out-of-plane vanadium 3d orbitals cooperate to form unidirectional coherent states in pristine CsV3Sb5, whereas the out-of-plane component disappears with doping-induced suppression of charge density wave and global electronic nematicity. In addition, the Sb pz orbital plays an important role in both the pseudo-gap and superconducting states in CsV3Sb5. Our findings offer new insights into multiorbital physics in quantum materials which are generally manifested with intriguing correlations between atomic orbitals and symmetry-encoded correlated electronic states.</description>

      <title>Pervasive symmetry-lowering nanoscale structural fluctuations in the cuprate La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cuprate superconductors are among the most widely studied quantum materials, yet there remain fundamental open questions regarding their electronic properties and the role of the structural degrees of freedom. Recent neutron and x-ray scattering measurements uncovered exponential scaling with temperature of the strength of orthorhombic fluctuations in the tetragonal phase of $La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$ and $Tl_2Ba_2CuO_{6+y}$, unusual behavior that closely resembles prior results for the emergence of superconducting fluctuations, and that points to a common origin rooted in inherent correlated structural inhomogeneity. Here we extend the measurements of $La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$ to higher temperatures in the parent compound (x=0) and to optimal doping (x=0.155), and we furthermore investigate the effects of in-situ in-plane uniaxial stress. Our neutron scattering result for undoped $La_2CuO_4$ complement prior x-ray data and reveal that the structural fluctuations persist to the maximum experimental temperature of nearly 1000K, i.e., to a significant fraction of the melting point. At this temperature, the spatial correlation length extracted from the momentum-space data is still about three lattice constants. The neutron scattering experiment enables quasistatic discrimination and reveals that the response is increasingly dynamic at higher temperatures. We also find that uniaxial stress up to 500 MPa along the tetragonal [110] direction, which corresponds to a strain of about 0.2%, does not significantly alter this robust behavior. Overall, these results support the notion that subtle, underlying inhomogeneity underpins the cuprate phase diagram. Finally, we uncover (for x=0.2) low-energy structural fluctuations at a nominally forbidden reflection. While the origin of these fluctuations is not clear, they might be related to the presence of extended defects such as dislocations or stacking faults.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial strain tuning of electronic and spin excitations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_{c,\text{onset}} &gt; 40$ K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) thin films under in-plane biaxial compressive strain underscores the pivotal role of epitaxial strain in tuning exotic electronic states and provides a unique platform for investigating the superconducting mechanisms in nickelate superconductors. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to probe the strain-dependent electronic and spin excitations in LNO thin films with biaxial strain ranging from $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$ to $1.91\%$. Compared with the bulk crystal, the LNO thin film grown on LaAlO$_3$ (with $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$) exhibits similar $dd$ excitations and enhanced spin excitation bandwidth. In contrast, the 0.4 eV and 1.6 eV $dd$ excitations associated with the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ orbital, along with the spin excitations, are significantly suppressed in the film grown on SrTiO$_3$ ($\varepsilon\approx1.91\%$). The $c$-axis compression and the reduced out-of-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle, induced by in-plane tensile strain in LNO/SrTiO$_3$ broaden the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ bandwidth and decrease the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization, thereby suppressing the $dd$ excitations. The evolution of spin excitations reflects significant changes in the interlayer exchange coupling $J_z$, which can be attributed to the strain-tuned Ni-O-Ni bond angle. Since superconductivity is observed only in films with in-plane compressive strain ($\epsilon\sim-2\%$), the strain-dependent spin correlations align with the emergence of superconductivity, providing indirect evidence for spin-fluctuation-mediated unconventional superconductivity in LNO.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and magnetic ordering in chalcogen-intercalated graphene bilayers with charge compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a new class of two-dimensional crystals with the structure AC$_8$XC$_8$, consisting of two layers of graphene, a chalcogen (X = O, S, Se, Te) intercalation layer, and an alkaline earth (A = Be, Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba) adlayer. The electronic band structure for the 20 compounds was studied using density functional theory. The chalcogen $p$ orbitals interact with the carbon $\pi$ orbitals to form weakly dispersing bands that intersect the Fermi level and give rise to complex Fermi surfaces featuring electron and hole pockets whose densities exactly compensate each other, and van Hove singularities that are very close to, or coincident with, the Fermi level in the majority of compounds studied. The resulting electron-electron interaction effects are studied using both the temperature-flow renormalisation group approach and a spin fluctuation model, which show a ferromagnetic phase with critical temperatures as high as $\sim 10^3$ K that coexists with $p$- or $f$-wave spin triplet superconductivity over a range of temperatures.</description>

      <title>Mutual control of critical temperature, RRR, stress, and surface quality for sputtered Nb films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting single quantum logic integrated circuits traditionally exploit magnetron sputtered niobium thin films on silicon oxide substrates. The sputtering depends on multiple process parameters, which dramatically affect mechanical, electrical, and cryogenic properties of Nb thin films. In this work, we focus on the comprehensive relationship study between 200-nm Nb film characteristics and their intrinsic stress. It is shown that there is a critical value of the working pressure pcritical at the fixed sputtering power above which stress in the film relaxes whereas the film properties degrade significantly. Below pcritical one can control intrinsic stress in the wide range from -400 MPa to +600 MPa maintaining perfect film surface with a 0.8 nm roughness (Rq), electrical resistivity less than 20 uOhm*cm, critical superconducting transition temperature above 8.9 K and residual resistance ratio over 6.4. We suggest a modified kinetic model to predict Nb films stress with the linear dependence of high-energy parameters on the working pressure replaced with an exponential one, which allowed reduction of the approximation error from 20 to 8%.</description>

      <title>Revealing inter-band electron pairing in a superconductor with spin-orbit coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most superconducting mechanisms pair electrons within the same band, forming spin singlets. However, the discovery of multi-band superconductivity has opened new scenarios for pairing, particularly in systems with strong spin-orbit coupling. Here, we reveal inter-band pairing in the superconductor \bipd\ by mapping the amplitude of sub-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states around Vanadium adatoms deposited on its surface. The surface of \bipd\ is characterized by spin-helical-like bands near the Fermi level. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals anisotropic YSR amplitude oscillations around the impurity, driven by spin-conserving Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (BQPI). Analysis of the BQPI patterns at the YSR energy exposes inter-band pairing in this material. Interestingly, only a small subset of all possible inter-band scattering processes observed in the normal state contribute to the BQPI patterns. Combining experimental data and theory, we demonstrate that the observed band selectivity results from the hybridization of the band coupled with the impurity with other bands. Our findings reveal unconventional pairing mechanisms in \bipd\ and highlight the crucial role of spin-orbit interactions in their formation.</description>

      <title>Evidence of P-wave Pairing in K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ Superconductors from Phase-sensitive Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: P-wave superconductors hold immense promise for both fundamental physics and practical applications due to their unusual pairing symmetry and potential topological superconductivity. However, the exploration of the p-wave superconductors has proved to be a complex endeavor. Not only are they rare in nature but also the identification of p-wave superconductors has been an arduous task in history. For example, phase-sensitive measurement, an experimental technique which can provide conclusive evidence for unconventional pairing, has not been implemented successfully to identify p-wave superconductors. Here, we study a recently discovered family of superconductors, A$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), which were proposed theoretically to be a candidate of p-wave superconductors. We fabricate superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) on exfoliated K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$, and perform the phase-sensitive measurement. We observe that such SQUIDs exhibit a pronounced second-order harmonic component sin(2$\pi$) in the current-phase relation, suggesting the admixture of 0- and $\pi$-phase. By carefully examining the magnetic field dependence of the oscillation patterns of critical current and Shapiro steps under microwave irradiation, we reveal a crossover from 0- to $\pi$-dominating phase state and conclude that the existence of the $\pi$-phase is in favor of the p-wave pairing symmetry in K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$.</description>

      <title>Josephson effect and odd-frequency pairing in superconducting junctions with unconventional magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Josephson junctions formed by coupling two conventional superconductors via an unconventional magnet and investigate the formation of Andreev bound states, their impact on the Josephson effect, and the emergent superconducting correlations. We focus on unconventional magnets known as $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. We find that the Andreev bound states in $d$-wave altermagnet and $p_y$-wave magnet Josephson junctions strongly depend on the transverse momentum, with a spin splitting and low-energy minima as a function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$. In contrast, the Andreev bound states for $p_{x}$-wave magnets are insensitive to the transverse momentum. We show that the Andreev bound states can be probed by the local density of states in the middle of the junction, which also reveals that $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- and $p$-wave magnet junctions are prone to host zero energy peaks. While the zero-energy peak in $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnet junctions tends to oscillate with the magnetic order, it remains robust in $p$-wave magnet junctions. We also demonstrate that the critical currents in $d$-wave altermagnet Josephson junctions exhibit an oscillatory decay with the increase of the magnetic order, while the oscillations are absent in $p$-wave magnet junctions albeit the currents exhibit a slow decay. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the interplay of the Josephson effect and unconventional magnetic order of $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets originates from odd-frequency spin-triplet $s$-wave superconducting correlations that are otherwise absent. Our results can serve as a guide to pursue the new functionality of Josephson junctions based on unconventional magnets.</description>

      <title>Classification of pair symmetries in superconductors with unconventional magnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider superconductors with unconventional magnetism and investigate the emergence of superconducting correlations by carrying out a full classification of allowed Cooper pair symmetries. In particular, we focus on spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconductors under the influence of $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. Under generic conditions, we find that unconventional magnets not only drive a spin-singlet to spin-triplet conversion but also they transfer their parity symmetry that induces superconducting correlations with higher angular momentum. For instance, a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor with $d$-wave altermagnetism is able to host odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $d$-wave superconducting pair amplitudes, while when combining with $p$-wave magnetism the emerging superconducting pairing acquires an even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $p$-wave symmetry. We further demonstrate that unconventional magnetism produces even more exotic superconducting correlations in spin-singlet $d$-wave superconductors, where odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $g$-wave and even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $f$-wave pair symmetries are possible in altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets, respectively. We also discuss how these ideas generalize to spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductors and also show how our results can be applied to unconventional magnets with higher angular momentum, such as $f$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave. Our results can help understand the emergent superconducting correlations due to the interplay of unconventional magnetism and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Reduced Order Hysteretic Magnetization Model for Composite Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the Reduced Order Hysteretic Magnetization (ROHM) model to describe the magnetization and instantaneous power loss of composite superconductors subject to time-varying magnetic fields. Once the parameters of the ROHM model are fixed based on reference simulations, it allows to directly compute the macroscopic response of composite superconductors without the need to solve the detailed current density distribution. It can then be used as part of a homogenization method in large-scale superconducting models to significantly reduce the computational effort compared to detailed simulations. In this contribution, we focus on the case of a strand with twisted superconducting filaments subject to a time-varying transverse magnetic field. We propose two variations of the ROHM model: (i) a rate-independent model that reproduces hysteresis in the filaments, and (ii) a rate-dependent model that generalizes the first level by also reproducing dynamic effects due to coupling and eddy currents. We then describe the implementation and inclusion of the ROHM model in a finite element framework, discuss how to deduce the model parameters, and finally demonstrate the capabilities of the approach in terms of accuracy and efficiency over a wide range of excitation frequencies and amplitudes.</description>
