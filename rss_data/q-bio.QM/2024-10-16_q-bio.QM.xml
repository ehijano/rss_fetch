      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Detection of Viral cDNA via Luminescence Resonance Energy Transfer Using Upconversion and Gold Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted global economies and healthcare systems, revealing critical vulnerabilities in both. In response, our study introduces a groundbreaking method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 cDNA, leveraging Luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) between upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to achieve an unprecedented detection limit of 242 femtomolar (fM). This innovative sensing platform utilizes UCNPs conjugated with one primer and AuNPs with another, targeting the 5' and 3' ends of the SARS-CoV-2 cDNA, respectively, enabling precise differentiation of mismatched DNA sequences and significantly enhancing detection specificity. Through rigorous experimental analysis, we established a quenching efficiency range from 10.4\% to 73.6\%, with an optimal midpoint of 42\%, thereby demonstrating the superior sensitivity of our method. By comparing the quenching efficiency of mismatched DNAs to the target DNA, we identified an optimal DNA:UCNP:AuNP ratio that ensures accurate detection. Our comparative analysis with existing SARS-CoV-2 detection methods revealed that our approach not only provides a lower detection limit but also offers higher specificity and potential for rapid, on-site testing. This study demonstrates the superior sensitivity and specificity of using UCNPs and AuNPs for SARS-CoV-2 cDNA detection, offering a significant advancement in rapid, accessible diagnostic technologies. Our method, characterized by its low detection limit and high precision, represents a critical step forward in managing current and future viral outbreaks, contributing to the enhancement of global healthcare responsiveness and infectious disease control.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning the ESM2 protein language model to understand the functional impact of missense variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elucidating the functional effect of missense variants is of crucial importance, yet challenging. To understand the impact of such variants, we fine-tuned the ESM2 protein language model to classify 20 protein features at amino acid resolution. We used the resulting models to: 1) identify protein features that are enriched in either pathogenic or benign missense variants, 2) compare the characteristics of proteins with reference or alternate alleles to understand how missense variants affect protein functionality. We show that our model can be used to reclassify some variants of unknown significance. We also demonstrate the usage of our models for understanding the potential effect of variants on protein features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics methods capture cellular measurements such as gene expression and cell types at specific locations in a cell, helping provide a localized picture of tissue health. Traditional visualization techniques superimpose the tissue image with pie charts for the cell distribution. We design an interactive visual analysis system that addresses perceptual problems in the state of the art, while adding filtering, drilling, and clustering analysis capabilities. Our approach can help researchers gain deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex biological processes within tissues.</description>

      <title>MAFin: Motif Detection in Multiple Alignment Files</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Genome and Proteome Alignments, represented by the Multiple Alignment File (MAF) format, have become a standard approach in the field of comparative genomics and proteomics. However, current approaches lack a direct method for motif detection within MAF files. To address this gap, we present MAFin, a novel tool that enables efficient motif detection and conservation analysis in MAF files, streamlining genomic and proteomic research.
  Results: We developed MAFin, the first motif detection tool for Multiple Alignment Format files. MAFin enables the multithreaded search of conserved motifs using three approaches: 1) by using user-specified k-mers to search the sequences. 2) with regular expressions, in which case one or more patterns are searched, and 3) with predefined Position Weight Matrices. Once the motif has been found, MAFin detects the motif instances and calculates the conservation across the aligned sequences. MAFin also calculates a conservation percentage, which provides information about the conservation levels of each motif across the aligned sequences, based on the number of matches relative to the length of the motif. A set of statistics enable the interpretation of each motif's conservation level, and the detected motifs are exported in JSON and CSV files for downstream analyses.
  Availability: MAFin is released as a Python package under the GPL license as a multi-platform application and is available at: https://github.com/Georgakopoulos-Soares-lab/MAFin.

      <title>A model learning framework for inferring the dynamics of transmission rate depending on exogenous variables for epidemic forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to formalize a novel scientific machine learning framework to reconstruct the hidden dynamics of the transmission rate, whose inaccurate extrapolation can significantly impair the quality of the epidemic forecasts, by incorporating the influence of exogenous variables (such as environmental conditions and strain-specific characteristics). We propose an hybrid model that blends a data-driven layer with a physics-based one. The data-driven layer is based on a neural ordinary differential equation that learns the dynamics of the transmission rate, conditioned on the meteorological data and wave-specific latent parameters. The physics-based layer, instead, consists of a standard SEIR compartmental model, wherein the transmission rate represents an input. The learning strategy follows an end-to-end approach: the loss function quantifies the mismatch between the actual numbers of infections and its numerical prediction obtained from the SEIR model incorporating as an input the transmission rate predicted by the neural ordinary differential equation. We validate this original approach using both a synthetic test case and a realistic test case based on meteorological data (temperature and humidity) and influenza data from Italy between 2010 and 2020. In both scenarios, we achieve low generalization error on the test set and observe strong alignment between the reconstructed model and established findings on the influence of meteorological factors on epidemic spread. Finally, we implement a data assimilation strategy to adapt the neural equation to the specific characteristics of an epidemic wave under investigation, and we conduct sensitivity tests on the network hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>A Reanalysis of the FDA's Benefit-Risk Assessment of Moderna's mRNA-1273 COVID Vaccine: For 18-25-Year-Old Males, Risks Exceeded Benefits Relative to Hospitalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FDA conducted a benefit-risk assessment for Moderna's COVID vaccine mRNA-1273 prior to its full approval (announced 1/31/2022). The FDA focused its assessment on males of ages 18-64 years because the agency's risk analysis was limited to vaccine-attributable myocarditis/pericarditis (VAM/P) given the excess risk among males. The FDA analysis concluded that vaccine benefits clearly outweighed risks, even for 18-25-year-old males (those at highest VAM/P risk). We reanalyze the FDA benefit-risk assessment using information available through the third week of January 2022 and focusing on 18-25-year-old males. We use the FDA's framework but extend its model by accounting for protection derived from prior COVID infection, finer age-stratification in COVID-hospitalization rates, and incidental hospitalizations (those of patients who test positive for COVID but are being treated for something else). We also use more realistic projections of Omicron-infection rates and more accurate rates of VAM/P. With hospitalizations as the principal endpoint of the analysis (those prevented by vaccination vs. those caused by VAM/P), we find a net harm: vaccine risks outweighed benefits for 18-25-year-old males, except in scenarios projecting implausibly high Omicron-infection prevalence. Comparing the projections of FDA's "most likely scenario" to ours, we find that the FDA's benefit-risk ratio, 43.33, is over 60 times more favorable than ours, 0.67. Our assessment suggests that mRNA-1273 vaccination of 18-25-year-old males generated between 16% and 63% more hospitalizations from vaccine-attributable myocarditis/pericarditis alone compared to COVID hospitalizations prevented (over a 5-month period of vaccine protection assumed by the FDA). The preceding assessment is based on assumptions drawn from data available before 1/22/22. Moreover, these assumptions are validated by subsequently available data.</description>

      <title>SGUQ: Staged Graph Convolution Neural Network for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis using Multi-Omics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia, significantly impacting cost, mortality, and burden worldwide. The advent of high-throughput omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics, has revolutionized the molecular understanding of AD. Conventional AI approaches typically require the completion of all omics data at the outset to achieve optimal AD diagnosis, which are inefficient and may be unnecessary. To reduce the clinical cost and improve the accuracy of AD diagnosis using multi-omics data, we propose a novel staged graph convolutional network with uncertainty quantification (SGUQ). SGUQ begins with mRNA and progressively incorporates DNA methylation and miRNA data only when necessary, reducing overall costs and exposure to harmful tests. Experimental results indicate that 46.23% of the samples can be reliably predicted using only single-modal omics data (mRNA), while an additional 16.04% of the samples can achieve reliable predictions when combining two omics data types (mRNA + DNA methylation). In addition, the proposed staged SGUQ achieved an accuracy of 0.858 on ROSMAP dataset, which outperformed existing methods significantly. The proposed SGUQ can not only be applied to AD diagnosis using multi-omics data but also has the potential for clinical decision-making using multi-viewed data. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/chenzhao2023/multiomicsuncertainty.</description>

      <title>Parsing altered brain connectivity in neurodevelopmental disorders by integrating graph-based normative modeling and deep generative networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many neurodevelopmental disorders can be understood as divergent patterns of neural interactions during brain development. Advances in neuroimaging have illuminated these patterns by modeling the brain as a network structure using diffution MRI tractography. However, characterizing and quantifying individual heterogeneity in neurodevelopmental disorders within these highly complex brain networks remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present for the first time, a framework that integrates deep generative models with graph-based normative modeling to characterize brain network development in the neurotypical population, which can then be used to quantify the individual-level neurodivergence associated with disorders. Our deep generative model incorporates bio-inspired wiring constraints to effectively capture the developmental trajectories of neurotypical brain networks. Neurodivergence is quantified by comparing individuals to this neurotypical trajectory, enabling the creation of region-wise divergence maps that reveal latent developmental differences at each brain regions, along with overall neurodivergence scores based on predicted brain age gaps. We demonstrate the clinical utility of this framework by applying it to a large sample of children with autism spectrum disorders, showing that the individualized region-wise maps help parse the heterogeneity in autism, and the neurodivergence scores correlate with clinical assessments. Together, we provide powerful tools for quantifying neurodevelopmental divergence in brain networks, paying the way for developing imaging markers that will support disorder stratification, monitor progression, and evaluate therapeutic effectiveness.</description>

      <title>MF-LAL: Drug Compound Generation Using Multi-Fidelity Latent Space Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current generative models for drug discovery primarily use molecular docking as an oracle to guide the generation of active compounds. However, such models are often not useful in practice because even compounds with high docking scores do not consistently show experimental activity. More accurate methods for activity prediction exist, such as molecular dynamics based binding free energy calculations, but they are too computationally expensive to use in a generative model. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-Fidelity Latent space Active Learning (MF-LAL), a generative modeling framework that integrates a set of oracles with varying cost-accuracy tradeoffs. Unlike previous approaches that separately learn the surrogate model and generative model, MF-LAL combines the generative and multi-fidelity surrogate models into a single framework, allowing for more accurate activity prediction and higher quality samples. We train MF-LAL with a novel active learning algorithm to further reduce computational cost. Our experiments on two disease-relevant proteins show that MF-LAL produces compounds with significantly better binding free energy scores than other single and multi-fidelity approaches.</description>

      <title>Contrastive learning of cell state dynamics in response to perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DynaCLR, a self-supervised framework for modeling cell dynamics via contrastive learning of representations of time-lapse datasets. Live cell imaging of cells and organelles is widely used to analyze cellular responses to perturbations. Human annotation of dynamic cell states captured by time-lapse perturbation datasets is laborious and prone to bias. DynaCLR integrates single-cell tracking with time-aware contrastive learning to map images of cells at neighboring time points to neighboring embeddings. Mapping the morphological dynamics of cells to a temporally regularized embedding space makes the annotation, classification, clustering, or interpretation of the cell states more quantitative and efficient. We illustrate the features and applications of DynaCLR with the following experiments: analyzing the kinetics of viral infection in human cells, detecting transient changes in cell morphology due to cell division, and mapping the dynamics of organelles due to viral infection. Models trained with DynaCLR consistently achieve $&gt;95\%$ accuracy for infection state classification, enable the detection of transient cell states and reliably embed unseen experiments. DynaCLR provides a flexible framework for comparative analysis of cell state dynamics due to perturbations, such as infection, gene knockouts, and drugs. We provide PyTorch-based implementations of the model training and inference pipeline (https://github.com/mehta-lab/viscy) and a user interface (https://github.com/czbiohub-sf/napari-iohub) for the visualization and annotation of trajectories of cells in the real space and the embedding space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial task in the process of Artificial Intelligence-Driven Drug Discovery (AIDD). The challenge of developing models that surpass traditional non-neural network methods continues to be a vibrant area of research. This paper presents a novel graph neural network model-the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)-based Graph Neural Network (KA-GNN), which incorporates Fourier series, specifically designed for molecular property prediction. This model maintains the high interpretability characteristic of KAN methods while being extremely efficient in computational resource usage, making it an ideal choice for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Tested and validated on seven public datasets, KA-GNN has shown significant improvements in property predictions over the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Crossed laser phase plates for transmission electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For decades since the development of phase-contrast optical microscopy, an analogous approach has been sought for maximizing the image contrast of weakly-scattering objects in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The recent development of the laser phase plate (LPP) has demonstrated that an amplified, focused laser standing wave can provide stable, tunable phase shift to the high-energy electron beam, thus achieving phase-contrast TEM. With the proof-of-concept experimental demonstrations of the LPP now completed, in this paper we explore how the design can be further improved by tailoring its properties to the needs of biological imaging. In particular, we introduce the approach of crossed laser phase plates (XLPP): two laser standing waves intersecting in the diffraction plane of the TEM, rather than a single beam as in the current LPP. We provide a theoretical model for the XLPP inside the microscope and use simulations to quantify its effect on image formation. We find that the XLPP offers a path to increase information transfer by the microscope at low spatial frequencies while also suppressing the ghost images formed by Kapitza-Dirac diffraction of the electron beam by the laser beam. We also demonstrate a simple acquisition scheme, enabled by the XLPP, which further suppresses unwanted diffraction effects. The results of this study chart the course for future developments of LPP hardware.</description>

Abstract: The analysis of dynamic organelles remains a formidable challenge, though key to understanding biological processes. We introduce Nellie, an automated and unbiased user-friendly pipeline for segmentation, tracking, and feature extraction of diverse intracellular structures. Nellie adapts to image metadata, eliminating user input. Nellie's preprocessing pipeline enhances structural contrast on multiple intracellular scales allowing for robust hierarchical segmentation of sub-organellar regions. Internal motion capture markers are generated and tracked via a radius-adaptive pattern matching scheme, and used as guides for sub-voxel flow interpolation. Nellie extracts a plethora of features at multiple hierarchical levels for deep and customizable analysis. Nellie features a point-and-click Napari-based GUI that allows for code-free operation and visualization, while its modular open-source codebase invites extension by experienced users. We demonstrate Nellie's wide variety of use cases with three examples: unmixing multiple organelles from a single channel using feature-based classification, training an unsupervised graph autoencoder on mitochondrial multi-mesh graphs to quantify latent space embedding changes following ionomycin treatment, and performing in-depth characterization and comparison of endoplasmic reticulum networks across different cell types and temporal frames.</description>
