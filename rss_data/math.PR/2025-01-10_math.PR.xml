      <title>A probabilistic study of the set of stationary solutions to spatial kinetic-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study multivariate kinetic-type equations in a general setup, which includes in particular the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation with Maxwellian molecules, both with elastic and inelastic collisions. Using a representation of the collision operator derived in Bassetti, Ladelli, Matthes (2015) and Dolera, Regazzini (2014), we prove the existence and uniqueness of time-dependent solutions with the help of continuous-time branching random walks, under assumptions as weak as possible. Our main objective is a characterisation of the set of stationary solutions, e.g. equilibrium solutions for inelastic kinetic-type equations, which we describe as mixtures of multidimensional stable laws.</description>

      <title>Random Tessellations -- An Overview of Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random tessellations are a prominent class of models in stochastic geometry. In this chapter, we give an overview of mechanisms that have been used to formulate random tessellation models. First, the notion of a random tessellation and basic geometric characteristics of random tessellations are introduced. Then, several model classes are presented. This includes, but is not limited to, Voronoi tessellations and their weighted generalizations, hyperplane tessellations, and STIT tessellations. Simulation of the tessellation models and approaches for model fitting are also discussed.</description>

      <title>The supercritical phase of the $\varphi^4$ model is well behaved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we analyse the $\varphi^4$ model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in the supercritical regime $\beta &gt; \beta_c$. We consider a random cluster representation of the $\varphi^4$ model, which corresponds to an Ising random cluster model on a random environment. We prove that the supercritical phase of this percolation model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ ($d\geq 2$) is well behaved in the sense that for every $\beta&gt;\beta_c$, local uniqueness of macroscopic clusters happens with high probability, uniformly in boundary conditions. This result provides the basis for renormalisation techniques used to study several fine properties of the supercritical phase. As an application, we obtain surface order large deviation bounds for the empirical magnetisation of the $\varphi^4$ model in the entire supercritical regime.</description>

      <title>The Ising model: Highlights and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a short non-technical introduction to the Ising model, and review some successes as well as challenges which have emerged from its study in probability and mathematical physics. This includes the infinite-volume theory of phase transitions, and ideas like scaling, renormalization group, universality, SLE, and random symmetry breaking in disordered systems and networks. This note is based on a talk given on 15 August 2024, as part of the Ising lecture during the 11th Bernoulli-IMS world congress, Bochum.</description>

      <title>Properties of the one-component Coulomb gas on a sphere with two macroscopic external charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-component Coulomb gas on the sphere, consisting on $N$ unit charges interacting via a logarithmic potential, and in the presence of two external charges each of strength proportional to $N$, is considered. There are two spherical caps naturally associated with the external charges, giving rise to two distinct phases depending on them not overlapping (post-critical) or overlapping (pre-critical). The equilibrium measure in the post-critical phase is known from earlier work. We determine the equilibrium measure in the pre-critical phase using a particular conformal map, with the parameters therein specified in terms of a root of a certain fourth order polynomial. This is used to determine the exact form of the electrostatic energy for the pre-critical phase. Using a duality relation from random matrix theory, the partition function for the Coulomb gas at the inverse temperature $\beta = 2$ can be expanded for large $N$ in the post-critical phase, and in a scaling region of the post and pre-critical boundary. For the pre-critical phase, the duality identity implies a relation between two electrostatic energies, one for the present sphere system, and the other for a certain constrained log-gas relating to the Jacobi unitary ensemble.</description>

      <title>Transition pathways for a class of degenerate stochastic dynamical systems with L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is devoted to deriving the Onsager--Machlup function for a class of degenerate stochastic dynamical systems with (non-Gaussian) L\'{e}vy noise as well as Brownian noise. This is obtained based on the Girsanov transformation and then by a path representation. Moreover, this Onsager--Machlup function may be regarded as a Lagrangian giving the most probable transition pathways. The Hamilton--Pontryagin principle is essential to handle such a variational problem in degenerate case. Finally, a kinetic Langevin system in which noise is degenerate is specifically investigated analytically and numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a combination of Galerkin's method and Dafermos' transformation is first used to prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions for a class of stochastic nonlocal PDEs with long time memory driven by additive noise. Next, the existence of tempered random attractors for such equations is established in an appropriate space for the analysis of problems with delay and memory. Eventually, the convergence of solutions of Wong-Zakai approximations and upper semicontinuity of random attractors of the approximate random system, as the step sizes of approximations approach zero, are analyzed in a detailed way.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scheduling in a Quantum Switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a growing number of quantum networks in operation, there is a pressing need for performance analysis of quantum switching technologies. A quantum switch establishes, distributes, and maintains entanglements across a network. In contrast to a classical switching fabric, a quantum switch is a two sided queueing network. The switch generates Link Level Entanglements (LLEs), which are then fused to process the networks entanglement requests. Our proof techniques analyse a two time scale separation phenomenon at the fluid scale for a general switch topology. This allows us to demonstrate that the optimal fluid dynamics are given by a scheduling algorithm that solves a certain average reward Markov Decision Process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the behavior of multi-matrix unitary invariant models under a potential $V_\beta=\beta U+W$ when the inverse temperature $\beta$ becomes very large. We first prove, under mild hypothesis on the functionals $U,W$ that as soon at these potentials are "confining" at infinity, the sequence of spectral distribution of the matrices are tight when the dimension goes to infinity. Their limit points are solutions of Dyson-Schwinger's equations. Next we investigate a few specific models, most importantly the "strong single variable model" where $U$ is a sum of potentials in a single matrix and the "strong commutator model" where $U = -[X,Y]^2$.</description>

      <title>Extending Wormald's Differential Equation Method to One-sided Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we formulate a "one-sided" version of Wormald's differential equation method. In the standard "two-sided" method, one is given a family of random variables which evolve over time and which satisfy some conditions including a tight estimate of the expected change in each variable over one time step. These estimates for the expected one-step changes suggest that the variables ought to be close to the solution of a certain system of differential equations, and the standard method concludes that this is indeed the case. We give a result for the case where instead of a tight estimate for each variable's expected one-step change, we have only an upper bound. Our proof is very simple, and is flexible enough that if we instead assume tight estimates on the variables, then we recover the conclusion of the standard differential equation method.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions of the Limit Laws of Gaussian and Laguerre (Wishart) Ensembles at the Soft Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07628v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large-matrix limit laws of the rescaled largest eigenvalue of the orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic $n$-dimensional Gaussian ensembles -- and of the corresponding Laguerre ensembles (Wishart distributions) for various regimes of the parameter $\alpha$ (degrees of freedom $p$) -- are known to be the Tracy-Widom distributions $F_\beta$ ($\beta=1,2,4$). We establish (paying particular attention to large or small ratios $p/n$) that, with careful choices of the rescaling constants and of the expansion parameter $h$, the limit laws embed into asymptotic expansions in powers of $h$, where $h \asymp n^{-2/3}$ resp. $h \asymp (n\,\wedge\,p)^{-2/3}$. We find explicit analytic expressions of the first few expansion terms as linear combinations of higher-order derivatives of the limit law $F_\beta$ with rational polynomial coefficients. The parametrizations are fine-tuned so that the expansion coefficients in the Gaussian cases are, for given $n$, the limits $p\to\infty$ of those of the Laguerre cases. Whereas the results for $\beta=2$ are presented with proof, the discussion of the cases $\beta=1,4$ is based on some hypotheses, focusing on the algebraic aspects of actually computing the polynomial coefficients. For the purposes of illustration and validation, the various results are checked against simulation data with large sample sizes.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the critical percolation threshold $p_c$ for $d$-regular graphs. It is well-known that $p_c \geq \frac{1}{d-1}$ for such graphs, with equality holding for the $d$-regular tree. We prove that among all quasi-transitive $d$-regular graphs, the equality $p_c(G) = \frac{1}{d-1}$ holds if and only if $G$ is a tree. Furthermore, we provide counterexamples that illustrate the necessity of the quasi-transitive assumption.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusive Central Limit Theorem for the Stochastic Burgers Equation at the critical dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Stochastic Burgers Equation (SBE) is a singular, non-linear Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) that describes, on mesoscopic scales, the fluctuations of stochastic driven diffusive systems with a conserved scalar quantity. In space dimension d = 2, the SBE is critical, being formally scale invariant under diffusive scaling. As such, it falls outside of the domain of applicability of the theories of Regularity Structures and paracontrolled calculus. In apparent contrast with the formal scale invariance, we fully prove the conjecture first appeared in [H. van Beijeren, R. Kutner, &amp; H. Spohn, Phys. Rev. Lett., 1986] according to which the 2d-SBE is logarithmically superdiffusive, i.e. its diffusion coefficient diverges like $(\log t)^{2/3}$ as $t\to\infty$, thus removing subleading diverging multiplicative corrections in [D. De Gaspari &amp; L. Haunschmid-Sibitz, Electron. J. Probab., 2024] and in [H.-T. Yau, Ann. of Math., 2004] for 2d-ASEP. We precisely identify the constant prefactor of the logarithm and show it is proportional to $\lambda^{4/3}$, for $\lambda&gt;0$ the coupling constant, which, intriguingly, turns out to be exactly the same as for the one-dimensional Stochastic Burgers/KPZ equation. More importantly, we prove that, under super-diffusive space-time rescaling, the SBE has an explicit Gaussian fixed point in the Renormalization Group sense, by deriving a superdiffusive central limit-type theorem for its solution.
  This is the first scaling limit result for a critical singular SPDE, beyond the weak coupling regime, and is obtained via a refined control, on all length-scales, of the resolvent of the generator of the SBE. We believe our methods are well-suited to study other out-of-equilibrium driven diffusive systems at the critical dimension, such as 2d-ASEP, which, we conjecture, have the same large-scale Fixed Point as SBE.</description>

      <title>Mean field limits of co-evolutionary signed heterogeneous networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.01742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many science phenomena are modelled as interacting particle systems (IPS) coupled on static networks. In reality, network connections are far more dynamic. Connections among individuals receive feedback from nearby individuals and make changes to better adapt to the world. Hence, it is reasonable to model myriad real-world phenomena as co-evolutionary (or adaptive) networks. These networks are used in different areas including telecommunication, neuroscience, computer science, biochemistry, social science, as well as physics, where Kuramoto-type networks have been widely used to model interaction among a set of oscillators. In this paper, we propose a rigorous formulation for limits of a sequence of co-evolutionary Kuramoto oscillators coupled on heterogeneous co-evolutionary networks, which receive both positive and negative feedback from the dynamics of the oscillators on the networks. We show under mild conditions, the mean field limit (MFL) of the co-evolutionary network exists and the sequence of co-evolutionary Kuramoto networks converges to this MFL. Such MFL is described by solutions of a generalized Vlasov equation. We treat the graph limits as signed graph measures, motivated by the recent work in [Kuehn, Xu. Vlasov equations on digraph measures, JDE, 339 (2022), 261--349]. In comparison to the recently emerging works on MFLs of IPS coupled on non-co-evolutionary networks (i.e., static networks or time-dependent networks independent of the dynamics of the IPS), our work seems the first to rigorously address the MFL of a co-evolutionary network model.</description>

Abstract: This article presents a formalism inspired by Dennett's notion of the intentional stance. Whereas Dennett's treatment of these concepts is informal, we aim to provide a more formal analogue. We introduce a framework based on stochastic processes with inputs and outputs, in which we can talk precisely about *interpreting* systems as having *normative-epistemic states*, which combine belief-like and desire-like features. Our framework is based on optimality but nevertheless allows us to model some forms of bounded cognition.
  One might expect that the systems that can be described in normative-epistemic terms would be some special subset of all systems, but we show that this is not the case: every system admits a (possibly trivial) normative-epistemic interpretation, and those that can be *uniquely specified* by a normative-epistemic description are exactly the deterministic ones. Finally, we show that there is a suitable notion of Bayesian updating for normative-epistemic states, which we call *value-laden filtering*, since it involves both normative and epistemic elements. For unbounded cognition it is always permissible to attribute beliefs that update in this way. This is not always the case for bounded cognition, but we give a sufficient condition under which it is.
  This paper gives an overview of our framework aimed at cognitive scientists, with a formal mathematical treatment given in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Probabilities-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11526v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for tackling complex regression and classification tasks, yet its success often hinges on the quality of training data. This study introduces an ML paradigm inspired by domain knowledge of the structure of output function, akin to physics-informed ML, but rooted in probabilistic principles rather than physical laws. The proposed approach integrates the probabilistic structure of the target variable (such as its cumulative distribution function) into the training process. This probabilistic information is obtained from historical data or estimated using structural reliability methods during experimental design. By embedding domain-specific probabilistic insights into the learning process, the technique enhances model accuracy and mitigates risks of overfitting and underfitting. Applications in regression, image denoising, and classification demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in addressing real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Heat Kernel Estimates for Schr\"odinger Operators with Decay at Infinity on Parabolic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give estimates for positive solutions for the Schr\"odinger equation $(\Delta_\mu+W)u=0$ on a wide class of parabolic weighted manifolds $(M, d\mu)$ when $W$ decays to zero at infinity faster than quadratically. These can be combined with results of Grigor'yan to give matching upper and lower bounds for the heat kernel of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator $\Delta_\mu+W$. In particular, this appears to complement known results for Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbf{R}^2$.</description>
