      <title>Intelligent Pixel Detectors: Towards a Radiation Hard ASIC with On-Chip Machine Learning in 28 nm CMOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detectors at future high energy colliders will face enormous technical challenges. Disentangling the unprecedented numbers of particles expected in each event will require highly granular silicon pixel detectors with billions of readout channels. With event rates as high as 40 MHz, these detectors will generate petabytes of data per second. To enable discovery within strict bandwidth and latency constraints, future trackers must be capable of fast, power efficient, and radiation hard data-reduction at the source. We are developing a radiation hard readout integrated circuit (ROIC) in 28nm CMOS with on-chip machine learning (ML) for future intelligent pixel detectors. We will show track parameter predictions using a neural network within a single layer of silicon and hardware tests on the first tape-outs produced with TSMC. Preliminary results indicate that reading out featurized clusters from particles above a modest momentum threshold could enable using pixel information at 40 MHz.</description>

      <title>A Method for Proton Detector Efficiency Measurement with Applications in Neutron Beta Decay and Lifetime Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a new method to measure the proton detector efficiency for use in "beam" determinations of the free neutron lifetime. There is currently a 4{\sigma} disagreement between the "beam" and "storage" methods of measuring the lifetime of the neutron. A possible reason for this is a systematic uncertainty that is not properly accounted for in one or both types of experiments. Absolute proton counting is an essential facet of the "beam" experimental approach. The absolute detector efficiency is not currently known for existing experiments and could be a source of a hidden systematic error. The proposed absolute calibration techniques can also be extended to new, large area particle detectors designed for future experiments. We propose to laser ionize a beam of atomic hydrogen and simultaneously count both the outgoing protons and electrons. Due to recent advances in UV laser and atomic hydrogen beam technologies, we estimate a count rate as high as ~200k proton-electrons pairs per second under the most favorable scheme discussed. Our proposed technique would remove one of the leading systematic uncertainties in the determination of the neutron lifetime, making an precision of {\pm}0.16 s feasible. Precise and accurate knowledge of the proton detection efficiency is crucial to fully understanding the systematics of the "beam" measurement method as well as developing next generation experiments that will have the precision to test the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Combined Raman spectroscopy and electrical transport measurements in ultra-high vacuum down to 3.7 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An instrument for the simultaneous characterization of thin films by Raman spectroscopy and electronic transport down to 3.7 K has been designed and built. This setup allows for the in-situ preparation of air-sensitive samples, their spectroscopic characterization by Raman spectroscopy with different laser lines and five-probe electronic transport measurements using sample plates with prefabricated contacts. The lowest temperatures that can be achieved on the sample are directly proven by measuring the superconducting transition of a Niobium film. The temperature-dependent Raman shift and narrowing of the Silicon F_{2g} Raman line are shown. This experimental system is specially designed for in-situ functionalization, optical spectroscopic and electron transport investigation of thin films. It allows for easy on-the-fly change of samples without the need to warm up the cryomanipulator.</description>

      <title>Performance assessment of the HERD calorimeter with a photo-diode read-out system for high-energy electron beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of cosmic rays at energies exceeding 100 TeV per nucleon is crucial for enhancing the understanding of high-energy particle propagation and acceleration models in the Galaxy. HERD is a space-borne calorimetric experiment that aims to extend the current direct measurements of cosmic rays to unexplored energies. The payload is scheduled to be installed on the Chinese Space Station in 2027. The primary peculiarity of the instrument is its capability to measure particles coming from all directions, with the main detector being a deep, homogeneous, 3D calorimeter. The active elements are read out using two independent systems: one based on wavelength shifter fibers coupled to CMOS cameras, and the other based on photo-diodes read-out with custom front-end electronics. A large calorimeter prototype was tested in 2023 during an extensive beam test campaign at CERN. In this paper, the performance of the calorimeter for high-energy electron beams, as obtained from the photo-diode system data, is presented. The prototype demonstrated excellent performance, e.g., an energy resolution better than 1% for electrons at 250 GeV. A comparison between beam test data and Monte Carlo simulation data is also presented.</description>

      <title>Room temperature buffer gas beam of metastable state titanium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We produce atomic beams of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in their metastable $3d^{3}(^4F){4}s$ $a^5F_5$ state by laser ablation into He, N$_2$, and Ar buffer gases. The high temperatures realized in the ablation process populate the $a^5F_5$ level without the need for optical pumping. Remarkably, we observe that Ti atoms in the $a^5F_5$ state survive $1000$'s of collisions with He and Ar buffer gas atoms without being quenched to lower-energy states. We study the yield of Ti atoms when ablated into buffer gases of varying species and pressure, quantify diffusion cross sections and quenching rates based on a simple model, and provide insight into optimal design parameters for an ablation cell. Using a 3.3$\,$cm ablation cell with interchangeable exit apertures, we produce metastable atom beams and quantify their brilliance and velocity distributions as functions of buffer gas pressure.</description>

      <title>Magnon spectroscopy in the electron microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The miniaturisation of transistors is approaching its limits due to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics are being developed, which leverage the electron's spin in addition to its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study and control spin wave propagation at the nano- and atomic scales a key challenge. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to probe spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant lengthscales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by such local features. Here, we show the first experimental detection of bulk magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy. By employing high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel direct electron detectors optimized for low acceleration voltages, we successfully overcome the challenges posed by weak signals and identify magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons, exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks an important milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the future development of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Real-time Position Reconstruction for the KamLAND-Zen Experiment using Hardware-AI Co-design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolithic liquid scintillator detector technology is the workhorse for detecting neutrinos and exploring new physics. The KamLAND-Zen experiment exemplifies this detector technology and has yielded top results in the quest for neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. To understand the physical events that occur in the detector, experimenters must reconstruct each event's position and energy from the raw data produced. Traditionally, this information has been obtained through a time-consuming offline process, meaning that event position and energy would only be available days after data collection. This work introduces a new pipeline to acquire this information quickly by implementing a machine learning model, PointNet, onto a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). This work outlines a successful demonstration of the entire pipeline, showing that event position and energy information can be reliably and quickly obtained as physics events occur in the detector. This marks one of the first instances of applying hardware-AI co-design in the context of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments.</description>
