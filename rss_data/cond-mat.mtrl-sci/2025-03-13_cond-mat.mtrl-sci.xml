      <title>Dissolution kinetics of iron sulfide minerals in alkaline solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deleterious aggregate reactions induced by iron sulfide minerals, especially pyrrhotite and pyrite, have devastated concrete structures across many global regions. While these minerals have been extensively studied under acidic conditions, their behavior in alkaline environments, such as concrete, remains poorly understood. This study investigates the kinetics and mechanisms of iron sulfide dissolution at high pH (13$\unicode{x2013}$14). Results revealed that pyrrhotite dissolves orders of magnitude more rapidly than pyrite, with dissolution rates increasing with both pH and temperature. The type of alkali (potassium or sodium) in the solution was not found to affect the dissolution behavior. Kinetic modeling and experimental characterization indicated that the dissolution kinetics of pyrrhotite is controlled by a combination of chemical reactions (oxidation of iron and sulfur species) and diffusion (through an Fe(III)-(oxy)hydroxide layer). These findings provide practical insights into controlling dissolution and mitigating iron sulfide-induced damage in concrete.</description>

      <title>Recombination velocities at grain boundaries in solar-cell absorbers -- revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work revisits the recombination velocities ($s_{\mathrm{GB}}$) of minority-charge carriers determined at grain boundaries in polycrystalline absorber materials for solar cells. The equations describing $s_{\mathrm{GB}}$ as well as the barriers for electrons and holes were derived. It is shown that for given net-doping density and absolute temperature, the experimentally determined recombination velocity of a specific grain boundary depends only on the excess-charge density at this planar defect as well as on the prefactor $s_{\mathrm{GB,0}}$ describing the nonradiative recombination. Value ranges for these two quantities can be determined for any measured $s_{\mathrm{GB}}$ value. When analyzing $s_{\mathrm{GB}}$ datasets acquired on various (Ag,Cu)(In,Ga)Se$_2$ and microcrystalline Si absorbers, it is apparent that both, the excess-charge density and the prefactor $s_{\mathrm{GB,0}}$, remain within about the same orders of magnitude for all grain boundaries analyzed in a specific absorber. The broad range of the recombination velocities over several orders magnitude indicate upward as well as downward band bending, and the band-bending values are on the order of several $\pm$10 meV for all materials analyzed.</description>

      <title>Fluence dependent delay of Ni in an FeNi alloy supports an exchange based origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The delayed demagnetization in Ni relative to Fe in the ultrafast demagnetization studies in FeNi alloy has led to two competing theoretical explanations: The Inhomogeneous Magnon Generation (IMG) and the Optically Induced Spin Transfer (OISTR) model. The IMG attributes the delay to the preferential magnon generation at the Fe sites and its subsequent propagation to Ni, while OISTR proposes direct spin transfer from Ni to Fe. In this study, we employ element-resolved extreme ultraviolet spectroscopy to investigate the effect of excitation strength on this delay, aiming to resolve the controversy. The data indicate a significant reduction in the delay with increasing fluence, which is inconsistent with the theoretical predictions of OISTR. These findings, in conjunction with the observation of a saturation of Fe demagnetization at the onset of Ni demagnetization, indicate that a spin-wave instability within the IMG framework may provide a potential explanation for the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity of Wurtzite Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N Heterovalent Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin films of aluminum hafnium nitride (Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N) were synthesized via reactive magnetron sputtering for Hf contents up to $x$ = 0.13. X-ray diffraction showed a single $c$-axis oriented wurtzite phase for all films. Hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated homogeneous Al:Hf distribution through the thin films and confirmed their insulating character. A collection of complementary tests showed unambiguous polarization inversion, and thus ferroelectricity in multiple samples. Current density vs. electric field hysteresis measurements showed distinct ferroelectric switching current peaks, the piezoelectric coefficient d$_{33,f,meas}$ measured using a double beam laser interferometer (DBLI) showed a reversal in sign with similar magnitude, and anisotropic wet etching confirmed field-induced polarization inversion. This demonstrates the possibility of using tetravalent--and not just trivalent--alloying elements to enable ferroelectricity in AlN-based thin films, highlighting the compositional flexibility of ferroelectricity in wurtzites and greatly expanding the chemistries that can be considered for future devices.</description>

      <title>Evidence of strong electron correlation effects and magnetic topological excitation in low carbon steel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Present study explores how thermal treatments and strain affect the magnetic response of two plain-carbon steels, with 0.05 wt% and 0.7 wt% carbon. Electron-backscattered diffraction and high-frequency magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) measurements in 0.05%C steel reveal that annealing increases $\chi$ by enlarging grains, while quenching reduces it by decreasing grain size. We also study the 0.7%C steel, to delineate effects of quench-induced strain and possible carbon-rich (Fe$_3$C) phase admixture in 0.05%C steel which could affect its magnetic response. In 0.7%C steel, uniaxial tensile strain enhances $\chi$ via altered magnetic anisotropy, avoiding the reduction seen in quenched 0.05%C steel. Micro-magnetic modelling and magnetic force microscopy identify magnetic topological structures (MTS) in 0.05%C steel, especially with quenching. Low-temperature transport measurement suggests strong electron correlations drive Kondo effect in 0.05%C steel and MTS is an emergent feature of interplay with local strain. Thus, steel exhibits strong electron correlations and novel magnetic excitations, making it a promising quantum material platform for developing new device applications.</description>

      <title>N\'eel vector rotation driven by spin-orbit torque in amorphous ferrimagnetic GdCo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin superfluidity, a phenomenon enabling low dissipative spin transport analogous to superfluidity in liquid helium and superconductivity in electronic systems, has remained a theoretical concept. To realize the spin superfluidity in an antiferromagnet, it is necessary to excite a N\'eel vector rotation within the magnetic easy-plane, which has been elusive so far. In this study, we demonstrated spin-orbit torque-driven N\'eel vector rotation in amorphous ferrimagnetic GdCo. A pseudo-magnetic easy-plane is formed in a spin-flop state under an external magnetic field at the vicinity of the magnetization compensation temperature, and we observed stochastic binary switching in the anomalous Hall resistance, directly attributed to N\'eel vector rotation. Furthermore, homodyne detection confirmed rotation frequencies in the GHz range as expected from atomic spin simulations, providing evidence of dynamic N\'eel vector behavior. These findings represent a crucial advance towards the realization of spin superfluidity.</description>

      <title>Automated Imaging of the Annihilation of a Transverse Domain Wall in Patterned Magnetic Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging the magnetic domain wall behavior in patterned thin films under external stimuli can enable understanding the underlying energy landscape as well as the role of local microstructure and defects. We present an automated workflow for in-situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy to image magnetic domain walls at the nanometer length scale and at a time resolution in the sub-millisecond regime - the latter of which is limited by the speed of the available camera. Our workflow is modular and can be broadly applied to various types of in-situ experiments, taking us a step closer to the future of autonomous imaging of nanomagnetic films with electron microscopy. Using our workflow, we show the transformation of a transverse domain wall with sub-millisecond time resolution under the application of an in-situ transverse magnetic field, a study of whose dynamics are essential in the design of future domain wall mediated spintronic device applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3 (BCZT/LSMO/BCZT) sandwich films were elaborated using the sol-gel spin coating process. The dielectric properties displayed excellent thermal stability with the temperature coefficient of capacitance, TCC, remaining within 10% between -50 C and 300 C. The high energy storage density, Wrec, of 11.8 J/cm3 observed in this sandwich films, is nearly twice as high as that of the BCZT films, with an efficiency, n, of 77% under a weak electric field of 800 kV/cm. Furthermore, the stability of Wrec and n was observed along the studied temperature interval making them promising candidates for high-temperature energy storage capacitors.</description>

      <title>Copper Vapor Catalyzing Role in the Growth of Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cu is most used substrate to grow monolayer graphene under a temperature near melting point. In this study, we elaborated a remarkable amount of Cu clusters were continuously evaporated during the graphene growth, resulting into the vapor pressure comparable with the CH4. Importantly, the decomposition barrier of CH4 on Cu clusters is similar or even lower than on Cu surface. CuCH4 serves as the primary active cluster in complex intermediates, exhibiting a growth-promoting effect. Particularly after the first graphene layer coverage, it may emerge as a dominant catalytic factor for multilayer growth by supplying critical growth species. Through controlled seed incorporation, this mechanism is expected to enable large-area controllable growth of bilayer and multilayer graphene structures.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e-Driven Interfacial Thermal Transport in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-plane thermal conductivity in homogeneous transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibits a strong dependence on twist angle, originating from atomic reconstruction within moir\'e superlattices. This reconstruction redistributes interlayer stacking modes, reducing high-efficiency thermal transport regions and softening the transverse acoustic phonon modes as the twist angle increases. We propose a general theoretical expression to capture this behavior, validated against non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations across both homo- and heterogeneous twisted TMDs structures, as well as homogeneous twisted graphene and hexagonal boron nitride stacks. Our model demonstrates that the interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) scales with the twist angle ($\theta$) as $\ln{\left(\text{ITC}\right)} \propto e^{-\sqrt{\theta}}$. This mechanism, likely universal in van der Waals layered materials, highlights the potential of twist engineering for controlling interfacial thermal transport, offering new avenues for thermal management in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Dislocation correlations in GaN epitaxial films revealed by EBSD and XRD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlations between dislocations in crystals reduce the elastic energy via screening of the strain by the surrounding dislocations. We study the correlations of threading dislocations in GaN epitaxial films with dislocation densities of 5x10^8 cm^-2 and 1.8x10^10 cm^-2 by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in reciprocal space and by high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) in real space, where the strain is derived from a cross-correlation analysis of the Kikuchi patterns. The measured XRD curves and EBSD strain and rotation maps are compared with Monte Carlo simulations within one and the same model for the dislocation distributions. The screening of the dislocation strains is provided by creating pairs of dislocations with opposite Burgers vectors, with the mean distance between dislocations in a pair equal to the screening distance. The pairs overlap and cannot be distinguished as separate dipoles. The EBSD-measured autocorrelation functions of the strain and rotation components follow the expected logarithmic law for distances smaller than the screening distances and become zero for larger distances, which is confirmed by the Monte Carlo simulations. Screening distances of 2 \textmu m and 0.3 \textmu m are obtained for the samples with low and high dislocation densities, respectively. The dislocation strain is thus screened by only 4 neighboring dislocations. High-resolution EBSD allows for a more precise determination of the screening distances than from fits of the XRD curves. In addition, an anisotropic resolution of the EBSD measurements is observed and quantified.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Photoexcitation of Semiconducting Photocathode Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cs-based semiconductors like $\mathrm{Cs_3Sb}$ and $\mathrm{Cs_2Te}$ are currently used as photocathodes in particle accelerators. Their performance as electron sources critically depends on their interaction with intense laser sources. In this work, we investigate from first principles the time-dependent response of $\mathrm{Cs_3Sb}$ and $\mathrm{Cs_2Te}$ to ultrafast pulses of varying intensities, ranging from $1~\mathrm{GW/cm^2}$ to $1~\mathrm{PW/cm^2}$. Nonlinear effects, including high harmonic generation, emerge starting from $100~\mathrm{GW/cm^2}$ in $\mathrm{Cs_3Sb}$ and $200~\mathrm{GW/cm^2}$ in $\mathrm{Cs_2Te}$. Above these intensities, the numbers of absorbed photons and excited electrons saturate due to the depletion of one-photon absorption channels, with renewed increases beyond $1~\mathrm{TW/cm^2}$ for $\mathrm{Cs_3Sb}$ and $5~\mathrm{TW/cm^2}$ for $\mathrm{Cs_2Te}$ where multi-photon absorption appears. Finally, the analysis of the occupation density in $\mathrm{Cs_3Sb}$ reveals the onset of tunnel ionization at intensities above $10~\mathrm{TW/cm^2}$. Our findings provide new insights into the nonlinear optical properties of $\mathrm{Cs_3Sb}$ and $\mathrm{Cs_2Te}$, contributing to the optimization of these materials for the development of next-generation photoinjectors.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Softening in Halide Double Perovskites via an unusual Pseudo-Triggered Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for next generation photovoltaic applications, attracting significant attention in recent years. Through first-principles calculations combined with group-theoretical analyses, we investigate the structural phase diagram of Pb-free Jahn-Teller-active $A_2$Au$_2X_6$ ($A$: Cs, Rb; $X$: Cl, Br, I) double perovskites. Our study identifies a previously unreported ferroelectric phase, where the softening of the polar mode$-$key to ferroelectricity$-$is driven by an unconventional and indirect coupling with improper strains originating from Jahn-Teller distortions. The proposed strain mediated \textit{pseudo}-triggered mechanism offers an alternative pathway to enhance the static dielectric constant or even promote (photo-)ferroelectricity, addressing challenges such as defects, excitons, and charge scattering that hinder photovoltaic efficiency. More broadly, this novel mechanism could be extended to oxide double perovskites and opens up a new type of ferroelectric phase transition worthy of future investigation.</description>

      <title>Imaging neutron radiation-induced defects in single-crystal chemical vapor deposition diamond at the atomic level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamond's exceptional properties make it highly suited for applications in challenging radiation environments. Understanding radiation-induced damage in diamond is crucial for enabling its practical applications and advancing materials science. However, direct imaging of radiation-induced crystal defects at the atomic scale remains rare due to diamond's compact lattice structure. Here, we report the atomic-level characterization of crystal defects induced by high-flux fast neutron radiation (up to $3 \times10^{17}$ n/$cm^2$) in single-crystal chemical vapor deposition diamonds. Through Raman spectroscopy, the phase transition from carbon $sp^3$ to $sp^2$ hybridization was identified, primarily associated with the formation of dumbbell-shaped interstitial defects. Using electron energy loss spectroscopy and aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, we observed a clustering trend in defect distribution, where $sp^2$ rich clusters manifested as dislocation structures with a density up to $10^{14}$ $cm^{-2}$. Lomer-Cottrell junctions were identified, offering a possible explanation for defect cluster formation. Radiation-induced point defects were found to be dispersed throughout the diamond lattice, highlighting the widespread nature of primary defect formation. Vacancy defects, along with $\langle 111 \rangle$ and $\langle 100 \rangle$ oriented dumbbell-shaped interstitial defects induced by high-dose neutron irradiation, were directly imaged, providing microscopic structural evidence that complements spectroscopic studies of point defects. Dynamical simulations combined with an adiabatic recombination-based damage model provided insights into the correlation between irradiation dose and resulting crystal damage.

      <title>Capturing non-equilibrium electron dynamics in metals accurately and efficiently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of non-equilibrium electron distributions is essential for capturing light-metal interactions and therefore the study of photoabsorption, photocatalysis, laser ablation, and many other phenomena. Current methodologies, such as the Boltzmann equation using full collision integrals, describe non-equilibrium electron dynamics in great detail but at often prohibitive computational expense. In contrast, the simplification via a relaxation time approach can hinder the description of important features or, even worse, lead to nonphysical behavior due to the lack of particle and energy conservation. We propose a model that bridges the gap between the Boltzmann equation and two-temperature models to trace non-equilibrium distributions efficiently. This Athermal Electron Model (AthEM) separately captures the dynamics of thermal and athermal electrons and describes the energy and particle flow between two electronic systems and phonons. We show that the results align well with the results of Boltzmann equation and data from photoemission experiments. The AthEM enables the rapid generation of qualitatively accurate non-equilibrium electron distributions and provides a good starting point for further extensions.</description>

      <title>Materials Discovery With Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials discovery is a computationally intensive process that requires exploring vast chemical spaces to identify promising candidates with desirable properties. In this work, we propose using quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithms following the extremal learning framework to predict novel heteroacene structures with low hole reorganization energy $\lambda$, a key property for organic semiconductors. We leverage chemical data generated in a previous large-scale virtual screening to construct three initial training datasets containing 54, 99 and 119 molecules encoded using $N=7,16$ and 22 bits, respectively. Furthermore, a sequential learning process is employed to augment the initial training data with compounds predicted by the algorithms through iterative retraining. Both algorithms are able to successfully extrapolate to heteroacene structures with lower $\lambda$ than in the initial dataset, demonstrating good generalization capabilities even when the amount of initial data is limited. We observe an improvement in the quality of the predicted compounds as the number of encoding bits $N$ increases, which offers an exciting prospect for applying the algorithms to richer chemical spaces that require larger values of $N$ and hence, in perspective, larger quantum circuits to deploy the proposed quantum-enhanced protocols.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic temperature-dependent lattice parameters and elastic constants from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quasi-harmonic Approximation (QHA) is a widely used method for calculating the temperature dependence of lattice parameters and the thermal expansion coefficients from first principles. However, applying QHA to anisotropic systems typically requires several dozens or even hundreds of phonon band structure calculations, leading to high computational costs. The Zero Static Internal Stress Approximation (ZSISA) QHA method partly addresses such caveat, but the computational load of its implementation remains high, so that its volumetric-only counterpart v-ZSISA-QHA is preferred. In this work, we present an efficient implementation of the ZSISA-QHA, enabling its application across a wide range of crystal structures under varying temperature (T) and pressure (P) conditions. By incorporating second-order derivatives of the vibrational free energy with respect to lattice degrees of freedom, we significantly reduce the number of required phonon band structure calculations for the determination of all lattice parameters and angles. For hexagonal, trigonal, and tetragonal systems, only six phonon band structure calculations are needed, while 10, 15, and 28 calculations suffice for orthorhombic, monoclinic, and triclinic systems, respectively. This method is tested for a variety of non-cubic materials, from uniaxial ones like ZnO and CaCO3 to monoclinic or triclinic materials such as ZrO2, HfO2, and Al2SiO5, demonstrating a significant reduction in computational effort while maintaining accuracy in modeling anisotropic thermal expansion, unlike the v-ZSISA-QHA. The method is also applied to the first-principles calculation of temperature-dependent elastic constants, with only up to six more phonon band structure calculations, depending on the crystallographic system.</description>

      <title>Novel design of biplanar electrodes in a multiwell plate for transepithelial electrical resistance measurement in 3D cell cultures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in microphysiological systems have underscored the need for novel sensing and monitoring systems specifically designed for three-dimensional (3D) cell culture. In this article, an original architecture of a cell-culture multiwell plate embedding an impedance spectroscopy monitoring system is presented alongside a fast and straightforward fabrication process that allows scale-up production for further industrial exploitation. Our proposed approach involves a biplanar electrode configuration, enabling real-time and high-throughput impedance spectroscopy measurements through a 3D biological construct. This configuration not only allows for non-invasive electrical characterization of a 3D tissue layer, but also offers the capability to thoroughly analyze and understand the characteristics of any type of biological barrier and 3D tissue. The proof of concept for the developed system has been effectively validated for measuring impedance across both endothelial and mouse myoblast monolayers cultured within a 3D collagen biomimicking matrix. Moreover, transepithelial electrical resistance values, which vary with cell type and duration of cell culture, were effectively determined from the impedance spectra. The obtained results showed that the proposed device allows the monitoring of tight junction and cell layer formation over time without inducing alterations to the cells.</description>

      <title>Advanced muon-spin spectroscopy with high lateral resolution using Si-pixel detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muon-spin spectroscopy at continuous sources has stagnated at a stopped muons rate of ~40 kHz for the last few decades. The major limiting factor is the requirement of a single muon in the sample during the typical 10 {\mu}s data gate window. To overcome this limit and to be able to perform muon-spin relaxation ({\mu}SR) measurements on millimeter-sized samples, one can use vertex reconstruction methods to construct {\mu}SR spectra. This is now possible thanks to the availability of very thin monolithic Si-pixel chips, which offer minimal particle scattering and high count rate. Here we present results from a Si-pixel based spectrometer that utilizes vertex reconstruction schemes for the incoming muons and emitted positrons. With this spectrometer we were able to obtain a first vertex reconstructed {\mu}SR (VR-{\mu}SR) spectrum. The unique capabilities and benefits of such a spectrometer are discussed.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Scattering of Mechanically Driven Polymers using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a deep learning approach for analyzing two-dimensional scattering data of semiflexible polymers under external forces. In our framework, scattering functions are compressed into a three-dimensional latent space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and two converter networks establish a bidirectional mapping between the polymer parameters (bending modulus, stretching force, and steady shear) and the scattering functions. The training data are generated using off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations to avoid the orientational bias inherent in lattice models, ensuring robust sampling of polymer conformations. The feasibility of this bidirectional mapping is demonstrated by the organized distribution of polymer parameters in the latent space. By integrating the converter networks with the VAE, we obtain a generator that produces scattering functions from given polymer parameters and an inferrer that directly extracts polymer parameters from scattering data. While the generator can be utilized in a traditional least-squares fitting procedure, the inferrer produces comparable results in a single pass and operates three orders of magnitude faster. This approach offers a scalable, automated tool for polymer scattering analysis and provides a promising foundation for extending the method to other scattering models, experimental validation, and the study of time-dependent scattering data.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Light-Induced Microwave Mode Tuning in a Rutile TiO$_2$ Whispering Gallery Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of transient nonlinear optical effects in a macroscopic whispering gallery mode resonator made of rutile TiO$_2$, demonstrating strong optical-microwave transduction under laser irradiation. By comparing the effects of ultraviolet (UV, 385 nm) and near-infrared (NIR, 700 nm) radiation, we find that the UV-induced effects are significantly amplified, consistent with the material's semiconductor bandgap energy. The interaction results in frequency shifts of microwave modes and changes in quality factor, suggesting a localized saturable refractive index tuning. This may be attributed to the saturation of a spin transition of a dopant ion within the crystal lattice. Remarkably, these effects are observed at low optical powers, down to nanowatt levels, indicating high sensitivity and efficient of light-matter interaction in this system. The phenomenon is centered around 15 GHz, yet electron spin resonance measurements reveal no zero-field splitting at this frequency, suggesting an alternative mechanism beyond conventional spin resonance. These findings highlight the potential of low-power optical control of microwave modes in high-Q resonators for applications in quantum technologies, sensing, and reconfigurable photonic-microwave systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long range order and symmetry in heterogeneous materials architected on crystal lattices lead to elastic and inelastic anisotropies and thus limit mechanical functionalities in particular crystallographic directions. Here, we present a facile approach for designing heterogeneous disordered materials that exhibit nearly isotropic mechanical resilience and energy dissipation capabilities. We demonstrate, through experiments and numerical simulations on 3D-printed prototypes, that near-complete isotropy can be attained in the proposed heterogeneous materials with a small, finite number of random spatial points. We also show that adding connectivity between random subdomains leads to much enhanced elastic stiffness, plastic strength, energy dissipation, shape recovery, structural stability and reusability in our new heterogeneous materials. Overall, our study opens avenues for the rational design of a new class of heterogeneous materials with isotropic mechanical functionalities for which the engineered disorder throughout the subdomains plays a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Dense suspensions as trainable rheological metafluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory-forming properties introduce a new paradigm to the design of adaptive materials. In dense suspensions, an adaptive response is enabled by non-Newtonian rheology; however, typical suspensions have little memory, which implies rapid cessation of any adapted behavior. Here we show how multiple adaptive responses can be achieved by designing suspensions where different stress levels trigger different memories. This is enabled by the interplay of interactions based on frictional contact and dynamic chemical bridging. These two interactions lead to novel rheology with several well-delineated shear thinning and thickening regimes, which enable stress-activated memories associated with opposite time-dependent trends. As a result, in response to different stress levels, the suspension can evolve by either softening or stiffening and is trainable, exhibiting targeted viscosity and energy dissipation with repeated low-velocity impact. Such behavior, usually associated with mechanical metamaterials, suggests that dense suspensions with multiple memories can be viewed as trainable rheological metafluids.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Optical Control of Multi-Valley States in 2D SnS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the ultrafast optical control of multiple valley states in two-dimensional (2D) tin sulfide (SnS) monolayers, a member of the layered group-IV monochalcogenides, which is a promising class of materials for overcoming current challenges in valleytronics. By combining time-dependent density functional theory with Maxwells equations, we simulate how both linearly and circularly polarized ultrashort laser pulses affect the electronic excitation dynamics and valley polarization in SnS. Our results reveal that the corrugated phosphorene-like crystal structure of SnS monolayers leads to the emergence of both linear and circular dichroism, allowing flexible manipulation of multi-valley excitation by simply adjusting the light polarization. Moreover, the interplay between broken inversion symmetry and spin-orbit coupling gives rise to distinct Berry curvature effects and spin-valley coupling, thereby enabling circular dichroism. Furthermore, we propose that tuning the carrier-envelope phase of few-cycle femtosecond laser pulses can achieve sub-cycle, ultrafast switching among multiple valleys states. These findings not only deepen our understanding of valley dynamics in 2D materials but may also open new avenues for the development of valleytronic devices.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a setup combining fast scanning calorimetry with X-ray total scattering at a synchrotron beamline, allowing for \emph{in-situ} characterizations of the nano-scale structure of samples during and after temperature scans. The setup features a portable vacuum chamber giving high signal-to-background ratio even on amorphous samples, which enables the observation of detailed structural changes between different sample states. We show three use cases, including one which leverages the high cooling rate of 10$^4$\,K/s achievable by this setup. Our demonstration opens the door to various applications in materials science where it is important to understand the interplay between structure and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Local probe evidence supporting altermagnetism in Co$_{1/4}$NbSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muon spin rotation (${\mu}$SR), combined with muon stopping site and local field analysis, was used to investigate the magnetic properties of cobalt intercalated 2H-NbSe$_2$ (Co$_{1/4}$NbSe$_2$). Co$_{1/4}$NbSe$_2$ is predicted to be an altermagnet, and whilst neutron diffraction has proposed its magnetic structure, microscopic details such as the magnetic volume fraction remain unclear. Therefore, a local probe investigation of its magnetism is essential. Here, we report the determination of the magnetically ordered volume fraction, ordered moment size, and magnetic structure. Our results reveal a sharp second-order transition to a full-volume-fraction, homogeneous magnetic order below $T_\mathrm{N}~=~168~$K. The moments are aligned antiparallel along the $c$-axis, consistent with neutron diffraction and altermagnetism. ${\mu}$SR reveals that the state remains stable under a $c$-axis magnetic field up to $0.78~$T, with magnetisation measurements suggesting this robust regimes extends to at least $5$~T. Within the time resolution of ${\mu}$SR, no precursor slow altermagnetic fluctuations were detected above $T_\mathrm{N}$, which is important for interpreting the band splitting in the paramagnetic state reported by photoemission studies. These findings support altermagnetism in Co$_{1/4}$NbSe$_2$ and motivate further experiments to explore the tunability of its magnetic and electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Contrasting $c$-axis and in-plane uniaxial stress effects on superconductivity and stripe order in La$_{1.885}$Ba$_{0.115}$CuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cuprate superconductor La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$ (LBCO) near $x=0.125$ is a striking example of intertwined electronic orders, where 3D superconductivity is anomalously suppressed, allowing spin and charge stripe order to develop, in a manner consistent with the emergence of a pair-density-wave (PDW) state. Understanding this interplay remains a key challenge in cuprates, highlighting the necessity of external tuning for deeper insight. While in-plane (within the CuO plane) uniaxial stress enhances superconductivity and suppresses stripe order, the effects of $c$-axis compression (perpendicular to the CuO plane) remains largely unexplored. Here, we use muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) and AC susceptibility with an in situ piezoelectric stress device to investigate the spin-stripe order and superconductivity in LBCO-0.115 under $c$-axis compression. The measurements reveal a gradual suppression of the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) with increasing $c$-axis stress, in stark contrast to the strong enhancement observed under in-plane stress. We further show that while in-plane stress rapidly reduces both the magnetic volume fraction ($V_{\rm m}$) and the spin-stripe ordering temperature ($T_{\rm so}$), $c$-axis compression has no effect, with $V_{\rm m}$ and $T_{\rm so}$ exhibiting an almost unchanged behavior up to the highest applied stress of 0.21 GPa. These findings demonstrate a strong anisotropy in stress response, underscoring the critical role of crystallographic anisotropy in governing competing electronic phases in LBCO.</description>

The inelastic effects are included in a consistent way using the optical potential retrieved from ab initio simulations of electron energy-loss spectra. We demonstrate a significant impact of inelastic effects even for single-layer graphene. Next, we address the ability of the electron reflection spectroscopy to determine specific parameters of graphene including not only the number of layers in the few-layer graphene but also the stacking type in the graphene multilayers, and to resolve moir\'e patterns in twisted graphene bilayers. We show that the predicted contrast, although significantly reduced by inelastic effects, is sufficient for the experimental detection of all considered parameters. Our findings are corroborated by a fair correspondence of our theoretical predictions with experimental data, both our own and recently published by other authors.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced strange metal phase in a metallic kagome ferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strange metallicity with $T$-linear electrical resistance preceding high-$T_c$ superconductivity remains an enigmatic, yet crucial, signature of correlation physics. Using electrical transport and magnetization measurements up to 50 GPa, we show that such a strange-metal phase is formed in pressurized kagome ferromagnet CrNiAs. In contrast to other kagome materials, a linear suppression of the Curie temperature is found, with the ferromagnetic quantum critical point at $p_{\rm{c}} \approx 12.5$ GPa. Remarkably, from $p_{\rm{c}}$ up to the highest measured pressure, characteristic strange-metal behavior is observed, whereas magnetic field reinstates the Fermi liquid. Electronic structure calculations reveal robust weakly dispersive bands persisting unchanged beyond $p_{\rm{c}}$, possibly at the origin of the $T$-linear electrical resistance. This establishes pressurized kagome ferromagnets as an intriguing platform for strange-metal behavior.</description>

      <title>Localisation of hexagonal boron nitride colour centres using patterned dielectric layers on graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most promising building blocks for the development of spin qubits, single-photon sources, and quantum sensors at room temperature, as well as 2D ultraviolet light-emitting diodes, are defect colour centres in 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, a significant requirement for the realisation of such devices towards scalable technologies is the deterministic localisation of hBN colour centres. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to the localisation of hBN colour centre emission by using patterned dielectric layers grown on graphene via atomic layer deposition (ALD). While colour centre emission is quenched within areas where hBN is deposited directly on graphene due to charge transfer, it is maintained where hBN is deposited on micron-sized Al2O3 pillars which act as barriers to charge transfer. Importantly, our approach allows for device architectures where graphene layers are used as top and bottom electrodes for the application of vertical electric fields, such as for carrier injection in electroluminescent devices, Stark shifting of colour centre emission, and charge state control of defect colour centres. Furthermore, the use of ALD to grow dielectric layers directly on graphene allows for the control of tunnel barrier thicknesses with atomic layer precision, which is crucial for many of these device applications. Our work represents an important step towards the realisation of a wide range of scalable device applications based on the determinsitic localisation of electrically controlled hBN colour centres</description>

      <title>Odd-parity altermagnetism through sublattice currents: From Haldane-Hubbard model to general bipartite lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the sublattice currents as a feasible route to odd-parity altermagnetism (ALM), where nonrelativistic collinear spin splitting occurs in the bands as an odd function of momentum. In contrast to previously classified ALMs, the sublattice currents break the time-reversal symmetry in nonmagnetic crystal structures and allow for such odd-parity spin splitting. A representative example is the Haldane-Hubbard model at half filling. Although the compensated collinear magnetic ground state was previously recognized as antiferromagnetism, we show that sublattice currents induce spin splitting in the bands and therefore turn it into an odd-parity ALM. Interestingly, its topological version serves as an example of ALM Chern insulator. We further generalize the Haldane-Hubbard model to common two- and three-dimensional bipartite lattices. With spin splitting from sublattice currents, the compensated collinear magnetic ground states at half filling are generally odd-parity ALM.</description>

      <title>Observation of increasing bending rigidity of graphene with temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of two-dimensional materials are important for a wide range of applications including composite and van der Waals-materials, flexible electronics and superconductivity. Several aspects are highly debated in the literature: For example, the theoretically predicted bending rigidity $\kappa$ at 0 K for quasi free-standing graphene varies from 0.8 to 1.6~eV, and there are predictions that it could either increase or decrease with temperature. Here we present an experimental study of the temperature-dependent bending rigidity $\kappa(T)$ of graphene. From the phonon dispersion relation measured with helium atom scattering for the out-of-plane acoustic (ZA) mode, we find $\kappa(T)$ to increase with sample temperature. We compare our experimental results with novel molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed as part of this study as well as available literature data. The calculations reproduce the temperature trend of our experiments, but with a slightly weaker slope. A probable cause for the observed differences is the slight strain associated with experimental substrate supported graphene that is not present in the calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted bilayers of two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as a highly tunable platform to study and engineer properties of excitons. However, the atomistic description of these properties has remained a significant challenge as a consequence of the large unit cells of the emergent moir\'e superlattices. To address this problem, we introduce an efficient approach to solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation that exploits the localization of atomic Wannier functions. We then use this approach to study intra- and interlayer excitons in twisted WS$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ at a range of twist angles. In agreement with experiment, we find that the optical spectrum exhibits three low-energy peaks for twist angles small than $2^\circ$. The energy splitting between the peaks is described accurately. We also find two low-energy interlayer excitons with weak oscillator strengths. Our approach opens up new opportunities for the design of light-matter interactions in ultrathin materials.</description>

      <title>Responses of any arbitrary initially stressed reference and the stress-free reference</title>

Abstract: The constitutive relation for an initially stressed reference is often determined by using the response of a virtual stress-free reference. However, identifying the constitutive relation of the original stress-free body can be challenging without conducting destructive tests. This paper presents three approaches for determining the response of a stress-free reference -- or any arbitrary initially stressed reference -- when the response of a particular initially stressed reference is known. Unlike standard practice, these approaches of changing reference configurations do not begin with a known stress-free state. The first and third approaches directly derive the constitutive relations of one stressed reference from another. {The first approach is applicable to a specific constitutive relation of the known initially stressed state,} while the third approach extends the first and is applicable to any constitutive form. The second approach uses any general response of a given stressed reference to identify the stress-free material. The response of the stress-free material is further analyzed and processed to determine the response of any stressed reference. We observe that even when the known initially stressed state is Green elastic, the arbitrarily stressed or stress-free references may exhibit implicit elasticity.

      <title>Crystal valley Hall effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time-reversal symmetry is thought to be a necessary condition for realizing valley Hall effect. If the time-reversal symmetry is broken, whether the valley Hall effect can be realized has not been explored. In this letter, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we demonstrate that the vally Hall effect without time-reversal symmetry can be realized in two-dimensional altermagnetic materials Fe$_2$WSe$_4$ and Fe$_2$WS$_4$. Due to crystal symmetry required, the vally Hall effect without time-reversal symmetry is called crystal vally Hall effect. In addition, under uniaxial strain, both monolayer Fe$_2$WSe$_4$ and Fe$_2$WS$_4$ can realize piezomagnetic effect. Under biaxial compressive stress, both monolayer Fe$_2$WSe$_4$ and Fe$_2$WS$_4$ will transform from altermagnetic semiconductor phase to bipolarized topological Weyl semimetal phase. Our work not only provides a new direction for exploring the novel valley Hall effect, but also provides a good platform for exploring altermagnetic semiconductors and altermagnetic topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Effects of Spin-Orbit Coupling and Thermal Expansion on the Phonon-limited Resistivity of Pb from First Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using density functional theory calculations with spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we report on the temperature-dependent thermodynamical properties of Pb: electrical resistivity, thermal expansion (TE), heat capacity, bulk modulus and its pressure derivative. For the former, we employed the state-of-the-art ab initio Boltzmann Transport Equation formalism, and we calculated the effect of TE. In accordance with previous work, we show that SOC improves the description of the phonon dispersion and the resistivity. We argue that this is caused by a joint mutual effect of an increase in the electronic nesting and an increase in the electron-phonon coupling. Interestingly, including TE incorporates non-linearity into the resistivity at high temperatures, whose magnitude depends on whether SOC is included or not. We suggest that mechanisms beyond the quasi-harmonic approximation should be considered to get a better description of Pb with SOC at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism: an unconventional spin-ordered phase of matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pauli exclusion principle combined with interactions between fermions is a basic mechanism across condensed-matter systems giving rise to a spontaneous breaking of the spin-space rotation symmetry of spin-ordered phases. Ferromagnetism is a conventional manifestation of spin ordering which leads to numerous applications, e.g., in spintronic information technologies. Altermagnetism, whose recent discovery was largely motivated by spintronics, stands apart from conventional magnetism in the sense that it spontaneously breaks not only spin-space but also real-space rotation symmetries, while it preserves a symmetry combining spin-space and real-space rotations. This is realized on crystals by a collinear compensated ordering of spins with a characteristic d, g or i-wave symmetry. Our Perspective goes beyond the theory of spin arrangements on crystals by connecting altermagnetism to basic notions in condensed matter physics. Specifically, we reflect on the analogies and distinctions of altermagnetism as compared to superfluid 3He and theories of spin ordering in the momentum space generated by other higher-partial-wave instabilities of a Fermi-liquid. On one hand, all these physical systems have in common the extraordinary combination of spontaneous breaking of spin-space and real-space rotation symmetries. On the other hand, we point out that there are key differences, both at the symmetry level and, particularly, at the level of microscopic mechanisms of ordering. These explain the comparatively large abundance, robustness and utility of altermagnetism, as predicted by the symmetry-classification of spin arrangements on crystals and ab initio calculations, and supported by initial experiments.</description>

      <title>Origin of $A$-type antiferromagnetism and chiral split magnons in altermagnetic $\alpha$-MnTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the $A$-type antiferromagnetic ordering, characterized by ferromagnetic layers coupling antiferromagnetically, in the prototype semiconductor altermagnet $\alpha$-MnTe has been a topic of ongoing debate. Experimentally, $\alpha$-MnTe exhibits an in-plane ferromagnetic exchange interaction, whereas previous \emph{ab initio} calculations predicted an antiferromagnetic interaction. In this paper, we resolve this discrepancy by considering an expanded set of magnetic configurations, which reveals a ferromagnetic in-plane exchange interaction in agreement with experimental findings. Additionally, we demonstrate that the 10th nearest-neighbor exchange interaction is directionally dependent, inducing a nonrelativistic chiral splitting in the magnon bands, as recently observed experimentally. We further show that applying a compressive strain may significantly enhance both nonrelativistic spin and chiral magnon splittings. The strain can also change the sign of the in-plane exchange interaction. Computing magnetic susceptibility, we show that strain enhances the N{\'e}el temperature, significantly. Our results highlight the critical importance of convergence in the number of magnetic configurations for spin interactions in antiferromagnetic materials.</description>

Abstract: Exploring the chemistry of materials at high pressures has lead to the discovery of previously unknown exotic compounds. Here, we systematically search for all thermodynamically stable Sr-C compounds under pressure (up to 100 GPa) using the ab initio evolutionary crystal structure prediction method. Our search lead to the discovery of hitherto unknown phases of SrC3, Sr2C5, Sr2C3, Sr2C, Sr3C2, and SrC. The newly discovered crystal structures feature a variety of different carbon environments ranging from isolated C anions and C-dimers to exotic polyatomic carbon anions including chains, stripes, and infinite ribbons consisting of pentagonal C5 and hexagonal C6 rings. Dynamical stability of all predicted compounds is confirmed by phonons calculations. Bader analysis unravels very diverse chemistry in these compounds and bonding patterns in some of them can be described using Zintl-Klemm rule.</description>

Abstract: Phonon interactions from lattice anharmonicity govern thermal properties and heat transport in materials. These interactions are described by n-th order interatomic force constants (n-IFCs), which can be viewed as high-dimensional tensors correlating the motion of n atoms, or equivalently encoding n-phonon scattering processes in momentum space. Here, we introduce a tensor decomposition to efficiently compress n-IFCs for arbitrary order n. Using tensor learning, we find optimal low-rank approximations of n-IFCs by solving the resulting optimization problem. Our approach reveals the inherent low dimensionality of phonon-phonon interactions and allows compression of the 3 and 4-IFC tensors by factors of up to $10^3-10^4$ while retaining high accuracy in calculations of phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity. Calculations of thermal conductivity using the compressed n-IFCs achieve a speed-up by nearly three orders of magnitude with &gt;98% accuracy relative to the reference uncompressed solution. These calculations include both 3- and 4-phonon scattering and are shown for a diverse range of materials (Si, HgTe, MgO, and TiNiSn). In addition to accelerating state-of-the-art thermal transport calculations, the method shown here paves the way for modeling strongly anharmonic materials and higher-order phonon interactions.</description>

Abstract: Based on high-throughput density functional theory calculations, we evaluate the local magnetic moments and M\"ossbauer properties for Fe-based intermetallic compounds and employ machine learning to map the local crystalline environments to such properties. It is observed that magnetic moments and M\"ossbauer parameters provide complementary insights into the local crystalline environment, where the statistical features cannot be captured using phenomenological models. Furthermore, we find that the scarcity of existing data in Materials Project (MP) poses a significant challenge in developing predictive machine learning models, whereas SOAP-based descriptors can be applied for reliable modeling of the enriched datasets with extra structural prototypes. This work advances the mapping of local crystalline structures to magnetic and spectroscopic properties, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical models.</description>

Recently, publicly available material data repositories have grown rapidly. This growth encompasses not only more materials but also a greater variety and quantity of their associated properties. Existing machine learning efforts in materials science focus primarily on single-modality tasks, i.e. relationships between materials and a single physical property, thus not taking advantage of the rich and multimodal set of material properties. Here, we introduce Multimodal Learning for Materials (MultiMat), which enables self-supervised multi-modality training of foundation models for materials. We demonstrate our framework's potential using data from the Materials Project database on multiple axes: (i) MultiMat achieves state-of-the-art performance for challenging material property prediction tasks; (ii) MultiMat enables novel and accurate material discovery via latent space similarity, enabling screening for stable materials with desired properties; and (iii) MultiMat encodes interpretable emergent features that may provide novel scientific insights.</description>

      <title>Mirror Chern Bands and Weyl Nodal Loops in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electronic spectra of altermagnets are a fertile ground for nontrivial topology due to the unique interplay between time-reversal and crystalline symmetries. This is reflected in the unconventional Zeeman splitting between bands of opposite spins, which emerges in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and displays nodes along high-symmetry directions. Here, we argue that even for a small SOC, the direction of the magnetic moments in the altermagnetic state has a profound impact on the electronic spectrum, enabling novel topological phenomena to appear. By investigating microscopic models for two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) altermagnets, motivated in part by rutile materials, we demonstrate the emergence of hitherto unexplored Dirac crossings between bands of the same spin but opposite sublattices. The direction of the moments determines the fate of these crossings when the SOC is turned on. We focus on the case of out-of-plane moments, which forbid an anomalous Hall effect and thus ensure that no weak magnetization is triggered in the altermagnetic state. In the 2D model, the SOC gaps out the Dirac crossings, resulting in mirror Chern bands that enable the Quantum Spin Hall Effect and undergo a topological transition to trivial bands upon increasing the magnitude of the magnetic moment. On the other hand, in the 3D model the crossings persist even in the presence of SOC, forming Weyl nodal loops protected by mirror symmetry. Finally, we discuss possible ways to control these effects in altermagnetic material candidates.</description>

      <title>DFT+DMFT study of correlated electronic structure in the monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By preforming DFT+DMFT calculations, we systematically investigate the correlated electronic structure in the newly discovered monolayer-trilayer (ML-TL) phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La327). Our calculated Fermi surfaces are in good agreement with the result of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We find that 1313-La327 is a multiorbital correlated metal. An orbital-selective Mott behavior is found in ML in our zero- and finite-temperature calculations. The ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits a Mott behavior, while the ML Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is metallic due to self-doping. We also find a large static local spin susceptibility of ML Ni, suggesting that there is large spin fluctuation in 1313-La327. The TL Ni-$e_g$ orbitals possess similar electronic correlation to those in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The $e_g$ orbitals of the outer-layer Ni in TL show non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Besides, large weight of high-spin states are found in TL-outer Ni and ML Ni, implying Hundness. Under 16 GPa, a Lifshitz transition is revealed by our calculations and a La-related band crosses the Fermi level. Our work provides a theoretical reference for studying other potential mixed-stacked nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Performance and Robustness of LLMs in Materials Science Q&amp;A and Property Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize scientific research, yet their robustness and reliability in domain-specific applications remain insufficiently explored. In this study, we evaluate the performance and robustness of LLMs for materials science, focusing on domain-specific question answering and materials property prediction across diverse real-world and adversarial conditions. Three distinct datasets are used in this study: 1) a set of multiple-choice questions from undergraduate-level materials science courses, 2) a dataset including various steel compositions and yield strengths, and 3) a band gap dataset, containing textual descriptions of material crystal structures and band gap values. The performance of LLMs is assessed using various prompting strategies, including zero-shot chain-of-thought, expert prompting, and few-shot in-context learning. The robustness of these models is tested against various forms of 'noise', ranging from realistic disturbances to intentionally adversarial manipulations, to evaluate their resilience and reliability under real-world conditions. Additionally, the study showcases unique phenomena of LLMs during predictive tasks, such as mode collapse behavior when the proximity of prompt examples is altered and performance recovery from train/test mismatch. The findings aim to provide informed skepticism for the broad use of LLMs in materials science and to inspire advancements that enhance their robustness and reliability for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Polaron-Polariton Dispersion and Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytical microscopic theory to describe the polaron-polariton dispersion, formed by hybridizing excitons, photons, and phonons, and their coherent dynamics inside optical cavities. Starting from a microscopic light-matter Hamiltonian, we derive a simple analytical model by pursuing a non-perturbative treatment of the phonon and photon couplings to excitons. Within our theoretical framework, the phonons are treated as classical fields that are then quantized via the Floquet formalism. We show that, to a good approximation, the entire polaron-polariton system can be described using a band picture despite the phonons breaking translational symmetry. Our theory also sheds light on the long-lived coherent ballistic motion of exciton-polaritons with high excitonic character that propagate with group velocities lower than is expected from pure exciton-polariton bands, offering a microscopic explanation for these puzzling experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Tensor Completion for Surrogate Modeling of Material Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When designing materials to optimize certain properties, there are often many possible configurations of designs that need to be explored. For example, the materials' composition of elements will affect properties such as strength or conductivity, which are necessary to know when developing new materials. Exploring all combinations of elements to find optimal materials becomes very time consuming, especially when there are more design variables. For this reason, there is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to predict a material's properties. In this work, we model the optimization of certain material properties as a tensor completion problem, to leverage the structure of our datasets and navigate the vast number of combinations of material configurations. Across a variety of material property prediction tasks, our experiments show tensor completion methods achieving 10-20% decreased error compared with baseline ML models such as GradientBoosting and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), while maintaining similar training speed.</description>
