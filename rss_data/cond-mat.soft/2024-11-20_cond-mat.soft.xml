      <title>Hydrodynamic Stokes flow induced by a chemically active patch imprinted on a planar wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patches of catalyst imprinted on supporting walls induce motion of the fluid around them once they are supplied with the chemical species (``fuel'') that are converted by the catalytic chemical reaction. While the functioning of such chemically active micropumps is conceptually well understood, an in-depth characterization of the induced hydrodynamic flow, and in particular of its possible dependences on parameters such as material properties of the patch and the wall or the geometry of the experimental cell, remains elusive. By using a simple model for the chemical activity of a patch imprinted on a planar wall, we determine analytically the induced hydrodynamic flow in a Newtonian solution that occupies the half space above the wall supporting the patch. This can be seen as an approximation for an experimental-cell geometry with a height much larger than its diameter, the latter, in turn, being much larger than the size of the patch.) The general flow is a linear superposition of a surface-driven and a bulk-driven component; they have different topologies and, generically, each one dominates in distinct regions, with the surface-driven flow being most relevant at small heights above the wall. The surface-driven flows exhibit a somewhat unexpectedly rich behavior, including qualitative changes in the topology of the flow, as a function of the contrast in surface-chemistry (osmotic slip coefficient) between the patch and the support wall. The results are expected to provide guidance for the interpretation of the drift of tracers by the ambient flow, which is the observable usually studied in experimental investigations of chemically active micropumps.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based Tensor Model for Nematic Liquid Crystals with Accurate Microscopic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenological Landau-de Gennes (LdG) model is a powerful continuum theory to describe the macroscopic state of nematic liquid crystals. However, it is invariably less accurate and less physically informed than the molecular-level models due to the lack of physical meaning of the parameters. We propose a neural network-based tensor (NN-Tensor) model for nematic liquid crystals, supervised by the molecular model. Consequently, the NN-Tensor model not only attains energy precision comparable to the molecular model but also accurately captures the Isotropic-Nematic phase transition, which the LdG model cannot achieve. The NN-Tensor model is further embedded in another neural network to predict liquid crystal configurations in a domain-free and mesh-free manner. We apply the NN-Tensor model to nematic liquid crystals in a number of two-dimensional and three-dimensional domains to demonstrate it can efficiently identify rich liquid crystal configurations in both regular and non-regular confinements.</description>

      <title>Transport of molecules via polymerization in chemical gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of molecules for chemical reactions is critically important in various cellular biological processes. Despite thermal diffusion being prevalent in many biochemical processes, it is unreliable for any sort of directed transport or preferential accumulation of molecules. In this paper we propose a strategy for directed motion in which the molecules are transported by active carriers via polymerization. This transport is facilitated by chemical/activity gradients which generate an effective drift of the polymers. By marginalizing out the active degrees of freedom of the system, we obtain an effective Fokker-Planck equation for the Rouse modes of such active-passive hybrid polymers. In particular, we solve for the steady state distribution of the center of mass and its mean first passage time to reach an intended destination. We focus on how the arrangement of active units within the polymer affect its steady-state and dynamic behaviour and how they can be optimized to achieve high accumulation or rapid motility.</description>

      <title>Double Splay Nematic Order in Confined Polar Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate that when a ferroelectric nematic is confined between two glass plates coated with ionic polymers, a modulated phase emerges in a narrow temperature range between the nematic and ferroelectric nematic phases. This modulated phase emerges from the nematic phase in a continuous manner and then transforms into the ferroelectric nematic phase via a first-order transition upon cooling. Using optical microscopy, we provide compelling evidence that this modulated phase corresponds to the theoretically predicted double splay nematic phase. In this phase, splay deformations alternate in two orthogonal directions oriented at 45{\deg} to the substrate surfaces, creating a modulation wavelength that is twice the thickness of the cell. Our experiments with different ionic coatings reveal that only polymeric cationic coatings effectively promote the formation of this phase, highlighting the critical role of electrical screening. These findings not only confirm the existence of the double splay nematic phase but also provide insights into the distinctive topological defects of this phase in confined geometries.</description>

      <title>Transition-path sampling for Run-and-Tumble particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate and validate a generalization of the renowned transition-path-sampling algorithm for a paradigmatic model of active particles, namely the Run-and-Tumble particles. Notwithstanding the non-equilibrium character of these particles, we show how the consequent lack of the microscopical reversibility property, which is usually required by transition-path sampling, can be circumvented by identifying reasonable backward dynamics with a well-defined path-probability density. Our method is then applied to characterize the structure and kinetics of rare transition pathways undergone by Run-and-Tumble particles having to cross a potential barrier in order to find a target.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Disordered Hyperuniformity in Confined Fluids and Soft Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confinement can significantly alter fluid properties, offering potential for specific technological applications. However, achieving precise control over the structural complexity of confined fluids and soft matter remains challenging, as it often requires careful tuning of system parameters. In this study, we perform large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of a fluid confined in a slit pore, employing an interaction potential applicable to a broad range of soft matter. Confinement induces the fluid to form two-dimensional (2D) layers, each of which self-assembles into structures of varying complexity. Notably, we observe a suppression of large-scale density fluctuations-akin to crystals-within complex nontrivial fluid-like geometries, leading to the emergence of disordered hyperuniformity. We demonstrate that fluid properties can be precisely adjusted by modifying control parameters. This work provides a foundation for designing experimental protocols to regulate the structure of self-assembling materials, stabilize disordered hyperuniform structures, and facilitate the fabrication of 2D arrays with tailored complexity. Additionally, it offers a new perspective for analyzing biological monolayers, such as epithelial tissues.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of phagocytosis through interplay of forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phagocytosis is the process by which cells, which are 5 to 10 times larger than the particle size, engulf particles, holding substantial importance in various biological contexts ranging from the nutrient uptake of unicellular organisms to immune system of humans, animals etc. While the previous studies focused primarily on the mechanism of phagocytosis, in this study we have a taken a different route by studying the dynamics of the phagocytes in a system consisting of many bacteria and a small number of phagocytes. We put forward a minimalist framework that models bacteria and phagocytes as active and passive circular disks, respectively. The interactions are governed by directional forces: phagocytes are attracted toward bacteria, while bacteria experience a repulsive force in proximity to phagocytes. Bacteria are capable of reproduction at a fixed rate, and the balance between bacterial reproduction and phagocytic engulfment is governed by the interplay of the two opposing forces. In attraction dominated regimes, bacterial populations decrease rapidly, while in repulsion dominated regimes, bacterial clusters grow and impede phagocytes, often resulting in phagocyte trapping. Conversely, in attraction-dominated scenarios, only a few bacteria remain at later times, rendering the motion of the phagocytes diffusive. Further, the transition between the two regimes occurs through a regime of bi-stability. Our study further describes the dynamics of both species using the tools of statistical analysis, offering insights into the internal dynamics of this system.</description>

      <title>Optothermally Induced Active and Chiral Motion of the Colloidal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial soft matter systems have appeared as important tools to harness mechanical motion for microscale manipulation. Typically, this motion is driven either by the external fields or by mutual interaction between the colloids. In the latter scenario, dynamics arise from non-reciprocal interaction among colloids within a chemical environment. In contrast, we eliminate the need for a chemical environment by utilizing a large area of optical illumination to generate thermal fields. The resulting optothermal interactions introduce non-reciprocity to the system, enabling active motion of the colloidal structure. Our approach involves two types of colloids: passive and thermally active. The thermally active colloids contain absorbing elements that capture energy from the incident optical beam, creating localized thermal fields around them. In a suspension of these colloids, the thermal gradients generated drive nearby particles through attractive thermo-osmotic forces. We investigate the resulting dynamics, which lead to various swimming modes, including active propulsion and chiral motion. We have also experimentally validated certain simulated results. By exploring the interplay between optical forces, thermal effects, and particle interactions, we aim to gain insights into controlling colloidal behavior in non-equilibrium systems. This research has significant implications for directed self-assembly, microfluidic manipulation, and the study of active matter.</description>

      <title>Transitions Between Cooperative and Crowding-Dominated Collective Motion in non-Jammed MDCK Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transitions between solid-like and fluid-like states in living tissues have been found in steps of embryonic development and in stages of disease progression. Our current understanding of these transitions has been guided by experimental and theoretical investigations focused on how motion becomes arrested with increased mechanical coupling between cells, typically as a function of packing density or cell cohesiveness. However, cells actively respond to externally applied forces by contracting after a time delay, so it is possible that at some packing densities or levels of cell cohesiveness, mechanical coupling stimulates cell motion instead of suppressing it. Here we report our findings that at low densities and within multiple ranges of cell cohesiveness, cell migration speeds increase with these measures of mechanical coupling. Our observations run counter to our intuition that cell motion will be suppressed by increasingly packing or sticking cells together and may provide new insight into biological processes involving motion in dense cell populations.</description>

      <title>Probing Langmuir monolayer self-assembly in condensed and collapsed phases: grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and X-ray standing waves studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ce-induced effects on the self-assembly of arachidic acid Langmuir monolayers was studied in this work. The monolayers were formed on the liquid subphase in the presence of Ce(III) ions. A new type of structural configuration is found for such monolayers, in which the monolayer maintains its structural ordering despite being compressed beyond the collapse point. Instead of forming 3D aggregates as in the typical collapsed state, the monolayer appears to be corrugated. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and X-ray standing waves confirm these findings. The diffraction pattern for the monolayer in a new state is represented by the unclosed diffraction rings with maxima near the sample horizon. This diffraction pattern is quantitatively reproduced in the numerical simulations by assuming the corrugated monolayer. The details of the conditions under which these corrugated Langmuir monolayers were observed and the analysis of the diffraction data are described.</description>

      <title>When Theory Meets Experiment: What Does it Take to Accurately Predict $^1$H NMR Dipolar Relaxation Rates in Neat Liquid Water from Theory?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12545v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we compute the $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rate of liquid water at ambient conditions. We are using structural and dynamical information from Coupled Cluster Molecular Dynamics (CCMD) trajectories generated at CCSD(T) electronic structure accuracy while considering also nuclear quantum effects in addition to consulting information from X-ray and neutron scattering experiments. Our analysis is based on a recently presented computational framework for determining the frequency-dependent NMR dipole-dipole relaxation rate of spin $1/2$ nuclei from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, which allows for an effective disentanglement of its structural and dynamical contributions, and is including a correction for finite-size effects inherent to MD simulations with periodic boundary conditions. A close to perfect agreement with experimental relaxation data is achieved if structural and dynamical informations from CCMD trajectories are considered including a re-balancing of the rotational and translational dynamics, according to the product of the self-diffusion coefficient and the reorientational correlation time of the H-H vector $D_0\times\tau_\mathrm{HH}$. The simulations show that this balance is significantly altered when nuclear quantum effects are taken into account. Our analysis suggests that the intermolecular and intramolecular contribution to the $^1$H NMR relaxation rate of liquid water are almost similar in magnitude, unlike to what was predicted earlier from classical MD simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the simplicity of the water molecule, the kinetics of ice nucleation under natural conditions can be complex. We investigated spontaneously grown ice nuclei using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and found significant differences between the kinetics of ice formation through spontaneously formed and ideal nuclei. Since classical nucleation theory can only provide a good description of ice nucleation in ideal conditions, we propose a generalized nucleation theory that can better characterize the kinetics of ice crystal nucleation in general conditions. This study provides an explanation on why previous experimental and computational studies have yielded widely varying critical nucleation sizes.</description>

      <title>Features of the Contact Angle Hysteresis at the Nanoscale: A Molecular Dynamics Insight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of a three-phase contact line between gas, liquid, and solid is important for numerous applications. At the macroscale, the three-phase contact line response to an external force action is often characterized by a contact angle hysteresis, and several models are presented in the literature for its description. Yet, there is still a need for more information about such model applications at the nanoscale. In this study, a molecular dynamics approach was used to investigate the shape of a liquid droplet under an external force for different wetting regimes. In addition, an analytic model for describing the droplet shape was developed. It gives us the possibility to evaluate the receding and advancing wetting angle accurately. With our modeling, we found that the interplay between capillary forces and viscous forces is crucial to characterize the droplet shape at the nanoscale. In this frame, the importance of the rolling movement of the interface between liquid and vapor was pointed out. We also demonstrate that in the range of the external forces when capillary forces are most significant compared to others, hysteresis is well described by the macroscale Cox-Voinov model.</description>

      <title>Comparison of time-of-flight with MIEZE spectroscopy of H$_2$O: Necessity to go beyond the spin-echo approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we discuss the comparability of data acquisitioned with the Modulation of IntEnsity with Zero Effort data, a neutron spin-echo (NSE) technique to neutron Time-of-Flight (ToF) spectroscopy data. As a NSE technique MIEZE records the intermediate scattering function $\mathcal{I}(Q, \tau)$ making it necessary to perform a Fourier transform to directly compare it to $S(Q, E)$, measured by ToF spectroscopy. Transforming either data set into the complementary parameter space requires detailed knowledge of detector efficiency, instrumental resolution, and background. We discuss these aspects by comparing measurements on pure water performed on the spectrometers RESEDA and TOFTOF under the same experimental conditions. Additionally, we discuss the data evaluation of spin-echo data beyond the SE approximation, which limits these techniques to small energy transfers. Furthermore, computational methods like molecular dynamics simulations are essential for understanding these processes and will become increasingly important as we study more complex systems.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic wetting transition: beyond lubrication theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dip-coating geometry, where a solid plate is withdrawn from or plunged into a liquid pool, offers a prototypical example of wetting flows involving contact-line motion. Such flows are commonly studied using the lubrication approximation approach which is intrinsically limited to small interface slopes and thus small contact angles. Flows for arbitrary contact angles, however, can be studied using a generalized lubrication theory that builds upon viscous corner flow solutions. Here we derive this generalized lubrication theory for viscoelastic liquids that exhibit normal stress effects and are modelled using the second-order fluid model. We apply our theory to advancing and receding contact lines in the dip-coating geometry, highlighting the influence of viscoelastic normal stresses for contact line motion at arbitrary contact angle.</description>

      <title>Designing complex behaviors using transition-based allosteric self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Allosteric interactions occur when binding at one part of a complex affects the interactions at another part. Allostery offers a high degree of control in multi-species processes, and these interactions play a crucial role in many biological and synthetic contexts. Leveraging allosteric principles in synthetic systems holds great potential for designing materials and systems that can autonomously adapt, reconfigure, or replicate. In this work we establish a basic allosteric model and develop an intuitive design process, which we demonstrate by constructing systems to exhibit four different complex behaviors: controlled fiber growth, shape-shifting, sorting, and self-replication. In order to verify that the systems evolve according to the pathways we have developed, we also calculate and measure key length and time scales. Our findings demonstrate that with minimal interaction rules, allosteric systems can be engineered to achieve sophisticated emergent behaviors, opening new avenues for the design of responsive and adaptive materials.</description>

      <title>Poisson quadrature method of moments for 2D kinetic equations with velocity of constant magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with kinetic equations with velocity of constant magnitude. We propose a quadrature method of moments based on the Poisson kernel, called Poisson-EQMOM. The derived moment closure systems are well defined for all physically relevant moments and the resultant approximations of the distribution function converge as the number of moments goes to infinity. The convergence makes our method stand out from most existing moment methods. Moreover, we devise a delicate moment inversion algorithm. As an application, the Vicsek model is studied for overdamped active particles. Then the Poisson-EQMOM is validated with a series of numerical tests including spatially homogeneous, one-dimensional and two-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>NEP-MB-pol: A unified machine-learned framework for fast and accurate prediction of water's thermodynamic and transport properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Water's unique hydrogen-bonding network and anomalous properties pose significant challenges for accurately modeling its structural, thermodynamic, and transport behavior across varied conditions. Although machine-learned potentials have advanced the prediction of individual properties, a unified computational framework capable of simultaneously capturing water's complex and subtle properties with high accuracy has remained elusive. Here, we address this challenge by introducing NEP-MB-pol, a highly accurate and efficient neuroevolution potential (NEP) trained on extensive many-body polarization (MB-pol) reference data approaching coupled-cluster-level accuracy, combined with path-integral molecular dynamics and quantum-correction techniques to incorporate nuclear quantum effects. This NEP-MB-pol framework reproduces experimentally measured structural, thermodynamic, and transport properties of water across a broad temperature range, achieving simultaneous, fast, and accurate prediction of self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. Our approach provides a unified and robust tool for exploring thermodynamic and transport properties of water under diverse conditions, with significant potential for broader applications across research fields.</description>
