      <title>Eliminating the irregular surface layer of anodically-grown Ni-Ti-O nanopore arrays in a two-stage anodization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanopores (NPs) grown by anodizing can be partially hidden beneath a relatively compact surface oxide layer, which limits the volumetric surface area of these nanostructures. In this work, nitinol (NiTi) alloy was anodized in an electrolyte containing ethylene glycol, water, and sodium chloride in static and stirred electrolyte stages with the aim of removing the irregular surface array while achieving a thick NP layer. Electron micrographs showed that anodization in the static electrolyte provides a controlled thickness of NP layers covered by an irregular surface layer. In contrast, anodizing in the stirred electrolyte reduced the thickness and the degree of irregularity, which were controlled by the different kinetics of dissolution at the tops, perimeters and bottoms of NPs. To benefit simultaneously from the thickness and regularity of the oxide layers, two-stage anodizing under static and then stirred electrolyte conditions was found to be effective. Following a 30 min anodization in the static electrolyte, anodizing for 30 min under the stirred conditions provided the highest regularity in the oxide array, resulting in NPs of almost 40 nm and 11 {\mu}m in diameter and layer thickness, respectively. Two-stage anodizing under static then stirred electrolyte conditions is proposed in order to promote NP structures for applications demanding higher surface areas.</description>

      <title>Estimating Spatially Resolved Radiation Fields Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis on how to build and train neural networks to estimate the spatial distribution of scattered radiation fields for radiation protection dosimetry in medical radiation fields, such as those found in Interventional Radiology and Cardiology. Therefore, we present three different synthetically generated datasets with increasing complexity for training, using a Monte-Carlo Simulation application based on Geant4. On those datasets, we evaluate convolutional and fully connected architectures of neural networks to demonstrate which design decisions work well for reconstructing the fluence and spectra distributions over the spatial domain of such radiation fields. All used datasets as well as our training pipeline are published as open source in separate repositories.</description>

      <title>An AI-driven Assessment of Bone Density as a Biomarker Leading to the Aging Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As global population aging intensifies, there is growing interest in the study of biological age. Bones have long been used to evaluate biological age, and the decline in bone density with age is a well-recognized phenomenon in adults. However, the pattern of this decline remains controversial, making it difficult to serve as a reliable indicator of the aging process. Here we present a novel AI-driven statistical method to assess the bone density, and a discovery that the bone mass distribution in trabecular bone of vertebrae follows a non-Gaussian, unimodal, and skewed distribution in CT images. The statistical mode of the distribution is defined as the measure of bone mass, which is a groundbreaking assessment of bone density, named Trabecular Bone Density (TBD). The dataset of CT images are collected from 1,719 patients who underwent PET/CT scans in three hospitals, in which a subset of the dataset is used for AI model training and generalization. Based upon the cases, we demonstrate that the pattern of bone density declining with aging exhibits a consistent trend of exponential decline across sexes and age groups using TBD assessment. The developed AI-driven statistical method blazes a trail in the field of AI for reliable quantitative computation and AI for medicine. The findings suggest that human aging is a gradual process, with the rate of decline slowing progressively over time, which will provide a valuable basis for scientific prediction of life expectancy.</description>

      <title>Patient-specific prediction of regional lung mechanics in ARDS patients with physics-based models: a validation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The choice of lung protective ventilation settings for mechanical ventilation has a considerable impact on patient outcome, yet identifying optimal ventilatory settings for individual patients remains highly challenging due to the inherent inter- and intra-patient pathophysiological variability. In this validation study, we demonstrate that physics-based computational lung models tailored to individual patients can resolve this variability, allowing us to predict the otherwise unknown local state of the pathologically affected lung during mechanical ventilation. For seven ARDS patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation, physics-based, patient-specific lung models were created using chest CT scans and ventilatory data. By numerically resolving the interaction of the pathological lung with the airway pressure and flow imparted by the ventilator, we predict the time-dependent and heterogeneous local state of the lung for each patient and compare it against the regional ventilation obtained from bedside monitoring using Electrical Impedance Tomography. Excellent agreement between numerical simulations and experimental data was obtained, with the model-predicted anteroposterior ventilation profile achieving a Pearson correlation of 96% with the clinical reference data. Even when considering the regional ventilation within the entire transverse chest cross-section and across the entire dynamic ventilation range, an average correlation of more than 81% and an average root mean square error of less than 15% were achieved. The results of this first systematic validation study demonstrate the ability of computational models to provide clinically relevant information and thereby open the door for a truly patient-specific choice of ventilator settings on the basis of both individual anatomy and pathophysiology.</description>

      <title>Dual-Input Dynamic Convolution for Positron Range Correction in PET Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00587v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positron range (PR) blurring degrades positron emission tomography (PET) image resolution, particularly for high-energy emitters like gallium-68 (68 Ga). We introduce Dual-Input Dynamic Convolution (DDConv), a novel computationally efficient approach trained with voxel-specific PR point spread functions (PSFs) from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and designed to be utilized within an iterative reconstruction algorithm to perform PR correction (PRC). By dynamically inferring local blurring kernels through a trained convolutional neural network (CNN), DDConv captures complex tissue interfaces more accurately than prior methods. Additionally, it also computes the transpose operator, ensuring consistency within iterative PET reconstruction. Comparisons with a state-of-the-art, tissue-dependent correction confirm the advantages of DDConv in recovering higher-resolution details in heterogeneous regions, including bone-soft tissue and lung-soft tissue boundaries. Experiments across digital phantoms and MC-simulated data show that DDConv offers near-MC accuracy and outperforms the state-of-the-art technique, namely spatially-variant and tissue-dependent (SVTD), especially in areas with complex material interfaces. Results from real phantom experiments further confirm DD-Conv's robustness and practical applicability: while both DD-Conv and SVTD performed similarly in homogeneous soft-tissue regions, DDConv provided more accurate activity recovery and sharper delineation at heterogeneous lung-soft tissue interfaces.

      <title>Multiscale modeling of blood circulation with cerebral autoregulation and network pathway analysis for hemodynamic redistribution in the vascular network with anatomical variations and stenosis conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cerebral hemodynamics is fundamentally regulated by the Circle of Willis (CoW), which redistributes flow through communicating arteries to stabilize perfusion under anatomical variations and vascular stenosis. In this study, we develop a multiscale circulation model by coupling a systemic hemodynamic framework with a cerebral arterial network reconstructed from medical imaging. The model incorporates a cerebral autoregulation mechanism (CAM) and enables quantitative simulation of flow redistribution within the CoW under normal, anatomically varied, and stenotic conditions. Baseline simulations reproduce physiological flow distributions in which communicating arteries remain nearly inactive, showing negligible cross-flow and agreement with clinical measurements. In contrast, anatomical variations reveal distinct collateral activation patterns: the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) emerges as the earliest and most sensitive functional collateral, whereas the posterior communicating arteries (PCoAs) exhibit structure-dependent engagement. Progressive stenosis simulations further demonstrate a transition from a complete CoW to a fetal-type posterior cerebral artery (PCA) configuration, characterized by early ACoA flow reversal followed by ipsilateral PCoA activation, consistent with experimental and transcranial Doppler observations. Finally, a path-based quantitative analysis is introduced to illustrate how the cerebral vascular network dynamically reconfigures collateral pathways in response to structural changes. Overall, the proposed framework provides a physiologically interpretable, image-informed tool for investigating cerebral flow regulation through functional collaterals within the CoW, with potential applications in the diagnosis and treatment planning of cerebrovascular diseases.</description>
