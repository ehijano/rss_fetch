      <title>Time-resolved Electron Momentum Spectroscopy with Ultrashort Electron Pulses: Confined Probing and Effects of Vacuum Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous theoretical studies have shown that attosecond electron dynamics can, in principle, be captured in electron momentum spectroscopy (EMS) using ultrashort electron pulses. By including further analytical considerations on the scattering probability, we here study the effect of the finite transversal extend of the projectile electron wave packet. We find that in wave packet scattering, the target momentum distribution is probed solely in a finite spatial region. This is evident from a spatially filtering Gabor transform appearing in the scattering probability, replacing the full momentum wave function appearing in the conventional plane wave treatment. In addition, by spatially shifting the target with regard to the wave packet focus, we illustrate the influence of vacuum dispersion, i.e., the spatial broadening of the wave packet as it propagates. Our findings are significant for the possibility to correctly interpret future attosecond-EMS results and the considered effects reflect fundamental aspects of wave packet scattering. The EMS setup may, therefore, constitute a useful framework for understanding scattering with finite wave packets.</description>

      <title>The hyperfine interaction as a probe of the microscopic structure of the atomic nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of highly charged electronic and muonic hydrogen-like ions, provides an intriguing way to probe the internal structure of their atomic nuclei. In this work, we use nuclear structure calculations to accurately calculate the hyperfine splitting of electronic and muonic hydrogen-like ions, focusing in particular on the incorporation of finite-volume corrections, such as Bohr-Weisskopf and Breit-Rosenthal, due to the penetration of the electron and muon wavefunction into the nuclear electric charge and magnetic dipole densities. These corrections are essential for refining our understanding of the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments. Our simulations use a Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-BCS model known for its effectiveness in modeling well-deformed nuclei such as ${}^{159}\mathrm{Tb}^{64+}$ and ${}^{165}\mathrm{Ho}^{66+}$, with particular emphasis on ${}^{161,163}\mathrm{Dy}^{65+}$ isotopes. It can also be generalised to multi-electron ions by studying the hyperfine anomaly between two isotopes.</description>

      <title>Rydberg states with a liquid core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a self-consistent approach that provides an explicit potential for a Rydberg electron whose ionic core consists of a polarizable medium, typically realized with superfluid droplets. The electron's motion remains separable in spherical coordinates, but the radial force exerted by the droplet breaks degeneracy of the angular momentum states non-perturbatively. The ensuing electron spectrum reveals intriguing properties dependent on droplet size and electron excitation. Deviations of the polarizable medium from the continuous spherical distribution can be taken into account as a perturbation of this redefined Rydberg dynamics. We discuss specific but paradigmatic examples for superfluid helium and also propose a way to probe droplet properties including its possible crystallized fraction through stimulated transitions of the Rydberg electron.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to Adiabaticity via Adaptive Quantum Zeno Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum Zeno dynamics arising from monitoring a time-dependent projector. Starting from a stroboscopic measurement protocol, it is shown that the effective Hamiltonian for Zeno dynamics involves a nonadiabatic geometric connection that takes the form of the Kato-Avron Hamiltonian for parallel transport, stirring the evolution within the time-dependent Zeno subspace. The latter reduces to counterdiabatic driving when projective measurements are performed in the instantaneous energy eigenbasis of the quantum system. The effective Zeno Hamiltonian can also be derived in the context of continuous quantum measurements of a time-dependent observable and the non-Hermitian evolution with a complex absorbing potential varying in time. Our results thus provide a unified framework for realizing shortcuts to adiabaticity via adaptive quantum Zeno measurements.</description>

      <title>Collective light shifts of many longitudinal cavity modes induced by coupling to a cold-atom ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally study the interaction between a cold atom cloud and many longitudinal modes of a high quality Fabry-Perot cavity, by measuring signatures of collective light shifts in the cavity transmission spectrum of an optical frequency comb probe. Using a resonator coupled to more than $10^5$ intracavity atoms, we detect significant shifts of $\sim 100$ cavity modes simultaneously, which is a direct manifestation of physics beyond the hitherto explored regime of cavity-cold atom interaction with only single or few longitudinal modes at a time. For the cavity mode closest to the atomic resonance, we demonstrate a bistability in the transmission spectrum, arising due to a combined coupling of the cloud to an external pump laser and a cavity mode probed by the optical frequency comb. These results provide a first step toward deeper exploration of multifrequency cavity quantum electrodynamics, where ultrashort pulsed sources could be used for optical manipulation, cooling and entanglement of cold atoms in a resonator.</description>

      <title>A fast, large-scale optimal transport algorithm for holographic beam shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport methods have recently established state of the art accuracy and efficiency for holographic laser beam shaping. However, use of such methods is hindered by severe $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ memory and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ time requirements for large scale input or output images with $N$ total pixels. Here we leverage the dual formulation of the optimal transport problem and the separable structure of the cost to implement algorithms with greatly reduced $\mathcal{O}(N)$ memory and $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N^{3/2})$ time complexity. These algorithms are parallelizable and can solve megapixel-scale beam shaping problems in tens of seconds on a CPU or seconds on a GPU.</description>
