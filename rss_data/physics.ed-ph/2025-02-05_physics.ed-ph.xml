      <title>Adding an Einsteinian motivation to key discussions in an electromagnetism course</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to provide physics teachers with tools to help deepen the understanding of the laws of electromagnetism. The fundamental contributions of our proposal are: a) to use quotes from mythical characters in the history of science as a motivating educational resource; b) to promote the discussion of striking and fundamental topics; c) to mention diverse approaches and stimulate the search for correct answers to provocative questions. Citations from Einstein refer to principal contributions made by Newton, Maxwell and himself. Emphasis is placed on the cognitive value of differential (local, infinitesimal) analysis of fundamental concepts (field structure, causality, field relativistic transformations). The unity of electromagnetism is analyzed from the point of view of special relativity. It is clarified that descriptions suggesting that the magnetic field is dispensable are contrary to the Einstenian approach: they assume that, to describe the interaction between moving charges, there is a preferred coordinate system for each particular problem. An introductory presentation of the tensor form of Maxwell equations is provided.</description>

      <title>Active Learning Through Flexible Collaborative Exams: Improving STEM Assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-stage exams, which pair a traditional individual exam with a subsequent collaborative exam, are widely popular with both students and faculty for fostering deep engagement, collaboration, and immediate feedback. Over the last decade, this assessment model has gained substantial traction in STEM college courses; however, holding both stages during class sessions often limits the full potential of two-stage exams, deterring many instructors from adopting them. To accommodate these constraints, instructors must either reduce the exam's content depth and coverage, or hold evening, in-person exam sessions at fixed times, which can often be impractical for students and faculty with external commitments. In this paper, we introduce an alternative asynchronous approach that allows the collaborative portion to be completed unsupervised and outside of regular class hours, within 48 hours of the individual exam. This method not only eases logistical constraints but also allows more time for collaboration, potentially enhancing feedback quality. Our findings show that students equate their engagement, collaboration, and feedback quality during the asynchronous collaborative exam with that of standard in-class exams and show signs of retention of learning. This cost-effective approach requires no extra time or resources and could promote widespread adoption of this effective assessment method, especially in online-only and general STEM courses.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Education in Latin America: Experiences and Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing is a rapidly advancing field facing a significant shortage of qualified experts, creating an urgent demand for skilled professionals. In Latin America, quantum education remains in its early stages, further exacerbating the regional talent gap due to deficiencies in educational infrastructure and limited financial support. This work presents the efforts of the Quantum Computing Research Group at Universidad Nacional de Colombia to integrate quantum computing into higher education using the European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies, which offers a standardized approach to defining competency requirements and assessing essential skills in the field. We propose introductory courses aligned with the frameworks guidelines, designed to meet industry standards and reach a broad audience. Additionally, we introduce supplementary resources, including team dynamics and evaluation methodologies, to enhance the educational ecosystem. These initiatives aim to create a sustainable and comprehensive quantum education model across Latin America, to close the regional skills gap, foster inclusivity, and prepare a diverse workforce to contribute innovative solutions on the global stage.</description>
