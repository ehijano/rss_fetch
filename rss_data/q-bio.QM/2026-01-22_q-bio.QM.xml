      <title>Fed-ComBat: A Generalized Federated Framework for Batch Effect Harmonization in Collaborative Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of multi-centric analyses is crucial for obtaining sufficient sample sizes and representative clinical populations in experimental studies. In this setting, data harmonization techniques are typically employed to address systematic biases and ensure the interoperability of the data. State-of-the-art harmonisation approaches are based on the statistical theory of random effect modeling, allowing to account for either linear of non-linear biases and batch effects. However, optimizing these statistical methods generally requires data centralization at some point during the analysis pipeline, therefore introducing the risk of exposing individual patient information while posing significant data governance issues. To overcome this challenge, in this paper we present Fed-ComBat, a federated framework for batch effect harmonization on decentralized data. Fed-ComBat enables the preservation of nonlinear covariate effects without requiring centralization of data and without prior parametric hypothesis on the variables to account for. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Fed-ComBat against a comprehensive panel of existing approaches based on the state-of-the-art ComBat, along with distributed and nonlinear variants. Our experiments are based on extensive simulated data, and on the analysis of multiple cohorts based on 7 neuroimaging studies comprising healthy controls (CI) and subjects with various disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our results show that in a federated settings, Fed-ComBat harmonization exhibits comparable results to centralized methods for both linear and nonlinear cases. On real data, harmonized trajectories of the thickness ofthe right hippocampus across lifespan measured on a set of 7 public studies show comparable results between centralized and federated models and are consistent with the literature when using a nonlinear model.

      <title>FBApro: A fast, simple linear transformation for diverse metabolic modeling tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint-based metabolic modeling is the predominant framework for simulating cellular metabolism. The central assumption of these models is that metabolism operates at a steady state, meaning that the production and consumption rates of each metabolite are balanced. This assumption imposes linear constraints on the fluxes of biochemical reactions. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), a fundamental method in the field, is formulated as an optimization problem maximizing a cellular objective (e.g., growth) over the resulting linear subspace of steady state fluxes. Many other methods in the field are expressed either as a modification to FBA, or use FBA as a black box within an algorithm. Here, we propose a simple and general alternative to optimization that, for any flux vector, finds the closest flux distribution within the steady-state subspace. This operation corresponds to an orthogonal projection that enforces the steady-state assumption. We further introduce extensions to handle cases involving unknown or fixed fluxes through modified projections and tailored affine subspaces. The overall approach is computationally efficient, does not require a cellular objective, and is easy to implement. We validate our method and its variants on both synthetic and experimental datasets, demonstrating their speed and utility for denoising and imputing metabolic flux data, and for predicting steady-state fluxes from more readily available types of data.
  Code availability: The code implementing FBApro is available at https://github.com/Singh-Lab/FBApro. All code required to reproduce the figures in the paper is available, although the data used must be sourced separately. The repository also contains toy models and examples.</description>

      <title>How high-resolution agent-based models can improve fundamental insights in tissue development and cell culturing methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental understanding of how cells physically interact with each other and their environment is key to understanding their organisation in living tissues. Over the past decades several computational methods have been developed to decipher emergent multi-cellular behaviors. In particular agent-based (or cell-based) models that consider the individual cell as basic modeling unit tracked in space and time enjoy increasing interest across scientific communities. In this article we explore a particular class of cell-based models, so-called Deformable Cell Models (DCMs), that allow to simulate the biophysics of the cell with high realism. After situating this model among other model types, We give an overview of past and recent DCM developments and discuss new simulation results of several applications covering in-vitro and in-vivo systems. Our goal is to demonstrate how such models can generate quantitative added value in biological and biotechnological problems.</description>

      <title>Karhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion-Based Residual Anomaly Map for Resource-Efficient Glioma MRI Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors is essential for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep learning is currently the state-of-the-art for brain tumor segmentation, yet it requires either large datasets or extensive computational resources that are inaccessible in most areas. This makes the problem increasingly difficult: state-of-the-art models use thousands of training cases and vast computational power, where performance drops sharply when either is limited. The top performer in the Brats GLI 2023 competition relied on supercomputers trained on over 92,000 augmented MRI scans using an AMD EPYC 7402 CPU, six NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs (48GB VRAM each), and 1024GB of RAM over multiple weeks. To address this, the Karhunen--Lo\`eve Expansion (KLE) was implemented as a feature extraction step on downsampled, z-score normalized MRI volumes. Each 240$\times$240$\times$155 multi-modal scan is reduced to four $48^3$ channels and compressed into 32 KL coefficients. The resulting approximate reconstruction enables a residual-based anomaly map, which is upsampled and added as a fifth channel to a compact 3D U-Net. All experiments were run on a consumer workstation (AMD Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, RTX 4060Ti (8GB VRAM), and 64GB RAM while using far fewer training cases. This model achieves post-processed Dice scores of 0.929 (WT), 0.856 (TC), and 0.821 (ET), with HD95 distances of 2.93, 6.78, and 10.35 voxels. These results are significantly better than the winning BraTS 2023 methodology for HD95 distances and WT dice scores. This demonstrates that a KLE-based residual anomaly map can dramatically reduce computational cost and data requirements while retaining state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Learning minimal representations of stochastic processes with variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic processes have found numerous applications in science, as they are broadly used to model a variety of natural phenomena. Due to their intrinsic randomness and uncertainty, they are, however, difficult to characterize. Here, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning approach to determine the minimal set of parameters required to effectively describe the dynamics of a stochastic process. Our method builds upon an extended $\beta$-variational autoencoder architecture. By means of simulated datasets corresponding to paradigmatic diffusion models, we showcase its effectiveness in extracting the minimal relevant parameters that accurately describe these dynamics. Furthermore, the method enables the generation of new trajectories that faithfully replicate the expected stochastic behavior. Overall, our approach enables the autonomous discovery of unknown parameters describing stochastic processes, hence enhancing our comprehension of complex phenomena across various fields.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Reveals the Local Cortical Morphology of Brain Aging in Normal Cognition and Alzheimers Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating brain age (BA) from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) provides a useful approach to map the anatomic features of brain senescence. Whereas global BA (GBA) summarizes overall brain health, local BA (LBA) can reveal spatially localized patterns of aging. Although previous studies have examined anatomical contributors to GBA, no framework has been established to compute LBA using cortical morphology. To address this gap, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN) that uses morphometric features (cortical thickness, curvature, surface area, gray/white matter intensity ratio and sulcal depth) to estimate LBA across the cortical surface at high spatial resolution (mean inter-vertex distance = 1.37 mm). Trained on cortical surface meshes extracted from the MRIs of cognitively normal adults (N = 14,250), our GNN identifies prefrontal and parietal association cortices as early sites of morphometric aging, in concordance with biological theories of brain aging. Feature comparison using integrated gradients reveals that morphological aging is driven primarily by changes in surface area (gyral crowns and highly folded regions) and cortical thickness (occipital lobes), with additional contributions from gray/white matter intensity ratio (frontal lobes and sulcal troughs) and curvature (sulcal troughs). In Alzheimers disease (AD), as expected, the model identifies widespread, excessive morphological aging in parahippocampal gyri and related temporal structures. Significant associations are found between regional LBA gaps and neuropsychological measures descriptive of AD-related cognitive impairment, suggesting an intimate relationship between morphological cortical aging and cognitive decline. These results highlight the ability of GNN-derived gero-morphometry to provide insights into local brain aging.</description>
