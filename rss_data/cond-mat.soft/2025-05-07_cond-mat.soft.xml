      <title>Ferroelectric Nematic and Smectic Liquid Crystals with Sub-Molecular Spatial Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of highly polar three ring rod-shaped compounds with a terminal thiophene ring have been synthesized and the physical properties of a subset are reported in detail. On cooling from the isotropic fluid, they directly transition to a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal (NF) phase that shows the strongest spatial correlations corresponding to 1/3 of the molecular length (L/3). The set of thiophene compounds reported here have ferroelectric polarizations about 20% larger than that of usual ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal materials. Such large polarization values are due to the ~20% larger mass densities of these thiophene compounds compared to most of the NF materials with short terminal chains. These unusual properties are consequences of tighter molecular packing due to the lack of flexible terminal chains. Below the NF phase, compounds with a single nitro or two cyano polar groups on the terminal benzene ring exhibit a so far never observed smectic phase with periodicity ~1/3 the molecular length. Based on our experimental results, we propose a model of this phase featuring antipolar packing of the molecules within the layers.</description>

      <title>Displacement and Stress Analysis of an Elastic Hollow Disk: Comparison with Strength of Materials' Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the stress distribution in a two-dimensional elastic disk under diametric loading, with a focus on enhancing the understanding of concrete and rock materials' mechanical behavior. The study revisits the Brazilian test and addresses its high shear stress issue near loading points by exploring the ring test, which introduces a central hole in the disk. Using dynamic elasticity theory, we derive stress distributions over time and extend the analysis to static conditions. This approach distinguishes between longitudinal and transverse wave effects, providing a detailed stress field analysis. By drawing parallels with curved beam theories, we demonstrate the applicability of dynamic elasticity theory to complex stress problems, offering improved insights into the stress behavior in elastic disks.</description>

      <title>Competitive Adsorption in Polymer Nanocomposites: The Molecular Weight and End-Group Effect Revealed by SANS and MD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding polymer adsorption at interfaces is essential for designing advanced polymer-based nanomaterials with tailored interfacial properties. Although adsorption significantly influences the macroscopic properties of polymer composites and thin films, a comprehensive understanding of molecular weight (MW)-dependent adsorption remains challenging and controversial, particularly in polydisperse polymer systems, due to the limitations of experimental approaches. We investigate competitive adsorption in bidisperse poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) melts and find that shorter chains preferentially adsorb onto nanoparticle surfaces. Experiments and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the high density of terminal hydroxyl groups in short PEG chains strengthens hydrogen bonding at the interface, driving enthalpy-driven adsorption despite identical polymer backbones. This leads to a densely packed interfacial layer that alters the conformation of longer chains. These findings highlight the critical role of end-group functionality in interfacial polymer behavior and provide new insights for tailoring nanocomposite properties.</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Predicting Polymer/Plasticizer Phase Behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasticisers (PLs) are small additives commonly incorporated into polymer composites to enhance processability and improve mechanical properties. Their effectiveness depends heavily on their miscibility within the polymer melt, yet isolating the influence of plasticiser properties, such as flexibility and geometry, remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the time consuming nature of experimental work and also from the presence of impurities and inconsistencies that often arise during synthesis and testing. Atomistic simulations face similar difficulties as phase separation can occur over microsecond timescales, which can be computationally expensive. In this work, we use a coarse-grained bead-and-spring model to screen plasticisers of varying flexibilities and geometries to build a pool-based active learning procedure which characterizes their design space and its effect on polymer/plasticiser miscibility. We perform an active learning cycle with a random forest model and an uncertainty/random hybrid query strategy to determine the miscibility behaviour of queried molecules. This is evaluated through computationally expensive, coarse-grained polymer/plasticiser simulations of a cis-(1,4)-polyisoprene melt filled with small hydrocarbon additives of varying sizes and rigidities. Through this, we are able to efficiently improve model performance in order to make predictions on the entire PL design space. Such findings enable us to determine a new set of general plasticiser design rules, suitable for non-polar molecules, which expands on our previous work. To further prove this, we perform atomistic simulations of polyisoprene/plasticiser systems which are approximately back-mapped from their coarse-grained equivalents. Our findings indicate that the polyisoprene/plasticiser phase behaviour, observed using the coarse-grained model for PLs in the absence of side chains, is valid.</description>

      <title>Nematic ordering via vertical stratification in drying clay nanotube suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaporative self-assembly offers a simple, cost-effective method for producing functional nanostructured materials. However, achieving tunable and ordered assemblies remains challenging, especially when working with complex building blocks like nanoparticles that exhibit significant shape and size polydispersity. In this study, starting from an aqueous suspension of a polydisperse sample of rod-like Halloysite nanotubes, we present a physical protocol for producing a high degree of orientational ordering in the final dried deposit. By placing a sessile droplet on a substrate heated to 50{\deg}C, self-induced Marangoni flows suppress the coffee-ring effect, enabling more uniform deposition of colloidal rods. Subsequently, the vertical stratification during evaporation leads to the segregation of particles by aspect ratio, with longer rods (aspect ratio&gt;=6.5) preferentially migrating to the top layers over the entire deposit. Since rods exceeding this threshold exhibit nematic ordering at high densities, the resulting top layer, spanning an area of the order of mm^2, displays a high degree of orientational order. Thus, our results highlight a robust strategy for engineering ordered structures from disordered colloidal suspensions despite the overall polydispersity of the system.</description>

      <title>Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy on dry Poly(vinyl alcohol)/Poly(vinylidene fluoride) blends reinforced with Nano-Graphene Platelets at combined pressure and temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poly(vinyl alcohol)/Poly(vinylidene fluoride) blends at mass ratio 3:1 with Nano - Graphene Platelet fillers constitute mechanically and thermally stable systems, which are used for developing piezoelectric devices. Blends host a fraction of water molecules absorbed by the poly(vinyl alcohol) phase. Dc conductivity and dielectric relaxation occur via fluctuation induced tunneling of electrons. Electric charge transport is affected by the glass transition of the polymer matrix and the rotational and translational dynamics of absorbed water molecules. In the present work, absorbed water was subtracted by annealing and pumping and, subsequently, dry blends were characterized by employing Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy at combined temperature and pressure states. Conductivity and relaxation obey fluctuation induced tunneling temperature dependencies. The corresponding activation energies and activation volumes reveal the role of absorbed polar water molecules on the tunneling current for macroscopic or localized electron transport.</description>

      <title>Barrier induced stalemate-consensus transition of self-propelled participants subject to majority rule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural or artificial barriers, such as the Himalayas, the Berlin Wall, or the Korean Demilitarized Zone, can significantly impede human migration. As a consequence, they may also hinder the dissemination of opinions within society, thereby contributing to divergent geopolitical landscapes and cultural developments. This raises a fundamental question: how do such barriers influence the opinion dynamics of mobile agents, such as human beings? In particular, can a barrier induce transitions in collective opinion states among spatially segregated groups? Here, we investigate the opinion dynamics governed by majority rule in a minimal model comprising self-propelled agents with binary opinions performing random walks within a closed space divided by a barrier. We focus on the conditions under which initially segregated clusters of agents with opposing opinions can reach consensus. Our results reveal the existence of a critical barrier size that marks a transition between stalemate and consensus states. Near this critical point, the relaxation time to reach consensus from an initial stalemate exhibits a power-law divergence. This barrier-induced stalemate-consensus transition in a simple agent-based model offers new insights into the role of physical or social barriers in shaping opinion dynamics and social structures.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics Modeling of Surface Diffusion Coupled with Large Deformation in 3D Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical and computational model that explores the behavior of a thin hydrated film bonded to a non-hydrated / impermeable soft substrate in the context of surface and bulk elasticity coupled with surface diffusion kinetics. This type of coupling can manifests as an integral aspect in diverse engineering processes encountered in optical interference coatings, tissue engineering, soft electronics, and can prove important in design process for the next generation of sensors and actuators, especially as the focus is shifted to systems in smaller lengthscales. The intricate interplay between solvent diffusion and deformation of the film is governed by surface poroelasticity, and the viscoelastic deformation of the substrate. While existing methodologies offer tools for studying coupled poroelasticity involving solvent diffusion and network deformation, there exists a gap in understanding how coupled poroelastic processes occurring in a film attached to the boundary of a highly deformable solid can influence its response. In this study, we introduce a non-equilibrium thermodynamics formulation encompassing the multiphysical processes of surface poroelasticity and bulk viscoelasticity, complemented by a corresponding finite element implementation. Our approach captures the complex dynamics between the finite deformation of the substrate and solvent diffusion on the surface. This work contributes valuable insights, particularly in scenarios where the coupling of surface diffusion kinetics and substrate elasticity is an important design factor.</description>

      <title>Recoverable strain in amorphous materials: the role of ongoing plastic events following initial elastic recoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recoverable strain is the strain recovered once a stress is removed from a body, in the direction opposite to that in which the stress had acted. To date, the phenomenon has been understood as being elastic in origin: polymer chains stretched in the direction of an imposed stress will recoil after the stress is removed, for example. Any unrecoverable strain is instead attributed to irreversible plastic deformations. Here we study theoretically strain recovery within the soft glassy rheology model, aimed at describing the rheology of elastoplastic yield stress fluids and amorphous soft solids. We consider a material subject to the switch-on of a shear stress that is held constant before later being set back to zero, after which the strain recovery is observed. After an initially fast recoil that is indeed elastic in nature, significant further strain recovery then occurs more slowly via the plastic yielding of elements with negative local stresses, opposite to that of the original shear. We elucidate the mechanism that underlies this behaviour, in terms of the evolution of the SGR model's population of elastoplastic elements. In particular, we show that the initial fast elastic recoil brings to a state of negative local stress those elements that had yielded during the forward straining while the load was applied. The subsequent delayed plastic yielding of these elements with negative stress is the origin of the slow ongoing strain recovery. In this way, counterintuitively, elements that had yielded plastically while the load was applied still contribute significantly to strain recovery after the sample is unloaded. This finding has important consequences for constitutive modeling, because such behaviour can only arise in a constitutive model that evolves a full distribution of local stresses (or multiple moments of such a distribution), rather than a single average stress.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of fibre networks is of great importance due to their appearance in a wide range of natural and industrial processes. These networks are particularly complex because their properties depend not only on the characteristics of individual fibres but also on their collective arrangements within the network. In this study, we investigate the case of nylon fibre aggregates that were generated in a turbulent von Karman flow. The key properties of these aggregates are characterized, including their three-dimensional structures, analysed through X-ray tomography, and their mechanical responses. The results are compared with those observed for aegagropilae, a natural fibre aggregate commonly found on the Mediterranean sea shore</description>

      <title>Computing Canonical Averages with Quantum and Classical Optimizers: Thermodynamic Reweighting for QUBO Models of Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general method to compute canonical averages for physical models sampled via quantum or classical quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). First, we introduce a histogram reweighting scheme applicable to QUBO-based sampling constrained to specific intervals of an order parameter, e.g., physical energy. Next, we demonstrate that the scheme can accurately recover the density of states, which in turn allows for calculating expectation values in the conjugate ensemble, e.g., at a fixed temperature. The method can thus be used to advance the state-of-the-art characterization of physical systems that admit a QUBO-based representation and that are otherwise intractable with real-space sampling methods. A case in point are space-filling melts of lattice ring polymers, recently mapped in QUBO form, for which our method reveals that the ring catenation probability is non-monotonic with the bending rigidity.</description>
