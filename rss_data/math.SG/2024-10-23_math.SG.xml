      <title>Simultaneous linear symplectic reduction and orbit fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a correspondence between the orbits of the group of linear symplectomorphisms of a real finite dimensional symplectic vector space in the complex Lagrangian Grassmannian and the Grassmannians of linear subspaces of the real symplectic vector space. Under this correspondence, orbit fibration maps whose fibers are holomorphic arc components correspond to fibrations from simultaneous linear symplectic reduction. We use this to compute the homotopy types of Grassmannians of linear subspaces of the symplectic vector space in the general case, recovering the observations of Arnold in the Lagrangian case, Oh-Park in the coisotropic case, and Lee-Leung in the symplectic case. Binary octahedral symmetries, symplectic twistor Grassmannians, and symmetries of Jacobi forms appear within this structure.</description>

      <title>Quantum spaces associated to mixed polarizations and their limiting behavior on toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X, \omega, J)$ be a toric variety of dimension $2n$ determined by a Delzant polytope $P$. As indicated in [40], $X$ admits a natural mixed polarization $\mathcal{P}_{k}$, induced by the action of a subtorus $T^{k}$. In this paper, we first establish the quantum space $\mathcal{H}_{k}$ for $\mathcal{P}_{k}$, identifying a basis parameterized by the integer lattice points of $P$. This confirms that the dimension of $\mathcal{H}_{k}$ aligns with those derived from K\"ahler and real polarizations. Secondly, we examine a one-parameter family of K\"ahler polarizations $\mathcal{P}_{k,t}$, defined via symplectic potentials, and demonstrate their convergence to $\mathcal{P}_{k}$. Thirdly, we verify that these polarizations $\mathcal{P}_{k,t}$ coincide with those induced by imaginary-time flow. Finally, we explore the relationship between the quantum space $\mathcal{H}_{k,0}$ and $\mathcal{H}_{k}$, establishing that ``$\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \mathcal{H}_{k,t} = \mathcal{H}_{k}$."</description>

      <title>Filtrations on equivariant quantum cohomology and Hilbert-Poincar\'e series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that Floer theory induces a filtration by ideals on equivariant quantum cohomology of symplectic manifolds equipped with a $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. In particular, this gives rise to Hilbert-Poincar\'e polynomials on ordinary cohomology that depend on Floer theory. En route, the paper develops structural properties of filtrations on three versions of equivariant Floer cohomology. We obtain an explicit presentation for equivariant symplectic cohomology in the Calabi-Yau and Fano settings.</description>

      <title>Family Floer mirror space for local SYZ singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04652v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a mathematically precise statement of the SYZ conjecture between mirror space pairs and prove it for any toric Calabi-Yau manifold with the Gross Lagrangian fibration. To date, it is the first time we realize the SYZ proposal with singular fibers beyond the topological level. The dual singular fibration is explicitly written and proved to be compatible with the family Floer mirror construction. Moreover, we discover that the Maurer-Cartan set of a singular Lagrangian is only a strict subset of the corresponding dual singular fiber. This responds negatively to the previous expectation and leads to new perspectives of SYZ singularities. As extra evidence, we also check some computations for a well-known folklore conjecture for the Landau-Ginzburg model.</description>

      <title>Filtrations on quantum cohomology from the Floer theory of $\mathbb{C}^*$-actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13026v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a filtration by ideals on quantum cohomology for symplectic manifolds with a Hamiltonian $S^1$-action that extends to a pseudoholomorphic $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. These spaces include all Conical Symplectic Resolutions, in particular all Quiver Varieties. In particular, we obtain a family of filtrations on singular cohomology for any Conical Symplectic Resolution, that is sensitive to the choice of $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. The symplectic form is rarely exact at infinity for these spaces, so substantial foundational work is carried out to rigorously define Floer theory, in particular symplectic cohomology. Using Floer theory, we construct a periodic persistence module, giving rise to a graded periodic barcode associated to the $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This encodes birth-death phenomena of Floer invariants. Our filtrations can be viewed as a Floer-theoretic analogue of Atiyah-Bott filtrations, arising from stratifying a manifold by gradient flowlines of a Morse-Bott function, but they are distinct from those and they can detect non-topological properties of the quantum product.</description>

      <title>Filtrations on quantum cohomology via Morse-Bott-Floer Spectral Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Morse-Bott-Floer spectral sequences, we describe a filtration by ideals on quantum cohomology for symplectic manifolds with a Hamiltonian $S^1$-action that extends to a pseudoholomorphic $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. These spaces include all Conical Symplectic Resolutions, in particular all Quiver Varieties. Our Morse-Bott-Floer spectral sequences give explicit descriptions of birth-death phenomena of the barcode of the persistence module associated to the $\mathbb{C}^*$-action, defined in our earlier paper. This paper contains the foundational work to rigorously construct a filtration on Floer complexes, announced in that earlier paper. We also include a substantial appendix on Morse-Bott-Floer theory, where a large part of the technical difficulties of the paper are dealt with. We compute a plethora of explicit examples, each highlighting various features, for Springer resolutions, ADE resolutions, and several Slodowy varieties of type A. We also consider certain Higgs moduli spaces, for which we compare our filtration with the well-known P=W filtration.</description>

      <title>$N=(2,2)$ superfields and geometry revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19079v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take a fresh look at the relation between generalised K\"ahler geometry and $N=(2,2)$ supersymmetric sigma models in two dimensions formulated in terms of $(2,2)$ superfields. Dual formulations in terms of different kinds of superfield are combined to give a formulation with a doubled target space and both the original superfield and the dual superfield. For K\"ahler geometry, we show that this doubled geometry is Donaldson's deformation of the holomorphic cotangent bundle of the original K\"ahler manifold. This doubled formulation gives an elegant geometric reformulation of the equations of motion. We interpret the equations of motion as the intersection of two Lagrangian submanifolds (or of a Lagrangian submanifold with an isotropic one) in the infinite dimensional symplectic supermanifold which is the analogue of phase space. We then consider further extensions of this formalism, including one in which the geometry is quadrupled, and discuss their geometry.</description>
