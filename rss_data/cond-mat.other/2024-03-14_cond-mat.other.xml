      <title>Isotope effects in supercooled H$_2$O and D$_2$O and a corresponding-states-like rescaling of the temperature and pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water shows anomalous properties that are enhanced upon supercooling. The unusual behavior is observed in both H$_2$O and D$_2$O, however with different temperature dependences for the two isotopes. It is often noted that comparing the properties of the isotopes at two different temperatures (i.e., a temperature shift) approximately accounts for many of the observations with a temperature shift of 7.2 K in the temperature of maximum density being the most well-known example. However, the physical justification for such a shift is unclear. Motivated by recent work demonstrating a corresponding-states-like rescaling for water properties in three classical water models that all exhibit a liquid-liquid transition and critical point (B. Uralcan, et al., J. Chem. Phys. 150, 064503 (2019)), the applicability of this approach for reconciling the differences in temperature- and pressure-dependent thermodynamic properties of H$_2$O and D$_2$O is investigated here. Utilizing previously published data and equations-of-state for H$_2$O and D$_2$O, we show that the available data and models for these isotopes are consistent with such a low temperature correspondence. These observations provide support for the hypothesis that a liquid-liquid critical point, which is predicted to occur at low temperatures and high pressures, is the origin of many of water's anomalies.</description>

      <title>Ghost Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) applications to Kardar-Parizi-Zhang (KPZ) equation with non-linear noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we modify the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation for growing surfaces to include the effect of surface tilt on the noise (that is have non-linearly coupled noise). We introduce ghost Martin-Siggia-Rose (gMSR) action for the KPZ equation with Faddeev-Popov ghosts to compute an auxiliary functional determinant. We integrate out the Faddeev-Popov ghosts to leading order and the auxiliary MSR Lagrange multiplierexactly to obtain and action for the height. We analyze it within the gaussian, meanfield and Landau free energy like approximations and find various instabilities to rough surfaces.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion flow in periodically modulated channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, topologically stabilized chiral magnetic textures with particle-like properties have so far primarily been studied statically. Here, we experimentally investigate the dynamics of skyrmion ensembles in metallic thin film conduits where they behave as quasi-particle fluids. By exploiting our access to the full trajectories of all fluid particles by means of time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr microscopy, we demonstrate that boundary conditions of skyrmion fluids can be tuned by modulation of the channel geometry. We observe as a function of channel width deviations from classical flow profiles even into the no- or partial-slip regime. Unlike conventional colloids, the skyrmion Hall effect can also introduce transversal flow-asymmetries and even local motion of single skyrmions against the driving force which we explore with particle-based simulations, demonstrating the unique properties of skyrmion liquid flow that uniquely deviates from previously known behavior of other quasi-particles.</description>
