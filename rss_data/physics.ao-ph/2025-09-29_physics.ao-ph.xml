      <title>Down-scale marine hydrodynamic analysis at the Norwegian coast -- the NORA-SARAH open framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offshore wave studies often assume Gaussian processes and homogeneous wave fields. However, as waves approach the shoreline, complex coastal topo-bathymetry induces transformations such as shoaling, refraction, diffraction, reflection, and breaking, leading to increased nonlinearity and site-specific wave characteristics. This complexity necessitates detailed site-specific studies for coastal infrastructure design and blue economy planning. This work presents a downscaling procedure for analyzing wave-structure interactions from offshore metocean conditions. The open-access NORA3 and NORA10EI hindcast databases define offshore sea states, which are propagated to nearshore regions using the phase-averaged wave model SWAN. The outputs inform phase-resolving simulations with the fully nonlinear potential flow solver REEF3D::FNPF, incorporating an Arbitrary Eulerian-Lagrangian (ALE) method to compute wave forces via Morisons formulation and to screen for extreme events. Extreme wave loads are further examined using the fully viscous Navier-Stokes solver REEF3D::CFD. A one-way hydrodynamic coupling (HDC) between the potential flow and viscous solvers ensures accurate information transfer. The proposed NORA-SARAH framework, integrating NORA databases with SWAN, REEF3D, ALE, and HDC, offers a robust approach for complex coastal environments. A case study in Southern Norway demonstrates its advantages over traditional significant wave height (Hs)-based or phase-averaged modeling practices, highlighting the necessity of this downscaling method.</description>

      <title>From spinning sea ice floes to ocean enstrophy spectra in the Marginal Ice Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying kinetic energy (KE) and enstrophy transfer, mixing, and dissipation in the Arctic Ocean is key to understanding polar ocean dynamics, which are critical components of the global climate system. However, in ice-covered regions, limited eddy-resolving observations challenge characterizing KE and enstrophy transfer across scales. Here, we use satellite-derived sea ice floe rotation rates to infer the surface ocean enstrophy spectra in the marginal ice zone. Employing a coarse-graining approach, we treat each floe as a local spatial filter. The method is validated with idealized sea ice-ocean simulations and applied to floe observations in the Beaufort Gyre. Our results reveal steepened spectral slopes at low sea ice concentrations, indicating enhanced mesoscale activity during the spring-to-summer transition. High-resolution simulations support these findings but overestimate enstrophy, highlighting a denser array of observations. Our two-dimensional spectral estimates are the first of their kind, providing a scalable approach for mapping Arctic Ocean characteristics.</description>

      <title>Climate change: across time and frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use continuous wavelet tools to characterize the dynamics of climate change across time and frequencies. This approach allows us to capture the changing patterns in the relationship between global mean temperature anomalies and climate forcings. Using historical data from 1850 to 2022, we find that greenhouse gases, and CO$_2$ in particular, play a significant role in driving the very low frequency trending behaviour in temperatures, even after controlling for the effects of natural forcings. At shorter frequencies, the effect of forcings on temperatures switches on and off, most likely because of complex feedback mechanisms in Earth's climate system.</description>

      <title>Accurate typhoon intensity forecasts using a non-iterative spatiotemporal transformer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclone (TC) intensity - particularly during periods of rapid intensification and rapid weakening - remains a challenge for operational meteorology, with high-stakes implications for disaster preparedness and infrastructure resilience. Recent advances in machine learning have yielded notable progress in TC prediction; however, most existing systems provide forecasts that degrade rapidly in extreme regimes and lack long-range consistency. Here we introduce TIFNet, a transformer-based forecasting model that generates non-iterative, 5-day intensity trajectories by integrating high-resolution global forecasts with a historical-evolution fusion mechanism. Trained on reanalysis data and fine-tuned with operational data, TIFNet consistently outperforms operational numerical models across all forecast horizons, delivering robust improvements across weak, strong, and super typhoon categories. In rapid intensity change regimes - long regarded as the most difficult to forecast - TIFNet reduces forecast error by 29-43% relative to current operational baselines. These results represent a substantial advance in artificial-intelligence-based TC intensity forecasting, especially under extreme conditions where traditional models consistently underperform.</description>

      <title>Generative AI-Downscaling of Large Ensembles Project Unprecedented Future Droughts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how droughts may change in the future is essential for anticipating and mitigating their adverse impacts. However, robust climate projections require large amounts of high-resolution climate simulations, particularly for assessing extreme events. Here, we use a novel dataset, multiple large-ensembles of Global Climate Models (GCMs), downscaled to 12km using generative AI, to quantify the future risk of meteorological drought across New Zealand. The ensembles consists of 20 GCMs, including two single-model initial condition large ensembles. The AI is trained to emulate a physics-based regional climate model (RCM) used in dynamically downscaling, and adds a similar amount of value as the RCM across precipitation and drought metrics. Marked increases in precipitation variability are found across all ensembles, alongside highly uncertain changes in mean precipitation. Future projections show droughts will become more intense across the majority of the country, however, internal variability and model uncertainty obscure future changes in drought durations and frequency across large portions of the country. This uncertainty is understated using a smaller number of dynamically-downscaled simulations. We find evidence that extreme droughts up to twice as long as those found in smaller ensembles, could occur across the entirety of the country in the current climate, highlighting the value of long-duration downscaled simulations to sample rare events. These extremely long droughts increase in length in many locations under a high emissions SSP3-7.0 scenario giving rise to events around 30 months long in some locations.</description>

      <title>Impact of Non-Classical Gravity-Wave Dynamics on Middle-Atmosphere Mean Flow and Solar Tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional gravity-wave (GW) parameterizations neglect three aspects of GW dynamics. Instead of momentum and entropy fluxes they use Eliassen-Palm fluxes, thereby neglecting the possibility that resolved flow are not in geostrophic and hydrostatic balance. They neglect the transience of the GW field and of the resolved flow, by determining at every time step equilibrium profiles of GW fluxes that would result if the vertical GW propagation were instantaneous. Moreover, they also do not take into account lateral GW propagation and horizontal GW fluxes. Because the prognostic GW model MS-GWaM does not need to make these assumptions, it has been used in the global weather and climate code ICON to investigate their consequences for the simulation of monthly mean zonal mean flows and of solar tides. All three aspects are found to influence the simulation results significantly. Among those, transience and lateral propagation have the strongest impact. The mean circulation in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere is affected at all latitudes and in the stratosphere at high altitudes as well. This together with the directly modified GW forcing leads also to significant differences in the migrating and nonmigrating components of solar tides. Comparisons with tides retrieved from satellite data are most favorable if both aspects are taken into account. This argues for a correspondingly generalized treatment of GW dynamics in their parameterization, as an efficient alternative to GW permitting simulations.</description>

      <title>Toward a digital twin of the Great Barrier Reef: impact of extreme model resolution on tidal simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coral reefs are topologically complex environments with a large variation over small spatial-scales. The availability of high resolution data (metre-scale) to study these environments has increased rapidly such that many researchers are actively engaged in creating a `digital twin' of these environments to aid protection and management. However, as with any model, a digital twin will only be as useful as the data used to create it. Previous numerical modelling work on coral reefs has been carried out at a range of resolutions from 10s to 1000s of metres, but to date there has been no comprehensive study on the impact of extreme model resolution at metre-scale. Here, we simulate the Capricorn Bunker region of the GBR in a high resolution, multi-scale model using grid scales of 20,000 m to 5 m and compare that to the models with minimum grid scales of 250 m and 50 m. It is shown that the observable physical processes are best simulated at extremely high resolutions, though the intermediate resolution model performs well also. The low resolution model, whilst using a resolution comparable to a number of previous studies, does not sufficiently capture local-scale processes. Numerical models play a vital role in creating a digital twin of coastal seas as they contain the mathematical representation of the biophysical and chemical processes present but are currently at a coarser resolution than satellite and bathymetric data on which digital twins could be based. Bridging this resolution gap remains a challenge.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the Future with Yesterday's Climate: Temperature Bias in AI Weather and Climate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-based climate and weather models have rapidly gained popularity, providing faster forecasts with skill that can match or even surpass that of traditional dynamical models. Despite this success, these models face a key challenge: predicting future climates while being trained only with historical data. In this study, we investigate this issue by analyzing boreal winter land temperature biases in AI weather and climate models. We examine two weather models, FourCastNet V2 Small (FourCastNet) and Pangu Weather (Pangu), evaluating their predictions for 2020-2025 and Ai2 Climate Emulator version 2 (ACE2) for 1996-2010. These time periods lie outside of the respective models' training sets and are significantly more recent than the bulk of their training data, allowing us to assess how well the models generalize to new, i.e. more modern, conditions. We find that all three models produce cold-biased mean temperatures, resembling climates from 15-20 years earlier than the period they are predicting. In some regions, like the Eastern U.S., the predictions resemble climates from as much as 20-30 years earlier. Further analysis shows that FourCastNet's and Pangu's cold bias is strongest in the hottest predicted temperatures, indicating limited training exposure to modern extreme heat events. In contrast, ACE2's bias is more evenly distributed but largest in regions, seasons, and parts of the temperature distribution where climate change has been most pronounced. These findings underscore the challenge of training AI models exclusively on historical data and highlight the need to account for such biases when applying them to future climate prediction.</description>

      <title>Instability of the halocline at the North Pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address the issue of stability for the near-inertial Pollard waves, as a model for the halocline in the region of the Arctic Ocean centered around the North Pole, derived in Puntini (2025a). Adopting the short-wavelength instability approach, the stability of such flows reduces to study the stability of a system of ODEs along fluid trajectories, leading to the result that, when the steepness of the near-inertial Pollard waves exceeds a specific threshold, those waves are linearly unstable. The explicit dispersion relation of the model allows to easily compute such threshold, knowing the physical properties of the water column.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Negative Commuting: Integrating Urban Design, Behavior, and Technology for Climate-Positive Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commuting contributes substantially to urban greenhouse gas emissions and represents a critical focus for climate mitigation efforts. This paper explores the multifaceted nature of commuting-related carbon dioxide emissions by analyzing the influence of urban form, socio-economic attributes, and individual behaviors. It reviews analytical approaches including structural equation modeling, multi-objective optimization, and agent-based simulations that have been employed to understand and mitigate emissions. Building on these insights, the paper develops a conceptual framework for carbon-negative commuting that integrates spatial planning, behavioral interventions, technological innovations, and carbon offsetting strategies. Case studies from diverse global contexts illustrate both the feasibility and challenges of implementing these interventions. The discussion highlights key trade-offs, equity considerations, and governance barriers while identifying co-benefits such as improved public health and urban resilience. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary research and adaptive policymaking to operationalize carbon-negative commuting and align urban mobility systems with global decarbonization goals.</description>

      <title>VISION: Prompting Ocean Vertical Velocity Reconstruction from Incomplete Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics, such as vertical velocity fields, from incomplete surface observations poses a critical challenge in Earth science, a field long hampered by the lack of standardized, analysis-ready benchmarks. To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising. Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research under data uncertainty. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/YuanGao-YG/VISION.</description>
