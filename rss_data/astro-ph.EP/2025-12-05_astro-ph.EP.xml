      <title>Resolving the terrestrial planet-forming region of HD 172555 with ALMA: I. Post-impact dust distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant impacts between planetary embryos are a natural step in the terrestrial planet formation process and are expected to create disks of warm debris in the terrestrial regions of their stars. Understanding the gas and dust debris produced in giant impacts is vital for comprehending and constraining models of planetary collisions. We reveal the distribution of millimeter grains in the giant impact debris disk of HD 172555 for the first time, using new ALMA 0.87 mm observations at $\sim$80 mas (2.3 au) resolution. We modeled the interferometric visibilities to obtain basic spatial properties of the disk, and compared it to the disk's dust and gas distributions at other wavelengths. We detect the star and dust emission from an inclined disk out to $\sim$9 au and down to 2.3 au (on-sky) from the central star, with no significant asymmetry in the dust distribution. Radiative transfer modeling of the visibilities indicates the disk surface density distribution of millimeter grains most likely peaks around $\sim$5 au, while the width inferred remains model-dependent at the S/N of the data. We highlight an outward radial offset of the small grains traced by scattered light observations compared to the millimeter grains, which could be explained by the combined effect of gas drag and radiation pressure in the presence of large enough gas densities. Furthermore, SED modeling implies a size distribution slope for the millimeter grains consistent with the expectation of collisional evolution and flatter than inferred for the micron-sized grains, implying a break in the grain size distribution and confirming an overabundance of small grains.</description>

      <title>Tighter constraints on the atmosphere of GJ 436 b from combined high-resolution CARMENES and CRIRES$^+$ observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to study the atmospheric properties of the warm Neptune GJ 436 b by combining a set of five transit events observed with the CARMENES spectrograph with one transit from CRIRES$^+$ so as to provide the most constrained results possible at high resolution. We removed telluric and stellar signals from the data using SysRem and potential planetary signals were investigated using the cross-correlation technique. Following standard procedures for undetected species, we performed injection recovery tests and Bayesian retrievals to place constraints on the detectability of the main near-infrared absorbers. In addition, we simulated ELT/ANDES observations by computing end-to-end in silico datasets with EXoPLORE. No molecular signals were detected in the atmosphere of GJ 436 b, which is consistent with previous studies. Combined CARMENES-CRIRES$^+$ injection-recovery and Bayesian retrieval analyses show that the atmosphere is likely covered by high-altitude clouds ($\sim$ $1$ mbar) at low and intermediate metallicities or, alternatively, is very metal-rich ($\gtrsim$ $900\times$ solar), which would suppress spectral features without invoking clouds. Simulations of ELT/ANDES observations suggest a boost by nearly an order of magnitude to the upper limit in the photon-limited regime, reaching $0.1$ mbar at $10$-$300\times$ solar metallicities. The joint analysis of all useful transit observations from CARMENES and CRIRES$^+$ provides the most stringent constraints to date on the atmospheric properties of GJ 436 b. Complementary CCF-based and retrieval approaches consistently indicate that the atmosphere is either cloudy or highly metal enriched. Any weak near-infrared absorption lines, if present, are likely to be below current detection limits. However, according to our simulations, these features may be revealed with ELT/ANDES even in single-transit observations.</description>

      <title>Fractal Aggregate Aerosols in the Virga Cloud Code II: Exploring the Effects of Key Cloud Parameters in Warm Neptune, Hot Jupiter and Brown Dwarf Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerosols and clouds are expected to be ubiquitous in exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres, where they can have a significant impact on transmission and emission spectra. The cloud code Virga is capable of quickly modeling cloud particle sizes as a function of altitude, and has recently been updated to include functionality for aggregates (ranging from very fluffy chains to compact fractals). We analyze the effect that these aggregates have on transmission spectra for typical warm Neptune and hot Jupiter environments, as well as their effect on emission spectra for an L-type brown dwarf, over the wavelength range 0.3 - 15 um. We find significant, measurable differences in spectra when particle shape is changed (particularly the shortest wavelengths where particle morphology strongly affects the scattering slope). We provide some intuitive rules for how non-absorbing aggregates impact spectra: when particle sizes are small compared to the wavelength of light, the most elongated and chain-like particles have the highest opacities. When particles are large, the inverse is true (the most compact shapes have the highest opacities). We present an explanation for these effects in terms of the dynamics of how the particles form and move through the atmosphere, as well as in terms of fundamental optics theory. Given the significant impact that particle shape can have on spectra, we strongly encourage the community to include shape as a free parameter in future case studies, atmospheric models, and retrievals.</description>

      <title>Separating flare and secondary atmospheric signals with RADYN modeling of near-infrared JWST transmission spectroscopy observations of TRAPPIST-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although TRAPPIST-1's temperate planets have the highest transmission signals of any known system, flares contaminate 50-70% of transits at the 1000 ppm level, far above 100 ppm secondary atmospheres. Efforts to mitigate flare contamination and assess impacts on radiation environments are each hampered by a lack of empirical spectral analysis and physics-based modeling. We present spectrotemporal analysis and radiative-hydrodynamic modeling of 5.5 hr of NIRISS and NIRSpec observations of 6 TRAPPIST-1 flares of 2.2-8.7x10^30 erg. Flare lines and continua are characterized using grid searches of RADYN beam-heating models spanning 10$^4\times$ in electron beam parameters. Best-fit models indicate these flares result from moderate-intensity beams with emergent electron fluxes of 10^12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 and energies $\leq$37 keV, although all models over-predict the Paschen jump. These models predict XUV, FUV, and NUV counterparts to the infrared peak fluxes of 8.9-28.9x10^27, 4.3-13.9x10^26, and 3.4-11.4x10^27 erg s^-1, respectively. Scaling the flare rate into the XUV suggests flaring contributes 1.35$_{-0.15}^{+2.0}\times$ quiescence yr$^{-1}$. We bin integrations of similar flare effective temperature to construct fiducial flare spectra from 2000-4500 K in order to develop separate empirical and RADYN-based mitigation pipelines. Both pipelines are applied to all 5.5 hr of R=10 data, resulting in maximum residuals from 1-2.8$\mu$m of 100-140 ppm and typical residuals of 54$\pm$14 and 65$\pm$17 ppm for the empirical and RADYN-based pipelines, respectively. Injection testing supports 3$\sigma$ detection capability for CO2 atmospheres with features of 150-250 ppm, with weak evidence (BF$\approx$3) still obtained at 130 ppm. Our results motivate multi-wavelength observations to improve model fidelity and test high-energy predictions.</description>

      <title>JWST Exoplanetary Worlds and Elemental Survey (JEWELS) I: High-Precision Chemical Abundances of 20 FGK Planet-Hosting Stars from JWST Cycle 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-precision chemical abundances for 20 FGK stars hosting planets observed in JWST Cycle 2 GO programs. Using high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise ratio spectra from the ESO and Keck archives, we perform a strict line-by-line differential analysis relative to the Sun to derive stellar parameters and abundances of 19 elements from C to Zn. The stars span effective temperatures of 4500-6500 K and metallicities from -0.57 to +0.50 dex. The sample includes hosts of both gas giants and terrestrial planets, allowing direct comparison between stellar composition and planetary properties. Several of the giant planets orbit metal-rich stars. The detailed abundance patterns show clear chemical diversity, including carbon-enhanced but mildly metal-poor stars (TOI-824, TOI-1130, GJ 9827) and $\alpha$-enhanced metal-poor stars (TOI-561, GJ 9827, TOI-824). These variations trace differences in protoplanetary disk composition and may influence planetary interiors and atmospheric chemistry. The planet-hosts show a range of [C/O] ratios, and the diverse [Mg/Si] ratios may suggest varied interior compositions for their rocky planets. This homogeneous stellar abundance, together with future uniform JWST planetary atmosphere measurements, provides a foundation for exploring the planet mass-metallicity relation and the connection between stellar chemistry and planetary formation pathways. These results constitute the first step in a larger survey spanning multiple JWST cycles to systematically examine how host star composition shapes exoplanetary systems.</description>

      <title>The GAPS programme at TNG LXXI. HD 128717 B/Gaia-6 B: a long-period eccentric low-mass brown dwarf from astrometry and radial velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition regime between giant planets (GPs) and brown dwarfs (BDs) is still an open subject of study in exoplanetary science. A complete understanding of the population of long-period GPs and BDs would be pivotal in understanding this topic, but the number of such objects with precisely measured orbital and physical parameters is still small. Moreover, their dynamical influence on smaller companions in inner orbits is still unclear. Within the GAPS programme, we aim to confirm and characterize sub-stellar companion candidates from Gaia DR3, and to study the potential presence of additional lower-mass planets in their systems. We present the results of an intensive high-precision RV monitoring of HD 128717, which hosts the astrometric candidate Gaia-ASOI-009. We used the HARPS-N spectrograph at TNG to collect a high-cadence RV time series of the target. We used MCMC analyses to refine the Gaia DR3 orbital solution of the companion and, finally, performed a combined model of RV and proper motion anomaly (PMa) to derive the complete 3-D orbit of the companion. We also ran a suite of numerical simulations to confirm our results. We confirm the sub-stellar nature of Gaia-ASOI-009, i.e. Gaia-6 B: from the combined RV+PMa fit, we confirm that it is a high-eccentricity low-mass brown dwarf with $P_\text{B} = 9.37^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ yr, $M_\text{B} = 19.8 \pm 0.5$ $M_\text{J}$, $e_\text{B}=0.85$, $i_\text{B} = 130^{\circ}$. The derived orbital solution differs significantly from the one published in Gaia DR3. Through a series of dedicated simulations, we demonstrate that this discrepancy arises from a degeneracy in the Gaia DR3 astrometric solution. Specifically, the combination of Gaia-6 B long orbital period and high eccentricity, both poorly constrained by the limited timespan of DR3, led to an incorrect solution characterized by a shorter period and lower eccentricity.</description>

      <title>The ejection velocities of interstellar objects signpost their progenitor system architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs) ejected from planetary systems carry kinematic signatures of their formation environments. The properties of these velocity distributions govern the ISOs' propagation and dynamical evolution in the Galactic potential. We investigate how planetary system architecture influences ISO production during post-gas-disc dynamical instabilities using N-body simulations. We explore the ISO production outcomes of 2461 randomly generated systems spanning total system masses of 300-800 Earth masses and multiplicities of 3-7 planets. By integrating planets embedded in a disc of test particles for 10 Myr, we find that evolving systems can be broadly divided into two distinct classes based on their initial architectures. Catastrophic systems are characterized by high multiplicities and orbitally compact configurations, or by high-mass planets in systems with large mass asymmetries. These systems eject a large fraction of their planetesimals (median 59 percent) and, depending on the ejection pathway, produce high-speed ISOs (median 2.9 km/s). In contrast, quiet systems have lower masses and multiplicities and do not undergo significant orbital rearrangement, yet still eject a median of 28 percent of planetesimals at lower velocities (median 1.6 km/s). This dichotomy points to distinct ejection pathways, involving either violent global instabilities or more gradual, diffusive processes. Overall, we find that ISO ejection velocities are typically low, on the order of a few km/s. Although ISOs subsequently experience dynamical heating as they orbit the Galaxy, their velocity distributions retain signatures of their progenitor systems' architectures and histories, underscoring the potential use of ISOs in Galactic archaeology.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Isotope Constraints on the Importance of Photochemical Processing in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations have revealed evidence of photochemical processing in protoplanetary disks. This processing occurs in the photon dominated layer, the optically thin regions of the disk high above the disk midplane. It remains unclear, however, how much this photochemical processing impacts the compositions of the planets and their building blocks within the disk. Here we use the oxygen isotopic compositions of Solar System solids, which has been attributed to photochemistry in the solar nebula, to quantitatively evaluate whether this processing could have produced the conditions needed to provide the diversity of compositions seen in the Solar System. We do this by modeling the chemical evolution while fine dust grows into the building blocks of the planets. We find that the oxygen isotopic evolution cannot be attributed to processing in the solar nebula and must instead be inherited from the parent molecular cloud. Further, our results indicate that the observed photochemical processing in protoplanetary disks does not significantly impact the compositions of planets that form within.</description>

      <title>Responsible Discovery in Astrobiology: Lessons from Four Controversial Claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines four case studies of life-detection claims in astrobiology, covering both biosignatures and technosignatures: the 1877 "canals" on Mars, the 1976 Mars Viking landers experiments, the 2020 phosphine detection on Venus, and the 2020 Breakthrough Listen Candidate 1 (BLC1) signal. We analyse the process of discovery for each case, including how they were detected, the media reception, the ensuing scientific debate, the correction processes, and the time it took until an expert consensus was reached. We identify lessons learned while providing scientists, the scientific community, and science communicators with recommendations for approaching future claims of astrobiological discoveries. To avoid potential cognitive biases and mitigate premature conclusions, we stress the need for clear communication of uncertainties, as well as thorough debate and verification processes among the scientific community. These responsible approaches can strengthen the credibility of scientists, cultivate a supportive scientific community, and help astrobiology flourish as a field.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of a Coronal Mass Ejection Leading Edge by Means of Multi-Spacecraft-in-Beam Phase Scintillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) was detected crossing the radio signals transmitted by the Mars Express (MEX) and Tianwen-1 (TIW) spacecraft at a solar elongation of $4.4^{o}$. The impact of the CME was clearly identifiable in the spacecraft signal SNR, Doppler noise and phase residuals observed at the University of Tasmania's Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) antenna in Ceduna, South Australia. The residual phases observed from the spacecraft were highly correlated with each other during the transit of the CME across the radio ray-path despite the spacecraft signals having substantially different Doppler trends. We analyse the auto- and cross-correlations between the spacecraft phase residuals, finding time-lags ranging between 3.18-14.43 seconds depending on whether the imprinted fluctuations were stronger on the uplink or the downlink radio ray-paths. We also examine the temporal evolution of the phase fluctuations to probe the finer structure of the CME and demonstrate that there was a clear difference in the turbulence regime of the CME leading edge and the background solar wind conditions several hours prior to the CME radio occultation. Finally, autocorrelation of the MEX two-way radio Doppler noise data from Ceduna and closed-loop Doppler data from ESA's New Norcia ground station antenna were used to constrain the location of the CME impact along the radio ray-path \add{to a region 0.2 AU from the Sun, at a heliospheric longitude consistent with CME origin at the Sun. The results presented demonstrate the potential of the multi-spacecraft-in-beam technique for studying CME structures in great detail, and providing measurements that complement the capabilities of future solar monitoring instruments.</description>

      <title>Long-term X-ray variability of the multiple-planet host L 98-59: Hints of an activity cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy irradiation in X-rays and UV (XUV) can transform the planetary atmospheres through photoevaporation and photochemistry. This is more crucial for M stars, whose habitable zones for Earth-like planets are located within a few percent of an AU. Transiting exoplanets around M dwarfs offer the opportunity to study their characteristics and habitability conditions. L 98-59 is an M3 dwarf hosting six Earth-like planets, with two of them in the habitable zone of the star. X-ray observations made in 2020 and 2021 detected significant flares above a quiescent luminosity of 4-10 x 10^26 erg/s. We present the results from two short XMM-Newton observations of L 98-59, which are part of a monitoring survey to detect long-term X-ray variability and activity cycles. In October 2024 the X-ray quiescent luminosity of the star was about 5.9 x 10^25 erg/s, and it was about 6.3 x 10^26 erg/s in February 2025. We speculate that in late 2024 the star had a minimum of activity; in 2021 the star was near a maximum of an activity cycle, and in 2025 it was at the middle of the cycle. We suggest a coarse estimate of the period of about 2 years and a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 10, which is the highest among the stars with a known X-ray cycle other than the Sun. We also infer that even the outer planet in the habitable zone, L 98-59f, is exposed to an X-ray dose between 100 and 1600 times the X-ray irradiation of the Earth in the XMM band.</description>

      <title>Geophysical intensity problems: the axisymmetric case</title>

Abstract: Considering the earth or any other celestial body the main sources of the gravitational as well as of the magnetic field lie inside the body. Above the surface both fields are in good approximation harmonic vector fields determined by their values at the body's surface or any other surface enclosing the body. The intensity problem seeks to determine harmonic vector fields vanishing at infinity and with prescribed intensity of the field at the surface. This problem constitutes a nonlinear boundary value problem, whose general solvability is not yet established. In this paper {\em axisymmetric} harmonic fields ${\bf H}$ outside the unit sphere $S^2$ are studied and, given an axisymmetric H\"older continuous intensity function $I\neq 0$ on $S^2$, the existence of infinitely many solutions of the intensity problem is proved. These solutions can more precisely be characterized as follows: fix a number $\de \in \nat\setminus \{1 \}$ and a meridional plane $M$ through the symmetry axis $S\!A$, and in $M$ a unit circle $S^1$ (symmetric with respect to $S\!A$) and, furthermore, $2\, N$, $N \in \nat_0$, points $z_n \in M$ (symmetric with respect to $S\!A$, avoiding $S\!A$, and outside $S^1$), then the existence of an (up to a sign) unique harmonic field ${\bf H}$ is established that vanishes at (the axisymmetric circles piercing $M$ at) $z_n$ and nowhere else, that has intensity $I$ at $S^2$ and (exact) decay order $\de$ at infinity. The proof is based on the solution of a nonlinear elliptic equation with discontinuous coefficients, which are, moreover, singular at the symmetry axis. Its combination with fixed boundary conditions was the basis of a recent treatment of the ``geomagnetic direction problem'' \cite{KR22}. Here we have instead natural boundary conditions, which provide less information, and which require, therefore, in part new solution techniques and sharper estimates.</description>

      <title>Global magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the inner regions of protoplanetary discs. I. Zero-net flux regime</title>

Abstract: The inner regions of protoplanetary discs, which encompass the putative habitable zone, are dynamically complex, featuring a well-ionised, turbulent active inner region and a poorly ionised `dead' outer region. In this first paper, we investigate a base-level model of the magnetohydrodynamic processes around the interface between these two regions, using five three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic simulations in the zero-net flux regime. We employ physically motivated profiles for Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion, alongside a simplified thermodynamic model comprising a cool disc and hot corona. Our results show that, first, large-scale coherent poloidal magnetic field loops form in the magnetorotational instability active region. These loops lead to the accumulation of tightly wound magnetic flux at the disc-corona temperature transition, driving strong, localised accretion flows in the surface layers of the active region. Second, an axisymmetric pressure maximum, extending across multiple disc scale heights, develops as a result of outward mass transport from the active region. This, in turn, triggers the Rossby wave instability and leads to the development of anticyclonic vortices. Third, the dead zone develops magnetic field with a distinct morphology, likely resulting from the outward diffusion of the large-scale poloidal loops in the active zone. This self-consistently generated field exhibits a vertical structure that can drive accretion in the inner dead zone via a weak magnetic-pressure wind. In the second paper in the series, we extend this work to the vertical-net flux regime, where global magnetic flux transport and magnetically driven outflows become dynamically significant.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRSpec Observations of Salacia-Actaea and M\'ani: Exploring Population-level Trends among Water-ice-rich Kuiper Belt Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present observations of the midsized Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) Salacia$-$Actaea and M\'ani, obtained with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph on JWST. The satellite Actaea was fully blended with Salacia at the spatial resolution of the integral field unit, and we extracted the combined spectrum. The 0.7$-$5.1 $\mu$m reflectance spectra of Salacia$-$Actaea and M\'ani display prominent water-ice absorption bands at 1.5, 2, 3, and 4$-$5 $\mu$m. The $\nu_{3}$ fundamental vibrational band of carbon dioxide ice at 4.25 $\mu$m is present in both spectra. From a quantitative band-depth analysis of the entire current JWST spectroscopic sample of water-ice-rich KBOs, we find strong evidence for a positive covariance between relative water-ice abundance and size, which may indicate the emergent impacts of internal differentiation and cryovolcanic production of surface water ice on midsized KBOs. A detailed look at the distribution of 2 and 3 $\mu$m band depths suggests additional sources of variability, such as different water-ice grain sizes. In addition, we report an apparent transition in the carbon dioxide band depth at object diameters of roughly 300$-$500 km, with larger objects showing systematically weaker absorptions, although selection effects within the sample do not allow us to confidently distinguish between a size-dependent phenomenon and a correlation with dynamical class.</description>

      <title>Silane-Methane Competition in Sub-Neptune Atmospheres as a Diagnostic of Metallicity and Magma Oceans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope is characterising the atmospheres of sub-Neptunes. The presence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes is expected to strongly alter the chemistry of their envelopes and observable atmospheres. At the magma ocean-envelope boundary (MEB, $&gt;$10 kbar), gas properties deviate from ideality, yet the effects of real gas behaviour on chemical equilibria remain underexplored. Here, we compute equilibrium between magma-gas and gas-gas reactions using real gas equations of state in the H-He-C-N-O-Si system for TOI-421b, a canonical hot sub-Neptune potentially hosting a magma ocean. We find that H and N are the most soluble in magma, followed by He and C. We fit real gas equations of state to experimental data on SiH$_4$, and show that, for a fully molten mantle, SiH$_4$ dominates at the MEB under accreted gas metallicity of 1$\times$ solar, but is supplanted by CH$_4$ at 100$\times$ solar. Lower mantle melt fractions lower both magma-derived Si abundances in the envelope and the solubility of H and He in magma, yielding H$_2$- and He-rich envelopes. Projecting equilibrium chemistry through the observable atmosphere (1 mbar-100 bar), we find that `clouds' of Si-bearing condensates strongly deplete Si-bearing gases, although SiH$_4$ remains key, especially when a solar gas is accreted. SiH$_4$/CH$_4$ and Si/C ratios increase with mantle melt fraction and decrease with accreted gas metallicity. The competition between SiH$_4$ and CH$_4$ is therefore diagnostic of metallicity and presence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes with equilibrium temperatures below 1000 K. The corollary is that H$_2$- and He-rich, SiH$_4$-deficient and CH$_4$-bearing observable atmospheres may indicate a limited role or absence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Cislunar Resonant Transport and Heteroclinic Pathways: From 3:1 to 2:1 to L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical structure of cislunar space beyond geosynchronous orbit is critical for both lunar exploration and for high-Earth-orbiting trajectories. In this study, we investigate the role of mean-motion resonances and their associated heteroclinic connections in enabling natural semi-major axis transport in the Earth-Moon system. Working within the planar circular restricted three-body problem, we compute and analyze families of periodic orbits associated with the interior 4:1, 3:1, and 2:1 lunar resonances. These families exhibit a rich bifurcation structure, including transitions between prograde and retrograde branches and connections through collision orbits. We construct stable and unstable manifolds of the unstable resonant orbits using a perigee-based Poincar\'e map, and identify heteroclinic connections - both between resonant orbits and with lunar $L_1$ libration-point orbits - across a range of Jacobi constant values. Using a new generalized distance metric to quantify the closeness between trajectories, we establish operational times-of-flight for such heteroclinic-type orbit-to-orbit transfers. These connections reveal ballistic, zero-$\Delta v$ pathways that achieve major orbit changes within reasonable times-of-flight, thus defining a network of accessible semi-major axes. Our results provide a new dynamical framework for long-term spacecraft evolution and cislunar mission design, particularly in regimes where lunar gravity strongly perturbs distant circumterrestrial orbits.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and dust fragility in protoplanetary discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dust growth from micron- to planet-size in protoplanetary discs involves multiple physical processes, including dust collisions, the streaming instability, and pebble accretion. Disc turbulence and dust fragility matter at almost every stage. Previous studies typically vary one of them while fixing the other, failing to provide a complete picture. Here, we use analytical models and numerical dust evolution models DustPy to study the combinations of gas turbulence and dust fragility that can reproduce multi-wavelength ALMA observables. We find that only appropriate combinations -- fragile dust (fragmentation velocity $v_\mathrm{frag}$= 1-2 m/s) in discs with viscous $\alpha=10^{-4}$ or resilient dust ($v_\mathrm{frag}$= 6-10 m/s) in discs with viscous $\alpha=10^{-3}$ -- can reproduce observations. Our result is robust to two widely used opacities (DSHARP and Ricci opacities). Regardless of the strength of disc turbulence, reproducing observations requires observed dust rings to be optically thick at $\lambda=1.3$ and $3$ mm. As only small dust can be lifted above the midplane to reach the emitting layers, SED analysis probably yields lower limits on the maximum grain sizes. We highlight the challenge of creating detectable dust rings at large radii when incorporating bouncing in models, and the need for earlier formation of dust rings at smaller radii to reproduce the decreasing ring brightness with radius observed across ALMA wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Finite Lifetime Fragment Model 4 for Striae Formation in the Dust Tails of Comets (FLM 4) Acceleration by Lorenz-force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The striations in the dust tails of comets are referred to as striae, and their origin has long been a mystery. We introduce a new dynamic model to describe the forms of the striae observed in comets Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1), West (C/1975 V1), and Seki-Lines (C/1962 C1). Charged particles made of refractory materials, with radii less than 0.5micrometer, are expelled from the comet's nucleus and accelerated by Lorentz forces near the nucleus. These particles decay many times to form striae, which have a lifespan of less than about 100 days at a distance of 1 astronomical unit from the sun. Over time, they continue to decay and eventually disappear from view. The following dynamic model explains these material science processes. Particles expelled from the comet's nucleus are subjected to three forces: solar gravity, solar radiation pressure, and Lorentz forces near the nucleus. As these particles decrease in size, the Lorentz forces and radiation pressure cause fluctuations, increasing and decreasing to form striae. This model, which is less of a dynamic approximation than previous theories (FLM3), explains the structure of the striae, enables predictions of their luminosity, and clarifies their origin.</description>

      <title>The Dependence of Earth Milankovitch Cycles on Martian Mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Milankovitch cycles of Earth result from gravitational interactions with other bodies in the Solar System. These interactions lead to slow changes in the orbit and angular momentum vector of Earth, and correspondingly influence Earth's climate evolution. Several studies have shown that Mars may play a significant role in these Milankovitch cycles, such as the 2.4 Myr eccentricity cycle related to perihelion precession dynamics. Here we provide the results of a detailed dynamical analysis that explores the Earth Milankovitch cycles as a function of the Martian mass to quantify the extent that Mars influences variations in Earth's orbital eccentricity, the longitude of perihelion, the longitude of the ascending node, and obliquity (axial tilt). Our results show that, although the 405 kyr long-eccentricity metronome driven by $g_2$ (Venus) and $g_5$ (Jupiter) persists at all Mars masses, the $\sim$100 kyr short-eccentricity bands driven by $g_4$ (Mars) lengthen and gain power as Mars becomes more massive, consistent with enhanced coupling among inner-planet $g$-modes. The 2.4 Myr grand cycle is absent when Mars approaches zero mass, reflecting the movement of $g_4$ with the Martian mass. Meanwhile, Earth's obliquity cycles driven by $s_3$ (Earth) and $s_4$ (Mars) lengthen from the canonical $\sim$41 kyr with increasing Mars mass, relocating to a dominant 45--55 kyr band when the mass of Mars is an order of magnitude larger than its present value. These results establish how Mars' mass controls the architecture of Earth's climate-forcing spectrum and that the Milankovitch spectrum of an Earth-like planet is a sensitive, interpretable probe of its planetary neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Enhanced magnetostrophic waves with magnetic field orthogonal to the rotation axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an isolated Gaussian velocity vortex perturbation in an otherwise quiescent, electrically conducting, and rotating fluid permeated by a uniform magnetic field $\bf{B}$. Studies suggest a presence of strong azimuthal wave motions on the timescale of centuries within the Earth's liquid outer core at higher latitudes. To understand these long-period oscillations, we focus on magnetostrophic waves, a slow component of magnetic-Coriolis waves with $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned with the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, which replicate the field lines in the azimuthal direction. We present an analytical solution to the magnetic-Coriolis wave equation in Cartesian coordinates. Later, with numerical solution, we validate our analytical estimates and show that magnetostrophic waves travel relatively faster along the magnetic field when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$ compared with the case when both are aligned. The study confirms that with a magnetic field $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned to the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, wave vectors satisfying the condition $\bf{\Omega}\cdot\bf{k} \approx 0$, travel with Alfv\'en velocities along the magnetic field lines as a component of inertial-Alfv\'en waves. The timescales on which Alfv\'en waves travel are relatively short, and it is also less likely that inertial-Alfv\'en waves will be sustained inside the core at higher latitudes \citep{Davidson2017}. This study shows that, excluding the inertial-Alfv\'en waves contribution ($k_z\neq 0$), there exists intensified magnetostrophic wave propagation when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$, which can explain the strong periodic oscillations on the time scales of centuries along the azimuthal field at higher latitudes. Results show persistence of the magnetostrophic waves despite the lower Lehnert number $Le$, suggesting the plausible existence of a low-intensity azimuthal magnetic field in the Earth's core.</description>
