      <title>Horizon classification via Riemannian flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that the geometry of connected totally geodesic compact null hypersurfaces in Lorentzian manifolds is only slightly more specialized than that of Riemannian flows over compact manifolds, the latter mathematical theory having been much studied in the context of foliation theory since the work by Reinhart (1959). We are then able to import results on Riemannian flows to the horizon case, so obtaining theorems on the dynamical structure of compact horizons that do not rely on (non-)degeneracy assumptions. Furthermore, we clarify the relation between isometric/geodesible Riemannian flows and non-degeneracy conditions. This work also contains some positive results on the possibility of finding, in the degenerate case, lightlike fields tangent to the horizon that have zero surface gravity.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Quadrupolar Nature of Gravitational Wave Background through Space-based Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) consists of an incoherent collection of waves from both astrophysical and cosmological sources. To distinguish the SGWB from noise, it is essential to verify its quadrupolar nature, exemplified by the cross-correlations among pairs of pulsars within a pulsar timing array, commonly referred to as the Hellings-Downs curve. We extend the concept of quadrupolar correlations to pairs of general gravitational wave detectors, classified by their antenna responses. This study involves space-based missions such as the laser interferometers LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, along with atom interferometers like AEDGE/MAGIS. We calculate modulations in their correlations due to orbital motions and relative orientations, which are characteristic markers for identifying the quadrupolar nature of the SGWB. Our findings identify optimal configurations for these missions, offer forecasts for the time needed to identify the quadrupolar nature of the SGWB, and are applicable to both space-space and space-terrestrial correlations.</description>

      <title>Time is entropy: A geometric proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the equilibrium space of an ideal gas using the formalism of geometrothermodynamics. We introduce the concept of thermodynamic geodesics to show that the equilibrium space around a particular initial state can be divided into two regions, one that can be reached using thermodynamic geodesics and the second one forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics. Moreover, we show that, along thermodynamic geodesics, entropy is a linear function of the affine parameter, indicating that it can be used as a time parameter with a particular arrow of time determined by the direction in which entropy increases. We argue that entropy can also be interpreted locally as time in the case of any thermodynamic system in equilibrium and systems described within the scope of linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Domain Wall and Holographic Dark Energy in $f(Q)$ Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present research article, we have studied the flat FRW space time with domain wall and holographic dark energy in the context of $f(Q)$ theory of gravity. The exact solutions of the field equations are obtained using two different forms of varying deceleration parameters: (i) $q=-b(t)-1$ and (ii) $q=-lt+m-1$. It is observed that the universe is accelerating and expanding. Furthermore, we have also discussed some physical parameters of the investigated model.</description>

      <title>Directly inferring cosmology and the neutron-star equation of state from gravitational-wave mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upgrades to existing gravitational-wave observatories have the potential to simultaneously constrain the nuclear equation of state and Hubble's constant $H_0$ to percent level with merging neutron star binaries. In practice, performing simultaneous inference of $H_0$ and the equation of state is limited computationally by the requirement to solve the equations of general-relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium millions of times. We develop a machine-learning model to solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations in less than a millisecond, and demonstrate its utility by performing direct inference of both equation of state and Hubble's constant for synthetic neutron star merger signals with LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA operating at A+ sensitivities. We show that a population of fifteen mergers observed with A+ allows for the radius of a $1.4\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star and $H_0$ to be constrained to $R_{1.4} = 11.74^{+0.35}_{-0.28}$ km and $H_0 = 68^{+17}_{-13} \rm \ km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}$, at 90% credible interval and 68% credible interval respectively. These constraints utilise only the gravitational-wave information to infer cosmological parameters; such numbers will be further improved with the addition of electromagnetic counterparts and/or galaxy catalogues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic Safety (AS) Paradigm is an interesting set of ideas and methods towards a meaningful quantization of Gravity. A brief review of phenomenological consequences in the context of AS regarding cosmology with emphasis on dark energy is given. Furthermore, recent studies that suggest a natural explanation of the recent cosmic acceleration and its coincidence using large-scale structure and AS framework will be analyzed.

      <title>Robustness of Deep Learning Models to Precession in Gravitational-Wave Searches for Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave searches for signals of intermediate-mass black hole binaries are hindered by detector glitches, as the increased masses from stellar-mass systems hinder current generation detectors from observing the inspiral phase of the binary evolution. This causes the waveforms to strongly resemble glitches, which are of similar duration within a similar frequency band. Additionally, precession of the orbital plane of a binary black hole may further warp signal waveforms. In this work three neural network-based classifiers for the task of distinguishing between signals and glitches are introduced, with each following different training regimes to study the impact of precession on the classifiers. Although all classifiers show highly accurate performance, the classifier found to perform best was trained following the principle of curriculum learning, where new examples are introduced only after the mastery of easier preceding examples. This classifier obtains an accuracy of approximately 95% on a synthetic test set consisting of signals and glitches injected into coloured noise from the O3 LIGO Hanford power spectral density. The model is compared to matched filtering, the state-of-the-art in modelled gravitational-wave searches, and analysed in search of particular sensitivities to black hole binary parameters. It was found that while the classifier is affected by the total mass of a system, the prediction of a misclassification is most strongly determined by visibility through the signal-to-noise ratio. The analysis of the three classifiers demonstrates that precession is handled differently depending on the training regime, meaning the architecture is not fully robust to precession and advancements can be made through the development of training routines.</description>

      <title>No-hair and almost-no-hair results for static axisymmetric black holes and ultracompact objects in astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: No-hair theorems are uniqueness results constraining the form of the metric of black holes in general relativity. These theorems are typically formulated under idealized assumptions, involving a mixture of local (regularity of the horizon) and global aspects (vacuum spacetime and asymptotic flatness). This limits their applicability to astrophysical scenarios of interest such as binary black holes and accreting systems, as well as their extension to horizonless objects. A previous result due to G\"urlebeck constrains the asymptotic multipolar structure of static spacetimes containing black holes surrounded by matter although not revealing the possible structure of the metric itself. In this work, we disentangle some of these assumptions in the static and axisymmetric case. Specifically: i) we show that only a one-parameter family of black-hole geometries is compatible with a given external gravitational field, ii) we also analyze the case in which the central object is close to forming an event horizon but is still horizonless and show that the deviations from the natural black-hole shape have to die off as one approaches the black hole limit under the physical principle that curvatures are bounded.</description>

      <title>Geometry and proper time of a relativistic quantum clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical clocks measure proper time along their worldline, and Riemannian geometry provides tools for predicting the time shown by clocks in both flat and curved spacetimes. Common approaches to time in quantum systems, based for instance on wave functions or density matrices, tend to obscure this geometric property at the quantum level. Here, a new framework is demonstrated for perturbing the classical path-length functional to include quantum degrees of freedom within a modified Riemannian geometry. In this framework, a quantum clock travels on geodesics of a family of spacetimes deformed by parameters specifying the clock's quantum state. Detailed derivations provide potentially testable corrections to gravitational time-dilation in Schwarzschild spacetime that scale with the ratio of the clock's Compton wavelength to its wave packet's spatial extent.</description>

      <title>Fundamental constants: from measurement to the universe, a window on gravitation and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fundamental constants are a cornerstone of the physical laws. Any constant varying in space and/or time would signal a violation of local position invariance and be associated with a violation of the universality of free fall, and hence of the weak equivalence principle. It will reflect the existence of new degrees of freedom that couple to standard matter. Thus, testing for the stability of fundamental constants is of utmost importance for our understanding of gravity and for characterizing the domain of validity of General Relativity. Besides, it opens an independent window on dark matter and dark energy. As a consequence, thanks to the active development of experiments and of their accuracy, fundamental constants have become a key player in our search for physics beyond the standard model of and beyond General Relativity.
  This review details the roles of the fundamental constants in the laws of physics and in the construction of the International System of units. Then, the relations between constants, tests of the local position invariance and of the universality of free fall are exposed, as well as the construction of field theories that account for "varying constants". Then, the main experimental and observational constraints are described. It details the basics of each system, its dependence with respect to the primary parameters the variation of which can be constrained from observations, the known systematics effects and the most recent constraints. It also describes how these primary parameters can be related to the fundamental constants and the model-dependencies. Both time and space variation are considered. Given the huge increase of data and constraints, a general scheme to present experimental and observational results and to construct a collaborative data base that will be more efficient for the community and allow for better traceability, is proposed.</description>

      <title>Hidden symmetries from extra dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Kaluza-Klein compactifications, some symmetries of the higher dimensional theory are preserved in lower dimensions, others are broken, and occasionally, there are symmetry enhancements. The symmetries that are enhanced by toroidal compactifications were recently shown to define a symmetry principle with constrained parameters that fixes the action before dimensional reduction. Here we show the opposite: symmetries of the higher dimensional theory that are broken in the reduction process, can actually be realized after dimensional reduction as a global symmetry principle with constrained parameters that fixes couplings in the lower dimensional theory. We implement this principle in pure gravity, half-maximal supergravity and the circle reduction of 11 dimensional supergravity to Type IIA superstring theory. As a further application, we show that it can be used to constrain the quartic Ramond-Ramond couplings in Type IIA superstring theory from the four-point $\zeta(3)\, \alpha'{}^3\, t_8 t_8 R^{(-) 4}$ interactions.</description>

      <title>Searching for ultra-light dark matter through frequency modulation of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-light bosons, naturally appearing in well-motivated extensions to the Standard Model, can constitute all the dark matter. Models with particle mass close to the smallest phenomenologically allowed exhibit coherent field configurations at (sub)galactic scales, oscillating at a frequency corresponding to the fundamental mass of the dark matter particle. The gravitational field of these structures inherits the dark matter field's coherent oscillations, leaving an imprint on gravitational (and electromagnetic) waves sourced close to (or in) such overdensities. This happens via a heterodyning frequency modulation, which can later be decoded in a gravitational-wave detector. An analogous effect occurs in models with universal (conformal) couplings of ultra-light bosons with ordinary matter, generated by the direct interaction with the oscillating field. In this work, we explore this phenomenon in detail and assess the capability of near-future interferometers to probe ultra-light dark matter and its potential conformal couplings to matter. Using astrophysical population models, together with results from cosmological simulations, we find that the observation of gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars at the Galactic Centre with the Einstein Telescope/Cosmic Explorer would be particularly effective in constraining ultra-light dark matter.</description>

      <title>Maximal chirality transfer in the photon-graviton conversion in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While photons and gravitons do not interact significantly, photons can be converted to gravitons in a background magnetic field -- a phenomenon known as the Gertsenshtein effect. In this paper, we investigate whether chiral electromagnetic (EM) waves can be converted to chiral gravitational waves (GW) in the presence of primordial magnetic fields during the radiation-dominated epoch of the early universe. We consider two situations wherein chirality is either present in the propagating EM waves or it exists in the background magnetic field. Our analysis shows that while the conversion probability increases with stronger magnetic fields, it remains insensitive to the chiral nature of the background magnetic field. Consequently, the net chirality parameter is independent of the chirality of the background field in both cases. Finally, we demonstrate that the present-day energy density of the produced chiral GWs peaks at a frequency of $\sim 100$ GHz, and the corresponding characteristic strain will be highly sensitive to current and future missions designed to detect high-frequency GWs.</description>

Abstract: We tackle head-on the computation of the $s$-channel Witten diagram in momentum space corresponding to the exchange of a graviton between minimally coupled scalars in Weyl invariant unimodular gravity. By means of a lengthy calculation, we show first that the value of the diagram in question is the same as in General Relativity and, then, we obtain a compact expression for it in terms of the Mandelstam variables.</description>

      <title>Kalb-Ramond field, black holes and black strings in (2 + 1)D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating dilaton black hole and black string solutions in three spacetime dimensions are obtained. The spacetime interpolates between Anti de-Sitter and a (an asymptotically) flat spacetime. The black strings are characterized by their masses, angular momenta and axion charges. The uncharged black string solutions have only a single horizon. They contain a curvature singularity enclosed inside their horizons. They are also black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity. On the other hand, the charged black string solutions have two horizons. They may or may not contain a curvature singularity depending on the ratio of their inner and outer horizons radii. When they contain a singularity, the singularity is enclosed inside their inner event horizons. We also obtain, in addition to the uncharged black strings, other black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity by applying duality transformation on the charged black strings. The black holes are described by their masses and angular momenta. We find that their masses can be made negative by adjusting, using the gauge ambiguity, the asymptotic value of the Kalb-Ramond field in the black strings.

      <title>Spin systems as quantum simulators of quantum field theories in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a quantum field theory (QFT) in general two-dimensional curved spacetimes can be realized by a system of quantum spins or qubits. We consider a spin-1/2 model on a one-dimensional ring with spatially and temporally varying exchange couplings and magnetic fields. This model reduces to a QFT of Majorana fermions in the continuum limit. From this correspondence, we establish a dictionary for translating between the spacetime-dependent parameters of the spin model and the general metric on which the QFT is defined. After addressing the general case, we consider the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric as a simple example. According to the dictionary, the QFT of Majorana fermions on the FLRW metric corresponds to the Ising model with a time-dependent transverse magnetic field. We demonstrate that the production of Majorana particles in the expanding universe can be simulated with the transverse-field Ising model by increasing the strength of the magnetic field. Furthermore, we examine the Unruh effect through the spin system by using our prescription and show the direct relation between the entanglement (or modular) Hamiltonian in the spin system and the Rindler Hamiltonian. This approach provides an experimentally viable system for probing various phenomena in QFT within curved spacetime, while also opening the door to uncovering nontrivial phenomena in spin systems inspired by curved spacetime physics. It offers fresh perspectives on both QFT in curved spacetimes and quantum many-body spin systems, revealing profound connections between these fields.</description>

      <title>From spherical stars to disk-like structures: 3D common-envelope evolution of massive binaries beyond inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional simulations usually fail to cover the entire dynamical common-envelope phase of gravitational wave progenitor systems due to the vast range of spatial and temporal scales involved. We investigated the common-envelope interactions of a $10\,M_\odot$ red supergiant primary star with a black hole and a neutron star companion, respectively, until full envelope ejection (${\gtrsim}\,97 \,\mathrm{\%}$ of the envelope mass). We find that the dynamical plunge-in of the systems determines largely the orbital separations of the core binary system, while the envelope ejection by recombination acts only at later stages of the evolution and fails to harden the core binaries down to orbital frequencies where they qualify as progenitors of gravitational-wave-emitting double-compact object mergers. As opposed to the conventional picture of a spherically symmetric envelope ejection, our simulations show a new mechanism: The rapid plunge-in of the companion transforms the spherical morphology of the giant primary star into a disk-like structure. During this process, magnetic fields are amplified, and the subsequent transport of material through the disk around the core binary system drives a fast jet-like outflow in the polar directions. While most of the envelope material is lost through a recombination-driven wind from the outer edge of the disk, about $7\,\mathrm{\%}$ of the envelope leaves the system via the magnetically driven outflows. We further explored the potential evolutionary pathways of the post-common-envelope systems given the expected remaining lifetime of the primary core ($2.97\,M_\odot$) until core collapse ($6{\times}10^{4}\,\mathrm{yr}$), most likely forming a neutron star. We find that the interaction of the core binary system with the circumbinary disk increases the likelihood of giving rise to a double-neutron star merger. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Does Gauss-Bonnet Inflationary Gravitational Waves satisfy the Pulsar Timing Arrays observations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observations from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), led by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), have provided opportunities to constrain primordial gravitational waves at low frequencies. In this paper, we analyze the best-fit parameter values for different Gauss-Bonnet Inflationary Gravitational Wave (GB-IGW) models with the PTArcade program, and we compare the results with the observations of NANOGrav, European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), and International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). We find the potential parameter $n$ derived from the GB-IGW model is not necessarily positive. Instead, PTA data suggest the possibility of new parameter ranges. Meanwhile, the other parameters' results also have difference with traditional Cosmic Microwave Background analyses, shows the reason of different GW power spectra expected. Additionally, the GB-IGW models we calculated are closer to the central values of multiple PTA datasets compared to the standard inflation model, making the GB-IGW model more likely to be detected by future space-based gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy density from a self-interacting scalar field in a Lorentz-violation Horava-Lifshitz model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a massive self-interacting scalar quantum field in a Lorentz-violation scenario based on a Horava-Lifshitz model. Specifically, we investigate the vacuum energy density and its loop correction, up to first order in the self-interaction coupling constant, and also the topological mass generation. These quantities are also analyzed in the case where the field is massless. The scalar vacuum state is perturbed by the presence of two large parallel plates, placed at a distance L from each other, due to the imposition of Dirichlet boundary condition on the two plates. To perform this study, the effective potential approach in quantum field theory is applied.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a new class of string and holographic dark energy (HDE) cosmological model in the context of the $f(R)$ theory of gravity using the Kasner metric is considered. The exact solution of the field equations is obtained using the relation between the average scale factor and the scalar function $f(R)$. It is observed that the universe is accelerating and expanding. The string phase of the universe is present at an early stage of the evolution of the universe. The universe is dominated by quintessence type HDE at present. The effect of the curvature function $f(R)$ is also observed on dynamical parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose high-frequency gravitational wave (GW) detectors with Rydberg atoms. Rydberg atoms are ultra-sensitive detectors of electric fields. By setting up a constant magnetic field, a weak electric field is generated upon the arrival of GWs. The weak electric field signal is then detected by an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in the system of the Rydberg atoms. Recently, the minimum detectable electric field with the Rydberg atoms is further improved by employing superheterodyne detection method. Hence, even the weak signal generated by GWs turns out to be detectable. We calculate the amplitude of Rabi frequency of the Rydberg atoms induced by the GWs and show that the sensitivity of the Rydberg atoms becomes maximum when the size of the Rydberg atoms is close to the wavelength of GWs. We evaluate the minimum detectable amplitude of GWs with Rubidium Rydberg atoms and find that the detector can probe GWs with a frequency $f=4.2$ GHz and an amplitude around $10^{-20}$.</description>

      <title>Fast Waveform Generation for Gravitational Waves using Evolutionary Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave analyses depend heavily on waveforms that model the evolution of compact binary coalescences as seen by observing detectors. In many cases these waveforms are given by waveform approximants, models that approximate the amplitude and phase of the waveform at a set of frequencies. Because of their omnipresence, improving the speed at which approximants can generate waveforms is crucial to accelerating the overall analysis of gravitational-wave detections. An optimisation algorithm is proposed that can select at which frequencies in the spectrum an approximant should compute the power of a waveform, and at which frequencies the power can be safely interpolated at a minor loss in accuracy. The algorithm used is an evolutionary algorithm modeled after the principle of natural selection, iterating frequency arrays that perform better at every iteration. As an application, the candidates proposed by the algorithm are used to reconstruct signal-to-noise ratios. It is shown that the IMRPhenomXPHM approximant can be sped up by at least 30% at a loss of at most 2.87% on the drawn samples, measured by the accuracy of the reconstruction of signal-to-noise ratios. The behaviour of the algorithm as well as lower bounds on both speedup and error are explored, leading to a proposed proof of concept candidate that obtains a speedup of 46% with a maximum error of 0.5% on a sample of the parameter space used.</description>

      <title>Energy of Gravitational Radiation and the Background Energy of the Space-Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the issue of gravitational radiation in the context of the Bondi-Sachs space-time, and consider the expression for the gravitational energy of the radiation obtained in the realm of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR). This expression is independent of the radial distance (i.e., of powers of $1/r$) and depends exclusively on the functions $c(u,\theta,\phi)$ and $d(u,\theta,\phi)$, which yield the news functions ($u$ is the retarded time, $u=t-r$). We investigate the mathematical and physical features of this energy expression in the simpler framework of axial symmetry. Once a burst of gravitational radiation takes place in a self gravitating system, that leads to a loss of the Bondi mass, gravitational radiation is emitted throughout the whole space-time. The existence and presence of this radiation in the background structure of the space-time is consistent with the analysis developed by Papapetrou, and Hallidy and Janis, who found no proof that a gravitational system that emits a burst of gravitational radiation is preceded and followed by two stationary gravitational field configurations, namely, it seems that it is impossible for a gravitational system, which is initially stationary, to return to a stationary state after emitting a burst of axially symmetric gravitational radiation, in which case the space-time is not even asymptotically stationary. Therefore, it is plausible that the gravitational energy of radiation is present in the background structure of the space-time, and this is the energy predicted in the TEGR. This analysis lead us to conjecture that the noise detected in the large terrestrial gravitational wave observatories is intrinsically related to the background gravitational radiation.</description>

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTA) hunt for gravitational waves (GW) by searching for the correlations that GWs induce in the time-of-arrival residuals from different pulsars. If the GW sources are of astrophysical origin, then they are located at discrete points on the sky. However, PTA data are often modeled, and subsequently analyzed, via a "standard Gaussian ensemble". That ensemble is obtained in the limit of an infinite density of vanishingly weak, Poisson-distributed sources. In this paper, we move away from that ensemble, to study the effects of two types of "source anisotropy". The first (a), which is often called "shot noise", arises because there are $N$ discrete GW sources at specific sky locations. The second (b) arises because the GW source positions are not a Poisson process, for example, because galaxy locations are clustered. Here, we quantify the impact of (a) and (b) on the mean and variance of the pulsar-averaged Hellings and Downs correlation. For conventional PTA sources, we show that the effects of shot noise (a) are much larger than the effects of clustering (b).</description>

Abstract: In this work, we derive a novel black hole solution surrounded by a Dehnen-(1,4,0) type dark matter halo by embedding a Schwarzschild black hole within the halo, constituting a composite dark matter-black hole system. The thermodynamics of the resulting effective black hole spacetime is then studied with particular attention to the influence of the dark matter parameters on various thermodynamic properties. We examine the specific heat and free energy to assess the thermodynamic stability of the model. Furthermore, the null geodesics and the effective potential of light rays are studied to investigate how the dark matter parameters affect these geodesics and the radii of circular orbits. The stability of circular null geodesics is analyzed using dynamical systems and Lyapunov exponents, which represents the dynamical behaviour of the circular photon orbits. Finally, we studied if the circular geodesics exhibit chaotic behaviour using the chaos-bound condition.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Morris-Thorne-type wormholes with global monopole charge using various shape function forms known in the literature. We solve the Einstein field equations incorporating an anisotropic energy-momentum tensor and obtain different physical quantities associated with the matter-content. A crucial aspect of this study is the non-exotic matter distribution, examined through the evaluation of energy conditions, and exploring how different shape functions impact these conditions. Additionally, the anisotropy parameter is calculated to quantify the extent of attractive or repulsive behavior. Our study demonstrates that for different types of shape function forms, the energy conditions are influenced by the global monopole parameter. Our findings provide valuable insights for further theoretical explorations of these fascinating hypothetical structures in the realm of general relativity and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring components of the gravitational field of a rotating massive body are analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level in terms of the osculating Keplerian orbital elements. To the Newtonian order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied to 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system along an unbound heliocentric orbit, and to the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth. The calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any alternative models of gravity as well.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love numbers of gravitational atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic fields can form condensates, or clouds, around spinning black holes. When this system is under the influence of a secondary massive body, its tidal response can be quantified in the tidal Love numbers (TLNs). Although TLNs vanish for black holes in vacuum, it has been shown that the same is not true for black holes immersed in matter environments. In this work, we compute the gravitational TLNs of black holes surrounded by scalar clouds, in the Newtonian limit. We show that they are non-vanishing, have a strong power-law dependence on the boson's mass, and are proportional to the scalar cloud's total mass. In particular, we find that, independently of the cloud's configuration, the TLNs from axisymmetric tides scale as $\propto r_c^{2l+1}$, for $r_c$ the cloud's "radius" and $l$ the multipole order of the external tidal field. This differs by a factor $r_c$ from previous estimates based on scalar and vector tidal perturbations but is in perfect agreement with the behavior of TLNs in other matter systems. Furthermore, we show that the adiabatic tides approximation we employ is, in general, not appropriate for non-axisymmetric tidal interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of particles in the spacetime of a Kerr black hole immersed in swirling universes. Using the Poincar\'{e} section, fast Lyapunov exponent indicator, bifurcation diagram and basins of attraction, we present the effects of the swirling parameter and the spin parameter on the dynamical behaviors of the motion of particles, and confirm the presence of chaos in the motion of particles in this background spacetime. We find that the swirling parameter can change the range of the spin parameter where the chaos occurs, and vice versa. Moreover, we observe clearly that, regardless of the spin parameter, there exist some self-similar fractal fine structures in the basins boundaries of attractors for the spacetime of a black hole immersed in swirling universes. The combination the swirling parameter and the spin parameter provides richer physics in the motion of particles.</description>

      <title>Two dark components of de Sitter Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath for matter with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter. Here do not consider the real matter, but only the component which is related to the gravitational degrees of freedom and participates the thermodynamics of the de Sitter state. This gravitational component behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter. The vacuum energy and the analog of the Zel'dovich stiff matter represent correspondingly the dark energy and dark matter. In equilibrium the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is rather similar to the correspondingly superfluid and normal components of superfluid liquid, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. We extend this two dark components approach and the suggest the phenomenological theory, which describes the dynamics of the dark energy and the dark matter. For that we assume that the in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter also behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter. In this phenomenological model, both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. How this phenomenology is supported by the microscopic physics is an open question.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analyzing Stability of Hybrid Stars within $f(Q)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study uses the Krori-Barua type metric to represent hybrid stars within the $f(Q)$ theory of gravity. We postulate that the hybrid star also contains strange quark matter in addition to regular baryonic matter. To investigate the physical viability of the hybrid star model, we present the graphical behavior of the energy density, radial pressure, and tangential pressure, equation of state parameters, anisotropy, and stability analysis, respectively, by choosing the compact star EXO 1785-248 with a mass of $1.3_{-0.2}^{+0.2}~M_{\odot}$ and radius $8.849_{-0.4}^{+0.4}$ km with five different values of the coupling constants as $a=2$, $a=4$, $a=6$, $a=8$, and $a=10$. The maximum allowed masses and corresponding radii have been calculated using the $M-R$ curve for three different coupling parameter '$a$' values which match the observational data of three distinct compact stars, namely LMC X-4, SMC X-1, and 4U 1538-52. So, the $f(Q)$ theory of gravity can provide results that are plausible for describing the macroscopical characteristics of hybrid star candidates.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we explore the $f(Q,T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu \nu})$ gravity theory, building upon the foundations laid by the $f(Q)$ and $f(Q,T)$ gravity theories. Here, $Q$ represents non-metricity and $T_{\mu\nu}$ stands for the energy-momentum tensor. The proposed action encompasses an arbitrary function of both non-metricity $Q$ and the square of the energy-momentum tensor, specifically $T^2=T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu \nu}$. We find the analytical solution for the barotropic fluid case $p=\omega \rho$ for the model $f(Q, T_{\mu \nu}T^{\mu \nu}) = Q + \eta(T_{\mu \nu}T^{\mu \nu}) $. We constrain parameters of the solution $H(z)$ utilizing CC, BAO, and latest Pantheon+SH0ES samples with the help of Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling technique along with Bayesian statistical analysis. Further, from the Om diagnostic test, we find that the assumed cosmological model favors the quintessence regime.</description>

      <title>DeepClean: Non-Linear Regression for Noise Reduction in the Virgo Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the first detection of gravitational waves (GW) in 2015, there have been significant efforts to enhance the sensitivity of the ground-based detectors within the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Despite these efforts, many gravitational wave signals remain below the detection threshold due to non-linear noise from the physical environment of the detectors, coupled with the main GW signal.
  \texttt{DeepClean}'s capability to handle a variety of noise sources, including linear, non-linear, and \emph{non-stationary} coupling mechanisms, is particularly important in fields like astrophysics and gravitational wave astronomy, where accurate data analysis is crucial for the detection and study of gravitational waves from astronomical events.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of several explanations of the strong X-ray polarization of the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-47</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations of the X-ray binary 4U 1630-47 in the high soft state revealed high linear polarization degrees (PDs) rising from 6% at 2 keV to 10% at 8 keV. We discuss in this letter three different mechanisms that impact the polarization of the observed X-rays: the reflection of gravitationally lensed emission by the accretion disk, reprocessing of the emission in outflowing plasma, and electron and ion anisotropies in the accretion disk atmosphere. We conducted detailed raytracing studies to evaluate the impact of the reflection of strongly gravitationally lensed emission on the PDs. Although the reflected emission can produce high PDs in the high-energy tail of the thermal emission component, we do not find models that describe the PDs and are consistent with independent estimates of the source distance. We discuss the energetics of another proposed mechanism: the emission or scattering of the X-rays in mildly relativistically moving plasma outflows. We argue that these models are disfavored as they require large mechanical luminosities on the order of, or even exceeding the Eddington Luminosity. We investigated the impact of electron and ion anisotropies, but find that their impact on the observed PDs are likely negligible. We conclude with a discussion of all three effects and avenues for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16356v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum improvement of Kerr black holes with mass-dependent scale identifications in asymptotically safe gravity. We find that a physically sensible identification can only be a function of $Mr$ and the area $A=4\pi(r^2+a^2)$ where $M$ is the mass of the black hole and $a$ is an angular momentum parameter. We then discuss various properties of the rotating quantum black holes for a simple choice of the identification. We show that the resulting regular rotating black holes have the following nice properties: (i) admitting a consistent black hole thermodynamics at the horizon, (ii) resolving the ring singularity, (iii) partially eliminating closed time-like curves present in the classical Kerr black holes.</description>

Abstract: Using spacetime Gaussian test functions, we find closed-form expressions for the smeared Wightman function, Feynman propagator, retarded and advanced Green's functions, causal propagator and symmetric propagator of a massless scalar field in the vacuum of Minkowski spacetime. We apply our results to localized quantum systems which interact with a quantum field in Gaussian spacetime regions and study different relativistic quantum information protocols. In the protocol of entanglement harvesting, we find a closed-form expression for the entanglement that can be acquired by probes which interact in Gaussian spacetime regions and obtain asymptotic results for the protocol. We also revisit the case of two gapless detectors and show that the detectors can become entangled if there is two-way signalling between their interaction regions, providing closed-form expressions for the detectors' final state.</description>

      <title>Universal relations for anisotropic interacting quark stars</title>

Abstract: Interacting quark stars, which are entirely composed of interacting quark matter including perturbative QCD corrections and color superconductivity, can meet constraints from various pulsar observations. In realistic scenarios, pressure anisotropies are expected in the star's interior. Recently, the stellar structural properties of anisotropic interacting quark stars have been investigated. In this study, we further explore the universal relations (URs) related to the moment of inertia $I$, tidal deformability $\Lambda$, compactness $C$, and the $f$-mode nonradial pulsation frequency for such stars. Our results reveal that these approximate URs generally hold, being insensitive to both the EOS variations as well as to the presence of anisotropy. In contrast to previous studies on anisotropic neutron stars, we find that more positive anisotropy tends to enhance the $I-\Lambda$ and $I-C$ URs, but weakens the $C-\Lambda$ UR. For all the URs involving $f$-mode frequency, we find that they are enhanced by the inclusion of anisotropy (whether positive or negative). Utilizing these URs and the tidal deformability constraint from the GW170817 event, we put limits on the structural properties of isotropic and anisotropic quark stars, such as the moment of inertia $I_{1.4}$, the canonical radius $R_{1.4}$ and the canonical $f$-mode frequency $f_{f,1.4}$, all of which are very different compared to those of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic bound on slow-roll parameter in stringy quintessence model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the late time behavior of the scalar part of the volume modulus and the dilaton in stringy quintessence model, focusing on their contributions to the Hubble slow-roll parameter $\epsilon$ which directly measures the deviation of the spacetime geometry from de Sitter space. When only one of the moduli is allowed to move, $\epsilon$ converges to the stable fixed point at late time. The fixed point value is larger than $1$, thus the slow-roll cannot be realized. Moreover, if the decay rate of the quintessence potential is larger than some critical value, the positivity of the potential imposes that the stable fixed point value is just given by $3$, independent of the details of the moduli dynamics. Otherwise, the fixed point value coincides with the potential slow-roll parameter. When both the volume modulus and the dilaton roll down the potential simultaneously, we can find the relation between the contributions of two moduli to $\epsilon$ satisfied at the fixed point. In this case, the fixed point value is not in general the simple sum of fixed point values in the single field case and cannot be larger than $3$.</description>

      <title>Velocity Distribution of Dark Matter Spike around Schwarzschild Black Holes and Effects on Gravitational Waves from EMRIs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) constitutes the predominant portion of matter in our universe. Despite compelling evidence, the precise characteristics of DM remain elusive. Among the leading DM candidates are weakly-interacting massive particles, which may clump into steep concentrations around the central black holes of galaxies. However, DM profiles of the resulting dense spikes remain uncertain. Here we employ the relativistic dynamics in Schwarzschild geometry and first evaluate the velocity distributions of DM within such spikes. Through variations in black hole masses and dark halo parameters, we identify universal features in DM profiles and fit them with Gaussian distributions. Additionally, we illustrate with the impact of dynamical friction on gravitational waves generated by extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) within DM spikes, taking into account the velocity distribution of DM in the relativistic regime. Our findings demonstrate the phase shifts in the time-domain waveform, potentially providing useful insights for probing DM in galactic centers by gravitational-wave experiments.</description>

Abstract: We perform the first magnetohydrodynamic simulation tracking the magnetosphere of a collapsing magnetar. The collapse is expected for massive rotating magnetars formed in merger events, and may occur many hours after the merger. Our simulation suggests a novel mechanism for a gamma-ray burst (GRB) which is uncollimated and forms a delayed high-energy counterpart of the merger gravitational waves. The simulation shows that the collapse launches an outgoing magnetospheric shock, and a hot magnetized outflow forms behind the shock. The outflow is baryon-free and uncollimated, and its power peaks on a millisecond timescale. Then, the outflow becomes modulated by the ring-down of the nascent black hole, imprinting its kilohertz quasi-normal modes on the GRB tail.</description>

      <title>Probing Stochastic Ultralight Dark Matter with Space-based Gravitational-Wave Interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight particles are theoretically well-motivated dark matter candidates. In the vicinity of the solar system, these ultralight particles can be described as a superposition of plane waves, resulting in a stochastic field with sizable amplitude fluctuations on scales determined by the velocity dispersion of dark matter. In this work, we systematically investigate the sensitivity of space-based gravitational-wave interferometers to the stochastic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) field within the frequentist framework. We derive the projected sensitivity of a single detector using the time-delay interferometry. Our results show that space-based gravitational-wave interferometers have the potential to probe unconstrained regions in parameter space and improve the current limit on coupling strengths. Furthermore, we explore the sensitivity of a detector network and investigate the optimal configuration for ULDM detection. We introduce the overlap reduction function for ULDM, which quantifies the degree of correlation between the signals observed by different detectors. We find that the configuration, where the signals observed by two detectors are uncorrelated, is the optimal choice for ULDM detection due to a smaller chance of missing signal. This contrasts with the detection of stochastic gravitational-wave background, where the correlated configuration is preferred. Our results may provide useful insights for potential joint observations involving space-based gravitational-wave detectors like LISA and Taiji, as well as other ULDM detection networks operating in the coherence limit.</description>

      <title>Reviving Horndeski after GW170817 by Kaluza-Klein compactifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of Horndeski theory/ Galileons for late time cosmology is heavily constrained by the strict coincidence in the speed of propagation of gravitational and electromagnetic waves. These constraints presuppose that the minimally coupled photon is not modified, not even at the scales where General Relativity (GR) may need modification. We find that the 4D Galileon obtained from a Kaluza-Klein compactification of its higher dimensional version is a natural simultaneous modification of GR and electromagnetism with automatically "luminal" gravitational waves. This property follows without any fine tuning of Galileon potentials for a larger class of theories than previously thought. In particular, the $G_4$ potential is not constrained by the speed test and $G_5$ may also be present. In other words, some Galileon models that have been ruled out since the event GW170817 are, in fact, not necessarily constrained if they arise in 4D from compactifications of their higher dimensional Galileon counterparts. Besides their compelling luminality, the resulting vector Galileons are naturally $U(1)$ gauge invariant. We also argue that the Vainshtein screening that allows to recover GR predictions for solar system tests is also at work for electrodynamics in the dense region of laboratory tests.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compute 1-loop corrections to the bispectrum in the decoupling limit of the Effective Field Theory of Inflation (EFToI). We regulate the divergences by employing dimensional regularization and work in $d=3+\delta$ dimensions. We find that the final results feature analytic structures of the form $\log{\left(k_i/k_T\right)}$ and $\log{\left(H/\mu\right)}$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $\mu$ is the renormalisation scale. An interesting outcome of our calculations is that unlike the 1-loop correction to the power-spectrum computed in arXiv:0912.2734 the unrenormalised answers always produce unphysical logarithms of co-moving momenta. These unphysical logarithms are cancelled only after renormalisation. We expect this to be a generic feature for loop computations unless there is some cancellation as in the previously computed 1-loop result for the power-spectrum.</description>

      <title>One loop effective actions in Kerr-(A)dS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute new exact analytic expressions for one-loop scalar effective actions in Kerr (A)dS black hole (BH) backgrounds in four and five dimensions. These are computed by the connection coefficients of the Heun equation via a generalization of the Gelfand-Yaglom formalism to second-order linear ODEs with regular singularities. The expressions we find are in terms of Nekrasov-Shatashvili special functions, making explicit the analytic properties of the one-loop effective actions with respect to the gravitational parameters and the precise contributions of the quasi-normal modes. The latter arise via an associated integrable system. In particular, we prove asymptotic formulae for large angular momenta in terms of hypergeometric functions and give a precise mathematical meaning to Rindler-like region contributions. Moreover we identify the leading terms in the large distance expansion as the point particle approximation of the BH and their finite size corrections as encoding the BH tidal response. We also discuss the exact properties of the thermal version of the BH effective actions by providing a proof of the DHS formula and explicitly computing it for new relevant cases. Although we focus on the real scalar field in dS-Kerr and (A)dS-Schwarzschild in four and five dimensions, similar formulae can be given for higher spin matter and radiation fields in more general gravitational backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Discreteness Effects in the Post-Reconstruction Galaxy Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have increasingly recognized the value of analyzing the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectrum for investigations into redshift space distortion (RSD) effects. In this paper, we present a novel theoretical model for the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectrum, designed for RSD analyses. In particular, we emphasize the importance of accounting for discrete effects arising from the reconstruction displacement vector, which have been overlooked. We specifically calculate these discrete effects, i.e., shot noise terms, within the framework of standard perturbation theory at the 1-loop level. In addition, we adopt a formulation that accounts for infrared (IR) effects to accurately model the non-linear damping of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal. Our model comprehensively integrates key physical phenomena relevant to the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectrum, such as gravitational non-linearities, RSD effects, bias effects, reconstruction effects, reconstruction-specific shot-noise effects, and the non-linear damping of the reconstructed BAO signal, thereby making it applicable to post-reconstruction RSD analyses.</description>

      <title>Reviving QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a conformally coupled scalar QFT on $2+1$ dimensional static Einstein universe $R \times S^2$, and write down the free theory Hilbert space. We explain that this theory is secretly a QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter space because all the quantum observables experience {\it quantum revivals}, which naturally restricts the timelike $R$ to the appropriate de Sitter time range. Our construction circumvents the causal obstruction to formulating QFT in de Sitter due to event horizons. There aren't any in static Einstein. The `unitary gauge' description of the theory is realized by the zonal harmonics $P_\ell(\hat n \cdot \hat n')$. We verify that interactions with conformally invariant external sources are mediated only by these modes. Hence these modes comprise the complete basis of the "bulk" theory. When the theory is cut off in the UV the basis dimension scales as the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally dominated instantons and instability of dS, AdS and Minkowski spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the decay of the false vacuum in the regime where the quantum field theory analysis is not valid, since gravitational effects become important. This happens when the height of the barrier separating the false and the true vacuum is large, and it has implications for the instability of de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua. We carry out the calculations for a scalar field with a potential coupled to gravity, and work within the thin-wall approximation, where the bubble wall is thin compared to the size of the bubble. We show that the false de Sitter vacuum is unstable, independently of the height of the potential and the relative depth of the true vacuum compared to the false vacuum. The false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua can be stable despite the existence of a lower energy true vacuum. However, when the relative depth of the true and false vacua exceeds a critical value, which depends on the potential of the false vacuum and the height of the barrier, then the false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua become unstable. We calculate the probability for the decay of the false de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua, as a function of the parameters characterizing the field potential.</description>

      <title>$SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ Cosmological Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cosmological theory where the kinetic term and potential have $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry. Potentials have a plateau at large values of the inflaton field, where the axion forms a flat direction. Due to the underlying hyperbolic geometry and special features of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ potentials, the theory exhibits an $\alpha$-attractor behavior: its cosmological predictions are stable with respect to significant modifications of the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant potentials. We present a supersymmetric version of this theory in the framework of $\overline {D3}$ induced geometric inflation. The choice of $\alpha$ is determined by underlying string compactification. For example, in a CY compactification with $T^2$, one has $3\alpha=1$, the lowest discrete Poincar\'e disk target for LiteBIRD</description>
