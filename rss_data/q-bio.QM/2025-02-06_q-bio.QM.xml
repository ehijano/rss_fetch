      <title>scBIT: Integrating Single-cell Transcriptomic Data into fMRI-based Prediction for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional MRI (fMRI) and single-cell transcriptomics are pivotal in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, each providing unique insights into neural function and molecular mechanisms. However, integrating these complementary modalities remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce scBIT, a novel method for enhancing AD prediction by combining fMRI with single-nucleus RNA (snRNA). scBIT leverages snRNA as an auxiliary modality, significantly improving fMRI-based prediction models and providing comprehensive interpretability. It employs a sampling strategy to segment snRNA data into cell-type-specific gene networks and utilizes a self-explainable graph neural network to extract critical subgraphs. Additionally, we use demographic and genetic similarities to pair snRNA and fMRI data across individuals, enabling robust cross-modal learning. Extensive experiments validate scBIT's effectiveness in revealing intricate brain region-gene associations and enhancing diagnostic prediction accuracy. By advancing brain imaging transcriptomics to the single-cell level, scBIT sheds new light on biomarker discovery in AD research. Experimental results show that incorporating snRNA data into the scBIT model significantly boosts accuracy, improving binary classification by 3.39% and five-class classification by 26.59%. The codes were implemented in Python and have been released on GitHub (https://github.com/77YQ77/scBIT) and Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/11599030) with detailed instructions.</description>

      <title>Bowel Incision Closure with a Semi-Automated Robot-Assisted Laser Tissue Soldering System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods for closing gastrointestinal (GI) surgery incisions, like suturing and stapling, present significant challenges, including potentially life-threatening leaks. These techniques, especially in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS), require advanced manual skills. While their repetitive and time-consuming nature makes them suitable candidates for automation, the automation process is complicated by the need for extensive contact with the tissue. Addressing this, we demonstrate a semi-autonomous contactless surgical procedure using our novel Robot-assisted Laser Tissue Soldering (RLTS) system on a live porcine bowel. Towards this in-vivo demonstration, we optimized soldering protocols and system parameters in ex-vivo experiments on porcine bowels and a porcine cadaver. To assess the RLTS system performance, we compared the pressure at which the anastomosis leaked between our robotic soldering and manual suturing. With the best setup, we advanced to an in-vivo Heineke Mikulicz closure on small bowel incision in live pigs and evaluated their healing for two weeks. All pigs successfully completing the procedure (N=5) survived without leaks and the histology indicated mucosal regeneration and fibrous tissue adhesion. This marks the first in-vivo semi-automated contactless incision closure, paving the way for automating GI surgery incision closure which has the potential to become an alternative to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Product Manifold Representations for Learning on Biological Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning models that embed graphs in non-Euclidean spaces have shown substantial benefits in a variety of contexts, but their application has not been studied extensively in the biological domain, particularly with respect to biological pathway graphs. Such graphs exhibit a variety of complex network structures, presenting challenges to existing embedding approaches. Learning high-quality embeddings for biological pathway graphs is important for researchers looking to understand the underpinnings of disease and train high-quality predictive models on these networks. In this work, we investigate the effects of embedding pathway graphs in non-Euclidean mixed-curvature spaces and compare against traditional Euclidean graph representation learning models. We then train a supervised model using the learned node embeddings to predict missing protein-protein interactions in pathway graphs. We find large reductions in distortion and boosts on in-distribution edge prediction performance as a result of using mixed-curvature embeddings and their corresponding graph neural network models. However, we find that mixed-curvature representations underperform existing baselines on out-of-distribution edge prediction performance suggesting that these representations may overfit to the training graph topology. We provide our Mixed-Curvature Product Graph Convolutional Network code at https://github.com/mcneela/Mixed-Curvature-GCN and our pathway analysis code at https://github.com/mcneela/Mixed-Curvature-Pathways.</description>
