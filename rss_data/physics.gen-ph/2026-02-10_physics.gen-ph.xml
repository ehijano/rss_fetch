      <title>Cosmological evolution of collisionless relativistic gases as dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a phenomenological dark matter model described as a collisionless relativistic kinetic gas in a spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker universe. After normalization to the observed present-day dark matter abundance, the model is fully specified by a single dimensionless parameter $\beta$, interpreted as the present particle velocity in units of the speed of light. The resulting energy density, pressure, and sound speed admit closed analytic expressions, interpolating between a radiation-like regime at early times and cold dark matter at late times. We implement the model in a modified version of the Boltzmann code CLASS and confront it with Planck 2018 CMB data. We find that sufficiently small values of $\beta$ are observationally indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM, while larger values inducing relativistic effects at early times are constrained. These results establish the consistency of the relativistic kinetic gas scenario with current cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Bouncing cosmology, $F(T)$ teleparallel gravity and entropy of apparent horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two parameters scale factor leading to bouncing cosmology is considered. We show that at some model parameters we obtain the deceleration parameter $q_0\approx -0.535$ at the current epoch which is in agreement with the Planck data. The equation for the transition point when the universe expands from acceleration to deceleration phases is obtained. We find the equation for the function $F(T)$ within the teleparallel gravity with torsion field $T$ which provides bouncing cosmology. For some parameters of the model the function $F(T)$ was computed. At the same time, in the framework of entropic cosmology, the associated entropy was obtained for particular model parameters.</description>

      <title>Noether's theorem for the conditional principle of least action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of a conditional extremum of an action in a class of fields constrained by differential equations. For this setup, we propose an extension of Noether's first theorem to connect the symmetries of the action and the imposed equations to the currents conserved at the conditional extrema.
  The key ingredient of the extension is the gauge symmetry of the differential equations constraining the admissible class of field configurations.
  We consider a special type of global symmetries of the action which we call conditional symmetries. Such global symmetries must be special cases of gauge transformations of the constraint equations. We construct conservation laws that follow from the conditional symmetries of action. No Lagrange multipliers or other auxiliary fields are introduced and the conserved currents include only the original fields. We also prove the converse theorem which connects the conserved currents to the conditional symmetries of action. The general method is illustrated by several examples.</description>

      <title>High-Level Fault-Tolerant Abstractions for Quantum-Gate Circuit Design and Synthesis: PQC and Topological Anyon Architectures (TQC) for Categorical Computations in SU(2)_3 TQFT and D-brane Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a dual-architecture quantum simulation framework for modeling morphisms and stability conditions in the bounded derived category $\mathbf{D}^b(\mathrm{Coh}(X))$, with applications to D-brane physics on K\"ahler and non-K\"ahler manifolds. Two physically executable quantum realizations are constructed: parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) implemented on conventional gate-based qubit platforms, and a topological quantum computing (TQC) realization using braiding and fusion of Fibonacci anyons modeled via SU(2)$_3$ modular tensor categories. In the PQC model, we encode slope functionals S(F) and stability constraints as variational observables, mapping derived morphisms to unitaries that evolve over parameterized angles. The output expectation values simulate quantum-corrected Chern class inequalities with deformation terms $\delta$, capturing quantum corrections to classical geometric stability. In the TQC model, we engineer braid group representations to implement functorial transformations such as spherical twists and autoequivalences as sequences of fault-tolerant braid operations. This bifurcated approach provides a robust engineering pipeline for simulating categorical stability and homological algebra on quantum hardware, bridging abstract derived category theory with executable quantum architectures.</description>
