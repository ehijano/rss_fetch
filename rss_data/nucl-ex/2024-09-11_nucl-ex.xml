      <title>Fragmentation of 1.2 A GeV $^7$Be nuclei in nuclear photographic emulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charge topology of peripheral fragmentation of 1.2 A GeV $^7$Be nuclei in a nuclear emulsion is presented. The dissociation of $^7$Be nuclei via the channels $^7$Be$\rightarrow ^4$He + $^3$He, $^7$Be$\rightarrow$2$^3$He + n and $^7$Be$\rightarrow ^4$He + 2$^1$H is considered in detail. It is found that in the channel $^7$Be$\rightarrow ^4$He + 2$^1$H, events related to the channel $^7$Be$\rightarrow ^6$Be + n with the cascade decay $^6$Be$\rightarrow ^4$He + 2p account for about 27 %.</description>

      <title>Factorization for jet production in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an Effective Field Theory approach for jet observables in heavy-ion collisions, where the jet is treated as an open quantum system interacting with a hot and dense QCD medium. Within this framework, we derive a novel factorization formula for inclusive jet production, expressed as a series expansion with an increasing number of radiating subjet functions that encode forward scattering with the Quark-Gluon Plasma, convolved with perturbative matching coefficients. This work provides a systematic framework for computing jet observables at higher order and understanding their non-perturbative aspects, paving the way for future applications in heavy-ion phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most compelling pieces of evidence of the Hot Big Bang model is the realisation and confirmation that some nuclides were created shortly after the Big Bang. This process is referred to as Big Bang nucleosynthesis (or, sometimes, primordial nucleosynthesis), and is the end-product of putting neutrons and protons in a hot, expanding Universe. Big Bang nucleosynthesis currently provides our earliest test of cosmology, and it is the only experiment currently designed that is simultaneously sensitive to all four known fundamental forces: the gravitational force, the electromagnetic force, the strong force and the weak force. Our theoretical understanding of Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the measurement of the primordial abundances together represents one of the strongest pillars of the standard cosmological model. In this chapter, we will develop an intuitive understanding of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, discuss modern calculations of this process, and provide a summary of the current state-of-the-art measurements that have been made. Overall, Big Bang nucleosynthesis is in remarkable agreement with various cosmological probes, and it is this agreement that serves to strengthen our confidence in the general picture of cosmology that we have today.</description>

      <title>Beam energy dependence of net-hyperon yield and its implication on baryon transport mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the constituent quark model, each valence quark inside a baryon carries 1/3 unit of the baryon number. An alternative picture exists where the center of a Y-shaped topology of gluon fields, called the baryon junction, carries a unit baryon number. Studying baryon transport over a large rapidity gap ($\delta y$) in nuclear collisions provides a possible tool to distinguish these two pictures. A recent analysis of global data on net-proton yield at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions showed an exponential dependence on $\delta y$ and the exponential slope does not vary with event centrality, favoring the baryon junction picture. Since junctions are flavor blind, hyperons -- baryons containing valence strange quarks -- are expected to exhibit a similar behavior as the proton. This study aims to test this prediction by analyzing hyperon yields in Au+Au collisions at various energies. We observe that net-hyperon yields, after correcting for the strangeness production suppression, adhere to the expected exponential form. The extracted slope parameters for net-$\Lambda$, net-$\Xi$ and net-$\Omega$ are consistent with each other and with those of net-proton within uncertainties, and exhibit no centrality dependence, further substantiating the baryon junction picture. Various implementations of the PYTHIA event generator, primarily based on valence quarks for baryon transport, are unable to simultaneously describe the slope parameters for all baryons.</description>

      <title>Shell-model study for allowed and forbidden $\beta^-$ decay properties in the mass region "south" of $^{208}$Pb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large-scale shell-model calculations have been performed for the neutron-rich nuclei in the south region of $^{208}$Pb in the nuclear chart. The $\beta$-decay properties, such as the $\log ft$, average shape factor values, half-lives, and partial decay rates are calculated for these neutron-rich nuclei using recent effective interaction for the $^{208}$Pb region. These calculations have been performed without truncation in a particular model space for nuclei $N\leq 126$; additionally, particle-hole excitations are included in the case of core-breaking nuclei ($Z\leq 82, N&gt;126$). An extensive comparison with the experimental data has been made, and spin parities of several states have been proposed.</description>

      <title>Detector performance of the Gamma-ray Transient Monitor onboard DRO-A Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray Transient Monitor (GTM) is an all-sky monitor onboard the Distant Retrograde Orbit-A (DRO-A) satellite with the scientific objective of detecting gamma-ray transients ranging from 20 keV to 1 MeV. GTM is equipped with 5 Gamma-ray Transient Probe (GTP) detector modules, utilizing the NaI(Tl) scintillator coupled with a SiPM array. To reduce the SiPM noise, GTP makes use of a dedicated dual-channel coincident readout design. In this work, we firstly studied the impact of different coincidence times on detection efficiency and ultimately selected the 500 ns time coincidence window for offline data processing. To test the performance of GTPs and validate the Monte Carlo simulated energy response, we conducted comprehensive ground calibration tests using Hard X-ray Calibration Facility (HXCF) and radioactive sources, including energy response, detection efficiency, spatial response, bias-voltage response, and temperature dependence. We extensively presented the ground calibration results, and validated the design and mass model of GTP detector. These work paved the road for the in-flight observation and science data analysis.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Light Guide with S-shaped Strips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A light guide is an essential part of many scintillator counters and light collection systems. Our main interest is a light guide for a thin wide scintillator which has high light transmission while converting the area of the light source to the shape of a photo-detector. We propose a variation of the light guide which avoids a 90$\rm ^o$ twist of the strips, reduces the length of the light pipe, and reduces the complexity of production. Detailed Monte Carlo simulation studies have been performed for a 3-strip S-shaped light-guide system.</description>
