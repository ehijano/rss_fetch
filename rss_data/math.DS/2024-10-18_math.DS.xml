      <title>On the transitivity of Anosov diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for an $\Omega-$stable diffeomorphism to be a topologically transitive Anosov diffeomorphism: to exhibit a nonempty intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds of any pair of periodic orbits. To elucidate its dynamical nature, we compare this condition with other properties known to be sufficient for an Anosov diffeomorphism to be topologically transitive. We also describe the $C^1$ interior of the set of diffeomorphisms which comply with this condition, discuss examples with a variety of dynamics and present some applications of interest.</description>

      <title>Graphs of continuous but non-affine functions are never self-similar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bandt and Kravchenko \cite{BandtKravchenko2010} proved that if a self-similar set spans $\R^m$, then there is no tangent hyperplane at any point of the set. In particular, this indicates that a smooth planar curve is self-similar if and only if it is a straight line. When restricting curves to graphs of continuous functions, we can show that the graph of a continuous function is self-similar if and only if the graph is a straight line, i.e., the underlying function is affine.</description>

      <title>Opinion-driven risk perception and reaction in SIS epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and analyze a mathematical model to study the feedback between behavior and epidemic spread in a population that is actively assessing and reacting to risk of infection. In our model, a population dynamically forms an opinion that reflects its willingness to engage in risky behavior (e.g., not wearing a mask in a crowded area) or reduce it (e.g., social distancing). We consider SIS epidemic dynamics in which the contact rate within a population adapts as a function of its opinion. For the new coupled model, we prove the existence of two distinct parameter regimes. One regime corresponds to a low baseline infectiousness, and the equilibria of the epidemic spread are identical to those of the standard SIS model. The other regime corresponds to a high baseline infectiousness, and there is a bistability between two new endemic equilibria that reflect an initial preference towards either risk seeking behavior or risk aversion. We prove that risk seeking behavior increases the steady-state infection level in the population compared to the baseline SIS model, whereas risk aversion decreases it. When a population is highly reactive to extreme opinions, we show how risk aversion enables the complete eradication of infection in the population. Extensions of the model to a network of populations or individuals are explored numerically.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a state-dependent delay-differential equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of a scalar differential equation with threshold state-dependent delayed feedback. This equation arises as a simplification of a gene regulatory model. There are two monotone nonlinearities in the model: one describes the dependence of delay on state, and the other is the feedback nonlinearity. Both increasing and decreasing nonlinearities are considered. Our analysis is exhaustive both analytically and numerically as we examine the bifurcations of the system for various combinations of increasing and decreasing nonlinearities. We identify rich bifurcation patterns including Bautin, Bogdanov-Takens, cusp, fold, homoclinic, and Hopf bifurcations whose existence depend on the derivative signs of nonlinearities. Our analysis confirms many of these patterns in the limit where the nonlinearities are switch-like and change their value abruptly at a threshold. Perhaps one of the most surprising findings is the existence of a Hopf bifurcation to a periodic solution when the nonlinearity is monotone increasing and the time delay is a decreasing function of the state variable--something that is impossible in the case of a constant delay.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Analysis of a Predator-Prey Model with Additive Allee Effect and Prey Group Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a predator-prey model with Allee effect and prey group defense. The model has three equilibrium points i.e. the trivial point, the predator extinction point, and the coexistence point. All equilibrium points are locally asymptotically stable under certain conditions. The Allee effect in this model influences the stability of the equilibrium point. If the Allee effect is weak, then the trivial equilibrium point is unstable. Meanwhile, if the Allee effect is strong, then the trivial equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable. Those mean that a strong Allee effect can lead to the extinction of both populations. Moreover, under weak Allee condition, forward bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation occur at the predator extinction equilibrium point. Meanwhile, a strong Allee effect may induce bistability at both the trivial equilibrium point and the predator extinction equilibrium point. Those mean that prey can survive without the presence of predators, but a strong Allee effect can lead to prey extinction if the population size is very small. To support our analytical findings, we perform some numerical simulations in the final section.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity, transitivity and chaos in non-autonomous discrete systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study properties of sensitivity, transitivity and chaos for non-autonomous discrete systems(NDS). Firstly, we present some different sufficient conditions for NDS to be chaotic. Then, we relate the transitivity with the sensitivity of NDS and give several sufficient conditions for NDS to be sensitive. We obtain that transitivity and dense periodic points imply sensitivity, and that transitive system is either sensitive or almost equicontinuous. The results improve and extend some existing ones. Besides, we give some examples to show that there is a significant difference between the theory of ADS and the theory of NDS. We get that almost periodic point and minimal point do not imply each other and that two definitions of minimal system are not equivalent for non-autonomous discrete systems. Finally, we introduce and study weakly sensitivity for non-autonomous discrete systems.</description>

      <title>Multiple mixing for parabolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Rokhlin Problem asks whether mixing implies higher order mixing. So far, all the known examples of zero entropy, mixing dynamical systems enjoy a variant of the mixing via shearing mechanism. In this paper we introduce the notion of locally uniformly shearing systems (LUS) which is a rigorous way of describing the mixing via shearing mechanism. We prove that all LUS flows are mixing of all orders. We then show that mixing smooth flows on surfaces and smooth time-changes of unipotent flow are LUS. We also introduce the notion of quantitative LUS. We show that polynomially mixing systems that are polynomially LUS are in fact polynomially mixing of all orders. As a consequence we show that Kochergin flows on $\mathbb{T}^2$ (for a.e. irrational frequency) as well as smooth time-changes of unipotent flows are polynomially mixing of all orders.</description>

      <title>Admissibility and generalized nonuniform dichotomies for nonautonomous Random Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce generalized dichotomies for nonautonomous random linear dynamical systems acting on arbitrary Banach spaces, and obtain their complete characterization in terms of an appropriate admissibility property. These generalized dichotomies are associated to growth rates satisfying mild conditions and they include the standard exponential behavior as a very particular case. As a nontrivial application, we establish the robustness property of such dichotomies under small (linear) perturbations.</description>

      <title>Stable functions and F{\o}lner's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $G$ is amenable and $A\subseteq G$ has positive upper Banach density, then there is an identity neighborhood $B$ in the Bohr topology on $G$ that is almost contained in $AA^{-1}$ in the sense that $B\backslash AA^{-1}$ has upper Banach density $0$. This generalizes the abelian case (due to F{\o}lner) and the countable case (due to Beiglb\"{o}ck, Bergelson, and Fish). The proof is indirectly based on local stable group theory in continuous logic. The main ingredients are Grothendieck's double-limit characterization of relatively weakly compact sets in spaces of continuous functions, along with results of Ellis and Nerurkar on the topological dynamics of weakly almost periodic flows.</description>

      <title>Deformational spectral rigidity of axially-symmetric symplectic billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symplectic billiards were introduced by Albers and Tabachnikov as billiards in strictly convex bounded domains of the plane with smooth boundary having a specific law of reflection. This paper proves a rigidity result for symplectic billiards which is similar to a previous result on classical billiards formulated by De Simoi, Kaloshin and Wei. Namely, it states that close to an ellipse, a sufficiently smooth one-parameter family of axially symmetric domains either contains domains with different area-spectra or is trivial, in a sense that the domains differ by area-preserving affine transformations of the plane. The paper also prove that in the general setting - that is even if the domains are not close to an ellipse - any sufficiently smooth one-parameter family of axially symmetric domains which preserves the area-spectrum is tangent to a finite dimensionnal space.</description>

      <title>Closed Orbits of Dynamically Convex Reeb Flows: Towards the HZ- and Multiplicity Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the multiplicity problem for prime closed orbits of dynamically convex Reeb flows on the boundary of a star-shaped domain in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. The first of our two main results asserts that such a flow has at least $n$ prime closed Reeb orbits, improving the previously known lower bound by a factor of two and settling a long-standing open question. The second main theorem is that when, in addition, the domain is centrally symmetric and the Reeb flow is non-degenerate, the flow has either exactly $n$ or infinitely many prime closed orbits. This is a higher-dimensional contact variant of Franks' celebrated $2$-or-infinity theorem and, viewed from the symplectic dynamics perspective, settles a particular case of the contact Hofer-Zehnder conjecture. The proofs are based on several auxiliary results of independent interest on the structure of the filtered symplectic homology and the properties of closed orbits.</description>

      <title>Positive ($S^1$-equivariant) symplectic homology of convex domains, higher capacities, and Clarke's duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the positive ($S^1$-equivariant) symplectic homology of a convex domain is naturally isomorphic to the singular ($S^1$-equivariant) homology of Clarke's dual associated with the convex domain. As a result, we prove that the Gutt-Hutchings capacities coincide with the spectral invariants introduced by Ekeland-Hofer for convex domains. From this identification, it follows that Besse convex contact spheres can be characterized by the Gutt-Hutchings capacities, which implies that symplectomorphisms of the interiors of Besse convex bodies encode information about the Reeb flow on their boundaries. Moreover, as a corollary of the aforementioned isomorphism, we deduce that the barcode entropy associated with the singular homology of Clarke's dual provides a lower bound for the topological entropy of the Reeb flow on the boundary of a convex domain in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. In particular, this barcode entropy coincides with the topological entropy for convex domains in $\mathbb{R}^4$.</description>

      <title>High-order exceptional points and stochastic resonance in pseudo-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points, a remarkable phenomenon in physical systems, have been exploited for sensing applications. It has been demonstrated recently that it can also utilize as sensory threshold in which the interplay between exceptional-point dynamics and noise can lead to enhanced performance. Most existing works focused on second-order exceptional points. We investigate the stochastic dynamics associated with high-order exceptional points with a particular eye towards optimizing sensing performance by developing a theoretical framework based on pseudo-Hermiticity. Our analysis reveals three distinct types of frequency responses to external perturbations. A broad type of stochastic resonance is uncovered where, as the noise amplitude increases, the signal-to-noise ratio reaches a global maximum rapidly but with a slow decaying process afterwards, indicating achievable high performance in a wide range of the noise level. These results suggest that stochastic high-order exceptional-point dynamics can be exploited for applications in signal processing and sensor technologies.</description>

      <title>A unifying theory for metrical results on regular continued fraction convergents and mediants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit Ito's (\cite{I1989}) natural extension of the Farey tent map, which generates all regular continued fraction convergents and mediants of a given irrational. With a slight shift in perspective on the order in which these convergents and mediants arise, this natural extension is shown to provide an elegant and powerful tool in the metric theory of continued fractions. A wealth of old and new results -- including limiting distributions of approximation coefficients, analogues of a theorem of Legendre and their refinements, and a generalisation of L\'evy's Theorem to subsequences of convergents and mediants -- are presented as corollaries within this unifying theory.</description>

Let sequences ${ p(n)},{ q(n)}$ satisfy the property $ p(n+1)- p(n), \ q(n+1)- q(n)\ \to\ +\infty.$ Then there exist automorphisms $S,T$ with simple singular spectrum and a set $C$ such that the sequence $ \sum_{n=1}^{N} \mu(S^{ p(n)}C\cap T^{ q(n)}C)/N$ diverges. We give also example of linear non-recurrence for a pair of mixing suspensions of zero entropy and with singular and Lebesgue parts in their spectra.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal polynomial approximation and Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition in chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08074v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) is a data-driven tool for forecasting and model reduction of dynamics, which has been extensively taken up in the physical sciences. While the method is conceptually simple, in deterministic chaos it is unclear what its properties are or even what it converges to. In particular, it is not clear how EDMD's least-squares approximation treats the classes of differentiable functions on which chaotic systems act.
  We develop for the first time a general, rigorous theory of EDMD on the simplest examples of chaotic maps: analytic expanding maps of the circle. To do this, we prove a new, basic approximation result in the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle (OPUC) and apply methods from transfer operator theory. We show that in the infinite-data limit, the least-squares projection error is exponentially small for trigonometric polynomial observable dictionaries. As a result, we show that forecasts and Koopman spectral data produced using EDMD in this setting converge to the physically meaningful limits, exponentially fast with respect to the size of the dictionary. This demonstrates that with only a relatively small polynomial dictionary, EDMD can be very effective, even when the sampling measure is not uniform. Furthermore, our OPUC result suggests that data-based least-squares projection may be a very effective approximation strategy more generally.</description>

      <title>Active risk aversion in SIS epidemics on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze an actively controlled Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (actSIS) model of interconnected populations to study how risk aversion strategies, such as social distancing, affect network epidemics. A population using a risk aversion strategy reduces its contact rate with other populations when it perceives an increase in infection risk. The network actSIS model relies on two distinct networks. One is a physical contact network that defines which populations come into contact with which other populations and thus how infection spreads. The other is a communication network, such as an online social network, that defines which populations observe the infection level of which other populations and thus how information spreads. We prove that the model, with these two networks and populations using risk aversion strategies, exhibits a transcritical bifurcation in which an endemic equilibrium emerges. For regular graphs, we prove that the endemic infection level is uniform across populations and reduced by the risk aversion strategy, relative to the network SIS endemic level. We show that when communication is sufficiently sparse, this initially stable equilibrium loses stability in a secondary bifurcation. Simulations show that a new stable solution emerges with nonuniform infection levels.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning prediction of tipping with applications to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anticipating a tipping point, a transition from one stable steady state to another, is a problem of broad relevance due to the ubiquity of the phenomenon in diverse fields. The steady-state nature of the dynamics about a tipping point makes its prediction significantly more challenging than predicting other types of critical transitions from oscillatory or chaotic dynamics. Exploiting the benefits of noise, we develop a general data-driven and machine-learning approach to predicting potential future tipping in nonautonomous dynamical systems and validate the framework using examples from different fields. As an application, we address the problem of predicting the potential collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), possibly driven by climate-induced changes in the freshwater input to the North Atlantic. Our predictions based on synthetic and currently available empirical data place a potential collapse window spanning from 2040 to 2065, in consistency with the results in the current literature.</description>

      <title>LifeGPT: Topology-Agnostic Generative Pretrained Transformer Model for Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conway's Game of Life (Life), a well known algorithm within the broader class of cellular automata (CA), exhibits complex emergent dynamics, with extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Modeling and predicting such intricate behavior without explicit knowledge of the system's underlying topology presents a significant challenge, motivating the development of algorithms that can generalize across various grid configurations and boundary conditions. We develop a decoder-only generative pretrained transformer (GPT) model to solve this problem, showing that our model can simulate Life on a toroidal grid with no prior knowledge on the size of the grid, or its periodic boundary conditions (LifeGPT). LifeGPT is topology-agnostic with respect to its training data and our results show that a GPT model is capable of capturing the deterministic rules of a Turing-complete system with near-perfect accuracy, given sufficiently diverse training data. We also introduce the idea of an `autoregressive autoregressor' to recursively implement Life using LifeGPT. Our results pave the path towards true universal computation within a large language model framework, synthesizing of mathematical analysis with natural language processing, and probing AI systems for situational awareness about the evolution of such algorithms without ever having to compute them. Similar GPTs could potentially solve inverse problems in multicellular self-assembly by extracting CA-compatible rulesets from real-world biological systems to create new predictive models, which would have significant consequences for the fields of bioinspired materials, tissue engineering, and architected materials design.</description>
