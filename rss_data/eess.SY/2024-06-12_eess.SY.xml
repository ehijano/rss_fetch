      <title>Data-driven Power Flow Linearization: Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the theoretical insights of Part I, this paper, as the second part of the tutorial, dives deeper into data-driven power flow linearization (DPFL), focusing on comprehensive numerical testing. The necessity of these simulations stems from the theoretical analysis's inherent limitations, particularly the challenge of identifying the differences in real-world performance among DPFL methods with overlapping theoretical capabilities and/or limitations. The absence of a comprehensive numerical comparison of DPFL approaches in the literature also motivates this paper, especially given the fact that over 95% of existing DPFL studies have not provided any open-source codes. To bridge the gap, this paper first reviews existing DPFL experiments, examining the adopted test scenarios, load fluctuation settings, data sources, considerations for data noise/outliers, and the comparison made so far. Subsequently, this paper evaluates a total of 44 methods, containing over 30 existing DPFL approaches, some innovative DPFL techniques, and several classic physics-driven power flow linearization methods for benchmarking. The evaluation spans various dimensions, including generalizability, applicability, accuracy, and computational efficiency, using various different test cases scaling from 9-bus to 1354-bus systems. The numerical analysis identifies and examines significant trends and consistent findings across all methods under various test cases. It also offers theoretical insights into phenomena like under-performance, failure, excessive computation times, etc. Overall, this paper identifies the differences in the performances of the wide range of DPFL methods, reveals gaps not evident from theoretical discussions, assists in method selection for real-world applications, and provides thorough discussions on open questions within DPFL research, indicating ten potential future directions.</description>

      <title>A game-theoretic, market-based approach to extract flexibility from distributed energy resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a market design based on game theory to optimally utilize the flexibility of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar PV, batteries, electric vehicles, and flexible loads. Market agents perform multiperiod optimization to determine their feasible flexibility limits for power injections while satisfying all constraints of their DERs. This is followed by a Stackelberg game between the market operator and the agents. The market operator as the leader aims to regulate the aggregate power injection around a desired value by leveraging the flexibility of their agents, and computes optimal prices for both electricity and flexibility services. The agents follow by optimally bidding their desired flexible power injections in response to these prices. We show the existence of an equilibrium among the market agents between all agents and the operator, along with simulation results for a small example system.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Sizing Optimization Method of Microgrid Considering Cost and Carbon Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microgrid serves as a promising solution to integrate and manage distributed renewable energy resources. In this paper, we establish a stochastic multi-objective sizing optimization (SMOSO) model for microgrid planning, which fully captures the battery degradation characteristics and the total carbon emissions. The microgrid operator aims to simultaneously maximize the economic benefits and minimize carbon emissions, and the degradation of the battery energy storage system (BESS) is modeled as a nonlinear function of power throughput. A self-adaptive multi-objective genetic algorithm (SAMOGA) is proposed to solve the SMOSO model, and this algorithm is enhanced by pre-grouped hierarchical selection and self-adaptive probabilities of crossover and mutation. Several case studies are conducted to determine the microgrid size by analyzing Pareto frontiers, and the simulation results validate that the proposed method has superior performance over other algorithms on the solution quality of optimum and diversity.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Control: Algorithms, Analysis and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive control provides techniques for adjusting control parameters in real time to maintain system performance despite unknown or changing process parameters. These methods use real data to tune controllers and adjust plant models or controller parameters. The field has progressed significantly since the 1970s, helped by digital computers. Early applications offered essential feedback, and theoretical advances solved many basic problems.
  This book comprehensively treats adaptive control, guiding readers from basic problems to analytical solutions with practical applications. Presenting a unified view is challenging due to various design steps and applications. However, a coherent presentation of basic techniques is now possible. The book uses a discrete-time approach to reflect the role of digital computers and shares practical experiences and understanding of different control designs.
  Mathematical aspects of synthesizing and analyzing algorithms are emphasized, though they alone may not solve practical problems. The book includes applications of control techniques but stresses that a solid mathematical understanding is crucial for creatively applying them to new challenges. Mathematical synthesis and analysis are highlighted, but they must be supplemented with practical problem-solving and algorithm modifications for specific applications.</description>

      <title>Meta-Backscatter: A New ISAC Paradigm for Battery-Free Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The meta-material sensor has been regarded as a next-generation sensing technology for the battery-free Internet of Things (IoT) due to its battery-free characteristic and improved sensing performance. The meta-material sensors function as backscatter tags that change their reflection coefficients with the conditions of sensing targets such as temperature and gas concentration, allowing transceivers to perform sensing by analyzing the reflected signals from the sensors. Simultaneously, the sensors also function as environmental scatterers, creating additional signal paths to enhance communication performance. Therefore, the meta-material sensor potentially provides a new paradigm of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) for the battery-free IoT system. In this article, we first propose a Meta-Backscatter system that utilizes meta-material sensors to achieve diverse sensing functionalities and improved communication performance. We begin with the introduction of the metamaterial sensor and further elaborate on the Meta-Backscatter system. Subsequently, we present optimization strategies for meta-material sensors, transmitters, and receivers to strike a balance between sensing and communication. Furthermore, this article provides a case study of the system and examines the feasibility and trade-off through the simulation results. Finally, potential extensions of the system and their related research challenges are addressed.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Heterogeneity in the Decentralised Control of Platoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of decentralised control architectures with heterogeneous dynamics for improving performance in large-scale systems. Our focus is on two well-known decentralised approaches; the 'predecessor following' and 'bidirectional architectures' for vehicle platooning. The former, utilising homogeneous control dynamics, is known to face exponential growth in disturbance amplification throughout the platoon, resulting in poor scalability properties. We demonstrate that by incorporating heterogeneous control system dynamics, this limitation disappears entirely, even under bandwidth constraints. Furthermore, we reveal that introducing heterogeneity in the bidirectional architecture allows the platoon's behaviour to be rendered independent of its length, allowing for highly scalable performance.</description>

      <title>Optimal policy design for decision problems under social influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on devising strategies for control-oriented decision-making scenarios, in the presence of social and external influences, e.g. within recommending systems in social contexts. More precisely, we extend the classical Friedkin and Johnsen model of opinion dynamics to incorporate random factors, such as variability in individual predisposition, and uncertainty in social acceptance towards a specific action that a recommending system aims to promote. Furthermore, we formulate an optimization-based control problem aimed at fostering the social acceptance of particular actions within the network. Initially conceptualized as an economic cost minimization, in this preliminary work, we simplify our problem by reformulating it into an MPC framework. Through our analysis and numerical simulations, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scheduling of Battery Storage Systems in the Swedish Multi-FCR Market Incorporating Battery Degradation and Technical Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for optimal participation of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) in the Swedish frequency containment reserve (FCR) markets. The developed model aims to maximize the battery owner's potential profit by considering battery degradation and participation in multiple FCR markets, i.e., FCR in normal operation (FCR-N), and FCR in disturbances (FCR-D) for up- and down-regulations. Accordingly, a precise formulation of a detailed battery degradation model and adherence to the technical requirements of the Swedish FCR markets are incorporated into the developed model. To achieve more practical results, simulations are conducted based on one minute time step realistic data for the whole year 2022. The results show a potential profit of 708 thousand Euros for a 1MW/1MWh BESS by participating in multi-FCR market. Analyzing the impact of considering degradation in the optimization problem has shown that the annual battery aging cost could decrease by 5%-29% without a significant effect on profit. The proposed model can be practically used by flexibility asset owners to achieve profitable and sustainable operation strategies that reduce battery degradation.</description>

      <title>Capacity Credit Evaluation of Generalized Energy Storage Considering Endogenous Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized energy storage (GES), encompassing both physical and virtual energy storage, can provide remarkable but uncertain adequacy flexibility. When assessing GES's contribution to resource adequacy, the literature typically considers exogenous uncertainties (e.g., failures and stochastic response) but overlooks endogenous uncertainties, such as self-scheduling in liberal markets and decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU). In this regard, this paper proposes a novel capacity credit evaluation framework to accurately quantify GES's contribution to resource adequacy, where a sequential coordinated dispatch method is proposed to capture realistic GES operations by coordinating self-scheduling in the day-ahead energy market and real-time adequacy-oriented dispatch in the capacity market. To incorporate DDU of GES (i.e., responsiveness affected by dispatch decisions and prices in capacity market), we present a chance-constrained optimization approach and tractable solution methodologies for real-time dispatch. We propose a practical adequacy assessment method to quantify the impact of DDU on capacity credit by evaluating the consequence of ignoring DDU. Additionally, a novel capacity credit index called equivalent storage capacity substitution is introduced to quantify the equivalent deterministic storage capacity of the uncertain virtual energy storage. Simulations show that the proposed method yields reliable and accurate capacity credit values by accounting for self-scheduling of GES and managing the risk from DDU. Finally, key impact factors of GES's capacity credit are thoroughly discussed, offering valuable insights for the decision-making of capacity market operators.</description>

      <title>ADDOPT: An Additive Manufacturing Optimal Control Framework Demonstrated in Minimizing Layer-Level Thermal Variance in Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) techniques hold promise but face significant challenges in process planning and optimization. The large temporal and spatial variations in temperature that can occur in layer-wise AM lead to thermal excursions, resulting in property variations and defects. These variations cannot always be fully mitigated by simple static parameter search. To address this challenge, we propose a general approach based on modeling AM processes on the part-scale in state-space and framing AM process planning as a numerical optimal control problem. We demonstrate this approach on the problem of minimizing thermal variation in a given layer in the electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF) AM process, and are able to compute globally optimal dynamic process plans. These optimized process plans are then evaluated in simulation, achieving an 87% and 86% reduction in cumulative variance compared to random spot melting and a uniform power field respectively, and are further validated in experiment. This one-shot feedforward planning approach expands the capabilities of AM technology by minimizing the need for experimentation and iteration to achieve process optimization. Further, this work opens the possibility for the application of optimal control theory to part-scale optimization and control in AM.</description>

      <title>Reserve Provision from Electric Vehicles: Aggregate Boundaries and Stochastic Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlled charging of electric vehicles, EVs, is a major potential source of flexibility to facilitate the integration of variable renewable energy and reduce the need for stationary energy storage. To offer system services from EVs, fleet aggregators must address the uncertainty of individual driving and charging behaviour. This paper introduces a means of forecasting the service volume available from EVs by considering several EV batteries as one conceptual battery with aggregate power and energy boundaries. This avoids the impossible task of predicting individual driving behaviour by taking advantage of the law of large numbers. The forecastability of the boundaries is demonstrated in a multiple linear regression model which achieves an $R^2$ of 0.7 for a fleet of 1,000 EVs. A two-stage stochastic model predictive control algorithm is used to schedule reserve services on a day-ahead basis addressing risk trade-offs by including Conditional Value-at-Risk in the objective function. A case study with 1.2 million domestic EV charge records from Great Britain shows that increasing fleet size improves prediction accuracy, thereby increasing reserve revenues and decreasing effective charging costs. For fleet sizes of 400 or above, charging cost reductions plateau at 60\%, with an average of 1.8kW of reserve provided per vehicle.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Machine Learning Approach for Cyberattack Mitigation of Parallel Converters in a DC Microgrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyberattack susceptibilities are introduced as the communication requirement increases with the incorporation of more renewable energy sources into DC microgrids. Parallel DC-DC converters are utilized to provide high current and supply the load. Nevertheless, these systems are susceptible to cyberattacks that have the potential to disrupt operations and jeopardize stability. Voltage instability may result from the manipulation of communication commands and low-layer control signals. Therefore, in this paper, a cyberattack that specifically targets parallel DC-DC converters is examined in a DC microgrid. A hybrid machine learning-based detection and mitigation strategy is suggested as a means to counteract this threat. The false data injection (FDI) attack targeting the converters is investigated within a DC microgrid. The efficacy of the suggested approach is verified via simulations executed for various scenarios within the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The technique successfully identifies and blocks FDI attacks, preventing cyberattacks and ensuring the safe operation of the DC microgrid.</description>

      <title>Accurate Current Sharing in a DC Microgrid Using Modified Droop Control Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the increasing popularity of DC loads and the potential for higher efficiency, DC microgrids are gaining significant attention. DC microgrids utilize multiple parallel converters to deliver sufficient power to the load. However, a key challenge arises when connecting these converters to a common DC bus: maintaining voltage regulation and accurate current sharing. Unequal cable resistances can cause uneven power sharing and lead to power losses. Conventional droop control methods, which employ a virtual resistor to address this issue, have limitations in achieving good performance across the entire converter operating range. This paper proposes a modified droop control algorithm to address this issue. This method modifies the virtual resistor in a way that ensures power sharing aligns with each converter-rated capacity. The algorithm is simple to implement and uses local measurements to update the droop gain. This paper presents simulation studies and experimental tests to analyze the performance of the proposed method, considering scenarios with equal and unequal converter ratings. The results successfully validate the accuracy and effectiveness of this innovative approach.</description>

      <title>Modeling of New Energy Vehicles' Impact on Urban Ecology Focusing on Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surging demand for new energy vehicles is driven by the imperative to conserve energy, reduce emissions, and enhance the ecological ambiance. By conducting behavioral analysis and mining usage patterns of new energy vehicles, particular patterns can be identified. For instance, overloading the battery, operating with low battery power, and driving at excessive speeds can all detrimentally affect the battery's performance. To assess the impact of such driving behavior on the urban ecology, an environmental computational modeling method has been proposed to simulate the interaction between new energy vehicles and the environment. To extend the time series data of the vehicle's entire life cycle and the ecological environment within the model sequence data, the LSTM model with Bayesian optimizer is utilized for simulation. The analysis revealed the detrimental effects of poor driving behavior on the environment.</description>

      <title>Building Hybrid B-Spline And Neural Network Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control systems are indispensable for ensuring the safety of cyber-physical systems (CPS), spanning various domains such as automobiles, airplanes, and missiles. Safeguarding CPS necessitates runtime methodologies that continuously monitor safety-critical conditions and respond in a verifiably safe manner. A fundamental aspect of many safety approaches involves predicting the future behavior of systems. However, achieving this requires accurate models that can operate in real time. Motivated by DeepONets, we propose a novel strategy that combines the inductive bias of B-splines with data-driven neural networks to facilitate real-time predictions of CPS behavior. We introduce our hybrid B-spline neural operator, establishing its capability as a universal approximator and providing rigorous bounds on the approximation error. These findings are applicable to a broad class of nonlinear autonomous systems and are validated through experimentation on a controlled 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) quadrotor with a 12 dimensional state space. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of different network architectures, specifically fully connected networks (FCNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), to elucidate the practical utility and trade-offs associated with each architecture in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Multi-module Robust Method for Transient Stability Assessment against False Label Injection Cyberattacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of deep learning in transient stability assessment (TSA) heavily relies on high-quality training data. However, the label information in TSA datasets is vulnerable to contamination through false label injection (FLI) cyberattacks, resulting in degraded performance of deep TSA models. To address this challenge, a Multi-Module Robust TSA method (MMR) is proposed to rectify the supervised training process misguided by FLI in an unsupervised manner. In MMR, a supervised classification module and an unsupervised clustering module are alternatively trained to improve the clustering friendliness of representation leaning, thereby achieving accurate clustering assignments. Leveraging the clustering assignments, we construct a training label corrector to rectify the injected false labels and progressively enhance robustness and resilience against FLI. However, there is still a gap on accuracy and convergence speed between MMR and FLI-free deep TSA models. To narrow this gap, we further propose a human-in-the-loop training strategy, named MMR-HIL. In MMR-HIL, potential false samples can be detected by modeling the training loss with a Gaussian distribution. From these samples, the most likely false samples and most ambiguous samples are re-labeled by a TSA experts guided bi-directional annotator and then subjected to penalized optimization, aimed at improving accuracy and convergence speed. Extensive experiments indicate that MMR and MMR-HIL both exhibit powerful robustness against FLI in TSA performance. Moreover, the contaminated labels can also be effectively corrected, demonstrating superior resilience of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Gait Design for a Soft Quadruped Robot via Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the locomotion capability improvement in a tendon-driven soft quadruped robot through an online adaptive learning approach. Leveraging the inverse kinematics model of the soft quadruped robot, we employ a central pattern generator to design a parametric gait pattern, and use Bayesian optimization (BO) to find the optimal parameters. Further, to address the challenges of modeling discrepancies, we implement a multi-fidelity BO approach, combining data from both simulation and physical experiments throughout training and optimization. This strategy enables the adaptive refinement of the gait pattern and ensures a smooth transition from simulation to real-world deployment for the controller. Moreover, we integrate a computational task off-loading architecture by edge computing, which reduces the onboard computational and memory overhead, to improve real-time control performance and facilitate an effective online learning process. The proposed approach successfully achieves optimal walking gait design for physical deployment with high efficiency, effectively addressing challenges related to the reality gap in soft robotics.</description>

      <title>Optimal Gait Control for a Tendon-driven Soft Quadruped Robot by Model-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an innovative approach to optimal gait control for a soft quadruped robot enabled by four Compressible Tendon-driven Soft Actuators (CTSAs). Improving our previous studies of using model-free reinforcement learning for gait control, we employ model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) to further enhance the performance of the gait controller. Compared to rigid robots, the proposed soft quadruped robot has better safety, less weight, and a simpler mechanism for fabrication and control. However, the primary challenge lies in developing sophisticated control algorithms to attain optimal gait control for fast and stable locomotion. The research employs a multi-stage methodology, including state space restriction, data-driven model training, and reinforcement learning algorithm development. Compared to benchmark methods, the proposed MBRL algorithm, combined with post-training, significantly improves the efficiency and performance of gait control policies. The developed policy is both robust and adaptable to the robot's deformable morphology. The study concludes by highlighting the practical applicability of these findings in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Horizon Distributionally Robust Regret-Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the infinite-horizon distributionally robust (DR) control of linear systems with quadratic costs, where disturbances have unknown, possibly time-correlated distribution within a Wasserstein-2 ambiguity set. We aim to minimize the worst-case expected regret-the excess cost of a causal policy compared to a non-causal one with access to future disturbance. Though the optimal policy lacks a finite-order state-space realization (i.e., it is non-rational), it can be characterized by a finite-dimensional parameter. Leveraging this, we develop an efficient frequency-domain algorithm to compute this optimal control policy and present a convex optimization method to construct a near-optimal state-space controller that approximates the optimal non-rational controller in the $\mathit{H}_\infty$-norm. This approach avoids solving a computationally expensive semi-definite program (SDP) that scales with the time horizon in the finite-horizon setting.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Control of Service Systems with Returns: Application to Design of Post-Discharge Hospital Readmission Prevention Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.00093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a control problem for queueing systems where customers may return for additional episodes of service after their initial service completion. At each service completion epoch, the decision maker can choose to reduce the probability of return for the departing customer but at a cost that is convex increasing in the amount of reduction in the return probability. Other costs are incurred as customers wait in the queue and every time they return for service. Our primary motivation comes from post-discharge Quality Improvement (QI) interventions (e.g., follow up phone-calls, appointments) frequently used in a variety of healthcare settings to reduce unplanned hospital readmissions. Our objective is to understand how the cost of interventions should be balanced with the reductions in congestion and service costs. To this end, we consider a fluid approximation of the queueing system and characterize the structure of optimal long-run average and bias-optimal transient control policies for the fluid model. Our structural results motivate the design of intuitive surge protocols whereby different intensities of interventions (corresponding to different levels of reduction in the return probability) are provided based on the congestion in the system. Through extensive simulation experiments, we study the performance of the fluid policy for the stochastic system and identify parameter regimes where it leads to significant cost savings compared to a fixed long-run average optimal policy that ignores holding costs and a simple policy that uses the highest level of intervention whenever the queue is non-empty. In particular, we find that in a parameter regime relevant to our motivating application, dynamically adjusting the intensity of interventions could result in up to 25.4% reduction in long-run average cost and 33.7% in finite-horizon costs compared to the simple aggressive policy.</description>

      <title>Maximin Headway Control of Automated Vehicles for System Optimal Dynamic Traffic Assignment in General Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study develops the headway control framework in a fully automated road network, as we believe headway of Automated Vehicles (AVs) is another influencing factor to traffic dynamics in addition to conventional vehicle behaviors (e.g. route and departure time choices). Specifically, we aim to search for the optimal time headway between AVs on each link that achieves the network-wide system optimal dynamic traffic assignment (SO-DTA). To this end, the headway-dependent fundamental diagram (HFD) and headway-dependent double queue model (HDQ) are developed to model the effect of dynamic headway on roads, and a dynamic network model is built. It is rigorously proved that the minimum headway could always achieve SO-DTA, yet the optimal headway is non-unique. Motivated by these two findings, this study defines a novel concept of maximin headway, which is the largest headway that still achieves SO-DTA in the network. Mathematical properties regarding maximin headway are analyzed and an efficient solution algorithm is developed. Numerical experiments on both a small and large network verify the effectiveness of the maximin headway control framework as well as the properties of maximin headway. This study sheds light on deriving the desired solution among the non-unique solutions in SO-DTA and provides implications regarding the safety margin of AVs under SO-DTA.</description>

Abstract: A new definition of discrete-time negative imaginary (NI) systems is provided. This definition characterizes the dissipative property of a zero-order hold sampled continuous-time NI system. Under some assumptions, asymptotic stability can be guaranteed for the closed-loop interconnection of an NI system and an output strictly negative imaginary system, with one of them having a one step advance. In the case of linear systems, we also provide necessary and sufficient frequency-domain and LMI conditions under which the definition is satisfied. Also provided is a simple DC gain condition for the stability results in the linear case.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning: A Unified Framework Based on Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we describe a new conceptual framework that connects approximate Dynamic Programming (DP), Model Predictive Control (MPC), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). This framework centers around two algorithms, which are designed largely independently of each other and operate in synergy through the powerful mechanism of Newton's method. We call them the off-line training and the on-line play algorithms. The names are borrowed from some of the major successes of RL involving games; primary examples are the recent (2017) AlphaZero program (which plays chess, [SHS17], [SSS17]), and the similarly structured and earlier (1990s) TD-Gammon program (which plays backgammon, [Tes94], [Tes95], [TeG96]). In these game contexts, the off-line training algorithm is the method used to teach the program how to evaluate positions and to generate good moves at any given position, while the on-line play algorithm is the method used to play in real time against human or computer opponents.
  Significantly, the synergy between off-line training and on-line play also underlies MPC (as well as other major classes of sequential decision problems), and indeed the MPC design architecture is very similar to the one of AlphaZero and TD-Gammon. This conceptual insight provides a vehicle for bridging the cultural gap between RL and MPC, and sheds new light on some fundamental issues in MPC. These include the enhancement of stability properties through rollout, the treatment of uncertainty through the use of certainty equivalence, the resilience of MPC in adaptive control settings that involve changing system parameters, and the insights provided by the superlinear performance bounds implied by Newton's method.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Monotonicity to Design an Adaptive PI Passivity-Based Controller for a Fuel-Cell System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a controller for a power electronic system composed of a fuel cell (FC) connected to a boost converter which feeds a resistive load. The controller aims to regulate the output voltage of the converter regardless of the uncertainty of the load. Leveraging the monotonicity feature of the fuel cell polarization curve we prove that the nonlinear system can be controlled by means of a passivity-based proportional-integral approach. We afterward extend the result to an adaptive version, allowing the controller to deal with parameter uncertainties, such as inductor parasitic resistance, load, and FC polarization curve parameters. This adaptive design is based on an indirect control approach with online parameter identification performed by a ``hybrid'' estimator which combines two techniques: the gradient-descent and immersion-and-invariance algorithms. The overall system is proved to be stable with the output voltage regulated to its reference. Experimental results validate our proposal under two real-life scenarios: pulsating load and output voltage reference changes.</description>

      <title>Optimization-Based Motion Planning for Autonomous Agricultural Vehicles Turning in Constrained Headlands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Headland maneuvering is a crucial aspect of unmanned field operations for autonomous agricultural vehicles (AAVs). While motion planning for headland turning in open fields has been extensively studied and integrated into commercial auto-guidance systems, the existing methods primarily address scenarios with ample headland space and thus may not work in more constrained headland geometries. Commercial orchards often contain narrow and irregularly shaped headlands, which may include static obstacles,rendering the task of planning a smooth and collision-free turning trajectory difficult. To address this challenge, we propose an optimization-based motion planning algorithm for headland turning under geometrical constraints imposed by field geometry and obstacles.</description>

      <title>Net-Zero Energy House-oriented Linear Programming for the Sizing Problem of Photovoltaic Panels and Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global drive towards carbon neutrality has led to a significant increase in the number of power plants based on renewable energy sources (RES). Concurrently, numerous households are adopting RES to generate their own energy, aiming to decrease both electricity costs and carbon footprints. To support these users, many papers have been devoted to developing optimal investment strategies for residential energy systems. However, there is still a significant gap as these studies often neglect important aspects like carbon neutrality. For this reason, in this paper, we explore the concept of net-zero energy houses (ZEHs) -- houses designed to have an annual net energy consumption around zero -- by presenting a constrained optimization problem to find the optimal number of photovoltaic panels and the optimal size of the battery system for home integration. Solving this constrained optimization problem is difficult due to its nonconvex constraints. Nevertheless, by applying a series of transformations, we reveal that it is possible to find an equivalent linear programming (LP) problem which is computationally tractable. The attainment of ZEH can be tackled by introducing a single constraint in the optimization problem. Additionally, we propose a sharing economy approach to the investment problem, offering a strategy that could potentially reduce investment costs and facilitate the attainment of ZEH more efficiently. Finally, we apply the proposed frameworks to a neighborhood in Japan as a case study, demonstrating the potential for long-term ZEH attainment. The results show that, under the right incentive, users can achieve ZEH, reduce their electricity costs and have a minimal impact on the main grid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern data-driven control applications call for flexible nonlinear models that are amenable to principled controller synthesis and realtime feedback. Many nonlinear dynamical systems of interest are control affine. We propose two novel classes of nonlinear feature representations which capture control affine structure while allowing for arbitrary complexity in the state dependence. Our methods make use of random features (RF) approximations, inheriting the expressiveness of kernel methods at a lower computational cost. We formalize the representational capabilities of our methods by showing their relationship to the Affine Dot Product (ADP) kernel proposed by Casta\~neda et al. (2021) and a novel Affine Dense (AD) kernel that we introduce. We further illustrate the utility by presenting a case study of data-driven optimization-based control using control certificate functions (CCF). Simulation experiments on a double pendulum empirically demonstrate the advantages of our methods.</description>
