      <title>ALMA high-resolution observations unveil planet formation shaping molecular emission in the PDS 70 disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With two directly detected protoplanets, the PDS 70 system is a unique source in which to study the complex interplay between forming planets and their natal environment. The large dust cavity carved by the two giant planets can affect the disk chemistry, and therefore the molecular emission morphology. On the other hand, chemical properties of the gas component of the disk are expected to leave an imprint on the planetary atmospheres. In this work, we reconstruct the emission morphology of a rich inventory of molecular tracers in the PDS 70 disk, and we look for possible chemical signatures of the two actively accreting protoplanets, PDS b and c. We leverage Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 6 high-angular-resolution and deep-sensitivity line emission observations, together with image and $uv$-plane techniques, to boost the detection of faint lines. We robustly detect ring-shaped emission from $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, H$^{13}$CN, HC$^{15}$N, DCN, H$_2$CO, CS, C$_2$H, and H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ lines in unprecedented detail. Most of the molecular tracers show a peak of the emission inside the millimeter dust peak. We interpret this as the direct impact of the effective irradiation of the cavity wall, as a result of the planet formation process. Moreover, we have found evidence of an O-poor gas reservoir in the outer disk, which is supported by the observations of bright C-rich molecules, the non-detection of SO, and a lower limit on the $\mathrm{CS/SO}$ ratio of $\sim1$. Eventually, we provide the first detection of the c-C$_3$H$_2$ transitions at 218.73 GHz, and the marginal detection of an azimuthal asymmetry in the higher-energy H$_2$CO (3$_{2,1}$-2$_{2,0}$) line, which could be due to accretion heating near PDS 70b.</description>

      <title>Assessing Exoplanetary System Architectures with DYNAMITE Including Observational Upper Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The information gathered from observing planetary systems is not limited to the discovery of planets, but also includes the observational upper limits constraining the presence of any additional planets. Incorporating these upper limits into statistical analyses of individual systems can significantly improve our ability to find hidden planets in these systems by narrowing the parameter space in which to search. Here I include radial velocity (RV), transit, and transit timing variation (TTV) upper limits on additional planets in known multi-planet systems into the DYNAMITE software package and test their impact on the predicted planets for these systems. The tests are run on systems with previous DYNAMITE analysis and with updated known planet parameters in the 2-3 years since the original predictions. I find that the RV limits provide the strongest constraints on additional planets, lowering the likelihood of finding them within orbital periods of ~10-100 days in the inner planetary systems, as well as truncating the likely planet size (radius and/or mass) distributions towards planets smaller than those currently observed. Transit and TTV limits also provide information on the size and inclination distributions of both the known and predicted planets in the system. Utilizing these limits on a wider range of systems in the near future will help determine which systems might be able to host temperate terrestrial planets and contribute to the search for extraterrestrial biosignatures.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Objects in the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov are the first macroscopic interstellar objects to be detected in the solar system. Their discovery has triggered a tsunami of scientific interest regarding the physical properties, dynamics and origin of the so-called interstellar interloper population. While it is clear that a deep understanding of these issues cannot be reached from a sample of just two bodies, the emergence of this new field of astronomical study is particularly fascinating, with ramifications from planetary science to galactic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Finding planets via gravitational microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the first microlensing planet discovery in 2003, more than 200 planets have been detected with gravitational microlensing, in addition to several free-floating planet and black hole candidates. In this chapter the microlensing theory is presented by introducing the numerical methods used to solve binary and triple lens problems and how these lead to the characterisation of the planetary systems. Then the microlensing planetary detection efficiency is discussed, with an emphasis on cold planets beyond the snow line. Furthermore, it will be explained how the planetary characterisation can be facilitated when the microlensing light curves exhibit distortions due to second order effects such as parallax, planetary orbital motion, and extended source. These second order effects can be turned to our advantage, and become useful to ultimately better characterise the planetary systems, but they can also introduce degeneracies in the light curve models. It will be explained how the use of modern observational and computational techniques enables microlensers to solve these degeneracies and estimate the planetary system parameters with very high accuracy. Then a review of the main discoveries to date will be presented while exploring the recent statistical results from high-cadence ground-based surveys and space-based observations, especially on the planet mass function. Finally, future prospects are discussed, with the expected advances from dedicated space missions, extending the planet sensitivity range down to Mars mass.</description>

      <title>Peering above the clouds of the warm Neptune GJ 436b with CRIRES+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanets with masses between Earth and Neptune are amongst the most commonly observed, yet their properties are poorly constrained. Their transmission spectra are often featureless, which indicate either high-altitude clouds or a high atmospheric metallicity. The archetypical warm Neptune GJ 436b is such a planet showing a flat transmission spectrum in observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy (HRS) effectively probes exoplanet atmospheres at higher altitudes and can therefore be more sensitive to absorption coming from above potential cloud decks. In this paper we aim to investigate this for the exoplanet GJ 436b. We present new CRIRES+ HRS transit data of GJ 436b. Three transits were observed, but since two were during bad weather conditions, only one transit was analyzed. The radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS was used to create atmospheric models for cross-correlation and signal-injection purposes, including absorption from H$_2$O, CH$_4$, and CO. No transmission signals were detected, but atmospheric constraints can be derived. Injection of artificial transmission signals indicate that if GJ 436b would have a cloud deck at pressures P&gt;10 mbar and a &lt;300$\times$ solar metallicity, these CRIRES+ observations should have resulted in a detection. We estimate that the constraints presented here from one ground-based HRS transit are slightly better than those obtained with four HST transits. Combining HRS data from multiple transits is an interesting avenue for future studies of exoplanets with high-altitude clouds.</description>

      <title>NEMESISPY: A Python package for simulating and retrieving exoplanetary spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NEMESISPY is a Python package developed to perform parametric atmospheric modelling and radiative transfer calculation for the retrievals of exoplanetary spectra. It is a recent development of the well-established Fortran NEMESIS library (P. G. J. Irwin et al., 2008), which has been applied to the atmospheric retrievals of both solar system planets and exoplanets employing numerous different observing geometries. NEMESISPY can be easily interfaced with Bayesian inference algorithms to retrieve atmospheric properties from spectroscopic observations. Recently, NEMESISPY has been applied to the retrievals of Hubble and Spitzer data of a hot Jupiter (Yang et al., 2023), as well as to JWST/Mid-Infrared Instrument (JWST/MIRI) data of a hot Jupiter (Yang et al., 2024).</description>

      <title>The Not-So Dramatic Effect of Advective Flows on Gas Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-Earths and mini-Neptunes are the most common types of exoplanets discovered, yet the physics of their formation are still debated. Standard core accretion models in gas-rich environment find that typical mini-Neptune mass planets would blow up into Jupiters before the underlying disk gas dissipates away. The injection of entropy from the protoplanetary disk into forming gaseous envelopes has recently been put forward as a mechanism to delay this runaway accretion, specifically at short orbital distances. Here, we reevaluate this line of reasoning by incorporating recycling flows of gas into a numerical one-dimensional thermodynamic model with more realistic equation of state and opacities and the thermal state of the advective flow. At 0.1 AU, we find that advective flows are only able to produce mini-Neptunes if they can penetrate below ~0.25 of the planet's gravitational sphere of influence. Otherwise, the gas-to-core mass ratio (GCR) reaches above ~10% which is too large to explain the measured properties of mini-Neptunes, necessitating other gas-limiting processes such as late-time core assembly. The effect of entropy advection on gas accretion weakens even further beyond 0.1 AU. We present an updated scaling relation between GCR and the penetration depth of the advective flows which varies non-trivially with orbital distances, core masses and dusty vs. dust-free opacity. We further demonstrate how measurements of planet mass distribution beyond ~1 AU using future instruments such as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope could be used to disambiguate between different formation conditions of gas-poor planets.</description>

      <title>Rocky planet formation in compact disks around M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rocky planets in compact configurations are the most common ones around M dwarfs. Many disks around very low mass stars (between 0.1 and 0.5 M$_\odot$) are rather compact and small (without observable substructures and radius less than 20 au), which favours the idea of an efficient radial drift that could enhance planet formation in compact orbits. We aim to investigate the potential formation paths of the observed close-in rocky exoplanet population around M dwarfs, assuming that planet formation could take place in compact disks with an efficient dust radial drift. We developed N-body simulations that include a sample of embryos growing by pebble accretion exposed to planet-disk interactions, star-planet tidal interactions and general relativistic corrections. For a star of 0.1 M$_\odot$ we considered different gas disk viscosity and initial embryo distributions. We also explore planet formation by pebble accretion around stars of 0.3 and 0.5 M$_\odot$. Lastly, for each stellar mass, we run simulations that include a sample of embryos growing by planetesimal accretion. Our main result is that the sample of simulated planets that grow by pebble accretion in a gas disk with low viscosity ($\alpha=10^{-4}$) can reproduce the close-in low-mass exoplanet population around M dwarfs in terms of multiplicity, masses and semi-major axis. Furthermore, we found that a gas disk with high viscosity ($\alpha=10^{-3}$) can not reproduce the observed planet masses. Also, we show that planetesimal accretion favours the formation of smaller planets than the ones formed by pebble accretion. Rocky planet formation around M dwarfs can take place in compact and small dust disks driven by an efficient radial drift in a gas disk with low viscosity. This result points towards a new approach in the direction of the disk conditions needed for rocky planet formation around very low mass stars.</description>

      <title>Towards a holistic magnetic braking model -- II: explaining several long-term internal- and surface-spin properties of solar-like stars and the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend our model of magnetic braking (MB), driven by an $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo mechanism, from fully convective M-dwarfs (FCMDs) to explain the surface and internal spin $P_\mathrm{spin}$ evolution of partly convective dwarfs (PCDs) starting from the disc-dispersal stage to the main-sequence turnoff. In our model, the spin of the core is governed by shear at the core-envelope boundary while the spin of the envelope is governed by MB and shear. We show that (1) the most massive FCMDs experience a stronger spin-down than PCDs and less massive FCMDs, (2) the stalled spin-down and enhanced activity of K-dwarfs and the pileup of G-dwarfs older than a few Gyr are stellar-structure- and MB-dependent, and weakly dependent on core-envelope coupling effects, (3) our expression of the core-envelope convergence time-scale $\tau_\mathrm{converge}(M_\ast,\,P_\mathrm{spin})$ between a few 10 to 100~Myr strongly depends on stellar structure but weakly on MB strength and shear, such that fast and massive rotators achieve corotation earlier, (4) our estimates of the surface magnetic fields are in general agreement with observations and our wind mass loss evolution explains the weak winds from the solar analog $\pi^1$ UMa and (5) with our model the massive young Sun hypothesis as a solution to the faint young Sun problem can likely be ruled out, because the maximum mass lost by winds from our Sun with our model is about an order of magnitude smaller than required to solve the problem.</description>
