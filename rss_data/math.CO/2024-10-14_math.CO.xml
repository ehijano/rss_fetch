      <title>Higher Specht bases and $q$-series for the cohomology rings of certain Hessenberg varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is conjectured (following the Stanley-Stembridge conjecture) that the cohomology rings of regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties yield permutation representations, but the decompositions of the modules are only known in some cases. For the Hessenberg function $h=(h(1),n,\ldots,n)$, the structure of the cohomology ring was determined by Abe, Horiguchi, and Masuda in 2017. We define two new bases for this cohomology ring, one of which is a higher Specht basis, and the other of which is a permutation basis. We also examine the transpose Hessenberg variety, indexed by the Hessenberg function $h' = ((n-1)^{n-m},n^m)$, and show that analogous results hold. Further, we give combinatorial bijections between the monomials in the new basis and sets of $P$-tableaux, motivated by the work of Gasharov, illustrating the connections between the $\mathfrak{S}_n$ action on these cohomology rings and the Schur expansion of chromatic symmetric functions.</description>

      <title>Hopping Forcing Number in Random $d$-regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hopping forcing is a single player combinatorial game in which the player is presented a graph on $n$ vertices, some of which are initially blue with the remaining vertices being white. In each round $t$, a blue vertex $v$ with all neighbours blue may hop and colour a white vertex blue in the second neighbourhood, provided that $v$ has not performed a hop in the previous $t-1$ rounds. The objective of the game is to eventually colour every vertex blue by repeatedly applying the hopping forcing rule. Subsequently, for a given graph $G$, the hopping forcing number is the minimum number of initial blue vertices that are required to achieve the objective.
  In this paper, we study the hopping forcing number for random $d$-regular graphs. Specifically, we aim to derive asymptotic upper and lower bounds for the hopping forcing number for various values of $d \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>On the total number of ones associated with cranks of partitions modulo 11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2021, Andrews mentioned that George Beck introduced partition statistics $M_w(r,m,n)$, which denote the total number of ones in the partition of $n$ with crank congruent to $r$ modulo $m$. Recently, a number of congruences and identities involving $M_w(r,m,n)$ for some small $m$ have been developed. We establish the 11-dissection of the generating functions for $M_{\omega}(r,11,n)-M_{\omega}(11-r,11,n)$, where $r=1,2,3,4,5$. In particular, we discover a beautiful identity involving $M_{\omega}(r,11,11n+6)$.</description>

      <title>Geometry of $C$-vectors and $C$-Matrices for Mutation-Infinite Quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The set of forks is a class of quivers introduced by M. Warkentin, where every connected mutation-infinite quiver is mutation equivalent to infinitely many forks. Let $Q$ be a fork with $n$ vertices, and $\boldsymbol{w}$ be a fork-preserving mutation sequence. We show that every $c$-vector of $Q$ obtained from $\boldsymbol{w}$ is a solution to a quadratic equation of the form $$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 + \sum_{1\leq i&lt;j\leq n} \pm q_{ij} x_i x_j =1,$$ where $q_{ij}$ is the number of arrows between the vertices $i$ and $j$ in $Q$. The same proof techniques implies that when $Q$ is a rank 3 mutation-cyclic quiver, every $c$-vector of $Q$ is a solution to a quadratic equation of the same form.</description>

      <title>Variants of Baranyai's Theorem with Additional Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical theorem of Baranyai states that, given integers $2\leq k &lt; n$ such that $k$ divides $n$, one can find a family of ${n-1\choose k-1}$ partitions of $[n]$ into $k$-element subsets such that every subset appears in exactly one partition. In this paper, we build on recent work by Katona and Katona in studying partial partitions, or parpartitions, of $[n]$ that consist of $k$-element sets not overlapping significantly. More precisely, two parpartitions $P_1$ and $P_2$ are considered $(\alpha,\beta)$-close for $\alpha,\beta\in (0,1)$ if there exist subsets $A_1\neq B_1\in P_1$ and $A_2\neq B_2\in P_2$ such that $|A_1\cap A_2| &gt; \alpha{k}$ and $|B_1\cap B_2| &gt; \beta{k}$.
  We establish that, given integers $k$, $\ell$, and $n$ satisfying $k^2\ell\leq n$ and $\alpha, \beta\in (0, 1)$ satisfying $\alpha+\beta\geq{(k+2)/k}$, one can find $\lfloor {n\choose
  k}/\ell\rfloor$ $(k, \ell)$-parpartitions of $[n]$ such that no two distinct $(k, \ell)$-parpartitions are $(\alpha,\beta)$-close; this result improves the condition $k=O(1)$ and $\ell=o(\sqrt{n})$ in a corresponding result by Katona and Katona for $\alpha = \beta = 1/2$. We also prove that, given integers $k$, $\ell$, and $n$ satisfying $k=O(1)$ and $\ell=o(\sqrt{n})$, there is a cyclic ordering of the $k$-element subsets of $[n]$ for any chosen $\alpha+\beta\geq{1}$ such that any $\ell$ consecutive $k$-element subsets in the ordering form a $(k, \ell)$-parpartition of $[n]$, which we refer to as a consecutive $(k, \ell)$-parpartition (according to the ordering), and any two of these disjoint consecutive $(k, \ell)$-parpartitions are not $(\alpha,\beta)$-close.</description>

      <title>Canonical Ramsey numbers of sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical Ramsey theorem of Erd\H{o}s and Rado implies that for any graph $H$, any edge-coloring (with an arbitrary number of colors) of a sufficiently large complete graph $K_N$ contains a monochromatic, lexicographic, or rainbow copy of $H$. The least such $N$ is called the Erd\H{o}s-Rado number of $H$, denoted by $ER(H)$. Erd\H{o}s-Rado numbers of cliques have received considerable attention, and in this paper we extend this line of research by studying Erd\H{o}s-Rado numbers of sparse graphs. For example, we prove that if $H$ has bounded degree, then $ER(H)$ is polynomial in $|V(H)|$ if $H$ is bipartite, but exponential in general.
  We also study the closely-related problem of constrained Ramsey numbers. For a given tree $S$ and given path $P_t$, we study the minimum $N$ such that every edge-coloring of $K_N$ contains a monochromatic copy of $S$ or a rainbow copy of $P_t$. We prove a nearly optimal upper bound for this problem, which differs from the best known lower bound by a function of inverse-Ackermann type.</description>

      <title>Metric Dimension of Villarceau Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metric dimension of a graph measures how uniquely vertices may be identified using a set of landmark vertices. This concept is frequently used in the study of network architecture, location-based problems and communication. Given a graph $G$, the metric dimension, denoted as $\dim(G)$, is the minimum size of a resolving set, a subset of vertices such that for every pair of vertices in $G$, there exists a vertex in the resolving set whose shortest path distance to the two vertices is different. This subset of vertices helps to uniquely determine the location of other vertices in the graph. A basis is a resolving set with a least cardinality. Finding a basis is a problem with practical applications in network design, where it is important to efficiently locate and identify nodes based on a limited set of reference points. The Cartesian product of $P_m$ and $P_n$ is the grid network in network science. In this paper, we investigate two novel types of grids in network science: the Villarceau grid Type I and Type II. For each of these grid types, we find the precise metric dimension.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of planar bipartite tight irreducible maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider planar bipartite maps which are both tight, i.e. without vertices of degree $1$, and $2b$-irreducible, i.e. such that each cycle has length at least $2b$ and such that any cycle of length exactly $2b$ is the contour of a face. It was shown by Budd that the number $\mathcal N_n^{(b)}$ of such maps made out of a fixed set of $n$ faces with prescribed even degrees is a polynomial in both $b$ and the face degrees. In this paper, we give an explicit expression for $\mathcal N_n^{(b)}$ by a direct bijective approach based on the so-called slice decomposition. More precisely, we decompose any of the maps at hand into a collection of $2b$-irreducible tight slices and a suitable two-face map. We show how to bijectively encode each $2b$-irreducible slice via a $b$-decorated tree drawn on its derived map, and how to enumerate collections thereof. We then discuss the polynomial counting of two-face maps, and show how to combine it with the former enumeration to obtain $\mathcal N_n^{(b)}$.</description>

      <title>A convex ear decomposition of the augmented Bergman complex of a matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article concerns the face enumeration of augmented Bergman complexes of matroids, introduced by Braden, Huh, Matherne, Proudfoot and Wang. We prove that the augmented Bergman complex of any matroid admits a convex ear decomposition and deduce that augmented Bergman complexes are doubly Cohen--Macaulay and that they have top-heavy $h$-vectors. We provide some formulas for computing the $h$-polynomials of these complexes and exhibit examples which show that, in general, they are neither log-concave nor unimodal.</description>

      <title>Separating hypergraph Tur\'an densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s asked whether, similarly as for graphs, the Tur\'an density of $K_4^{(3)}$ is the same as that of $K_5^{(3)-}$. This was disproved by Markstr\"om using a proof that relied on computer-aided flag algebra calculations. Here we give a flag-algebra-free proof that for all $k\geq 3$, $\pi(K_{k+1}^{(k)})&lt;\pi(K_{k+2}^{(k)-})$. We further illustrate our methods by separating the Tur\'an densities of other hypergraphs without relying on explicit bounds. For instance, we show that $\pi(K_{\ell}^{(k)})&lt;\pi(K_{\ell+1}^{(k)})$, for all $\ell&gt; k\geq3$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse theory for Gowers uniformity norms is one of the central topics in additive combinatorics and one of the most important aspects of the theory is the question of bounds. In this paper, we prove a quasipolynomial inverse theorem for the $\mathsf{U}^4$ norm in finite vector spaces. The proof follows a different strategy compared to the existing quantitative inverse theorems. In particular, the argument relies on a novel argument, which we call the abstract Balog-Szemer\'edi-Gowers theorem, and combines several other ingredients such as algebraic regularity method, bilinear Bogolyubov argument and algebraic dependent random choice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Erd\H{o}s-Rado canonization theorem generalizes Ramsey's theorem to edge-colorings with an unbounded number of colors, in the sense that for $n = ER(m)$ sufficiently large, any edge-coloring of $E(K_n) \to \mathbb{N}$ will yield some copy of $K_m$ which is colored according to one of four canonical patterns. In this paper, we show that in the bipartite setting, the bipartite Erd\H{o}s-Rado number $ER_B(m)$ satisfies \[ \log ER_B(m) = \Theta(m \log m). \] Comparing this to the non-bipartite setting, the best known lower and upper bounds on $\log ER(m)$ are still separated by a factor of $\log m$.</description>

      <title>Tropical subrepresentations of the boolean regular representation in low dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two dimensional and three dimensional tropical subrepresentations of the regular representation $\mathbb{B}[G]$ of a finite group over the tropical booleans, utilizing the theory of group representations over a fixed idempotent semifield as developed by Giansiracusa--Manaker. In dimension two we completely classify all two dimensional tropical subrepresentations of $\mathbb{B}[G]$, provide an explicit characterization for the set of bases of the corresponding matroids, and show an equivalence with the subgroups of $G$. In dimension three we show such an equivalence no longer holds. Towards a classification in dimension three we give a collection of tropical subrepresentations corresponding to subgroups of index 2, and we show that in the special case of finite cyclic groups, one can find three dimensional tropical subrepresentations that do not correspond to subgroups in a similar way.</description>

      <title>Heating Up Quasi-Monte Carlo Graph Random Features: A Diffusion Kernel Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build upon a recently introduced class of quasi-graph random features (q-GRFs), which have demonstrated the ability to yield lower variance estimators of the 2-regularized Laplacian kernel (Choromanski 2023). Our research investigates whether similar results can be achieved with alternative kernel functions, specifically the Diffusion (or Heat), Mat\'ern, and Inverse Cosine kernels. We find that the Diffusion kernel performs most similarly to the 2-regularized Laplacian, and we further explore graph types that benefit from the previously established antithetic termination procedure. Specifically, we explore Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and Barab\'asi-Albert random graph models, Binary Trees, and Ladder graphs, with the goal of identifying combinations of specific kernel and graph type that benefit from antithetic termination. We assert that q-GRFs achieve lower variance estimators of the Diffusion (or Heat) kernel on Ladder graphs. However, the number of rungs on the Ladder graphs impacts the algorithm's performance; further theoretical results supporting our experimentation are forthcoming. This work builds upon some of the earliest Quasi-Monte Carlo methods for kernels defined on combinatorial objects, paving the way for kernel-based learning algorithms and future real-world applications in various domains.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Regret for Unconstrained Submodular Maximization Stochastic Bandit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the online unconstrained submodular maximization problem (Online USM), in a setting with stochastic bandit feedback. In this framework, a decision-maker receives noisy rewards from a nonmonotone submodular function, taking values in a known bounded interval. This paper proposes Double-Greedy - Explore-then-Commit (DG-ETC), adapting the Double-Greedy approach from the offline and online full-information settings. DG-ETC satisfies a O(d log(dT)) problemdependent upper bound for the 1/2-approximate pseudo-regret, as well as a O(dT^{2/3}log(dT)^{1/3}) problem-free one at the same time, outperforming existing approaches. To that end, we introduce a notion of hardness for submodular functions, characterizing how difficult it is to maximize them with this type of strategy.</description>

Abstract: We obtain a complete characterization of the space of matrix elements dual to the graded multiplicity space arising from fusion products of Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules over special twisted current algebras defined by Kus and Venkatesh, which generalizes the result of Ardonne and Kedem to the special twisted current algebras. We also prove the conjectural identity of $q$-graded fermionic sums by Hatayama \emph{et al.} for the special twisted current algebras, from which we deduce that the graded tensor product multiplicities of the fusion products of Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules over special twisted current algebras are both given by the $q$-graded fermionic sums, and constant term evaluations of products of solutions of the quantum twisted $Q$-systems obtained by Di Francesco and Kedem.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Polygonal Cluster Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a new family of noncommutative generalizations of cluster algebras called polygonal cluster algebras. These algebras generalize the noncommutative surfaces of Berenstein-Retakh, and are inspired by the emerging theory of $\Theta$-positivity for the groups $\mathrm{Spin}(p,q)$. They are generated by mutations of quivers which we call ST-compatible, and which encode the order of the products that appear in the exchange relations. We show that these ST-compatible quivers can be represented by tilings of surfaces by polygons, a generalization of the description of surface type cluster algebras. As examples, we construct tilings which produce ST-compatible versions of the Del Pezzo quivers and the quivers first described by Le for Fock-Goncharov coordinates for Lie groups of type $B$. We show that polygonal cluster algebras have natural evaluations in Clifford algebras, which we use to produce noncommutative generalizations of the Somos sequences and to parameterize the $\Theta$-positive semigroup of $\mathrm{Spin}(2,n)$. We indicate how this will be done for the semigroup in $\mathrm{Spin}(p,q)$ and how one will give coordinates for general $\Theta$-positive representations into $\mathrm{Spin}(p,q)$.</description>

      <title>Block coupling and rapidly mixing k-heights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $k$-height on a graph $G=(V, E)$ is an assignment $V\to\{0, \ldots, k\}$ such that the value on ajacent vertices differs by at most $1$. We study the Markov chain on $k$-heights that in each step selects a vertex at random, and, if admissible, increases or decreases the value at this vertex by one. In the cases of $2$-heights and $3$-heights we show that this Markov chain is rapidly mixing on certain families of grid-like graphs and on planar cubic $3$-connected graphs.
  The result is based on a novel technique called block coupling, which is derived from the well-established monotone coupling approach. This technique may also be effective when analyzing other Markov chains that operate on configurations of spin systems that form a distributive lattice. It is therefore of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the geometry and the arithmetic of a family of polytopal sphere packings induced by regular polytopes in any dimension. We prove that every integral polytope is crystallographic, and we show that there are 11 crystallographic regular polytopes in any dimension. After introducing the notion of Apollonian section, we determine which Platonic crystallographic packings emerge as cross-sections of the Apollonian arrangements of the regular 4-polytopes. Additionally, we compute the M\"obius spectrum of every regular polytope.</description>

      <title>Trees with many leaves in tournaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.06384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sumner's universal tournament conjecture states that every $(2n-2)$-vertex tournament should contain a copy of every $n$-vertex oriented tree. If we know the number of leaves of an oriented tree, or its maximum degree, can we guarantee a copy of the tree with fewer vertices in the tournament? Due to work initiated by H\"aggkvist and Thomason (for number of leaves) and K\"uhn, Mycroft and Osthus (for maximum degree), it is known that improvements can be made over Sumner's conjecture in some cases, and indeed sometimes an $(n+o(n))$-vertex tournament may be sufficient.
  In this paper, we give new results on these problems. Specifically, we show
  i) for every $\alpha&gt;0$, there exists $n_0\in\mathbb{N}$ such that, whenever $n\geqslant n_0$, every $((1+\alpha)n+k)$-vertex tournament contains a copy of every $n$-vertex oriented tree with $k$ leaves, and
  ii) for every $\alpha&gt;0$, there exists $c&gt;0$ and $n_0\in\mathbb{N}$ such that, whenever $n\geqslant n_0$, every $(1+\alpha)n$-vertex tournament contains a copy of every $n$-vertex oriented tree with maximum degree $\Delta(T)\leqslant cn$.
  Our first result gives an asymptotic form of a conjecture by Havet and Thomass\'e, while the second improves a result of Mycroft and Naia which applies to trees with polylogarithmic maximum degree.</description>

      <title>Sharp bounds for rainbow matchings in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose we are given matchings $M_1,....,M_N$ of size $t$ in some $r$-uniform hypergraph, and let us think of each matching having a different color. How large does $N$ need to be (in terms of $t$ and $r$) such that we can always find a rainbow matching of size $t$? This problem was first introduced by Aharoni and Berger, and has since been studied by several different authors. For example, Alon discovered an intriguing connection with the Erd\H{o}s--Ginzburg--Ziv problem from additive combinatorics, which implies certain lower bounds for $N$.
  For any fixed uniformity $r \ge 3$, we answer this problem up to constant factors depending on $r$, showing that the answer is on the order of $t^{r}$. Furthermore, for any fixed $t$ and large $r$, we determine the answer up to lower order factors. We also prove analogous results in the setting where the underlying hypergraph is assumed to be $r$-partite. Our results settle questions of Alon and of Glebov-Sudakov-Szab\'{o}.</description>

      <title>Cops and Robber -- When Capturing is not Surrounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider "surrounding" versions of the classic Cops and Robber game. The game is played on a connected graph in which two players, one controlling a number of cops and the other controlling a robber, take alternating turns. In a turn, each player may move each of their pieces: The robber always moves between adjacent vertices. Regarding the moves of the cops we distinguish four versions that differ in whether the cops are on the vertices or the edges of the graph and whether the robber may move on/through them. The goal of the cops is to surround the robber, i.e., occupying all neighbors (vertex version) or incident edges (edge version) of the robber's current vertex. In contrast, the robber tries to avoid being surrounded indefinitely. Given a graph, the so-called cop number denotes the minimum number of cops required to eventually surround the robber. We relate the different cop numbers of these versions and prove that none of them is bounded by a function of the classical cop number and the maximum degree of the graph, thereby refuting a conjecture by Crytser, Komarov and Mackey [Graphs and Combinatorics, 2020].</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Interpretations of $q$-Fibonacci Numbers and Their Binomial Analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fibonomial coefficients are well-known analogues of the classical binomial coefficients. In 2009, Sagan and Savage introduced a combinatorial interpretation for these coefficients, based on tiling a rectangular grid. More recently, Bergeron extended this work by providing a similar interpretation for the q-Fibonomial coefficients, using weighted tilings of a rectangular grid. Inspired by Bennett's model, Bergeron also developed a staircase tiling model for the q-Fibonomial coefficients. While Bergeron's proofs for the rectangular grid model relied on induction, and the staircase model on bijective correspondences with the rectangular grid model, these approaches lacked deeper structural insights. In this paper, we propose a novel model for the q-Fibonacci numbers that generalizes Bergeron's approach. This new model not only enables us to prove several identities related to q-Fibonacci numbers but also provides a non-bijective proof for the staircase model of the q-Fibonomial coefficients, offering greater structural clarity. Additionally, we demonstrate new identities involving the q-Fibonomial coefficients using this refined rectangular grid model, further enhancing the combinatorial understanding of these mathematical objects.</description>

Abstract: The $n$-dimensional random twisted hypercube $\mathbf{G}_n$ is constructed recursively by taking two instances of $\mathbf{G}_{n-1}$, with any joint distribution, and adding a random perfect matching between their vertex sets. Benjamini, Dikstein, Gross, and Zhukovskii showed that its diameter is $O(n\log \log \log n/\log \log n)$ with high probability and at least ${(n - 1)/ \log_2 n}$. We improve their upper bound by showing that $$\operatorname{diam}(\mathbf{G}_n) = \big(1 + o(1)\big) \frac{n}{\log_2 n}$$ with high probability.</description>

      <title>Recognition of chordal graphs and cographs which are Cover-Incomparability graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13964v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cover-Incomparability graphs (C-I graphs) are an interesting class of graphs from posets. A C-I graph is a graph from a poset $P=(V,\le)$ with vertex set $V$, and the edge-set is the union of edge sets of the cover graph and the incomparability graph of the poset. The recognition of the C-I graphs is known to be NP-complete (Maxov\'{a} et al., Order 26(3), 229--236(2009)). In this paper, we prove that chordal graphs having at most two independent simplicial vertices are exactly the chordal graphs which are also C-I graphs. A similar result is obtained for cographs as well. Using the structural results of these graphs, we derive linear time recognition algorithms for chordal graphs and cographs which are C-I graphs.</description>

Abstract: We study multiport networks, common in electrical engineering. They have boundary conditions different from electrical networks: the boundary vertices are split into pairs and the sum of the incoming currents is set to be zero in each pair. If one sets the voltage difference for each pair, then the incoming currents are uniquely determined. We generalize Kirchhoff's matrix-tree theorem to this setup. Different forests now contribute with different signs, making the proof subtle. In particular, we use the formula for the response matrix minors by R. Kenyon-D. Wilson, determinantal identities, and combinatorial bijections. We introduce superport networks, generalizing both ordinary networks and multiport ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A folklore result on matchings in graphs states that if $G$ is a bipartite graph whose vertex classes $A$ and $B$ each have size $n$, with $\mathrm{deg}(u) \geq a$ for every $u \in A$ and $\mathrm{deg}(v) \geq b$ for every $v \in B$, then $G$ admits a matching of size $\min\{n, a+b\}$. In this paper we establish the analogous result for large $k$-partite $k$-uniform hypergraphs, answering a question of Han, Zang and Zhao, who previously demonstrated that this result holds under the additional condition that the minimum degrees into at least two of the vertex classes are large. A key part of our proof is a study of rainbow matchings under a combination of degree and multiplicity conditions, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive formal general formulas for noncommutative exponentiation and the exponential function, while also revisiting an unrecognized, and yet powerful theorem. These tools are subsequently applied to derive counterparts for the exponential identity $e^{A+B} = e^A e^B$ and the binomial theorem $(A+B)^n = \sum \binom{n}{k} A^k B^{n-k}$ when the commutator $[B, A]$ is either an arbitrary quadratic polynomial or a monomial in $A$ or $B$. Analogous formulas are found when the commutator is bivariate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel operator bridging between the normal and antinormal ordered forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semidirected networks have received interest in evolutionary biology as the appropriate generalization of unrooted trees to networks, in which some but not all edges are directed. Yet these networks lack proper theoretical study. We define here a general class of semidirected phylogenetic networks, with a stable set of leaves, tree nodes and hybrid nodes. We prove that for these networks, if we locally choose the direction of one edge, then globally the set of directed paths starting by this edge is stable across all choices to root the network. We define an edge-based representation of semidirected phylogenetic networks and use it to define a dissimilarity between networks, which can be efficiently computed in near-quadratic time. Our dissimilarity extends the widely-used Robinson-Foulds distance on both rooted trees and unrooted trees. After generalizing the notion of tree-child networks to semidirected networks, we prove that our edge-based dissimilarity is in fact a distance on the space of tree-child semidirected phylogenetic networks.</description>

      <title>An integral representation of Catalan numbers using Malmst\'en's formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we propose an integral expression of the Catalan numbers, based on Malmst\'en's definite-integral representation of $\ln\left[\Gamma(x)\right]$, $\Gamma$ being the usual Gamma function. The obtained expression is likely to yield new summations involving Catalan numbers or central binomial coefficients.</description>

      <title>A degenerate version of Brion's formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{p} \subset V$ be a polytope and $\xi \in V_{\mathbb{C}}^*$. We obtain an expression for $I(\mathfrak{p}; \alpha) := \int_{\mathfrak{p}} e^{\langle \alpha, x \rangle} dx$ as a sum of meromorphic functions in $\alpha \in V^*_{\mathbb{C}}$ parametrized by the faces $\mathfrak{f}$ of $\mathfrak{p}$ on which $\langle \xi, x \rangle$ is constant. Each term only depends on the local geometry of $\mathfrak{p}$ near $\mathfrak{f}$ (and on $\xi$) and is holomorphic at $\alpha = \xi$. When $\langle \xi, \cdot \rangle$ is only constant on the vertices of $\mathfrak{p}$ our formula reduces to Brion's formula.
  Suppose $\mathfrak{p}$ is a rational polytope with respect to a lattice $\Lambda$. We obtain an expression for $S(\mathfrak{p}; \alpha) := \sum_{\lambda \in \mathfrak{p} \cap \Lambda} e^{\langle \alpha, \lambda \rangle}$ as a sum of meromorphic functions parametrized by the faces $\mathfrak{f}$ on which $e^{\langle \xi, x \rangle} = 1$ on a finite index sublattice of $\text{lin}(\mathfrak{f}) \cap \Lambda$. Each term only depends on the local geometry of $\mathfrak{p}$ near $\mathfrak{f}$ (and on $\xi$ and $\Lambda$) and is holomorphic at $\alpha = \xi$. When $e^{\langle \xi, \cdot \rangle} \neq 1$ at any non-zero lattice point on a line through the origin parallel to an edge of $\mathfrak{p}$, our formula reduces to Brion's formula, and when $\xi = 0$, it reduces to the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial.
  Our formulas are particularly useful for understanding how $I(\mathfrak{p}(h); \xi)$ and $S(\mathfrak{p}(h); \xi)$ vary in a family of polytopes $\mathfrak{p}(h)$ with the same normal fan. When considering dilates of a fixed polytope, our formulas may be viewed as polytopal analogues of Laplace's method and the method of stationary phase. Such expressions naturally show up in analysis on symmetric spaces and affine buildings.</description>

      <title>Solutions for $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers using Fuss-Catalan numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new expressions for the $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers, say $F_k(n)$.
  They satisfy the recurrence $F_k(n) = F_k(n-1) +\dots+F_k(n-k)$.
  Explicit expressions for the roots of the auxiliary (or characteristic) polynomial are presented, using Fuss-Catalan numbers.
  Properties of the roots are enumerated.
  We quantify the accuracy of asymptotic approximations for $F_k(n)$ for $n\gg1$.
  Our results subsume and extend some results published by previous authors.
  We also comment on the use of multinomial sums for the $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers and related sequences.
  We also employ the generating function to express $F_k(n)$ as a concise (non-nested) sum of binomial coefficients for arbitrary $k$.
  Finally, we present a basis (or `fundamental solutions') to solve the above recurrence for arbitrary initial conditions.</description>

      <title>$f$-vectors of balanced simplicial complexes, flag spheres, and geometric Lefschetz decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there are $f$-vectors of balanced simplicial complexes giving a source of simplicial complexes exhibiting a Boolean decomposition similar to a geometric Lefschetz decomposition. The objects we are working with are $h$-vectors of flag spheres and balanced simplicial complexes whose $f$-vectors are equal to them. This builds on work of Nevo--Petersen--Tenner on a conjecture of Nevo--Petersen that the gamma vector of an odd-dimensional flag sphere is the $f$-vector of a balanced simplicial complex (which was shown for barycentric subdivisions by Nevo--Petersen--Tenner). We can connect our decomposition to positivity questions on reciprocal/palindromic polynomials associated to flag spheres and geometric questions motivating them. In addition, we note that the degrees in the Lefschetz-like decomposition are not halved unlike the usual $h$-vector setting.</description>

      <title>Towards a conjecture on a special class of matrices over commutative rings of characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the conjecture posed by Keller and Rosemarin at Eurocrypt 2021 on the nullity of a matrix polynomial of a block matrix with Hadamard type blocks over commutative rings of characteristic 2. Therefore, it confirms the conjectural optimal bound on the dimension of invariant subspace of the Starkad cipher using the HADES design strategy. Moreover, we reveal the algebraic structure formed by Hadamard matrices over commutative rings from the perspectives of group algebra and polynomial algebra. An interesting relation between block-Hadamard matrices and Hadamard-block matrices is obtained as well.</description>

      <title>Earthquake theorem for cluster algebras of finite type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.15226v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a cluster algebraic generalization of Thurston's earthquake map for the cluster algebras of finite type, which we call the \emph{cluster earthquake map}. It is defined by gluing exponential maps, which is modeled after the earthquakes along ideal arcs. We prove an analogue of the earthquake theorem, which states that the cluster earthquake map gives a homeomorphism between the spaces of $\mathbb{R}^\mathrm{trop}$- and $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$-valued points of the cluster $\mathcal{X}$-variety. For those of type $A_n$ and $D_n$, the cluster earthquake map indeed recovers the earthquake maps for marked disks and once-punctured marked disks, respectively. Moreover, we investigate certain asymptotic behaviors of the cluster earthquake map, which give rise to "continuous deformations" of the Fock--Goncharov fan.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem for crossings in randomly embedded graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the number of crossings in a random embedding of a graph, $G$, with vertices in convex position. We give explicit formulas for the mean and variance of the number of crossings as a function of various subgraph counts of $G$. Using Stein's method and size-bias coupling, we establish an upper bound on the Kolmogorov distance between the distribution of the number of crossings and a standard normal random variable. We also consider the case where $G$ is a random graph and obtain a Kolmogorov bound between the distribution of crossings and a Gaussian mixture distribution. As applications, we obtain central limit theorems with convergence rates for the number of crossings in random embeddings of matchings, path graphs, cycle graphs, disjoint union of triangles, random $d$-regular graphs, and mixtures of random graphs.</description>

      <title>On the $p$-torsional rigidity of combinatorial graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $p$-\emph{torsion function} and the corresponding $p$-\emph{torsional rigidity} associated with $p$-Laplacians and, more generally, $p$-Schr\"odinger operators, for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, on possibly infinite combinatorial graphs. We present sufficient criteria for the existence of a summable $p$-torsion function and we derive several upper and lower bounds for the $p$-torsional rigidity. Our methods are mostly based on novel surgery principles. As an application, we also find some new estimates on the bottom of the spectrum of the $p$-Laplacian with Dirichlet conditions, thus complementing some results recently obtained in: Jos\'e M. Maz\'on, Julian Toledo, Torsional rigidity in random walk spaces, in a more general setting. Finally, we prove a Kohler-Jobin inequality for combinatorial graphs (for $p=2$): to the best of our knowledge, graphs thus become the third ambient where a Kohler-Jobin inequality is known to hold.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Sphere Sizes in the Sum-Rank Metric and Coordinate-Additive Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides new bounds on the size of spheres in any coordinate-additive metric with a particular focus on improving existing bounds in the sum-rank metric. We derive improved upper and lower bounds based on the entropy of a distribution related to the Boltzmann distribution, which work for any coordinate-additive metric. Additionally, we derive new closed-form upper and lower bounds specifically for the sum-rank metric that outperform existing closed-form bounds.</description>
