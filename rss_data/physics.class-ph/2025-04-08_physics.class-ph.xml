      <title>Electromagnetic Helicity in Twisted Cavity Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through left- or right-handed twisting, we investigate the impact of mirror-asymmetry (chirality) of the conducting boundary conditions of an equilaterial triangular cross-section electromagnetic resonator. We observe the generation of eigenmodes with non-zero electromagnetic helicity as a result of the coupling of near degenerate TE$_{11(p+1)}$ and TM$_{11p}$ modes. This can be interpreted as an emergence of magneto-electric coupling, which in turn produces a measurable shift in resonant mode frequency as a function of twist angle. We show that this coupling mechanism is equivalent to introducing a non-zero chirality material parameter $\kappa_\text{eff}$ or axion field $\theta_{\text{eff}}$ to the medium. Our findings demonstrate the potential for real-time, macroscopic manipulation of electromagnetic helicity.</description>

      <title>Three strongly coupled Kerr parametric oscillators forming a Boltzmann machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) are a promising resource for classical and quantum analog computation, for example to find the ground state of Ising Hamiltonians. Yet, the state space of strongly coupled KPO networks is very involved. As such, their phase diagram sometimes features either too few or too many states, including some that cannot be mapped to Ising spin configurations. This complexity makes it challenging to find and meet the conditions under which an analog optimization algorithm can be successful. Here, we demonstrate how to use three strongly coupled KPOs as a simulator for an Ising Hamiltonian, and estimate its ground state using a Boltzmann sampling measurement. While fully classical, our work is directly relevant for quantum systems operating on coherent states.</description>

      <title>Lines of Bound States in the Continuum in a Phononic Crystal Slab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that bound states in the continuum (BICs) form continuous lines along high-symmetry directions of momentum space in a simple phononic crystal slab. Contrary to common sense, these BICs are symmetry-protected (SP) BICs not only at the center of the Brillouin zone (gamma point) but also off the gamma point. We utilize numerical simulations, a group theory method, and a mode expansion method to comprehensively understand the formation of the BICs. It is revealed that these BICs correspond to phase singularity lines of far-field radiation, and the phase winding number can be defined as a topological index. This makes the BICs topologically protected and robust to any parameter variation that maintains periodicity and rotational symmetry. Finally, the generation of the BICs lines is experimentally demonstrated.</description>

      <title>An optimal baseline selection methodology for data-driven damage detection and temperature compensation in acousto-ultrasonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global trends in the construction of modern structures require the integration of sensors together with data recording and analysis modules so that their integrity can be continuously monitored for safe-life, economic and ecological reasons. This process of measuring and analyzing the data from a distributed sensor network all over a structural system in order to quantify its condition is known as structural health monitoring (SHM). Guided ultrasonic wave-based techniques are increasingly being adapted and used in several SHM systems which benefit from built-in transduction, large inspection ranges, and high sensitivity to small flaws. Nonetheless, for the design of a trustworthy health monitoring system, a vast amount of information regarding the inherent physical characteristics of the sources and their propagation and interaction across the structure is crucial. Moreover, any SHM system which is expected to transition to field operation must take into account the influence of environmental and operational changes which cause modifications in the stiffness and damping of the structure and consequently modify its dynamic behaviour. On that account, special attention is paid in this paper to the development of an efficient SHM methodology where robust signal processing and pattern recognition techniques are integrated for the correct interpretation of complex ultrasonic waves within the context of damage detection and identification. The methodology is based on an acousto-ultrasonics technique where the discrete wavelet transform is evaluated for feature extraction and selection, linear principal component analysis for data-driven modelling and selforganizing maps for a two-level clustering under the principle of local density. At the end, the methodology is experimentally demonstrated and results show that all the damages were detectable and identifiable.</description>

      <title>Note on the transformation from the Lorenz gauge to the Coulomb gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16530v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a simple formula for the gauge function of the transformation from the Lorenz gauge to the Coulomb gauge, valid under a condition that is satisfied by some charge densities employed in the literature. An equation for the gauge function of this transformation that is alternative but equivalent to a formula of Jackson is derived also.</description>

      <title>Optimal damping adapted to a set of initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vibrating systems can respond to an infinite number of initial conditions and the overall dynamics of the system can be strongly affected by them. Therefore, it is of practical importance to have methods by which we can determine the damping that is in some sense optimal for all initial conditions, or for a given set of initial conditions. For a single and multi degree of freedom systems, we determine the optimal damping coefficients adapted to different sets of initial conditions using the known method of minimizing the (zero to infinity) time integral of the energy of the system, averaged over a set of initial conditions, and using two new methods that we introduce. One method is based on determining the damping for which the energy of the system, averaged over a set of initial conditions, drops the fastest to a given threshold value. The other method is based on determining the damping that gives minimal average settling time of the system, where we take that the system settled when its energy dropped to a given threshold value. We show that the two new methods give results for optimal damping that are in excellent agreement with each other, but are significantly different from the results given by the minimization of the average energy integral. More precisely, for considered multi degree of freedom systems and sets of initial conditions, the two new methods give optimal damping coefficients that converge to the critical damping of the first mode as the target energy threshold decreases. On the other hand, for these same systems and sets of initial conditions, the method of minimizing the average energy integral gives optimal damping coefficients which are deep in the overdamped regime with respect to the first mode.</description>
