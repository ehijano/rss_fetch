      <title>Stochastic Dynamics of Urban Predator-Prey Systems: Integrating Human Disturbance and Functional Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban ecosystems exhibit complex predator-prey dynamics increasingly disrupted by anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., noise, habitat fragmentation). Classical Lotka-Volterra (LV) models fail to capture these human-induced stressors, and integrated frameworks incorporating functional responses, stochasticity, and spatial dynamics remain scarce. We develop a comprehensive stochastic model to quantify how human disturbance reshapes predator-prey interactions in urban landscapes, using rat-cat systems as a case study. Our framework extends the LV model to incorporate: (i) human disturbance as an external mortality factor, (ii) Holling Type III functional responses to model predation saturation and prey refugia, (iii) multiplicative noise and periodic forcing to capture stochastic disturbance regimes, and (iv) spatial diffusion across fragmented habitats. We non-dimensionalize the system to generalize dynamics and analyze stability, bifurcations, and noise-induced transitions. Numerical simulations (MATLAB) reveal three key outcomes: (1) Human disturbance disrupts classical oscillations, inducing quasi-periodic cycles and elevating extinction risks; (2) Stochasticity lowers collapse thresholds by 25% compared to deterministic predictions; (3) Spatial diffusion drives pattern formation (e.g., disturbance shadows, prey hotspots) through habitat coupling. Results highlight the extreme vulnerability of urban wildlife to anthropogenic pressures, demonstrating how disturbance intensity governs system stability. The model provides a predictive framework for conservation strategies, emphasizing refuge enhancement and phased interventions synchronized with population cycles.</description>

      <title>Predator-prey models with memory and kicks: Exact solution and discrete maps with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we proposed new predator-prey models that take into account memory and kicks. Memory is understood as the dependence of current behavior on the history of past behavior. The equations of these proposed models are generalizations of the Lotka-Volterra and Kolmogorov equations by using the Caputo fractional derivative of non-integer order and periodic kicks. This fractional derivative allows us to take into account memory with power-law fading. The periodic kicks, which are described by Dirac delta-functions, take into account short duration of interaction between predators and prey. For the proposed equations, which are fractional differential equations with kicks, we obtain exact solutions that describe behaviors of predator and prey with power-law fading memory. Using these exact solutions, we derive, without using any approximations, new discrete maps with memory that represent the proposed predator-prey models with memory.</description>

      <title>Predicted decline in common bird and butterfly species despite conservation policies in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to increasing threats to biodiversity, conservation objectives have been set at national and international level, with the aim of halting biodiversity decline by reducing direct anthropogenic pressures on species. However, the potential effects of conservation policies derived from these objectives on common species remain rarely studied. Common species are often not the primary species targeted by conservation measures and can be distributed across a wide range of habitats that may be affected differently by these measures. We analyse the effect of a range of pressures related to climate, land use and land use intensity, on 263 common bird and 144 common butterfly species from more than 20,000 sites between 2000 and 2021 across 26 European countries. We use land-use and land-use-intensity change scenarios produced previously using the IPBES Nature Futures Framework to support the achievement of conservation objectives, as well as climate change scenarios in order to project the future of biodiversity pressures in Europe up to 2050. To project the future of common biodiversity in these scenarios, we translate these pressure changes into expected variations of abundances for all common bird and butterfly species, as well as for the multi-species indicators used to monitor common biodiversity status in Europe. The projected trends are improved, while still declining, for birds in particular farmland species under the scenarios that meet the conservation objectives, with few effects on butterflies. No scenario shows a stop or a reversal in the decline in abundance of bird and butterfly species that are currently common, on the time scale considered. Our results therefore call into question the fate of common biodiversity under the current conservation policies and the need for other anticipatory frameworks that do not implicitly require a growing need for natural resources.</description>

      <title>On a Neutral Host-Virus Model with Recombination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by observations in sequence data of herpesviruses, we introduce a multi-locus model for the joint evolution of different genotypes in a virus population that is distributed across a population of hosts. In the model, virus particles replicate, recombine, and mutate within their hosts at rates that act on different time scales. Furthermore, virus particles are exchanged between hosts at reinfection events and hosts are replaced by primary infected hosts when they die. We determine the asymptotic type distribution observed in a single host in the limit of large host and virus populations under asymptotic rate assumptions by tracing back the ancestry of the sample. The proposed model may serve as a null model for the evolution of virus populations that are capable of persistence and can be used to estimate the strengths of different evolutionary forces driving genetic diversity, see also [4].</description>

      <title>A dichotomy law for certain classes of phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many classes of phylogenetic networks have been proposed in the literature. A feature of several of these classes is that if one restricts a network in the class to a subset of its leaves, then the resulting network may no longer lie within this class. This has implications for their biological applicability, since some species -- which are the leaves of an underlying evolutionary network -- may be missing (e.g., they may have become extinct, or there are no data available for them) or we may simply wish to focus attention on a subset of the species. On the other hand, certain classes of networks are `closed' when we restrict to subsets of leaves, such as (i) the classes of all phylogenetic networks or all phylogenetic trees; (ii) the classes of galled networks, simplicial networks, galled trees; and (iii) the classes of networks that have some parameter that is monotone-under-leaf-subsampling (e.g., the number of reticulations, height, etc.) bounded by some fixed value. It is easily shown that a closed subclass of phylogenetic trees is either all trees or a vanishingly small proportion of them (as the number of leaves grows). In this short paper, we explore whether this dichotomy phenomenon holds for other classes of phylogenetic networks, and their subclasses.</description>

      <title>Effective decoupling of mutations and the resulting loss of biodiversity caused by environmental change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many biological populations exhibit diversity in their strategy for survival and reproduction in a given environment, and microbes are an example. We explore the fate of different strategies under sustained environmental change by considering a mathematical model for a large population of asexual organisms. Fitness is a bimodal function of a quantitative trait, with two local optima, separated by a local minimum, i.e., a mixture of stabilising and disruptive selection. The optima represent two locally `best' trait values. We consider regimes where, when the environment is unchanging, the equilibrium distribution of the trait is bimodal. A bimodal trait distribution generally requires, for its existence, mutational coupling between the two peaks, and it indicates two coexisting clones with distinct survival and reproduction strategies. When subject to persistent environmental change, the population adapts by utilising mutations that allow it to track the changing environment. The faster the rate of change of the environment, the larger the effect of the mutations that are utilised. Under persistent environmental change, the distribution of trait values takes two different forms. At low rates of change, the distribution remains bimodal. At higher rates, the distribution becomes unimodal. This loss of a clone/biodiversity is driven by a novel mechanism where environmental change decouples a class of mutations.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Impulsive Releases: A Species Competition Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on optimizing species release $S_2$ to control species population $S_1$ through impulsive release strategies. We investigate the conditions required to remove species $S_1$, which is equivalent to the establishment of $S_2$. The research includes a theoretical analysis that examines the positivity, existence, and uniqueness of solutions, the conditions ensuring global stability, and a sufficient condition for controlling the $S_1$-free solution. In addition, we formulate an optimal control problem to maximize the effectiveness of $S_2$ releases, manage the population of $S_1$, and minimize the costs associated with this intervention strategy. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the proposed theories and allow visualization of population dynamics under various release scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Feller diffusion conditioned on a single ancestral founder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the distributional properties of a Feller diffusion $(X(\tau))_{\tau \in [0, t]}$ conditioned on the current population $X(t)$ having a single ancestor at time zero. The approach is novel and is based on an interpretation of Feller's original solution according to which the current population is comprised of a Poisson number of exponentially distributed families, each descended from a single ancestor. The distribution of the number of ancestors at intermediate times and the joint density of coalescent times is determined under assumptions of initiation of the process from a single ancestor at a specified time in the past, including infinitely far in the past, and for the case of a uniform prior on the time since initiation. Also calculated are the joint distribution of the time since the most recent common ancestor of the current population and the contemporaneous population size at that time under different assumptions on the time since initiation. In each case exact solutions are given for supercritical, critical and subcritical diffusions. For supercritical diffusions asymptotic forms of distributions are also given in the limit of unbounded exponential growth.</description>

      <title>Social influence on complex networks as a perturbation to individual behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperation is fundamental to the functioning of biological and social systems in both human and animal populations, with the structure of interactions playing a crucial role. Previous studies have used networks to describe interactions and explore the evolution of cooperation, but with limited transposability to social settings due to biologically relevant assumptions. Exogenous processes -- that affect the individual and are not derived from social interactions -- even if unbiased, have a role in supporting cooperation over defection, and this role has been largely overlooked in the context of network-based interactions. Here, we show that selection can favor either cooperation or defection depending on the frequency of exogenous, even if neutral, processes in any population structure. Our framework allows for deriving analytically the conditions for favoring a specific behavior in any network structure strongly affected by non-social environments (frequent exogenous forcing, FEF), which contrasts with previous computationally prohibitive methods. Our results demonstrate that the requirements for favoring cooperation under FEF do not match those in the rare-mutation limit, establishing that underlying neutral processes can be considered a mechanism for cooperation. We reveal that, under FEF, populations are less cooperative, and network heterogeneity can provide an advantage only if targeting specific network properties, clarifying seemingly contradictory experimental results and evolutionary predictions. While focused on cooperation, our assumptions generalize to any decision-making process involving a choice between alternative options. Our framework is particularly applicable to non-homogeneous human populations, offering a new perspective on cooperation science in the context of cultural evolution, where neutral and biased processes within structured interactions are abundant.</description>
