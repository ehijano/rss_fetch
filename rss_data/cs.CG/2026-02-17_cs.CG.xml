      <title>Lower Estimates for $L_1$-Distortion of Transportation Cost Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the degree of dissimilarity between two probability distributions on a finite metric space is a fundamental task in Computer Science and Computer Vision. A natural dissimilarity measure based on optimal transport is the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). A key technique for analyzing this metric, pioneered by Charikar (2002) and Indyk and Thaper (2003), involves constructing low-distortion embeddings of EMD(X) into the Lebesgue space $L_1$.
  It became a key problem to investigate whether the upper bound of $O(\log n)$ can be improved for important classes of metric spaces known to admit low-distortion embeddings into $L_1$. In the context of Computer Vision, grid graphs, especially planar grids, are among the most fundamental. Indyk posed the related problem of estimating the $L_1$-distortion of the space of uniform distributions on $n$-point subsets of $R^2$. The Progress Report, last updated in August 2011, highlighted two key results: first, the work of Khot and Naor (2006) on Hamming cubes, which showed that the $L_1$-distortion for Hamming cubes meets the described above upper estimate, and second, the result of Naor and Schechtman (2007) for planar grids, which established that the $L_1$-distortion of for a planar $n$ by $n$ grid is $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})$.
  Our first result is the improvement of the lower bound on the $L_1$-distortion for grids to $\Omega(\log n)$, matching the universal upper bound up to multiplicative constants. The key ingredient allowing us to obtain these sharp estimates is a new Sobolev-type inequality for scalar-valued functions on the grid graphs. Our method is also applicable to many recursive families of graphs, such as diamond and Laakso graphs. We obtain the sharp distortion estimates of $\log n$ in these cases as well.</description>

      <title>Morphing of and writing with a scissor linkage mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinematics of mechanisms is intricately coupled to their geometry and their utility often arises out of the ability to perform reproducible motion with fewer actuating degrees of freedom. In this article, we explore the assembly of scissor-units, each made of two rigid linear members connected by a pin joint. The assembly has a single degree of freedom, where actuating any single unit results in a shape change of the entire assembly. We derive expressions for the effective curvature of the unit and the trajectory of the mechanism's tip as a function of the geometric variables which we then use as the basis to program two tasks in the mechanism: shape morphing and writing. By phrasing these tasks as optimization problems and utilizing the differentiable simulation framework, we arrive at solutions that are then tested in table-top experiments. Our results show that the geometry of scissor assemblies can be leveraged for automated navigation and inspection in complex domains, in light of the optimization framework. However, we highlight that the challenges associated with rapid programming and error-free implementation in experiments without feedback still remain.</description>

      <title>Sometimes Two Irrational Guards are Needed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01211v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the art gallery problem, we are given a closed polygon $P$, with rational coordinates and an integer $k$. We are asked whether it is possible to find a set (of guards) $G$ of size $k$ such that any point $p\in P$ is seen by a point in $G$. We say two points $p$, $q$ see each other if the line segment $pq$ is contained inside $P$. It was shown by Abrahamsen, Adamaszek, and Miltzow that there is a polygon that can be guarded with three guards, but requires four guards if the guards are required to have rational coordinates. In other words, an optimal solution of size three might need to be irrational. We show that an optimal solution of size two might need to be irrational. Note that it is well-known that any polygon that can be guarded with one guard has an optimal guard placement with rational coordinates. Hence, our work closes the gap on when irrational guards are possible to occur.</description>

      <title>Computing Betti tables and minimal presentations of zero-dimensional persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Betti tables of a multigraded module encode the grades at which there is an algebraic change in the module. Multigraded modules show up in many areas of pure and applied mathematics, and in particular in topological data analysis, where they are known as persistence modules, and where their Betti tables describe the places at which the homology of filtered simplicial complexes changes. Although Betti tables of singly and bigraded modules are already being used in applications of topological data analysis, their computation in the bigraded case (which relies on an algorithm that is cubic in the size of the filtered simplicial complex) is a bottleneck when working with large datasets. We show that, in the special case of zero-dimensional homology (relevant for clustering and graph classification) Betti tables of bigraded modules can be computed in log-linear time. We also consider the problem of computing minimal presentations, and show that minimal presentations of zero-dimensional persistent homology can be computed in quadratic time, regardless of the grading poset.</description>

      <title>Epsilon-Neighborhood Decision-Boundary Governed Estimation (EDGE) of 2D Black Box Classifier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately estimating decision boundaries in black box systems is critical when ensuring safety, quality, and feasibility in real-world applications. However, existing methods iteratively refine boundary estimates by sampling in regions of uncertainty, without providing guarantees on the closeness to the decision boundary and also result in unnecessary exploration that is especially disadvantageous when evaluations are costly. This paper presents $\varepsilon$-Neighborhood Decision-Boundary Governed Estimation (EDGE), a sample efficient and function-agnostic algorithm that leverages the intermediate value theorem to estimate the location of the decision boundary of a black box binary classifier within a user-specified $\varepsilon$-neighborhood. To demonstrate applicability, a case study is presented of an electric grid stability problem with uncertain renewable power injection. Evaluations are conducted on three test functions, where it is seen that the EDGE algorithm demonstrates superior sample efficiency and better boundary approximation than adaptive sampling techniques and grid-based searches.</description>

      <title>The Contiguous Art Gallery Problem is in {\Theta}(n log n)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a natural variant of the Art Gallery problem, known as the \emph{Contiguous Art Gallery problem} was proposed. Given a simple polygon $P$, the goal is to partition its boundary $\partial P$ into the smallest number of contiguous segments such that each segment is completely visible from some point in $P$. Unlike the classical Art Gallery problem, which is NP-hard, this variant is polynomial-time solvable. At SoCG~2025, three independent works presented algorithms for this problem, each achieving a running time of $O(k n^5 \log n)$ (or $O(n^6\log n)$), where $k$ is the size of an optimal solution. Interestingly, these results were obtained using entirely different approaches, yet all led to roughly the same asymptotic complexity, suggesting that such a running time might be inherent to the problem.
  We show that this is not the case. In the real RAM-model, the prevalent model in computational geometry, we present an $O(n \log n)$-time algorithm, achieving an $O(k n^4)$ factor speed-up over the previous state-of-the-art. We also give a straightforward sorting-based lower bound by reducing from the set intersection problem. We thus show that the Contiguous Art Gallery problem is in $\Theta(n \log n)$.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology with Path-Representable Distances on Graph Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology (PH) has been widely applied to graph data to extract topological features. However, little attention has been paid to how different distance functions on a graph affect the resulting persistence barcodes and their interpretations. In this paper, we define a class of distances on graphs, called path-representable distances, and investigate structural relationships between their induced persistent homologies. In particular, we identify a nontrivial injection between the 1-dimensional barcodes induced by two commonly used graph distances: the unweighted and weighted shortest-path distances. We formally establish sufficient conditions under which such embeddings arise, focusing on a subclass we call cost-dominated distances. The injection property is shown to hold in 0- and 1-dimensions, while we provide counterexamples for higher-dimensional cases. To make these relationships measurable, we introduce the total persistence difference (TPD), a new topological measure that quantifies changes between filtrations induced by cost-dominated distances on a fixed graph. We prove a stability result for TPD when the distance functions admit a partial order and apply the method to the SNAP EU Research Institution E-Mail dataset. TPD captures both periodic patterns and global trends in the data, and shows stronger alignment with classical graph statistics compared to an existing PH-based measure applied to the same dataset.</description>

      <title>PyKirigami: An interactive Python simulator for kirigami structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the concept of kirigami has been used in creating deployable structures for various scientific and technological applications. While high-fidelity Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is the standard for analyzing stress distributions and material deformation, it is computationally intensive and often ill-suited for the rapid exploration of vast kinematic configuration spaces. In this work, we develop PyKirigami, a lightweight, open-source Python framework for the efficient deployment simulation of kirigami structures. Unlike continuum mechanics solvers, PyKirigami models tessellations as articulated rigid-body networks, allowing for the real-time simulation of global deployment trajectories and volumetric transformations. The tool incorporates collision detection and interactive actuation, enabling users to validate folding paths and identify geometric locking states in both 2D and 3D topologies. This framework serves as a fast kinematic prototyping tool for kirigami structures, allowing researchers to verify deployment mechanics and self-contacts prior to performing detailed mechanical analysis or physical fabrication.</description>
