      <title>The ordered phase of charged N=4 SYM plasma from STU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{Buchel:2025cve} we numerically identified the ordered phase of the charged ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma. We explain here how this phase can be obtained analytically within the STU model of Behrnd, Cveti\v{c}, and Sabra \cite{Behrndt:1998jd}.</description>

      <title>Geometric Entropies and their Hamiltonian Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In holographic theories, the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) area operator plays a key role in our understanding of the emergence of semiclassical Einstein-Hilbert gravity. When higher derivative corrections are included, the role of the area is instead played by a more general functional known as the geometric entropy. It is thus of interest to understand the flow generated by the geometric entropy on the classical phase space. In particular, the fact that the associated flow in Einstein-Hilbert or Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity induces a relative boost between the left and right entanglement wedges is deeply related to the fact that gravitational dressing promotes the von Neumann algebra of local fields in each wedge to type II. This relative boost is known as a boundary-condition-preserving (BCP) kink-transformation. In a general theory of gravity (with arbitrary higher-derivative terms), it is straightforward to show that the flow continues to take the above geometric form when acting on a spacetime where the HRT surface is the bifurcation surface of a Killing horizon. However, the form of the flow on other spacetimes is less clear.
  In this paper, we use the manifestly-covariant Peierls bracket to explore such flows in two-dimensional theories of JT gravity coupled to matter fields with higher derivative interactions. The results no longer take a purely geometric form and, instead, demonstrate new features that should be expected of such flows in general higher derivative theories. We also show how to obtain the above flows using Poisson brackets.</description>

      <title>Complex hidden symmetries in real spacetime and their algebraic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering real spacetime as a Lorentzian fiber in a complex manifold, there is a mismatch of the elementary linear representations of their symmetry groups, the real and complex Poincar\'{e} groups. No spinors are allowed as linear irreducible representations for the complex case, but when a spin$^{h}$ structure is implemented on the associated principal bundles, one is naturally led to an algebraic structure similar to the one of the standard model. This last (dynamical) structure might therefore be inherited from the kinematical symmetries of a larger space.</description>

      <title>Euclidean AdS wormholes and gravitational instantons in the Einstein-Skyrme theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euclidean AdS wormholes provide a natural setup for studying the AdS/CFT correspondence with multiple boundaries. However, from a bottom-up perspective, they cannot be embedded in the four-dimensional Einstein-AdS-Maxwell theory if these boundaries have positive curvature. Nevertheless, Maldacena and Maoz showed that this obstruction could be circumvented by introducing merons in the four-dimensional Einstein-AdS-Yang-Mills theory. In this work, we show that Euclidean-AdS wormholes also exist in the four-dimensional Einstein-AdS-Skyrme theory, whose matter sector possesses a nontrivial baryonic charge. We compute its free energy and show that it does not depend on the integration constants whatsoever, resembling topological solitons. Additionally, we obtain its holographic stress tensor and show that it vanishes, allowing us to interpret this configuration as a holographic Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) state. Other topologically nontrivial ground states in Einstein-Skyrme theory are found, such as gravitational instantons, representing the homotopically inequivalent vacua of the theory. We find that they develop Hawking-Page phase transitions above a critical temperature. Some of these solutions are periodic in Euclidean time, representing the gravitational analog of calorons in Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Weak and strong turbulence in self-focusing and defocusing media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the focusing and defocusing Nonlinear Schrodinger Equations have similar behavior in the weak turbulence regime, they must differ dramatically in the strong turbulence regime. Here, we show that this difference is already present at next-to-leading order in the nonlinearity in the weak turbulence regime: The one-loop correction to the interaction vertex suppresses repulsion (like screening in electrodynamics), leading to a steeper spectrum in the defocusing case. In contrast, attraction enhancement (like antiscreening in chromodynamics) makes the spectrum less steep in the focusing case. To describe strong turbulence, we consider a vector model in the limit of a large number of components. A large-N kinetic equation, valid at all scales, can be derived analytically. It has an inverse-cascade solution whose two asymptotics, at high and low wavenumbers, describe weak and strong turbulence, respectively. We find two forms of universality in the strong turbulence spectrum: in focusing media it is independent of the flux magnitude, while in defocusing media it is independent of the bare coupling constant, with the largest scale appearing instead.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry dynamics in random quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in random unitary circuits (RUCs). Focusing on a local $U(1)$ charge, we consider symmetric initial states evolved by both local one-dimensional circuits and geometrically non-local RUCs made of two-qudit gates. We compute the entanglement asymmetry of subsystems of arbitrary size, analyzing the relaxation time scales. We show that the entanglement asymmetry of the whole system approaches its stationary value in a time independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits. For subsystems, we find qualitative differences depending on their size. When the subsystem is larger than half of the full system, the equilibration time scales are again independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits and the entanglement asymmetry grows monotonically in time. Conversely, when the subsystems are smaller than half of the full system, we show that the entanglement asymmetry is non-monotonic in time and that it equilibrates in a time proportional to the quantum-information scrambling time, providing a physical intuition. As a consequence, the subsystem-equilibration time depends on the locality of interactions, scaling linearly and logarithmically in the system size, respectively, for local and non-local RUCs. Our work confirms the entanglement asymmetry as a versatile and computable probe of symmetry in many-body physics and yields a phenomenological overview of entanglement-asymmetry evolution in typical non-integrable dynamics.</description>

      <title>Global symmetries of quantum lattice models under non-invertible dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible dualities/symmetries have become an important tool in the study of quantum field theories and quantum lattice models in recent years. One of the most studied examples is non-invertible dualities obtained by gauging a discrete group. When the physical system has more global symmetries than the gauged symmetry, it has not been thoroughly investigated how those global symmetries transform under non-invertible duality. In this paper, we study the change of global symmetries under non-invertible duality of gauging a discrete group $G$ in the context of (1+1)-dimensional quantum lattice models. We obtain the global symmetries of the dual model by focusing on different Hilbert space sectors determined by the $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We provide general conjectures of global symmetries of the dual model forming an algebraic ring of the double cosets. We present concrete examples of the XXZ models and the duals, providing strong evidence for the conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the first computations of colored unknots and Hopf link in $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^3$ using both the topological vertex and its refinement. Our approach utilizes the toric Calabi-Yau threefold arising from the geometric transition of the cotangent bundle of $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^3$ under the large $N$ duality. We find that the link invariants are series in the Kahler parameters of the toric Calabi-Yau manifold and the $q$-expansions of the rational functions of the series have positivity property. We conjecture that they are Poincare series of an infinite dimensional link homology theory for links in $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^3$. We compare our results with that of the $S^3$ and speculate the consequences of the series nature of the invariants.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of screening masses of mesons in two-flavor lattice QCD at high temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12675v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spatial two-point correlation functions of mesonic operators in two-flavor lattice QCD at high temperatures. The simulated temperatures over the range $T \in [147, 330]$ MeV, where the critical temperature is estimated around 165 MeV. To ensure a good control of the chiral symmetry we employ the M\"obius domain-wall fermion action for two degenerate flavors of quarks. With a lattice cut off $a^{-1}\sim 2.6$ GeV, the residual mass is reduced to 0.14 MeV. With the energy spectrum obtained from the screening mass at incremental values of the temperature range, we examine the $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry, the anomalous axial $U(1)$ as well as an enhanced symmetry which exchanges the spin degrees of freedom. We also study how the data approaches the perturbative prediction given by twice the Matsubara frequency of free quarks.</description>

      <title>An introduction to effective potential methods in field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter we give a pedagogical introduction to effective potential methods in field theories. We first review the general functional methods leading to the concept of effective action and effective potential. Focusing on the effective potential we review the methods to compute radiative contributions, starting from the original 1973 seminal paper by Sidney Coleman and Erick Weinberg on one-loop corrections, along with its improvement by the renormalization group equations, as well as some basic results from thermal field theory, including the one-loop thermal corrections to the effective potential. We concentrate on some physical applications of the effective potential: i) the possibility of spontaneous symmetry breaking by radiative corrections, ii) the metastability of the electroweak vacuum in the Standard Model, and iii) the relevance of quantum effects in the dynamics of Higgs inflation. We then apply the previous results to cosmological phase transitions in the early universe and the possibility of generating a stochastic background of gravitational waves as well as primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Quasinormal Modes of Black Holes in $f(\mathbb{T})$ and $f(\mathbb{Q})$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal modes of static and spherically symmetric black holes in vacuum within the framework of $f(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathbb{Q} + \alpha \mathbb{Q}^2$ gravity, and compare them with those in $f(\mathbb{T}) = \mathbb{T} + \alpha \mathbb{T}^2$ gravity. Based on the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, the gravitational effects arise from non-metricity (the covariant derivative of metrics) in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity rather than curvature in $f(R)$ or torsion in $f(\mathbb{T})$. Using the finite difference method and the sixth-order WKB method, we compute the quasinormal modes of massless scalar and electromagnetic fields. Tables of quasinormal frequencies for various parameter configurations are provided based on the sixth-order WKB method. Our findings reveal the differences in the quasinormal modes of black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity compared to those in $f(R)$ and $f(\mathbb{T})$ gravity. This variation demonstrates the impact of different parameter values, offering insights into the characteristics of $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity. These results provide the theoretical groundwork for assessing alternative gravities' viability through gravitational wave data, and aid probably in picking out the alternative gravity theory that best aligns with the empirical reality.</description>

      <title>The late-time heating Green's function and improvements to distortion frequency hierarchy treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early energy injection leaves an imprint on the observed blackbody spectrum of the CMB, allowing us to study the thermal history of the Universe. For small energy release, the distortion can be efficiently computed using the quasi-exact Green's function method. For pre-recombination injections, the Green's function has already been studied previously. Here we reconsider the pre- and post-recombination periods, showcasing both the spectral distortion intensity and the relative temperature difference, which encrypt precious information about physical processes such as free-free interactions and thermal decoupling. We present the associated distortion visibility function, investigating the impact of various physical effects. We then study improvements to the so-called frequency hierarchy (FH) treatment, a method that was developed for the modelling of anisotropic distortions, which like the average distortion signals encode valuable cosmological information. Specifically, the FH treatment has shortcomings even in the $\mu$ era, that in principle should be easy to overcome. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to reduce the mismatch, concluding with a redefinition of the $\mu$ spectral shape using CosmoTherm. This solution takes into account double Compton and Bremsstrahlung effects in the low tail, which can be included in the FH. This opens the path towards a refined modeling of spectral distortion anisotropies.</description>

      <title>Topologically Charged Vortices at Superconductor/Quantum Hall Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore interface states between a type-II $s$-wave superconductor (SC) and a Chern insulator in the integer quantum Hall (QH) regime. Our results show that the effective interaction at this boundary gives rise to two emergent Abelian Higgs fields, representing paired electrons at the SC/QH interface. These fields couple to a gauge field that includes both Chern-Simons term, originating from the QH sector, and Maxwell term. Using this framework, we investigate the effects of magnetic flux vortices on the SC/QH interface. The emergence of the Chern-Simons term significantly modifies the magnetic penetration depth, influencing the Abrikosov lattice period and potentially altering the superconducting behavior at the interface. Furthermore, we demonstrate that vortex solutions at the interface carry a fractional charge of $e/2$, which reflects the ratio between the effective Chern-Simons level parameter and the charge of the Cooper pairs.</description>

      <title>A note on Strong Cosmic Censorship and its violation in Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter black hole space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Penrose's Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture safeguards determinism in General Relativity. Within the initial value approach to General Relativity, proof of Strong Cosmic Censorship preservation is predicated on the unique evolution of the metric. For the Kerr-Newman family of black hole solutions, this requires the inextendability of the metric past the Cauchy horizon, due to the development of a "blue-shift" instability. Attempts to provide a rigorous mathematical proof of Strong Cosmic Censorship has led to the formulation of several Strong Cosmic Censorship conjectures of varying strengths, which seem to be discussed rarely outside of the mathematical relativity literature. In this note, we review some of the arguments for and against Strong Cosmic Censorship preservation, with a focus on the Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter context, where the positive cosmological constant invites a "red-shift" effect that competes against the "blue-shift". We study the consequent role of quasinormal mode behaviour and illustrate the parameter space for which we consistently observe violations of the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture within Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic features of static, spherically-symmetric Schwarzschild black holes adopting different types of Barrow entropy. Specifically, in addition to the standard Barrow entropy, we consider a logarithmic-corrected type of this entropy by taking into account some loop quantum gravity effects. Moreover, we investigate the black hole thermodynamics from the viewpoint of Barrow entropy in presence of non-extensivity effects coming from the Tsallis statistics. Finally, we compare the results obtained for different Barrow-based entropies.</description>

      <title>Creation of Wavepackets for Quantum Chromodynamics on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most ambitious goals of quantum simulation of quantum field theory is the description of scattering in real time, which would allow not only for computation of scattering amplitudes, but also for studying the collision process step by step. The initial state of such simulation is made of typically two wavepackets moving on top of the vacuum, whose preparation is hard. Some proposals are based on a modified adiabatic transformation of free wavepackets into interacting wavepackets, but this is not suitable for quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Other approaches used in one-dimensional lattice gauge theories rely on an adiabatic transformation from the strong coupling limit, or on ansatzes to create the wavepackets from the full, interacting vacuum. Here we extend a previous work to create wavepackets of a general kind of particle from the vacuum in lattice gauge theories in one and three dimensions, including QCD. The conceptual foundation of this approach is the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory, and the only theoretical limitation is given by massless particles. In the context of digital quantum computation, the wavepacket creation from the vacuum is implemented with the technique known as LCU (linear combination of unitaries). The preparation is performed successfully with a certain success probability, which may represent the main obstacle of our approach.</description>

      <title>A Non-linear Massive Gravity Theory of Geometric Origin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the number of propagating degrees of freedom, at non-linear order, in torsion gravity theories, a class of modified theories of gravity that include a propagating torsion in addition to the metric. We focus on a three-parameter subfamily of theories (``torsion bigravity") that contains, at linear order, only two physical excitations: a massless spin-2 one (with two degrees of freedom) and a massive spin-2 one (with five degrees of freedom). We study the dynamics of the massive spin-2 field in the limit where the torsion field decouples from the metric. The number of degrees of freedom of the torsion field is found to {\it change, at non-linear order, from five to nine}.</description>

      <title>Holographic Study of Reflected Entropy in Anisotropic Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate reflected entropy in certain anisotropic boundary theories dual to nonrelativistic geometries using holography. It is proposed that this quantity is proportional to the minimal area of the entanglement wedge cross section. Using this prescription, we study in detail the effect of anisotropy on reflected entropy and other holographic entanglement measures. In particular, we study the discontinuous phase transition of this quantity for a symmetric configuration consisting of two disjoint strips. We find that in the specific regimes of the parameter space the critical separation is an increasing function of the anisotropy parameter and hence the correlation between the subregions becomes more pronounced. We carefully examine how these results are consistent with the behavior of other correlation measures including the mutual information. Finally, we show that the structure of the universal terms of entanglement entropy is corrected depending on the orientation of the entangling region with respect to the anisotropic direction.</description>

      <title>Nicolai maps with four-fermion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19946v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nicolai maps offer an alternative description of supersymmetric theories via nonlinear and nonlocal transformations characterized by the so-called `free-action' and `determinant-matching' conditions. The latter expresses the equality of the Jacobian determinant of the transformation with the one obtained by integrating out the fermions, which so far have been considered only to quadratic terms. We argue that such a restriction is not substantial, as Nicolai maps can be constructed for arbitrary nonlinear sigma models, which feature four-fermion interactions. The fermionic effective one-loop action then gets generalized to higher loops and the perturbative tree expansion of such Nicolai maps receives quantum corrections in the form of fermion loop decorations. The `free-action condition' continues to hold for the classical map, but the `determinant-matching condition' is extended to an infinite hierarchy in fermion loop order. After general considerations for sigma models in four dimensions, we specialize to the case of $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^N$ symmetric spaces and construct the associated Nicolai map. These sigma models admit a formulation with only quadratic fermions via an auxiliary vector field, which does not simplify our analysis.</description>

      <title>Dynamical 4-D Gauss-Bonnet action from matter-graviton interaction at one-loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The occurrence of singularities at the centers of black holes suggests that general relativity (GR), although a highly successful model of gravity and cosmology, is inapplicable. This is due to the breakdown of the equivalence principle. Gauss-Bonnet (GB) action is the simplest extension of GR as it possesses second-order equations of motion and is devoid of ghosts. However, in 4-D, the GB action is topological. Recently, Glavan and Lin proposed a mathematical framework that transforms the 4-D GB gravity theory into a non-topological one. However, it has been argued that without a canonical way to choose 4-D from the higher-dimensional space, such a GB gravity is not well-defined in 4-D. Naturally, there has been much interest in having a systematic procedure for making the 4-D GB term non-topological, such as using the counterterm regularization method in 4-D, regularization with the dimensional derivative, and Kaluza-Klein reduction. The current work takes a step in addressing this issue by demonstrating that the rescaling of the GB coupling $\alpha \rightarrow \alpha/(D - 4)$ arises from the self-energy correction of gravitons in 4-D using \emph{only} the established quantum field theoretic techniques. To keep things transparent, we focus on the linearized theory of gravity coupled with matter fields. By computing the one-loop self-energy correction of gravitons induced by the matter fields, we explicitly provide the origin of the prescription provided by Glavan and Lin. We compare the procedure with other regularization procedures like Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction and conformal scaling regarding the strong coupling problem. Our work naturally opens a new window to considering 4-D Einstein Gauss-Bonnet gravity as the most straightforward modification to GR.</description>

      <title>Higher derivative SVT theories from Kaluza-Klein reductions of Horndeski theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently pointed out that some precise Photon-Galileon couplings in four dimensions (4D) -- inspired by a higher dimensional reduction -- are enough to obtain a Horndeski theory that is less constrained by the stringent experimental bounds on the speed of Gravitational Waves. They imply the constancy of the ratio of speed of gravity to light throughout cosmic evolution. This holds even if we include the general scalar potentials $G_4 (\pi,X)$ and $G_5 (\pi)$. In this paper we go into the details of this 4D Luminal extension of Horndeski theory including its scalar sector. We also present the complete action including the general $G_5(\pi,X),\, G_6(\pi,X)$ scalar potentials. Thus we show all the $U(1)$ gauge invariant vector Galileons in 4D that result from a Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction from 5D Horndeski. They provide a {\it consistent} coupling of a higher derivative vector to scalar modifications of gravity -- namely, without inducing Ostrogradsky ghosts and keeping gauge invariance -- in the aim to explore more universal couplings of dark energy to other matter, such as vectors and in particular the Photon.</description>

      <title>UV complete local field theory of persistent symmetry breaking in 2+1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking can persist at all temperatures in certain biconical $\mathrm{O}(N)\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ vector models when the underlying field theories are ultraviolet complete. So far, the existence of such theories has been established in fractional dimensions for local but nonunitary models or in 2+1 dimensions but for nonlocal models. Here, we study local models at zero and finite temperature directly in 2+1 dimensions employing functional methods. At zero temperature, we establish that our approach describes the quantum critical behaviour with high accuracy for all $N\geq 2$. We then exhibit the mechanism of discrete symmetry breaking from $\mathrm{O}(N)\times \mathbb{Z}_2\to \mathrm{O}(N)$ for increasing temperature near the biconical critical point when $N$ is finite but large. We calculate the corresponding finite-temperature phase diagram and further show that the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem is fully respected within this approach, i.e., symmetry breaking only occurs in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector. Finally, we determine the critical $N$ above which this phenomenon can be observed to be $N_c \approx 15$.</description>

Abstract: We study the conditions for finding an island in an anisotropic universe - Bianchi Type-I filled with radiation. We verify that the existence of islands does not depend on their shape. We then find that islands may form at certain times, near the turnaround point - where the universe turns from contraction to expansion in one of the directions. This is in line with previous analyses regarding cosmological space-times where islands form if one has two energy scales in the problem, such as the typical temperature of the universe and, on top of that, cosmological constant, curvature, anisotropy, or some mass scale.</description>

      <title>Euclidean and complex geometries from real-time computations of gravitational R\'enyi entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational R\'enyi computations have traditionally been described in the language of Euclidean path integrals. In the semiclassical limit, such calculations are governed by Euclidean (or, more generally, complex) saddle-point geometries. We emphasize here that, at least in simple contexts, the Euclidean approach suggests an alternative formulation in terms of the bulk quantum wavefunction. Since this alternate formulation can be directly applied to the real-time quantum theory, it is insensitive to subtleties involved in defining the Euclidean path integral. In particular, it can be consistent with many different choices of integration contour.
  Despite the fact that self-adjoint operators in the associated real-time quantum theory have real eigenvalues, we note that the bulk wavefunction encodes the Euclidean (or complex) R\'enyi geometries that would arise in any Euclidean path integral. As a result, for any given quantum state, the appropriate real-time path integral yields both R\'enyi entropies and associated complex saddle-point geometries that agree with Euclidean methods. After brief explanations of these general points, we use JT gravity to illustrate the associated real-time computations in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we define absorptive Compton amplitudes, which captures the absorption factor for waves of spin-weight-$s$ scattering in black hole perturbation theory. At the leading order, in the $G M \omega$ expansion, such amplitudes are purely imaginary and expressible as contact terms. Equipped with these amplitudes we compute the mass change in black hole scattering events via Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell formalism, where the rest mass of Schwarzschild/Kerr black hole is modified due to absorption of gravitational, electromagnetic, or scalar fields sourced by other compact object. We reproduced the power loss previously computed in the post-Newtonian expansion. The results presented here hold for similar mass ratios and generic spin orientation, while keeping the Kerr spin parameter to lie in the physical region $\chi \le 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate ultra slow-roll inflation with a seed black hole in a de Sitter background. By numerically tracking transitions from slow-roll to ultra slow-roll inflation, we find that quasi-normal mode solutions of the scalar field are excited following the decay of the slow-roll attractor, depending on the mass of the black hole. For small black holes, the picture is similar to standard inflation with the usual damping of the scalar field; with a large black hole, we find that the ringing modes dominate. It is believed that the transition to ultra slow-roll in the pure inflationary case enhances the peak of the primordial power spectrum, thereby increasing the likelihood of primordial black hole formation. We comment on how the novel ringing behaviour due to the seed black hole might impact on cosmological perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study twisted M-theory in a general conifold background, and describe it in terms of a 5d non-commutative Chern-Simons-matter theory, which is equivalent to 5d non-commutative Chern-Simons theory for a supergroup. In an equivalent description as twisted type IIA string theory, the matter degrees of freedom arise from topological strings stretched between stacks of D6-branes. In order to study 5d Chern-Simons-matter theories with a boundary, we first construct and investigate the properties of a 4d non-commutative gauged chiral WZW model. We prove the gauge invariant coupling of this 4d theory to the bulk 5d Chern-Simons theory defined on $\mathbb{R}_+ \times \mathbb{C}^2 $, and further generalize our results to the 5d Chern-Simons-matter theory. We also investigate the toroidal current algebra of the 4d chiral WZW model that arises from radial quantization along one of the complex planes. Finally, we show that a gauged non-commutative chiral 4d WZW model arises from the partition function for quantum 5d non-commutative Chern-Simons theory with boundaries in the BV-BFV formalism, and further generalize this 5d-4d correspondence to the 5d non-commutative Chern-Simons-matter theory for the case of adjoint matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an equivalence between non-isometry of quantum codes and state-dependence of operator reconstruction, and discuss implications of this equivalence for holographic duality. Specifically, we define quantitative measures of non-isometry and state-dependence and describe bounds relating these quantities. In the context of holography we show that, assuming known gravitational path integral results for overlaps between semiclassical states, non-isometric bulk-to-boundary maps with a trivial kernel are approximately isometric and bulk reconstruction approximately state-independent. In contrast, non-isometric maps with a non-empty kernel always lead to state-dependent reconstruction. We also show that if a global bulk-to-boundary map is non-isometric, then there exists a region in the bulk which is causally disconnected from the boundary. Finally, we conjecture that, under certain physical assumptions for the definition of the Hilbert space of effective field theory in AdS space, the presence of a global horizon implies a non-isometric global bulk-to-boundary map.</description>

      <title>Self-Dual Gauge Theory from the Top Down</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a family of dualities between certain non-supersymmetric self-dual gauge theories on a large class of $4d$ self-dual asymptotically flat backgrounds, and the large $N$ limit of an independently defined $2d$ chiral defect CFT. Our construction goes via twisted holography for the type I topological string on a Calabi-Yau five-fold which fibres over twistor space. In particular, we show that single-trace operators of the $2d$ defect CFT are in bijection with states of the celestial chiral algebra. We match the operator products of these states with the collinear splitting amplitudes of the self-dual gauge theory up to one-loop. Assigning vacuum expectations to central operators in the boundary theory computes bulk amplitudes on self-dual backgrounds. We are able to extract form factors from these amplitudes, which we use to give a simple closed formula for certain $n$-point two-loop all $+$ amplitudes in $\mathrm{SU}(K) \times \mathrm{SU}(R)$ gauge theory coupled to bifundamental massless fermions.</description>

      <title>Index and localization for type B superconformal mechanics on singular spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type B superconformal quantum mechanical sigma models are of physical interest as they arise in the description of D-brane bound states forming an AdS$_2$ throat. In this work we discuss the applicability of localization methods to compute the superconformal index in these theories, despite the fact that their target spaces are generically singular. Similar in spirit to recent works on type A models, we propose to work on a suitably resolved target space to compute a regularized index. While this regularized index correctly captures the actual index unambiguously in models of physical interest, we do uncover a subtlety in more pathological examples. This occurs in situations where the supercharge is not essentially-selfadjoint, in which case the index becomes ambiguous and depends on the chosen selfadjoint extension. We also discuss the special class of models with K\"ahler target spaces, which can accommodate both type A and type B models, and show that the type B index is a particular limit of the type A index. For Calabi-Yau cones, the type B index coincides with the Hilbert series of the unresolved space.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations meet Wheeler DeWitt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study approximate solutions of the Wheeler DeWitt (WdW) equation and compare them with the standard results of cosmological perturbation theory. In mini-superspace, we introduce a dimensionless gravitational coupling $\alpha$ that is typically very small and functions like $\hbar$ in a WKB expansion. We seek solutions of the form $\Psi = e^{iS/\alpha} \psi$ that are the closest quantum analog of a given classical background spacetime. The function $S$ satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, while $\psi$ obeys a Schr\"odinger-like equation and can be given a probabilistic interpretation. The semiclassical limit suggests a specific relation between $\psi$ and the standard perturbation-theory wavefunction $\psi_P$. We verify this relation in two main examples: a scalar field with a purely exponential potential, of which simple scaling solutions are known and a slow-roll scenario expanded in the vicinity of the origin in field space. Each example is worked out in two different gauges, that are the minisuperspace equivalent of unitary gauge and spatially flat gauge. We discuss possible deviations from the classical background trajectory as well as the higher ``time" derivative terms that are present in the WdW equation but not in the perturbative approach. We clarify the \emph{conditional probability} content of the wavefunctions and how this is related with the standard gauge fixing procedure in perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how an isolated quantum system evolves toward a thermal state from an initial state far from equilibrium such as one prepared by a global quantum quench has attracted significant interest in recent years. This phenomenon can be elucidated through the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), which has had a profound impact across various fields, from high-energy physics to condensed matter physics. The purpose of this review article is to present the fundamental concepts of quantum equilibrium and the ETH to a broad audience within the physics community, particularly for those in high-energy physics who seek a comprehensive understanding of these important topics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explicitly construct a prefactorisation algebra on any real two-dimensional conformal Euclidean manifold $\Sigma$ which locally encodes the non-chiral version $\mathbb{F}^{\mathfrak{g}, \kappa} = \mathbb{V}^{\mathfrak{g}, \kappa} \otimes \bar{\mathbb{V}}^{\mathfrak{g}, \kappa}$ of the affine Kac-Moody vertex algebra $\mathbb{V}^{\mathfrak{g}, \kappa}$ associated with any simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and a level $\kappa : \mathfrak{g} \otimes \mathfrak{g} \to \mathbb{C}$. We consider in detail the case of the $2$-sphere $\Sigma = S^2$ equipped with a certain orientation reversing involution. This setting is used to construct a Hermitian sesquilinear product on $\mathbb{F}^{\mathfrak{g}, \kappa}$ as well as derive the operator formalism for $\mathbb{F}^{\mathfrak{g}, \kappa}$ describing the Fourier mode decompositions of quantum operators on $S^1$ built out of a pair of chiral and anti-chiral $\mathfrak{g}$-valued currents on $S^1$ with central extension determined by $\kappa$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry fractionalization, mixed-anomalies and dualities in quantum spin models with generalized symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gauging of higher-form finite Abelian symmetries and their sub-groups in quantum spin models in spatial dimensions $d=2$ and 3. Doing so, we naturally uncover gauged models with dual higher-group symmetries and potential mixed 't Hooft anomalies. We demonstrate that the mixed anomalies manifest as the symmetry fractionalization of higher-form symmetries participating in the mixed anomaly. Gauging is realized as an isomorphism or duality between the bond algebras that generate the space of quantum spin models with the dual generalized symmetry structures. We explore the mapping of gapped phases under such gauging related dualities for 0-form and 1-form symmetries in spatial dimension $d=2$ and 3. In $d=2$, these include several non-trivial dualities between short-range entangled gapped phases with 0-form symmetries and 0-form symmetry enriched Higgs and (twisted) deconfined phases of the gauged theory with possible symmetry fractionalizations. Such dualities also imply strong constraints on several unconventional, i.e., deconfined or topological transitions. In $d=3$, among others, we find, dualities between topological orders via gauging of 1-form symmetries. Hamiltonians self-dual under gauging of 1-form symmetries host emergent non-invertible symmetries, realizing higher-categorical generalizations of the Tambara-Yamagami fusion category.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the variational preparation of the Thermofield Double as the ground state of a suitably engineered Hamiltonian acting on the doubled Hilbert space. Through the use of the Entanglement Forging ansatz, we propose a solution that involves only circuits of width $N$. We illustrate the method with generic fermionic Hamiltonians. The free fermion case can be solved in closed form, and yields a warm start state for the variational circuits whenever interactions are present. As an important side product, this method returns the complete energy spectrum and eigenbasis of the system.</description>

      <title>Thermalization in Krylov Basis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study thermalization in closed non-integrable quantum systems using the Krylov basis. We demonstrate that for thermalization to occur, the matrix representation of typical local operators in the Krylov basis should exhibit a specific tridiagonal form with all other elements in the matrix are exponentially small, reminiscent of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Within this framework, we propose that the nature of thermalization, whether weak or strong, can be examined by the infinite time average of the Krylov complexity. Moreover, we analyze the variance of Lanczos coefficients as another probe for the nature of thermalization. One observes that although the variance of Lanczos coefficients may capture certain features of thermalization, it is not as effective as the infinite time average of complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory that preserves spin-summed scattering and decay rates at tree level while affecting particle spins. This is achieved by breaking the Lorentz group in a non-local way that tries avoiding stringent constraints, for example leaving unbroken the maximal sub-group SIM(2). As a phenomenological application, this new physics can alter the spins of top-antitop pairs (and consequently their entanglement) produced in $pp$ collisions without impacting their rates. Some observables affected by loops involving top quarks with modified entanglement receive corrections.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of mixed-state topological orders in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classification and characterization of topological phases of matter is well understood for ground states of gapped Hamiltonians that are well isolated from the environment. However, decoherence due to interactions with the environment is inevitable -- thus motivating the investigation of topological orders in the context of mixed states. Here, we take a step toward classifying mixed-state topological orders in two spatial dimensions by considering their (emergent) generalized symmetries. We argue that their 1-form symmetries and the associated anyon theories lead to a partial classification under two-way connectivity by quasi-local quantum channels. This allows us to establish mixed-state topological orders that are intrinsically mixed, i.e., that have no ground state counterpart. We provide a wide range of examples based on topological subsystem codes, decohering $G$-graded string-net models, and "classically gauging" symmetry-enriched topological orders. One of our main examples is an Ising string-net model under the influence of dephasing noise. We study the resulting space of locally-indistinguishable states and compute the modular transformations within a particular coherent space. Based on our examples, we identify two possible effects of quasi-local quantum channels on anyon theories: (1) anyons can be incoherently proliferated -- thus reducing to a commutant of the proliferated anyons, or (2) the system can be "classically gauged", resulting in the symmetrization of anyons and an extension by transparent bosons. Given these two mechanisms, we conjecture that mixed-state topological orders are classified by premodular anyon theories, i.e., those for which the braiding relations may be degenerate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By constructing a model of spacetime having a strong curvature singularity in which causal geodesics are complete, but more generic causal curves are not, we explicitly show that some electrostatic field configurations on that background are bounded on every open punctured neighborhood of the curvature singularity. Our calculations are performed using the analog gravity description provided by Plebanski and Tamm, according to which the characterization of the electromagnetic field on a generic curved background is equivalent to solving Maxwell's equations in flat space with a matter content verifying certain nontrivial constitutive relations. The regularity of the electric field as it approaches what could be considered the worst conceivable physical condition, opens the door to further investigation into the possibility of propagating signals capable of crossing a spacetime singularity.</description>

      <title>Theory of metastable states in many-body quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a mathematical theory of metastable pure states in closed many-body quantum systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Given a Hamiltonian, a pure state is defined to be metastable when all sufficiently local operators either stabilize the state, or raise its average energy. We prove that short-range entangled metastable states are necessarily eigenstates (scars) of a perturbatively close Hamiltonian. Given any metastable eigenstate of a Hamiltonian, in the presence of perturbations, we prove the presence of prethermal behavior: local correlation functions decay at a rate bounded by a time scale nonperturbatively long in the inverse metastability radius, rather than Fermi's Golden Rule. Inspired by this general theory, we prove that the lifetime of the false vacuum in certain $d$-dimensional quantum models grows at least as fast as $\exp(\epsilon^{-d} )$, where $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$ is the relative energy density of the false vacuum; this lower bound matches, for the first time, explicit calculations using quantum field theory. We identify metastable states at finite energy density in the PXP model, along with exponentially many metastable states in "helical" spin chains and the two-dimensional Ising model. Our inherently quantum formalism reveals precise connections between many problems, including prethermalization, robust quantum scars, and quantum nucleation theory, and applies to systems without known semiclassical and/or field theoretic limits.</description>

Abstract: We develop a method of constructing a kernel of Lie algebra weight system. A main tool we use in the analysis is Vogel's $\Lambda$ algebra and the surrounding framework. As an example of a developed technique we explicitly provide all Jacobi diagrams lying in the kernel of $\mathfrak{sl}_N$ weight system at low orders. We also discuss consequences of the presence of the kernel in Lie algebra weight systems for detection of correlators in the 3D Chern-Simons topological field theory and for distinguishing of knots by the corresponding quantum knot invariants.</description>

      <title>Soft symmetries of topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations in Bosonic Stars: chains and rings from spherical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the bifurcation phenomena between spherical and axisymmetric bosonic stars. By numerically solving for the zero-modes of spherical bosonic stars under specific axially symmetric perturbations, we discover that excited state spherical bosonic stars bifurcate into two types of axisymmetric bosonic stars under $\ell=2$ perturbations, with matter distributions resembling chains and rings, respectively. Meanwhile, $\ell=4$ axisymmetric perturbations lead spherical scalar bosonic stars to bifurcate into a new type of axisymmetric bosonic stars, exhibiting a mixed chain-like and ring-like matter distribution, which we refer to as gyroscope-like. Additionally, for the first time, we have constructed chains of scalar bosonic stars with 7 constituents and their corresponding ring-like scalar bosonic stars. Our results provide an explanation for the bifurcations in bosonic stars from the perspective of perturbations, and by analyzing physical quantities such as quadrupoles and energy densities we systematically discuss the impact of axisymmetric perturbations on spherical bosonic stars.</description>

      <title>Invariant Theory and Magic State Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the performance of a linear self-orthogonal $GF(4)$ code for magic state distillation of Bravyi and Kitaev's $|T\rangle$-state is characterized by its simple weight enumerator. We compute weight enumerators of all such codes with fewer than 20 qubits and find none whose threshold exceeds that of the 5-qubit code. Using constraints on weight enumerators from invariant theory and linear programming, we establish bounds on the exponent characterizing noise suppression of a $|T\rangle$-state distillation protocol. We also obtain new non-negativity constraints on such weight enumerators by demanding consistency of the associated magic state distillation routine. These constraints yield new bounds on the distances of classical Hermitian self-dual and maximal self-orthogonal linear $GF(4)$ codes, notably proving the nonexistence of such codes with parameters $[12m, 6m, 4m+2]_{GF(4)}$.</description>

Abstract: We extend our prior results on the worldline computation of the axial vector-vector-vector (AVV) triangle anomaly in polarized deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) to the finite mass case by computing in addition the pseudoscalar-vector-vector (PVV) triangle graph. For the well-studied QED case, we show explicitly how the off-forward AVV pole exactly cancels an identical PVV pole. We then demonstrate the dramatic difference in QCD due to the chiral condensate, which qualitatively modifies anomalous Ward identities. As in the massless case, the anomaly pole in QCD is canceled by the dynamics of a primordial isosinglet pseudoscalar $\bar \eta$-meson, whose Wess-Zumino-Witten coupling to the topological charge density shifts the pole to the physical $\eta^\prime$ mass, with the finite quark mass contribution differing by $O(10\%)$ from the Witten-Veneziano formula. We obtain a compact analytic expression for the finite mass corrections to Shore and Veneziano's result that the proton's net quark helicity $\Delta \Sigma\propto \sqrt{\chi_{\rm QCD}' |_{m=0}(0)}$, the forward slope of the topological susceptibility in the chiral limit, and show they are of the order of a few percent. Our prior prediction that the polarized DIS structure function $g_1$ is quenched by sphaleron-like topological transitions at small $x$ is unaffected by quark mass effects. Our results illustrate how worldline computations of anomalous processes, in synergy with lattice computations and nonet chiral perturbation theory, can uncover novel nonperturbative features of QCD at the Electron-Ion collider.</description>
