      <title>A Learning Framework For Cooperative Collision Avoidance of UAV Swarms Leveraging Domain Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for cooperative collision avoidance of UAV swarms leveraging domain knowledge-driven reward. The reward is derived from knowledge in the domain of image processing, approximating contours on a two-dimensional field. By modeling obstacles as maxima on the field, collisions are inherently avoided as contours never go through peaks or intersect. Additionally, counters are smooth and energy-efficient. Our framework enables training with large swarm sizes as the agent interaction is minimized and the need for complex credit assignment schemes or observation sharing mechanisms in state-of-the-art MARL approaches are eliminated. Moreover, UAVs obtain the ability to adapt to complex environments where contours may be non-viable or non-existent through intensive training. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performances of our framework against state-of-the-art MARL algorithms.</description>

      <title>AI Mother Tongue: Self-Emergent Communication in MARL via Endogenous Symbol Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), the development of Emergent Communication has long been constrained by the ``Joint Exploration Dilemma'', leading agents to fall into a ``Communication Vacuum Equilibrium'' . Traditional methods address this by introducing inductive biases to facilitate communication emergence . This study fundamentally questions whether such artificial inductive biases are, in fact, over-engineering. Through experiments with the ``AI Mother Tongue'' (AIM) framework, based on a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we demonstrate that when agents possess an endogenous symbol system, their neural representations naturally exhibit spontaneous semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic convergence, achieving effective symbolic communication without external inductive biases. This aligns with recent neuroscience findings suggesting that the human brain does not directly use human language for internal thought , and resonates with research on ``soft thinking'' capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) . Compared to traditional explicit communication methods, AIM demonstrates stronger generality and efficiency. The interpretable analysis toolkit developed in this study confirms that symbol usage exhibits a significant power-law distribution, leading to three major theoretical insights: the ``Neural Communication Hypothesis'', the ``Tool-First Principle'', and the ``Semantic Interpretability Paradigm''. Future research will explore the integration of Hierarchical Quantized Variational Autoencoders (HQ-VAE) to enhance AIM's complex expressive capabilities and investigate the potential for ``Reinforcement Learning (RL) Low-Level Pre-training''. This discovery offers new avenues for bridging symbolism and connectionism.</description>

      <title>From Semantic Web and MAS to Agentic AI: A Unified Narrative of the Web of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of the Web of Agents (WoA), which transforms the static, document-centric Web into an environment of autonomous agents acting on users' behalf, has attracted growing interest as large language models (LLMs) become more capable. However, research in this area is still fragmented across different communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered frameworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the Semantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation obscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic understanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive evolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and the MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations of earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To systematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic foundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery mechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing agent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent where others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift in the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic Web) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model (LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable and adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new protocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open, trustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies in solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda focused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance for the emerging WoA.</description>

      <title>Taming Uncertainty via Automation: Observing, Analyzing, and Optimizing Agentic AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed within agentic systems-collections of interacting, LLM-powered agents that execute complex, adaptive workflows using memory, tools, and dynamic planning. While enabling powerful new capabilities, these systems also introduce unique forms of uncertainty stemming from probabilistic reasoning, evolving memory states, and fluid execution paths. Traditional software observability and operations practices fall short in addressing these challenges.
  This paper introduces AgentOps: a comprehensive framework for observing, analyzing, optimizing, and automating operation of agentic AI systems. We identify distinct needs across four key roles-developers, testers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and business users-each of whom engages with the system at different points in its lifecycle. We present the AgentOps Automation Pipeline, a six-stage process encompassing behavior observation, metric collection, issue detection, root cause analysis, optimized recommendations, and runtime automation. Throughout, we emphasize the critical role of automation in managing uncertainty and enabling self-improving AI systems-not by eliminating uncertainty, but by taming it to ensure safe, adaptive, and effective operation.</description>

      <title>Step-wise Policy for Rare-tool Knowledge (SPaRK): Offline RL that Drives Diverse Tool Use in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Step-wise Policy for Rare-tool Knowledge (SPaRK), a novel reinforcement learning framework that teaches large language models to explore diverse tool usage patterns beyond conventional high-temperature sampling. Building on recent advances in step-wise reinforcement learning, we introduce a dual-objective reward system that simultaneously optimizes for answer quality and tool diversity, training a Llama-3.1 8B model through offline PPO on synthetically generated trajectories from the MMLU-Pro dataset. Our approach uniquely employs a rarity-first exploitation strategy where a GPT-4o judge scores candidate actions across eight distinct tools plus chain-of-thought reasoning, with the policy favoring less-frequently used but still viable tools to encourage systematic exploration. Empirical results demonstrate that SPaRK achieves competitive performance across 14 MMLU-Pro categories while exhibiting significantly higher entropy in tool selection compared to both baseline and supervised fine-tuning approaches, suggesting that algorithmic exploration through explicit tool diversity can enhance reasoning capabilities without sacrificing accuracy.</description>

      <title>From Kinetic Theory to AI: a Rediscovery of High-Dimensional Divergences and Their Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selecting an appropriate divergence measure is a critical aspect of machine learning, as it directly impacts model performance. Among the most widely used, we find the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, originally introduced in kinetic theory as a measure of relative entropy between probability distributions. Just as in machine learning, the ability to quantify the proximity of probability distributions plays a central role in kinetic theory. In this paper, we present a comparative review of divergence measures rooted in kinetic theory, highlighting their theoretical foundations and exploring their potential applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>LF: Online Multi-Robot Path Planning Meets Optimal Trajectory Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-robot control paradigm to solve point-to-point navigation tasks for a team of holonomic robots with access to the full environment information. The framework invokes two processes asynchronously at high frequency: (i) a centralized, discrete, and full-horizon planner for computing collision- and deadlock-free paths rapidly, leveraging recent advances in multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF), and (ii) dynamics-aware, robot-wise optimal trajectory controllers that ensure all robots independently follow their assigned paths reliably. This hierarchical shift in planning representation from (i) discrete and coupled to (ii) continuous and decoupled domains enables the framework to maintain long-term scalable motion synthesis. As an instantiation of this idea, we present LF, which combines a fast state-of-the-art MAPF solver (LaCAM), and a robust feedback control stack (Freyja) for executing agile robot maneuvers. LF provides a robust and versatile mechanism for lifelong multi-robot navigation even under asynchronous and partial goal updates, and adapts to dynamic workspaces simply by quick replanning. We present various multirotor and ground robot demonstrations, including the deployment of 15 real multirotors with random, consecutive target updates while a person walks through the operational workspace.</description>

      <title>DroidSpeak: KV Cache Sharing for Cross-LLM Communication and Multi-LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02820v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compound AI systems, such as agentic systems, are an emerging trend in large-scale enterprise settings, with multiple LLMs specialized for different users, tasks, and/or roles working together. In these scenarios, different models often process inputs that share the same context prefix. Although much work was done in the past to enable the reuse of prefix KV caches across inputs for a single model, how to enable one model to reuse the prefix KV caches of a different model remains an open question.
  We introduce DroidSpeak, the first distributed LLM inference system that enables KV cache reuse across distributed nodes running inference of different LLMs, so long as the LLMs have the same architecture. We present the first study that aims at understanding the impact of sharing KV caches across different LLMs, and if/when such sharing affects quality. Inspired by the findings, we present DroidSpeak, which selectively recomputes a few layers of the KV cache produced by another LLM and reuses the remaining layers, with negligible quality loss. Moreover, carefully pipelining the layer-wise re-computation and the loading of reused KV cache further improves the inference performance. Experiments on diverse datasets and model pairs demonstrate that DroidSpeak achieves up to 4x throughput improvement and about 3.1x faster prefill (time to first token), with negligible loss of quality in F1 scores, Rouge-L or code similarity score, compared to the baseline which does not allow any sharing across models.</description>

      <title>Voting or Consensus? Decision-Making in Multi-Agent Debate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much of the success of multi-agent debates depends on carefully choosing the right parameters. The decision-making protocol stands out as it can highly impact final model answers, depending on how decisions are reached. Systematic comparison of decision protocols is difficult because many studies alter multiple discussion parameters beyond the protocol. So far, it has been largely unknown how decision-making influences different tasks. This work systematically evaluates the impact of seven decision protocols (e.g., majority voting, unanimity consensus). We change only one variable at a time - the decision protocol - to analyze how different methods affect the collaboration between agents and measure differences in knowledge and reasoning tasks. Our results show that voting protocols improve performance by 13.2% in reasoning tasks and consensus protocols by 2.8% in knowledge tasks compared to other decision protocols. Increasing the number of agents improves performance, while more discussion rounds before voting reduce it. To improve decision-making by increasing answer diversity, we propose two new methods, All-Agents Drafting (AAD) and Collective Improvement (CI). Our methods improve task performance by up to 3.3% with AAD and up to 7.4% with CI. This work demonstrates the importance of decision-making in multi-agent debates beyond scaling.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Multi-Modal LLM Agents for Treatment Planning in Focused Ultrasound Ablation Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Focused Ultrasound Ablation Surgery (FUAS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive therapeutic modality, valued for its safety and precision. Nevertheless, its clinical implementation entails intricate tasks such as multimodal image interpretation, personalized dose planning, and real-time intraoperative decision-making processes that demand intelligent assistance to improve efficiency and reliability. We introduce FUAS-Agents, an autonomous agent system that leverages the multimodal understanding and tool-using capabilities of large language models (LLMs). By integrating patient profiles and MRI data, FUAS-Agents orchestrates a suite of specialized medical AI tools, including segmentation, treatment dose prediction, and clinical guideline retrieval, to generate personalized treatment plans comprising MRI image, dose parameters, and therapeutic strategies. We evaluate the system in a uterine fibroid treatment scenario. Human assessment by four senior FUAS experts indicates that 82.5%, 82.5%, 87.5%, and 97.5% of the generated plans were rated 4 or above (on a 5-point scale) in terms of completeness, accuracy, fluency, and clinical compliance, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven agents in enhancing decision-making across complex clinical workflows, and exemplify a translational paradigm that combines general-purpose models with specialized expert systems to solve practical challenges in vertical healthcare domains.</description>

      <title>MATE: LLM-Powered Multi-Agent Translation Environment for Accessibility Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accessibility remains a critical concern in today's society, as many technologies are not developed to support the full range of user needs. Existing multi-agent systems (MAS) often cannot provide comprehensive assistance for users in need due to the lack of customization stemming from closed-source designs. Consequently, individuals with disabilities frequently encounter significant barriers when attempting to interact with digital environments. We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs the modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for assisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to an understandable format. For instance, if the user cannot see well and receives an image, the system converts this image to its audio description. MATE can be applied to a wide range of domains, industries, and areas, such as healthcare, and can become a useful assistant for various groups of users. The system supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using custom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the system can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with a wide variety of hardware. Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy and security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be effectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital healthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce ModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise modality conversion task from the user input. Numerous experiments show that ModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical models on our custom data. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/AlgazinovAleksandr/Multi-Agent-MATE.</description>

      <title>Simulation for All: A Step-by-Step Cookbook for Developing Human-Centered Multi-Agent Transportation Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As cities evolve toward more complex and multimodal transportation systems, the need for human-centered multi-agent simulation tools has never been more urgent. Yet most existing platforms remain limited - they often separate different types of road users, rely on scripted or pre-defined behaviors, overlook public transit users as active participants, and are rarely designed with accessibility in mind for non-technical users. To address this gap, this paper presents the specifications of a multi-agent simulation platform designed to support real-time, human-centered, and immersive studies of all road users, accompanied by open-source scripts for replication. Using high-fidelity immersive virtual environments, our platform enables interaction across public transit users, pedestrians, cyclists, automated vehicles, and drivers. The architecture is modular, extensible, and designed for accessibility. The system integrates hardware-specific modules - including an omnidirectional treadmill, a seating arrangement, a smart trainer, and an actuated cockpit. Additionally, the platform collects multimodal physiological, neurological, and behavioral data through embedded sensing devices such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), eye tracking, and wrist-based biosensors. To show the usability of this system, we present three use cases. Simulation for All aims to lower the barrier to entry for high-fidelity transportation simulation, support experimentation across disciplines, and advance our understanding of multimodal mobility in complex urban environments.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Imputation in Multi-Agent Sports with Derivative-Accumulating Self-Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10878v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory data collected from domains such as team sports often suffer from missing values due to various factors. While many imputation methods have been proposed for spatiotemporal data, they are not well-suited for multi-agent sports scenarios where player movements are highly dynamic and inter-agent interactions continuously evolve. To address these challenges, we propose MIDAS (Multi-agent Imputer with Derivative-Accumulating Self-ensemble), a framework that imputes multi-agent trajectories with high accuracy and physical plausibility. It jointly predicts positions, velocities, and accelerations through a Set Transformer-based neural network and generates alternative estimates by recursively accumulating predicted velocity and acceleration values. These predictions are then combined using a learnable weighted ensemble to produce final imputed trajectories. Experiments on three sports datasets demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms existing baselines in both positional accuracy and physical plausibility. Lastly, we showcase use cases of MIDAS, such as approximating total distance and pass success probability, to highlight its applicability to practical downstream tasks that require complete tracking data.</description>

Abstract: Discrete choice models are essential for modelling various decision-making processes in human behaviour. However, the specification of these models has depended heavily on domain knowledge from experts, and the fully automated but interpretable modelling of complex human behaviours has been a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we introduce the differentiable discrete choice model (Diff-DCM), a fully data-driven method for the interpretable modelling, learning, prediction, and control of complex human behaviours, which is realised by differentiable programming. Solely from input features and choice outcomes without any prior knowledge, Diff-DCM can estimate interpretable closed-form utility functions that reproduce observed behaviours. Comprehensive experiments with both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that Diff-DCM can be applied to various types of data and requires only a small amount of computational resources for the estimations, which can be completed within tens of seconds on a laptop without any accelerators. In these experiments, we also demonstrate that, using its differentiability, Diff-DCM can provide useful insights into human behaviours, such as an optimal intervention path for effective behavioural changes. This study provides a strong basis for the fully automated and reliable modelling, prediction, and control of human behaviours.</description>

      <title>Beyond Predictions: A Participatory Framework for Multi-Stakeholder Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional automated decision-support systems, often based on supervised learning, focus on predicting outcomes to recommend actions. However, they typically overlook the complexity of multi-actor environments, where diverse and conflicting stakeholder preferences must be balanced. At the same time, participatory AI approaches remain largely context-specific, limiting their broader applicability. To address these gaps, we propose a participatory framework that reframes decision-making as a multi-stakeholder optimization problem, using context-dependent reward functions to represent each actor's preferences. Our modular, model-agnostic framework employs k-fold cross-validation to fine-tune user-provided prediction models and evaluate decision strategies, including compromise functions that mediate stakeholder trade-offs. A synthetic scoring mechanism aggregates user-defined preferences across multiple metrics to rank strategies and select an optimal decision-maker for generating actionable recommendations on new data. Validated on two high-stake real-world case studies, the framework consistently produces stakeholder-aware decisions that outperform purely predictive baselines across multiple metrics, while enhancing the transparency and accountability of AI-supported decision-making.</description>

      <title>A unifying approach to self-organizing systems interacting via conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for embedding and analyzing dynamical systems using generalized projection operators rooted in local conservation laws. By representing physical, biological, and engineered systems as graphs with incidence and cycle matrices, we derive dual projection operators that decompose network fluxes and potentials. This formalism aligns with principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and captures a broad class of systems governed by flux-forcing relationships and local constraints. We extend this approach to collective dynamics through the PRojective Embedding of Dynamical Systems (PrEDS), which lifts low-dimensional dynamics into a high-dimensional space, enabling both replication and recovery of the original dynamics. When systems fall within the PrEDS class, their collective behavior can be effectively approximated through projection onto a mean-field space. We demonstrate the versatility of PrEDS across diverse domains, including resistive and memristive circuits, adaptive flow networks (e.g., slime molds), elastic string networks, and particle swarms. Notably, we establish a direct correspondence between PrEDS and swarm dynamics, revealing new insights into optimization and self-organization. Our results offer a general theoretical foundation for analyzing complex networked systems and for designing systems that self-organize through local interactions.</description>
