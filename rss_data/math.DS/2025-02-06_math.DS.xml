      <title>Cantor sets in higher dimension I: Criterion for stable intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometry of dynamically defined Cantor sets in arbitrary dimensions, introducing a criterion for $\mathcal{C}^{1+\alpha}$ stable intersections of such Cantor sets, under a mild bunching condition. This condition is naturally satisfied for perturbations of conformal Cantor sets and, in particular, always holds in dimension one. Our work extends the celebrated recurrent compact set criterion of Moreira and Yoccoz for stable intersection of Cantor sets in the real line to higher-dimensional spaces. Based on this criterion, we develop a method for constructing explicit examples of stably intersecting Cantor sets in any dimension. This construction operates in the most fragile and critical regimes, where the Hausdorff dimension of one of the Cantor sets is arbitrarily small and both Cantor sets are nearly homothetical. All results and examples are provided in both real and complex settings.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric infinite sumsets in large sets of integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for any set $A \subset \mathbb{N}$ with positive upper density and any $\ell,m \in \mathbb{N}$, there exist an infinite set $B\subset \mathbb{N}$ and some $t\in \mathbb{N}$ so that $\{mb_1 + \ell b_2 \colon b_1,b_2\in B\ \text{and}\ b_1&lt;b_2 \}+t \subset A,$ verifying a conjecture of Kra, Moreira, Richter and Robertson. We also consider the patterns $\{mb_1 + \ell b_2 \colon b_1,b_2\in B\ \text{and}\ b_1 \leq b_2 \}$, for infinite $B\subset \mathbb{N}$ and prove that any set $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ with lower density $\underline{d}(A)&gt;1/2$ contains such configurations up to a shift. We show that the value $1/2$ is optimal and obtain analogous results for values of upper density and when no shift is allowed.</description>

      <title>Primitive prime divisors in the forward orbit of a polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the polynomial $f(z) \in \mathbb{Q}[z]$, we consider the Zsigmondy set $\mathcal{Z}(f,0)$ associated to the numerators of the sequence $\{f^n(0)\}_{n \geq 0}$. In this paper, we provide an upper bound on the largest element of $\mathcal{Z}(f, 0)$. As an application, we show that the largest element of the set $\mathcal{Z}(f,0)$ is bounded above by $6$ when $f(z) = z^d + z^e +c \in \mathbb{Q}[z]$, with $d&gt;e \geq 2$ and $|c|&gt;2$. Furthermore, when $f(z) =z^d+c \in \mathbb{Q}[z]$ with $|f(0)| &gt; 2^{\frac{d}{d-1}}$ and $d &gt;2$, we also deduce a result of Krieger [Int. Math. Res. Not. IMRN, 23 (2013), pp. 5498-5525] as a consequence of our main result.</description>

      <title>Capturing the short-term characteristics of a barred galaxy from a single snapshot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a dataset of stars from a barred galaxy that provides instantaneous positions and velocities in the sky, we propose a method to identify its key structures, such as the central bar and spiral arms, and to determine the bar pattern speed in the short term. This is accomplished by applying combinatorial and topological data analysis techniques to the available star-state information set.
  To validate the methodology, we apply it to two scenarios: a test particle simulation and a N-body simulation, both evaluated when the bar is fully formed. In both cases, the results are robust and consistent. We then use these outcomes to calibrate a classical dynamical model and compute related structures, such as equilibrium points and invariant manifolds, which we verify align with the galaxy's spiral arms.</description>

      <title>The hyperspace {\omega}(f) when f is a transitive dendrite mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact metric space. By $2^X$ we denote the hyperspace of all closed and non-empty subsets of $X$ endowed with the Hausdorff metric. Let $f:X\to X$ be a continuous function. In this paper we study some topological properties of the hyperspace $\omega(f)$, the collection of all omega limits sets $\omega(x,f)$ with $x\in X$. We prove the following: $i)$ If $X$ has no isolated points, then, for every continuous function $f:X\to X$, $int_{2^X}(\omega(f))=\emptyset$. $ii)$ If $X$ is a dendrite for which every arc contains a free arc and $f:X\to X$ is transitive, then the hyperspace $\omega(f)$ is totally disconnected. $iii)$ Let $D_\infty$ be the Wazewski's universal dendrite. Then there exists a transitive continuous function $f:D_\infty\to D_\infty$ for which the hyperspace $\omega(f)$ contains an arc; hence, $\omega(f)$ is not totally disconnected.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Holomorphic Hamiltonian Systems and K\"ahler Duality of Complex Coadjoint Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis is split up into two parts: The first one concerns (pseudo)-holomorphic Hamiltonian systems, while the second part is about K\"ahler structures of complex coadjoint orbits. We begin the first part by investigating basic properties of holomorphic Hamiltonian systems (HHSs) like maximal holomorphic trajectories and holomorphic Hamiltonian foliations. Afterwards, we use these notions to combine HHSs with two structures frequently studied in geometry, namely Lefschetz and almost toric fibrations, leading us to the notion of a holomorphic symplectic Lefschetz fibration. Following this examination, we formulate action functionals for HHSs. These action functionals are well-suited to find periodic orbits. However, it turns out that HHSs rarely exhibit periodic orbits. One possible obstruction for a HHS to possess periodic orbits is the integrability of the underlying complex structure. To circumvent this obstruction, we introduce the notion of pseudo-holomorphic Hamiltonian systems (PHHSs) which allow us to describe classical mechanics on almost complex manifolds. We show that PHHSs satisfy almost the same properties as HHSs. In the second part, we study coadjoint orbits of complex Lie groups and show that they also exhibit, next to their Hyperk\"ahler structure which was introduced by Kronheimer and Kovalev in the 90s, a holomorphic K\"ahler structure. A holomorphic K\"ahler structure can be thought of as a complexification of a usual K\"ahler structure. We call the fact that a space admits both Hyperk\"ahler and holomorphic K\"ahler structures ''K\"ahler duality''. In this thesis, we suspect that the K\"ahler duality of complex coadjoint orbits can be traced back to double cotangent bundles. Precisely speaking, we conjecture that double cotangent bundles naturally exhibit K\"ahler duality and that this K\"ahler duality transfers via reduction to complex coadjoint orbits.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian split tori in $S^2 \times S^2$ and billiards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify up to Hamiltonian isotopy Lagrangian tori that split as a product of circles in $S^2 \times S^2$, when the latter is equipped with a non-monotone split symplectic form. We show that this classification is equivalent to a problem of mathematical billiards in rectangles. We give many applications, among others: (1) answering a question on Lagrangian packing numbers raised by Polterovich--Shelukhin, (2) studying the topology of the space of Lagrangian tori, and (3) determining which split tori are images under symplectic ball embeddings of Chekanov or product tori in $\mathbb{R}^4$.</description>

      <title>Dense Lineable Criterion for Linear Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Li-Yorke chaos for sequences of continuous linear operators from an \(F\)-space to a normed space. We introduce the \emph{D-phenomenon} to establish a common dense lineable criterion that encompasses properties such as recurrence, universality, and Li-Yorke chaos. We show that in every infinite-dimensional separable complex Banach space, there exists a sequence of operators with a dense set of irregular vectors but without a dense irregular manifold, and we exhibit a recurrent operator whose set of recurrent vectors is not dense-lineable. This resolves in the negative a question posed by Grivaux et al.</description>

      <title>Poisson Hypothesis and large-population limit for networks of spiking neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study mean-field descriptions for spatially-extended networks of linear (leaky) and quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons with stochastic spiking times. We consider large-population limits of continuous-time Galves-L\"ocherbach (GL) networks with linear and quadratic intrinsic dynamics. We prove that that the Poisson Hypothesis holds for the replica-mean-field limit of these networks, that is, in a suitably-defined limit, neurons are independent with interaction times replaced by independent time-inhomogeneous Poisson processes with intensities depending on the mean firing rates, extending known results to networks with quadratic intrinsic dynamics and resets. Proving that the Poisson Hypothesis holds opens up the possibility of studying the large-population limit in these networks. We prove this limit to be a well-posed neural field model, subject to stochastic resets.</description>

Abstract: We study the post-critical set of a class of holomorphic systems with an irrationally indifferent fixed point. We prove a trichotomy for the topology of the post-critical set based on the arithmetic of the rotation number at the fixed point. The only options are Jordan curves, a one-sided hairy Jordan curves, and Cantor bouquet. This explains the degeneration of the closed invariant curves inside the Siegel disks, as one varies the rotation number.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we obtain 32 canonical forms for 3D piecewise smooth vector fields presenting the so called cusp-fold singularity. All these canonical forms are topologically distinct and collect the main topological aspects of the singularities described as kind of the tangencies involved and positions of the sliding, escaping and crossing regions. Also, one-parameter bifurcations of these canonical forms are presented and the topologically equivalent piecewise smooth vector fields are obtained.</description>

We prove that if over the boundary of $P$ there is a S or Z shaped bifurcation graph containing two opposing fold bifurcation points while over the rest of the boundary there are no other bifurcation points, then, if there is no fold-Hopf bifurcation in $P$ then there is at least one cusp in the interior of $P$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop combinatorial tools to study partial rigidity within the class of minimal $\mathcal{S}$-adic subshifts. By leveraging the combinatorial data of well-chosen Kakutani-Rokhlin partitions, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for partial rigidity. Additionally, we provide an explicit expression to compute the partial rigidity rate and an associated partial rigidity sequence. As applications, we compute the partial rigidity rate for a variety of constant length substitution subshifts, such as the Thue-Morse subshift, where we determine a partial rigidity rate of 2/3. We also exhibit non-rigid substitution subshifts with partial rigidity rates arbitrarily close to 1 and as a consequence, using products of the aforementioned substitutions, we obtain that any number in $[0, 1]$ is the partial rigidity rate of a system.</description>

      <title>Dynamics, data and reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven learning is prevalent in many fields of science, mathematics and engineering. The goal of data-driven learning of dynamical systems is to interpret timeseries as a continuous observation of an underlying dynamical system. This task is not well-posed for a variety of reasons. A dynamical system may have multiple sub-systems co-existing within it. The nature of the dataset depends on the portion of the phase space being viewed, and may thus my confined to a sub-system. Secondly these sub-systems may be topologically inter-weaved, so may be inseparable computationally. Thirdly, two timeseries sampled separately from different dynamical systems may be close or even indistinguishable. So there is no unique source for the timeseries. We show how these ambiguities are circumvented if one considers dynamical systems and measurement maps collectively. This is made possible in a category theoretical framework, in which reconstruction is unique up to equivalences. Dynamical systems, observed dynamical systems, and timeseries data - each of these three collections have an extensive network of relations within them, which gives them the mathematical structure of a category. We show that the transformations preserve these relations, and thus have the mathematical property of being functors. Secondly we show that under mild conditions of consistency, reconstruction algorithms are themselves functors from the category of timeseries-data into the category of dynamical systems. Finally we present that the task of inverting the transformation of dynamics in the language of Kan extensions.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on the dense uniform Li-Yorke chaos for linear operators on a Banach space. Some sufficient conditions and equivalent conditions are established under which the dynamical system is densely uniformly Li-Yorke chaotic. It is shown that there are plenty of densely uniformly Li-Yorke chaotic operators. For unilateral backward weighted shifts and bilateral backward weighted shifts on $\ell^p$, it is shown that Li-Yorke chaos is equivalent to dense uniform Li-Yorke chaos.</description>

      <title>An inverse of Furstenberg's correspondence principle and applications to van der Corput sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain an inverse of Furstenberg's correspondence principle in the setting of cancellative, amenable semigroups. Besides being of intrinsic interest on its own, this result allows us to answer a variety of questions concerning sets of recurrence and van der Corput (vdC) sets, which were posed by Bergelson and Lesigne \cite{BL}, Bergelson and Ferr\'e Moragues \cite{BF}, and Moreira \cite{Mor}. We also prove a spectral characterization of vdC sets and prove some of their basic properties in the context of countable amenable groups.
  Several results in this article were independently discovered by Sohail Farhangi and Robin Tucker-Drob in \cite{FT}.</description>
