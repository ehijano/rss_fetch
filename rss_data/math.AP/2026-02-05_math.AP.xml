      <title>Using wave packet decompositions to construct function spaces: a user guide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey the construction of a range of function spaces used in harmonic analysis of PDE, including classical results as well as recent developments. We frame these constructions in a common conceptual framework, where these function spaces arise as retracts of simple function spaces over phase space, through a projection associated with a wave packet decomposition. Finding appropriate function spaces to study a given PDE then consists in choosing a relevant wave packet decomposition. We provide a user guide to making such choices, and constructing the corresponding function spaces. This is done mostly by surveying recent constructions, but we also include a new construction, adapted to Schr\"odinger operators of the form $\Delta - V$ for $V \geq 0$, as a sneak peek into upcoming joint work with Dorothee Frey, Andrew Morris, and Adam Sikora.</description>

      <title>A note on exterior stability of finite time singularity formation for nonlinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of the exterior of Type I and Type II singularity formation for the wave maps equation in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ with $d\geq2$ and the power nonlinear wave equation in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ with $d\geq3$: Given characteristic initial data on the backwards lightcone of the singularity $\mathcal{C}=\{t+r=0\}$ converging to the singular background solution along with suitable data on an outgoing cone, we establish existence in a region $\{t+r\in(0,v_1),t-r\in(-1,0)\}$ for some suitably small $v_1$, i.e. all the way to the Cauchy horizon. Our result hinges on a particular set of assumptions on the regularity properties of these initial data and is therefore conjectural on the behaviour inside the lightcone.
  The proof goes via a suitable change of coordinates and an application of the scattering result of [KK25], which, in particular, also applies to scaling-critical potentials.
  In the case of the wave maps equation, we only provide the proof in the corotational symmetry class, but we also sketch how to lift this restriction.</description>

      <title>Hotspot formation driven by temperature-dependent coefficients in one-dimensional thermoviscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript is concerned with a two-component evolution system generalizing the classical model for one-dimensional thermoviscoelastic dynamics in Kelvin-Voigt materials in the presence of temperature-dependent viscosities and elastic stiffnesses. Under suitable assumptions on the growth of these ingredients and on the initial data, the occurrence of finite-time blow-up with respect to the $L^\infty$ norm in the temperature variable is discovered.</description>

      <title>Large-data global solutions to a quasilinear model for viscuos acoustic wave propagation in a non-isothermal setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manuscript considers the model for conversion of mechanical energy into heat during acoustic wave propagation in the presence of temperature-dependent elastic parameters, as given by \[
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
  u_{tt} = (\gamma(\Theta) u_{xt})_x + a (\gamma(\Theta) u_x)_x, \\[1mm]
  \Theta_t = D\Theta_{xx} + \gamma(\Theta) u_{xt}^2.
  \end{array} \right.
  \qquad \qquad (\star) \] It is firstly shown that when considered along with no-flux boundary conditions in an open bounded real interval $\Omega$, under the assumption that $\gamma\in C^2([0,\infty))$ is such that $\gamma&gt;0$ and $\gamma'\ge 0$ on $[0,\infty)$ as well as \[
  D\cdot (\gamma+D) \cdot \gamma'' + 2\gamma \gamma'^2 \le 0
  \qquad \mbox{on } [0,\infty), \] for all suitably regular initial data this problem admits a globally defined classical solution. This complements recent findings in the literature, according to which ($\star$) may admit solutions blowing up in finite time whenever $\gamma$ is positive and nondecreasing on $[0,\infty)$ with $\int_0^\infty \frac{d\xi}{\gamma(\xi)} &lt; \infty$.
  Apart from that, it is found that if the additional assumption \[
  a|\Omega|^2 \le \frac{\pi^2 \gamma(0)}{1+\sqrt{1+\frac{\gamma(0)}{D}}} \] is satisfied, the all these solutions stabilize toward some spatially homogeneous equilibrium in the large time limit.</description>

      <title>Local strong solutions in a quasilinear Moore-Gibson-Thompson type model for thermoviscoelastic evolution in a standard linear solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript is concerned with the evolution system \[
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
  u_{ttt} + \alpha u_{tt} = \big(\gamma(\Theta) u_{xt}\big)_x + \big( \widehat{\gamma}(\Theta) u_x\big)_x,
  \Theta_t = D \Theta_{xx} + \Gamma(\Theta) u_{xt}^2,
  \end{array} \right. \] which arises as a simplified model for heat generation during acoustic wave propagation in a one-dimensional viscoelastic medium of standard linear solid type.
  Under the assumptions that $D&gt;0$ and $\alpha\ge 0$, and that $\gamma, \widehat{\gamma}$ and $\Gamma$ are sufficiently smooth with $\gamma&gt;0, \widehat{\gamma}&gt;0$ and $\Gamma\ge 0$ on $[0,\infty)$, for suitably regular initial data a statement on local existence and uniqueness of solutions in an associated Neumann problem is derived in a suitable framework of strong solvability.</description>

      <title>On a Mathematical Model Describing Chemotherapeutic Drug Treatment for Tumor Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a semilinear parabolic PDE system which describes the interaction of normal cells, tumor cells, immune cells, with a chemotherapeutic drug. The model extends the previous model with incorporating strong Allee affects in the normal-tissue and tumor dynamics. Under mild assumptions, we establish global-in-time existence and uniqueness of nonnegative weak solutions and derive L-infinity bounds for all time. We then investigate spatiotemporal dynamics of the model and therapy scheduling using an implicit Crank Nicolson Backward Euler (CNBE) scheme. Simulations in a heterogeneous two-dimensional space-dimensional tissue region with three tumor peaks indicate rapid tumor invasion without treatment and significant tumor suppression under pulsed chemotherapeutic treatment. Moreover, in a fixed total dose delivered within the treatment cycle, while keeping each injection duration fixed, concentrated pulses produce stronger early knock-down of tumor density, while more frequent but gentler pulses achieve comparable control of the tumor invasive front while better preserving normal tissue over a four-week period.</description>

      <title>The Existence, uniqueness, and regularity of weak solutions for a thermodynamically consistent two-phase flow model in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamically consistent models for two-phase flow in porous media have attracted significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we prove the existence, uniqueness and regularity of the weak solution to such a recent model proposed in [25,35]. To this end, firstly, we introduce a fully implicit time semi-discrete approximation and a fully discrete approximation for an appropriate weak formulation of the thermodynamically consistent model. Next, by using the zeros of a vector field theorem, we prove the existence of the weak solution for the fully discrete approximation. Then the existence of weak solutions for the fully implicit time semi-discrete approximation and the weak formulation of the model are derived by the weak convergence technique and the energy stability estimate. Subsequently, by the Gr{\" o}nwall inequality, we prove the uniqueness result under the smoothness assumption on the chemical potential. Finally, combined with the regularity theory of elliptic partial differential equations (PDE), the regularity of the weak solution for the model with complete Neumann boundary conditions is established.</description>

      <title>Existence and Spatial Decay of Forced Waves for the Fisher-KPP Equation with a Degenerate Shifting Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies forced waves for the heterogeneous Fisher-KPP equation $u_t = u_{xx} + u(a(x-ct)-u)$, where $c&gt;0$ and $a(z)&gt;0$ satisfies $a(-\infty)=\alpha&gt;0=a(+\infty)$, $a'(z)\le0$ ($z\gg1$). Using ODE asymptotic analysis, we classify all local positive solutions near $z=+\infty$. Exponential decay solutions always exist; non-exponential decay solutions exist if and only if $\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{1}{c}\int_{z_0}^z a(s)ds}\in L^1$ (or equivalently, when $a(z)$ decays slower than a critical algebraic rate).
  We establish a complete existence, multiplicity and spatial decay theory for forced waves. For each $c\in(0,2\sqrt\alpha)$, there exists a unique exponentially decaying forced wave. This wave is either the unique forced wave or the minimal forced wave, depending on the integrability condition. In the super-critical case $\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{1}{c}\int_{z_0}^z a(s)ds}\in L^1$, for any $c&gt;0$ there exist infinitely many non-exponentially decaying forced waves. The maximal wave is not in $L^1$, and for nearly all such $a(z)$ we establish the existence, multiplicity and precise decay of these waves.
  These results provide nearly complete answers to open problems concerning the existence, uniqueness, multiplicity and spatial decay rates of forced waves in Fisher-KPP models with degenerate moving environments.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of pure bubble type II blow-up solutions to energy critical wave equation in the 3D radial case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider the focusing, energy-critical wave equation in 3D radial case. According to the soliton resolution conjecture, which has been verified in the radial case, any type II blow-up solution decomposes into a superposition of several decoupled grounds states, a free wave and a small error, as time tends to the blow-up time. We prove that there does not exist any pure bubble type II blow up solutions. In other words, the free wave part is never zero in the soliton resolution of type II blow-up solutions, regardless of the bubble number.</description>

      <title>Global Regularity for Non-resistive or Non-viscous MHD System on the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the global well-posedness of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system on $n-$dimensional $(n\geq 2)$ periodic boxes with either no magnetic diffusivity (non-resistive case) or no fluid viscosity (non-viscous case) under assumption that initial magnetic fields are sufficiently close to the background magnetic field ${\bf e}_n=(0,\cdots,0,1)$. In Eulerian coordinates, we develop novel time-weighted energy estimates and commutator estimates involving Riesz transforms in negative Sobolev spaces to handle two distinct dissipation cases under different initial symmetry assumptions. The analysis becomes much more difficult and delicate in three- or higher-dimensional cases. In particular, for the three-dimensional and non-resistive case, compared with the regularity requirement proposed by Pan, Zhou and Zhu {\it [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 2018]}, our result relaxes it from $H^{11}(\mathbb{T}^3)$ to $H^{\frac{9}{2}+}(\mathbb{T}^3)$. And we further establish precise decay rates and growth bounds for both $u(t)$ and $\partial_n(u(t),b(t))$ in Sobolev norms. For the three-dimensional and non-viscous case, we prove the first nonlinear stability result near the background field $\mathbf{e}_3 = (0,0,1)$. This sharply contrasts with the recent blow-up results on the 3D incompressible Euler equations by Elgindi {\it [Ann. Math. 2021]}, Chen-Hou {\it [Commun. Math. Phys. 2021]} and by Chen-Hou {\it [arXiv:2210.07191]}. Our results show that, under certain symmetry assumptions, magnetic fields near the background field provide enhanced dissipations and suppress potential blow-up mechanisms in non-viscous MHD system.</description>

      <title>On the Cauchy problem to the axially-symmetric solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem to the axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations. To prove an existence of global regular solutions we examine the Navier-Stokes equations near the axis of symmetry and far from it separately. We derive only a global a priori estimate. To show it near the axis of symmetry we need the energy estimate, $L_\infty$-estimate for swirl, $H^2$ and $H^3$ estimates for the modified stream function (stream function divided by radius) and also expansions of velocity and modified stream function found by Liu-Wang. The estimate for solutions far from the axis of symmetry follows easily. Hence, having so regular solutions that Liu-Wang expansions hold we have the global a priori estimate $(\Omega=\mathbb{R}^3)$ $$ \|\omega_{r/r} \|_{V(\Omega^t)} + \|\omega_{\varphi/r}\|_{V(\Omega^t)}\le\phi({\rm data}),\ \ t&lt;\infty, \qquad(*) $$ where $\omega_r$ is the radiar component of vorticity, $\omega_\varphi$ the angular, $V(\Omega^t)$ is the energy norm. Estimate $(*)$ can be treated as an a priori estimate derived on sufficiently regular solutions. Increasing regularity of solutions $(*)$ we derive the estimate $$\eqalign{ &amp;\|v\|_{W_3^{3,3/2}(\Omega^t)}+\|\nabla p\|_{W_3^{1,1/2}(\Omega^t)}\cr &amp;\le\phi(\phi({\rm data}),\|f\|_{W_3^{1,1/2}(\Omega^t)},\|v(0)\|_{W_3^{3-2/3}(\Omega)}),\cr} \qquad(**) $$ where $\phi$ is an increasing positive function. The estimate is proved on the local solution. Estimate $(**)$ plus existence of local solutions imply the existence of global regular solutions to the Cauchy problem.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Boltzmann equation from hard-sphere dynamics (after Y. Deng, Z. Hani, and X. Ma)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a microscopic system of $N$ hard spheres that are initially independent (modulo the exclusion condition on particle positions) and identically distributed in $\mathbb{R}^3$. When the number $N$ of particles goes to infinity and the diameter $\varepsilon$ of the particles goes to zero, and under the weak density assumption $N\varepsilon^2=1$, it has been known since the work of Lanford that the empirical measure for the particles converges to the solution of the Boltzmann equation in a short time interval. In particular, the particles remain dynamically independent, in this limit and in the short time interval where the correlations induced by their collisions remain under control. In a recent work, Y. Deng, Z. Hani and X. Ma successfully obtained the same convergence result in arbitrary large time; more precisely, the convergence result holds for any time interval on which the Boltzmann equation has a regular solution. In this note, we explain a few elements of their proof.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of stochastic primitive equations with relaxed hydrostatic assumption as a higher order approximation of 3D stochastic Navier-Stokes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence of solutions of a stochastic representation of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations to those of their primitive equations counterpart. Our analysis covers both weak and strong convergence regimes, corresponding respectively to rigid-lid and "fully periodic" boundary conditions. Furthermore, we explore the impact of relaxing the hydrostatic assumption in the stochastic primitive equations by retaining martingale terms as deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium. This modified model, obtained through a specific asymptotic scaling accessible only within the stochastic framework, captures non-hydrostatic effects while remaining within the primitive equations formalism. The resulting generalized hydrostatic model has been shown to be well-posed when the additional terms are regularized using a suitable filter for divergence-free noises under suitable assumptions. Within this setting, we demonstrate that the model provides a higher-order approximation of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations for appropriately scaled noises.</description>

      <title>The monotonicity method for the inverse elastic scattering on unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a time-harmonic inverse scattering problem for the Navier equation with compactly supported penetrable and possibly inhomogeneous scattering objects in an unbounded homogeneous background medium, and we develop a monotonicity relation for the far field operator that maps superpositions of incident plane waves to the far field patterns of the corresponding scattered waves. Combining the monotonicity relation with the method of localized potentials, we extend the so called monotonicity method to characterize the support of inhomogeneities in the Lam\'{e} parameters and the density in terms of the far field operator.</description>

Abstract: The isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes system subject to the Navier-slip boundary conditions is considered in a general three-dimensional exterior domain. For the density approaches far-field vacuum initially and the viscosities are power functions of the density({\rho}^{\delta} with 0 &lt; {\delta}&lt; 1), the local well-posedness of strong solutions is established in this paper. In particular, the method we adopt can not only simultaneously handle the difficulties caused by boundary terms and far-field vacuum, but also make the selection of {\delta} independent of the gas coefficient {\gamma}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact Riemannian manifold without boundary, with $L^2$-normalized Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions $\{e_j\}_j$, which satisfy $\Delta_g e_j = -\lambda_j^2 e_j$. We study the following inner product of eigenfunctions \[
  \langle e_{i_1} e_{i_2} \ldots e_{i_k}, e_{i_{k+1}} \rangle = \int e_{i_1} e_{i_2}\ldots e_{i_k} \overline{e_{i_{k+1}}} \, dV. \] We show that, after a mild averaging in the frequency variables, the main $\ell^2$-concentration of this inner product is determined by the measure of a set of configurations of $(k+1)$-gons whose side lengths are the frequencies $\lambda_{i_1}, \lambda_{i_2}, \dots, \lambda_{i_{k+1}}$. We prove that a rapidly vanishing proportion of this mass lies in the regime where $\lambda_{i_1}, \lambda_{i_2}, \dots, \lambda_{i_{k+1}}$ cannot occur as the side lengths of any $(k+1)$-gon.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Ultracontractivity for a class of Schroedinger Semigroups in $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ by Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this article we present a growth condition on the potential $q$ in the Schr\"odinger operator $H=-\Delta + q(x)$ in $\mathrm{L}^{2}\left( \mathbb{R}^{n} \right)$ that implies Rosen inequalities for the ground state $\varphi$ of $H$, i.e.
  $\forall \varepsilon &gt; 0 \exists \gamma(\varepsilon) &gt; 0 \ : \ - \ln\left( \varphi(x) \right) \leq \varepsilon q(x) + \gamma(\varepsilon)$.
  While these inequalities are not particularly interesting in themselves, they offer Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities which are absolutely essential to prove an intrinsic ultracontractivity of the associated Schr\"odinger semigroup $\mathrm{e}^{-tH}$, i.e.
  $\forall t&gt;0 \exists C_{t} &gt; 0 \ : \ \left| \mathrm{e}^{-tH} u (x) \right| \ \leq \ C_{t} \varphi(x) \| u \|_{2}$
  holds for every $u \in \mathrm{L}^{2}\left( \mathbb{R}^{n} \right)$ almost everywhere in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ which we prove in the second part of this article. For proving Rosen inequalities we focus on solving a radial Schr\"odinger inequality and use Agmon's version of the comparison principle and Young's inequality for increasing functions. We follow the classic method proving intrinsic ultracontractivity of $\mathrm{e}^{-tH}$ by using weighted Sobolev function spaces, weighted Schr\"odinger semigroups and Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a class of potentials $q \colon \mathbb{R}^{n} \to (0,\infty)$ that implies the weighted Schr\"odinger semigroup $\varphi^{-1}\mathrm{e}^{-tH}\varphi$ to map a weighted Lebesgue function space $\mathrm{L}_{\mu}^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ into a weighted Lebesgue function space $\mathrm{L}_{\mu}^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ continously at every time $t&gt;0$ by Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for $H=-\Delta + q(x)$ with it's strictly positive ground state $\varphi \colon \mathbb{R}^{n} \to (0,\infty)$. We use the self-adjointness of $\mathrm{e}^{-tH}$ in $\mathrm{L}^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ to infer an intrinsic ultracontractivity, i.e.
  $\forall t&gt;0 \ \exists C_{t} &gt; 0 \ : \ \left| \mathrm{e}^{-tH} u (x) \right| \ \leq \ C_{t} \varphi(x) \| u \|_{2}$

      <title>Blow-up Solutions for General Toda Systems on Riemann Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study general Toda systems with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on Riemann surfaces. Assuming the surface satisfies the ``$k$-symmetric'' condition, we construct a family of bubbling solutions using singular perturbation methods, where the concentration rates of different components occur in distinct orders. In particular, we establish the existence of asymmetric blow-up solutions for the $SU(3)$ Toda system. Furthermore, the blow-up points are precisely located at the ``$k$-symmetric'' centers of the surface.

      <title>Blow-up solutions for mean field equations with non-quantized singularities on Riemann surfaces with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mean field equations with singular sources on a compact Riemann surface with boundary $(\Sigma,g)$, subject to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions:
  \[
  -\Delta_g v
  = \rho\left( \frac{V e^{v}}{\int_\Sigma V e^{v}\, d v_g}
  - \frac{1}{|\Sigma|_g}\right)
  - \sum_{\xi\in Q} \frac{\varrho(\xi)}{2}\gamma(\xi)
  \left(\delta_{\xi}- \dfrac{1}{|\Sigma|_g}\right)
  \text{in }\Sigma; \qquad
  \partial_{\nu_g} v = 0
  \text{ on }\partial\Sigma.
  \]
  Here, $V$ is a smooth positive function, $\rho$ is a non-negative parameter, $Q\subset\Sigma$ is a finite set of prescribed singular points, and the singular weights satisfy $\gamma(\xi)\in(-1,+\infty)\setminus(\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\})$. The coefficients are given by $\varrho(\xi)=8\pi$ for $\xi \in\Sigma\setminus\partial\Sigma$ and $\varrho(\xi)=4\pi$ for $\xi \in\partial\Sigma$.
  We construct blow-up solutions in the non-quantized singular regime, including purely singular and mixed singular-regular blow-up cases, with parameters approaching resonant values. The construction is achieved via a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction under suitable stability assumptions.

      <description>arXiv:2602.04822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate an inverse problem for a semi-linear wave equation posed in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, with $n \geq 2$. Our primary objective is to reconstruct the damping coefficient, the linear potential, and the nonlinear potential from the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. The analysis is based on a higher-order linearization method. As a key step, we establish the existence of suitable asymptotic solutions, crucial for reconstructing the nonlinear potential. In addition, we also provide a detailed study of the corresponding forward problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that $H^{m,p}(\Omega) = W^{m,p}(\Omega)$ holds for any $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, $p \in [1, \infty)$, and open subset $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Due to the essential difficulty that there exists no nontrivial translation-invariant measure in infinite dimensions, it is hard to obtain its infinite-dimensional counterparts. In this paper, using infinite-dimensional analogues of the classical techniques of truncation, boundary straightening, and partition of unity, we prove that smooth cylinder functions are dense in $W^{m,p}(O)$. Consequently, $H^{m,p}(O) = W^{m,p}(O)$ holds for any $m \in \mathbb{N}$, $p \in [1, \infty)$, and open subset $O$ of $\ell^2$ with a suitable boundary. Moreover, in the key step of compact truncation, we also prove that the Schatten $p$-norm type estimates for the higher-order derivatives of the Gross convolution are sharp for $p = 2$.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence of the Gursky-Malchiodi $Q$-curvature Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In their seminal work, Gursky and Malchiodi introduced a non-local conformal flow in dimensions $n \geq 5$ to resolve the constant $Q$-curvature problem. They proved sequential convergence of the flow for initial metrics with positive scalar curvature and $Q$-curvature, provided the energy was sufficiently small.
  In this paper, we prove the global convergence of the flow for arbitrary initial energy under the same positivity assumptions by establishing a non-local version of the {\L}ojasiewicz-Simon inequality for the Paneitz-Sobolev quotient along the flow.
  We construct test bubbles and estimate their Paneitz-Sobolev quotients, a strategy that was carried out in the celebrated work of Brendle in the context of the Yamabe flow. We develop a more geometric and systematic proof that addresses the algebraic and computational complexity inherent in the $Q$-curvature and the Paneitz operator. Along the way, we derive a stability inequality for the Paneitz-Sobolev quotient using a higher-order Koiso-Bochner formula established in recent work of Bahuaud, Guenther, Isenberg, and Mazzeo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By employing harmonic analysis techniques, we derive weak-type Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities under natural parameter conditions. A key feature of these weak-type versions is that they remain valid even at critical parameter values where the classical inequalities fail. As an important corollary, we obtain weak-type Hardy inequalities that hold true even in the critical dimension \(d = p\). The methods developed here are sufficiently flexible to handle homogeneous, non-homogeneous and anisotropic weights, providing a unified approach to various endpoint cases in interpolation theory.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove full local well-posedness for the Cauchy problem for the compressible 3D Euler equation, i.e. local existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on initial data, with initial velocity, density and vorticity $(\mathbf{v}_0, \rho_0, \mathbf{w}_0) \in H^{2+} \times H^{2+} \times H^{2}$, improving on the regularity conditions of \cite{WQEuler}. The continuous dependence on initial data for rough solutions of the compressible Euler system is new, even with the same regularity conditions as in \cite{WQEuler}. In addition, we prove new local well-posedness results for the 3D compressible Euler system with entropy.</description>

      <title>Low regularity solutions for the Cauchy problem of the ideal incompressible Magnetohydrodynamics equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Lagrangian coordinates, the local well-posedness of low regularity solutions is established for an ideal incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) system subject to a homogeneous background magnetic field. First, the MHD system is reformulated into a degenerate wave-elliptic system with a particular null structure. By introducing a suitably defined solution space, several refined product estimates are derived. Next, using the inherent null structure, a Klainerman-Machedon type bilinear estimate is obtained for the nonlinear terms. These nice structures and estimates yield the local well-posedness of the ideal incompressible MHD equations in Lagrangian coordinates for initial velocity fields $\bv_0 \in H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with $s &gt; \frac{n+1}{2}$ $(n=2,3,4)$. Moreover, the regularity requirement is lowered by half a derivative compared with the classical exponent $s &gt; \frac{n}{2}+1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a construction proposed in \cite{acharyaQAM} that builds on the notion of weak solutions for incompressible fluids to provide a scheme that generates variationally a certain type of dual solutions. If these dual solutions are regular enough one can use them to recover standard solutions. The scheme provides a generalisation of a construction of Y. Brenier for the Euler equations. We rigorously analyze the scheme, extending the work of Y.Brenier for Euler, and also provide an extension of it to the case of the Navier-Stokes equations. Furthermore we obtain the inviscid limit of Navier-Stokes to Euler as a $\Gamma$-limit.</description>

      <title>Global smooth solutions of 2-D quadratic quasilinear wave equations with null conditions in exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For 3-D quadratic quasilinear wave equations with or without null conditions in exterior domains, when the compatible initial data and Dirichlet boundary values are given, the global existence or the maximal existence time of small data smooth solutions have been established in early references. For the Cauchy problem of 2-D quadratic quasilinear wave equations with null conditions, it has been shown that the small data smooth solutions exist globally. However, for the corresponding 2-D initial boundary value problem in exterior domains, it is still open whether the global solutions exist. In the present paper, we solve this open problem through proving the global existence of small solutions in exterior domains. Our main ingredients include: deriving new precise pointwise estimates for the initial boundary value problem of 2-D linear wave equations in exterior domains; finding appropriate divergence structures of quasilinear wave equations under null conditions; introducing a good unknown to eliminate the resulting $Q_0$ type nonlinearity, and establishing some crucial pointwise spacetime decay estimates of solutions and their derivatives.</description>

      <title>An extended variational setting for critical SPDEs with L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical variational setting was recently introduced and shown to be applicable to many important SPDEs not covered by the classical variational setting. In this paper, we extend the critical variational setting in several ways. We introduce a flexibility in the range space for the nonlinear drift term, due to which certain borderline cases can now also be included. An example of this is the Allen-Cahn equation in dimension two in the weak setting. In addition to this, we allow the drift to be singular in time, which is something that naturally arises in the study of the skeleton equations for large deviation principles for SPDEs. Last but not least, we present the theory in the case of L\'evy noise for which the critical setting was not available yet.</description>

      <title>Existence of variational solutions to doubly nonlinear systems in nondecreasing domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $q \in (0, \infty)$, we consider the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem to doubly nonlinear systems of the form \begin{align*}
  \partial_t \big( |u|^{q-1}u \big) - \operatorname{div} \big( D_\xi f(x,u,Du) \big) = - D_u f(x,u,Du) \end{align*} in a bounded noncylindrical domain $E \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. We assume that $x \mapsto f(x,u,\xi)$ is integrable, that $(u,\xi) \mapsto f(x,u,\xi)$ is convex, and that $f$ satisfies a $p$-coercivity condition for some $p \in (1,\infty)$. However, we do not impose any specific growth condition from above on $f$. For nondecreasing domains that merely satisfy $\mathcal{L}^{n+1}(\partial E) = 0$, we prove the existence of variational solutions $u \in C^{0}([0,T];L^{q+1}(E,\mathbb{R}^N))$ via a nonlinear version of the method of minimizing movements. Moreover, under additional assumptions on $E$ and a $p$-growth condition on $f$, we show that $|u|^{q-1}u$ admits a weak time derivative in the dual $(V^{p,0}(E))^{\prime}$ of the subspace $V^{p,0}(E) \subset L^p(0,T;W^{1,p}(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^N))$ that encodes zero boundary values.</description>

      <title>Wave packet decompositions and sharp bilinear estimates for rough Hamiltonian flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to prove bilinear $L^p$ estimates for rough dispersive evolutions satisfying non-degeneracy and transversality assumptions. The estimates generalize the sharp Fourier extension estimates for the cone and the paraboloid. To this end, we require a wave packet decomposition with localization properties in space-time and space-time frequencies. Secondly, we construct a refined wave packet parametrix for dispersive equations with $C^{1,1}$-coefficients by using the FBI transform. As a consequence, we obtain bilinear estimates for solutions to dispersive equations with $C^{1,1}$ coefficients provided that the solutions interact transversely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Besov and Triebel--Lizorkin spaces on a manifold with boundary adapted to H\"ormander vector fields, near a so-called non-characteristic point of the boundary. We prove sharp results in these spaces for the corresponding restriction and trace operators, show these operators are retractions, and other related results. This is the second paper in a forthcoming series devoted to a general theory of maximally subelliptic boundary value problems, and lays the function space foundation for this general theory.</description>

      <title>Quantitative classification of potential Navier-Stokes singularities beyond the blow-up time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{hou}, Hou gave a compelling numerical candidate for a singular solution of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations. We pioneer classifications of potentially singular solutions, motivated by the issue of investigating the viability of numerical candidates.For approximately axisymmetric initial data, we give the first quantitative classification of potentially singular solutions at \textit{any} given time in the region of potential blow-up times. Moreover, the quantitative bounds in the vicinity of any potential blow-up time are in principle amenable to numerical testing. To achieve this, we establish improved quantitative regions of regularity for approximately axisymmetric initial data, which may be of independent interest. Together with improved quantitative energy estimates from \cite{TB24}, this allows us to get a quantitative lower bound in the vicinity of a blow-up time by implementing the strategy of \cite{BP21}, which is a physical space analogue of Tao's strategy \cite{Ta21} for producing quantitative estimates for critically bounded solutions. To obtain a quantitative lower bound on the solution at any time in the region of potential blow-up times, we recursively apply quantitative Carleman inequality arguments from \cite{Ta21}. This necessitates careful bookkeeping to avoid exponential losses and to ensure that all forward-in-time iterations of (localized) vorticity concentration remain within the region of quantitative regularity of the solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the incompressible three-dimensional Euler equations in a setting where a vortex ring undergoes radially expanding Lagrangian transport. To clarify the fundamental mechanisms responsible for nonlinear scale-local deformations of the vortex structure, we develop a geometric Lagrangian framework that avoids singular integral representations of the pressure and leads to the derivation of a novel wave equation governing the axis of swirling particles. Within this framework, we identify purely nonlinear mechanisms responsible for the emergence of scale-local deformations of the vortex structure, with the aid of a machine-learning-based analysis.</description>

      <title>Global weak solutions to the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with vacuum and unbounded density in a half-plane under Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the global existence of a class of weak solutions to the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations in a half-plane with Dirichlet boundary conditions, allowing for vacuum both in the interior and at infinity, under a suitably small initial total energy. The solutions constructed here admit unbounded densities and lie in an intermediate regularity regime between the finite-energy weak solutions of Lions-Feireisl and the framework of Hoff. This result generalizes previous works of Hoff (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 55 (2002), pp. 1365-1407) and Perepelitsa (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 212 (2014), pp. 709-726) concerning discontinuous solutions by allowing vacuum states and unbounded density. Our analysis relies on the Green function method and new estimates involving the specific structure of the equations and the geometry of the half-plane. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result concerning global weak solutions within Hoff's framework on an unbounded domain that simultaneously accommodates Dirichlet boundary conditions and far-field vacuum. The intermediate-regularity class developed here may be viewed as a natural extension of Hoff's theory, precisely tailored to overcome the two corresponding obstructions: the lack of global space-time control of the effective viscous flux arising from far-field vacuum and the absence of boundary-induced regularity gains in the no-slip setting.</description>

      <title>Multistatic anisotropic travel-time as a tensor tomography problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Travel-time imaging problems seek to reconstruct an image of reflectivity of a scene by measuring travel time (and amplitude, phase) of electromagnetic or acoustic signals, such as radar and sonar. Multistatic, in this context, means that the transmitters and receivers need not be co-located. The reflectivity is anisotropic if it depends on direction, and in the multistatic case this means incoming and outgoing direction. Travel-time problems can be formulated as generalized Radon transforms of integrals over isochrones, in the planar case ellipses with transmitter and receivers at foci. In a simplified case where transmitters and receivers are distant from the scene, isochrones can be approximated by straight lines. We relate this to tensor ray transforms, specifically the longitudinal ray transform of Sharafutdinov, and discuss the implication of its known null-space. In the volumetric case isochrones are spheroids and we relate the problem to the normal Radon transform of tensor fields.</description>

More precisely, we prove the Lipschitz continuity and the H\"older continuity of the gradient of minimizers. The analysis is based on techniques from De Giorgi's classical regularity theory. As a byproduct of our results, we also provide a characterization of the structure of the nodal sets of the minimizers.</description>

      <title>The Small-Dispersion Limit of the Intermediate Long Wave Equation via Semiclassical Soliton Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the small dispersion limit of the intermediate long wave (ILW) equation, specifically on a class of well-behaved initial conditions $u_0$ where the number of solitons in the solution increases without bound. First, we conduct a formal WKB-style analysis on the ILW direct scattering problem, generating approximate eigenvalues and norming constants. We then use this to define a modified set of scattering data and rigorously analyze the associated inverse scattering problem. The main results include demonstrating $L^2$-convergence of the solution at $t = 0$ to the original initial condition $u_0$ and for $0 &lt; t &lt; t_\mathrm{c}$ to the associated solution of invicid Burgers' equation, where $t_\mathrm{c}$ is the time of gradient catastrophe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the convergence properties of the upwind difference scheme for the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation, a central partial differential equation in optimal control theory. First, assuming the existence of a classical solution, we show that the numerical solution converges to the true solution with a first-order rate with respect to the time step. This result complements the square-root rate established in previous studies for viscosity solutions. Second, by exploiting the correspondence between HJB equations and conservation laws, we prove the convergence of the optimal control input. This analysis is crucial for practical applications where the control input is the primary quantity of interest, yet it has rarely been addressed in previous studies. Finally, we confirm the validity of our theoretical results through numerical experiments on typical control problems.</description>

      <title>On the Mean-Field limit of diffusive games through the master equation: $L^{\infty}$ estimates and extreme value behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an $N$-player game where the states of the players evolve with time as Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) with interaction only in the drift terms. Each player controls the drift of the SDE satisfied by her state process, aiming to minimize the expected value of a cost that depends on the paths of the player's state and the empirical measure of the states of all the players until a terminal time. When $N \to \infty$, previous works have established Central Limit Theorems and Large Deviation Principles for the state processes when the game is in Nash Equilibrium (the Nash states), by using the Master Equation to construct approximations of those processes that evolve with time as SDEs with classical Mean-Field interaction. Staying in this framework, we improve an existing $L^{1}$ estimate for the total error of approximating all the Nash states to an $L^{\infty}$ one, and we also establish the $N \to \infty$ asymptotic behavior of the upper order statistics of the Nash states. The latter initiates the development of an Extreme Value Theory for Stochastic Differential Games.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the buckling and clamped-plate problems to the context of differential forms on compact Riemannian manifolds with smooth boundary. We characterize their smallest eigenvalues and prove that, in the case of bounded Euclidean domains, their spectra without multiplicities on forms coincide with the spectra of the corresponding problems on functions. We obtain various estimates involving the first eigenvalues of the mentioned problems and the ones of the Hodge Laplacian with respect to Dirichlet and absolute boundary conditions on forms. These estimates generalize previous ones in the case of functions.</description>

Abstract: We provide an alternative construction of the quasi-Fuchsian flows introduced by Ghys in \cite{Ghys-92}. Our approach is based on the coupled vortex equations that allows to see these flows as thermostats on the unit tangent bundle of the Blaschke metric uniquely determined by a conformal class and a holomorphic quadratic differential. We also give formulas for the marked length spectrum of a quasi-Fuchsian flow in the thermostat parametrization.</description>

Abstract: In these notes, we emphasize Theorems rather than Theories concerning turbulent fluid motion. Such theorems can be viewed as constraints on the theoretical predictions and expectations of some of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century: Lars Onsager, Andrey Kolmogorov, Lev Landau, Lewis Fry Richardson among others.</description>
