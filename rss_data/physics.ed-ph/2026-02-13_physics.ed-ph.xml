      <title>Spreading viscous fluids on a horizontal surface: project-based learning in fluid mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spreading of a thin viscous fluid film on a horizontal surface is an interesting problem in fluid mechanics with many practical applications ranging from coating processes to biological systems and environmental flows. It can even be observed in everyday situations, such as syrup spreading on a pancake. We present a project-based learning approach to this problem, in which engineering or physics undergraduates apply classroom knowledge to understand and solve it, using dimensional analysis, experiments, and theoretical modeling. First, a dimensional analysis is conducted to guide the design of the experiment suitable for an undergraduate laboratory or even at home. The problem is then simplified to obtain a mathematical model that accounts for the experimental results. Through this process, students are able to obtain a solution compatible with those published in fluid mechanics journals with minimal supervision from the instructor. This project not only develops important skills but also motivates students by showing that they have the ability to solve complex problems.</description>
