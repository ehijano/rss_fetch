      <title>Parabolic skein modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop skein theory for 3-manifolds in the presence of codimension-one defects, focusing especially on defects arising from parabolic induction/restriction for quantum groups. We use these defects as a model for the quantum decorated character stacks of arXiv:2102.12283, thus extending them to 3-manifolds with surface defects. As a special case we obtain knot invariants closely related to the ``quantum $A$-polynomial", and we give a concrete method for computation resembling the approach of Dimofte and collaborators based on ideal triangulations and gluing equations.</description>

      <title>Generalized digroups, di-skew braces, and solutions of the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel algebraic structure called di-skew brace by which we show that generalized digroups systematically yield bijective, non-degenerate solutions to the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation. We study the structural properties of these solutions with a particular focus on their left derived shelves, which belong to the class of conjugation racks. Consistently, we show that these solutions belong to a broader class that includes skew brace solutions. In particular, we prove that each such solution can be decomposed as a hemi-semidirect product of a skew brace solution endowed with a certain compatible action on the idempotents of the associated di-skew brace structure. Finally, we provide concrete instances of these solutions through a suitable notion of averaging operators on groups.</description>

      <title>On braided Hopf structures on exterior algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the exterior algebra of a vector space $V$ of dimension greater than one admits a one-parameter family of braided Hopf algebra structures, arising from its identification with a Nichols algebra. We explicitly compute the structure constants with respect to a natural set-theoretic basis.
  A one-parameter family of diagonal automorphisms exists, which we use to construct solutions to the (constant) Yang--Baxter equation. These solutions are conjectured to give rise to the two-variable Links--Gould polynomial invariants associated with the super-quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(N|1))$, where $N = \dim(V)$. We support this conjecture through computations for small values of $N$.</description>

      <title>Affine standard Lyndon words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we establish the convexity and monotonicity for affine standard Lyndon words in all types, generalizing the $A$-type results of arXiv:2305.16299. We also derive partial results on the structure of imaginary standard Lyndon words and present a conjecture for their general form. Additionally, we provide computer code in Appendix which, in particular, allows to efficiently compute affine standard Lyndon words in exceptional types for all orders.</description>

      <title>Five-Term Relations for wreath Macdonald polynomials and tableau formulas for Pieri coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a variety of new identities involving operators in the theory of wreath Macdonald polynomials. One such family of identities gives five-term relations, analogous to the one given by Garsia and Mellit for the modified Macdonald polynomials. As a consequence, we generate tableau formulas for wreath Macdonald Pieri coefficients, which give an incredibly quick way of computing their monomial expansions.</description>

      <title>Tesler identities for wreath Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an explicit formula for an operator that sends a wreath Macdonald polynomial to the delta function at a character associated to its partition. This allows us to prove many new results for wreath Macdonald polynomials, especially pertaining to reciprocity: Macdonald--Koornwinder duality, evaluation formulas, etc. Additionally, we initiate the study of wreath interpolation Macdonald polynomials, derive a plethystic formula for wreath $(q,t)$-Kostka coefficients, and present series solutions to the bispectral problem involving wreath Macdonald operators. Our approach is to use the eigenoperators for wreath Macdonald polynomials that have been produced from quantum toroidal and shuffle algebras.</description>

      <title>Self-distributive structures, braces &amp; the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation is reviewed from a purely algebraic point of view. We recall certain algebraic structures called shelves, racks and quandles. These objects satisfy a self-distributivity condition and lead to solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. The quantum algebra as well as the integrability associated to Baxterized involutive set-theoretic solutions is briefly discussed. We then present the theory of the universal algebras associated to rack and general set-theoretic solutions. We show that these are quasi-triangular Hopf algebras and we derive the universal set-theoretic Drinfel'd twist. It is shown that this is an admissible twist allowing the derivation of the universal set-theoretic R-matrix.</description>
