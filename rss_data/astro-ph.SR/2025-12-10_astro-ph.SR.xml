      <title>Solar neutron and muon detection on November 11, 2025: First simultaneous recovery of energy spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground Level Enhancement (GLE) events provide rare opportunities to study high-energy solar particle acceleration through direct detection of secondary radiation at ground level. On November 11, 2025, the Aragats Solar Neutron Telescope (ASNT) recorded a statistically significant increase in high-energy neutron and muon fluxes associated with an X5.1 flare and the subsequent Solar Energetic Proton (SEP) event. The event displayed a unique dual-peak profile: an initial hard component at 10 28 UT, followed by a softer yet still energetic peak at 10 45 UT. For the first time, we report simultaneous energy spectra of atmospheric neutrons and muons measured in the 10 600 MeV range at Aragats. Broken-power-law fits reveal a clear temporal evolution of acceleration conditions, evidenced by spectral indices declining with energy. These findings highlight the unique capabilities of the ASNT as an instrument for studying extreme solar particle acceleration.</description>

      <title>von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov oscillations in nearby bright stars. I. Lambda Ophiuchi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of constraining both the inner and the outer orbits in multiple stars has resulted in a growing abyss between the rich theoretical and the sparse observational studies of von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov (ZKL) oscillations in stellar systems. Here we solve for the full orbital architecture of the bright intermediate-mass nearby system Lambda Ophiuchi based on astrometric measurements of the outer orbit (period of 129 years) compiled in the Sixth Catalog of Orbits of Visual Binary Stars and new VLTI/GRAVITY interferometric measurements that are used to determine the inner orbit (period of 42 days). The orbits are retrograde and misaligned by either $88.5\pm1.9^o$ or $113.5\pm1.9^o$, which in either case results in the inner binary currently undergoing ZKL oscillations. While pure Newtonian point source evolution would have predicted the stars in the inner binary to have merged long ago, in reality the eccentricity oscillations are significantly modulated by general relativistic, tidal and rotational bulge precession. We show that due to the effect of ``slaved'' precession the dynamics can still be solved semi-analytically. We find that the (currently unknown) inclination angles between the stellar spins axes and the inner orbital axis play a very important role in the amplitude of the ZKL oscillations, which is at a minimum $\Delta e = e_{\mathrm{max}} - e_{\mathrm{min}} \simeq 0.15$ and could be as high as $\Delta e \simeq 0.70$. We argue that currently feasible spectroscopic and interferometric observations could allow for a complete and unique dynamical solution for this system.</description>

      <title>Chemical Signatures of AGB Mass Transfer in Gaia White Dwarf Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a homogeneous abundance analysis of 160 main-sequence stars in astrometric white-dwarf + main-sequence (WD+MS) binaries with orbits from Gaia DR3. These systems have AU-scale separations and are thought to have undergone mass transfer (MT) when the WD progenitor was an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. Using high-resolution spectroscopy, we measure chemical abundances of the MS stars, focusing on s-process elements. Since s-process nucleosynthesis occurs mainly in AGB stars, s-process enhancement in the MS star is a key signature of accretion from an AGB companion. We identify 40 barium dwarfs -- 36 of them newly discovered -- roughly doubling the known population in astrometric WD+MS binaries and extending it to lower metallicities than previously studied. The s-process abundances show large star-to-star variations that correlate with component masses and with metallicity but not with orbital separation. At the lowest metallicities, three barium dwarfs display strong CH and $\rm C_2$ absorption bands, linking them to CEMP-s stars and implying that AGB mass transfer usually leads to strong carbon enhancement at low metallicity. By comparing the observed abundance patterns to AGB nucleosynthesis models, we show that the diversity of s-process enhancements can be explained by variations in donor mass, metallicity, and most importantly, the number of thermal pulses the AGB star experienced before the onset of MT. Variation in the depth of the accretors' convective envelopes, with which accreted material is diluted, strengthens correlations with MS star mass and metallicity. Our results establish Gaia WD+MS binaries as a powerful laboratory for constraining binary mass-transfer physics and the origins of chemically peculiar stars.</description>

      <title>Analytical Solutions for the Dynamics of Planetary Nebulae with and without Common Envelope Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new analytical solutions for the dynamics of planetary nebulae. These equations consider the temporal variation of the mechanical luminosity as well as the common envelope evolution scenario. By comparing a database of nebulae with these solutions, a large portion of planetary nebulae can be better explained by the common envelope evolution scenario, especially the fast and slow ones. Single AGB stellar models can only reproduce nebulae with expansion velocities between 20 and 30 km/s.</description>

      <title>Can meridional flow variations explain the observed rising/declining phase asymmetry in the solar cycle?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the 11-year solar cycle remains a major challenge in solar physics and is important for space weather forecasting. A persistent property of the cycle is its asymmetry: the rise phase is usually much shorter than the decay phase. This asymmetry is often linked to variations in the Sun's meridional circulation, but it is unclear whether these variations are mainly deterministic, produced by Lorentz-force feedback, or stochastic in nature. We investigate this question using kinematic flux-transport dynamo simulations that include three types of time-dependent meridional flow: deterministic variations, stochastic fluctuations, and hybrid combinations of both. We evaluate cycle asymmetry using the ratio of rise to decay times and correlations of cycle amplitude with rise time, rise rate, and decay rate. Our results show that the temporal evolution of the meridional flow strongly controls cycle asymmetry. When both the meridional circulation and the Babcock-Leighton mechanism vary stochastically, the model does not produce cycles in which the decay phase is consistently longer than the rise phase. In contrast, deterministic variations motivated by Lorentz-force feedback and linked to the latitude of maximum toroidal field reproduce the observed asymmetry. In these cases, the meridional flow weakens near cycle maximum, stays reduced for some time, and then recovers, producing a longer decay phase. Hybrid models that mix deterministic and stochastic variability also match the observed rise-decay asymmetry. Across all simulations, cycle amplitude correlates strongly with rise rate, while correlations with rise time and decay rate are weaker but remain significant. These results highlight the key role of meridional flow variability in shaping solar cycle asymmetry and show that incorporating such variability can improve forecasting tools such as Solar Predict.</description>

      <title>The SOFIA Massive(SOMA)Radio Survey. III. Radio Emission from Intermediate-Mass Protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from Very Large Array (VLA) radio continuum observations of twelve intermediate-mass (IM) protostars, as part of the \textit{SOFIA} Massive Star Formation Survey. Using these observations, we studied their morphology, multiplicity and radio spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Across our target regions, we resolve multiple compact sources and report eight new detections, four of which are entirely new and four that have counterparts at other wavelengths, but are detected here for the first time at radio frequencies. Based on radio morphologies and spectral indices, we assess the nature of the detected sources, highlighting seven that display jet-like structures and spectral indices consistent with ionized jets. Combining our results with the SOMA Radio I and II results, we expand the overall sample to 29 protostars, covering a bolometric luminosity range from $L_{\rm bol}\sim 10^2$ to $10^6\:L_\odot$. These sources help define a potential evolutionary sequence in the radio versus bolometric luminosity diagram. IM protostars have radio luminosities that are lower than expected from a simple power law extrapolation from low-mass protostars. However, this result is consistent with theoretical expectations from protostellar evolution models, which show low levels of photoionization and reduced shock ionization emission due to expanded stellar radii during this phase. Overall our expanded SOMA Radio sample provides new constraints on theoretical models of massive protostellar evolution, especially the connection to ionized gas structures.</description>

      <title>Improvements to the NSO Farside Mapping Pipeline: Noise Reduction Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The National Solar Observatory (NSO)'s Farside Pipeline is a critical tool of the space weather industry. It enables the detection and tracking of solar active regions that have rotated to the farside (invisible surface) of the Sun without relying on direct observational platforms such as satellites. By applying the technique of helioseismic holography to continuous Doppler images of the front side (visible surface), the pipeline infers the size and location of these regions through the acoustic signatures. These farside maps, produced using data from the NSO's GONG Network, allow scientists and solar observers to monitor the behavior of solar active regions. They support efforts to protect vital telecommunications and national interest infrastructure. While the data from this pipeline are widely used to many scientific, industrial, and national security applications, global helioseismic monitoring remains a developing field, with ongoing refinements in methodology and reliability. In this report, we will outline the updates made to the NSO's Farside Pipeline which have resulted in more accurate and consistent helioseismic maps, strengthening its value for both operational forecasting and scientific research.</description>

      <title>Inferring main-sequence stage and buoyancy-glitch amplitudes from Fourier spectra of gravity-mode period spacings: Ensemble Analysis of 26 Slowly Pulsating B Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravito-inertial-mode asteroseismology of intermediate-mass main-sequence stars took off with the 5-month uninterrupted light curves of the CoRoT space mission. It was developed in detail from the 4-year-long Kepler light curves, which provided a practical means to measure the rotation frequency in the transition layer between the convective core and the radiative envelope, where the local buoyancy frequency reaches a maximum. Recently, a new buoyancy glitch inversion method based on the Fourier spectra of gravity-mode period spacings was developed to probe that region further (Guo 2025). We aim to exploit the information contained in the variability of gravity-mode period spacings ($\Delta P$) in Slowly Pulsating B (SPB) stars with rotation. We investigate how well the main-sequence evolutionary stage can be inferred from this variability. We extract the frequency and amplitude of the variability in $\Delta P$ from the Fourier spectrum (FT). Both the period spacing $\Delta P$ and its periodic perturbations $\delta P$ (deviations from their asymptotic values) are used. The measured dominant frequency of $\Delta P$ allows us to infer the central hydrogen mass fraction, $X_c$, which is a main-sequence age indicator. The inferred $X_c$ values from $FT(\Delta P)$ mostly agree with previous results reported in the literature based on forward modelling of individual identified mode frequencies.
  We find that the buoyancy glitches $\delta N/N$ in SPB stars are generally less than $2\%$ in amplitude. Ensemble asteroseismic modeling of gravity-mode pulsators can now be carried out efficiently with our novel $FT(\Delta P)$ method once the internal rotation rate of the pulsators is known. Our methodology offers a fast method for gravito-inertial asteroseismic applications in the era of ongoing and future space-based observations.</description>

      <title>Follow-up Observations of Candidate White Dwarf Planets with MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on second-epoch imaging of two candidate planet-hosting white dwarfs stars, WD2105-82 and WD1202-232. Both stars showed evidence of resolved, planet-mass candidate companions in observations using the MIRI mid-infrared imager on JWST. WD2105-82 also showed evidence of an infrared excess consistent with an unresolved 1.4 Jupiter mass companion with an orbital separation of &lt;4 au. Our second epoch observations confirm that the source of the excess shares common proper motion with the star. The excess is almost certainly due to a companion planet or debris disk. However, neither of the two resolved sources with projected separations of &gt;1" in the first epoch of JWST observations show measurable proper motion and are thus likely faint, unresolved background galaxies. We also search for common proper motion companions out to hundreds of au, but find no evidence of widely separated companions.</description>

      <title>The Birth of Be Star Disks II. A High-Resolution Spectroscopic Campaign and TESS Observations of an Outburst of the Classical Be star {\lambda} Pavonis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Be stars are non-supergiant, rapidly rotating B stars that have shown emission lines originating in a circumstellar disk. The exact mechanisms that lead to disk formation and dissipation are not fully known although progress has been made with some systems. Here, we present a study of a disk outburst of the southern Be star {\lambda} Pavonis (HD 173948). Our dataset comprises 698 high-resolution spectra taken contemporaneously with TESS photometry in 2023. During the final days of TESS monitoring, the star began building a disk from a pristine diskless state. We find that the disk built within 5 days in optical H I and He I lines, while the disk is circularized in about 12 days. The disk began to decay in higher energy He I first, then lower energy transitions, with the decay ending last for H{\alpha}. We examine non-radial pulsations both through TESS photometry and the line profile variations in Balmer lines, He I lines, and the weak photospheric Si III 5739 line. Our analysis indicates that two periodicities seen in TESS photometry (at 1.644 and 1.485 cycles/d) are not seen in the spectral lines before, during, or after the outburst. The strongest spectral signal is a periodicity at 0.163 cycles/d, which appears as a difference between the weaker signals. We additionally find evidence for fast non-photometric pulsational variations over the course of spectroscopy obtained before, during, and after the outburst. These fast LPVs are strong, and interfere with the two weaker signals, causing their apparent incoherence.</description>

      <title>Magnetic activity of ultracool dwarfs in the LAMOST DR11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracool dwarfs consist of lowest-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Their interior is fully convective, different from that of the partly-convective Sun-like stars. Magnetic field generation process beneath the surface of ultracool dwarfs is still poorly understood and controversial. To increase samples of active ultracool dwarfs significantly, we have identified 962 ultracool dwarfs in the latest LAMOST data release, DR11. We also simulate the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) low-resolution slitless spectra by degrading the LAMOST spectra. A semi-supervised machine learning approach with an autoencoder model is built to identify ultracool dwarfs with the simulated CSST spectra, which demonstrates the capability of the CSST all-sky slitless spectroscopic survey on the detection of ultracool dwarfs. Magnetic activity of the ultracool dwarfs is investigated by using the H$\alpha$ line emission as a proxy. The rotational periods of 82 ultracool dwarfs are derived based on the Kepler/K2 light curves. We also derive the activity-rotation relation of the ultracool dwarfs, which is saturated around a Rossby number of 0.12.</description>

      <title>Extremely energetic EUV late phase of a pair of C-class flares caused by a non-eruptive sigmoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The EUV late phase is the second increase of the irradiance of the warm coronal lines during solar flares, and has a crucial impact on the Earth's ionosphere. In this paper, we report on the extremely energetic EUV late phase of a pair of C-class flares (SOL2012-06-17T17:26:11) observed on 2012 June 17 in NOAA active region 11504 by the \textit{Atmospheric Imaging Assembly} (AIA) instrument on board the \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO). The light curves integrated over the flaring region show that a factor of 4.2 more energy is released in the ``warm'' (2$-$3$\times 10^6$~K) temperature passbands (e.g. AIA 335 \AA) during the late phase than during the main peaks. The origin of the emission in this extremely energetic EUV late phase is a non-eruptive sigmoid situated in a multi-polar magnetic field configuration, which is rapidly energised by C-class flares. The sigmoid plasma appears to reach temperatures in excess of $10^7$~K, before cooling to produce the EUV late-phase emission. This is seen in high-temperature passbands (e.g. AIA 131 \AA) and by using differential emission measure analysis. Magnetic extrapolations indicate that the sigmoid is consistent with formation by magnetic reconnection between previously existing J-shaped loops. The sigmoid experienced a fast and a slow cooling stages, both of which were dominated by conductive cooling. The estimated total cooling time of the sigmoid is shorter than the observed value. So, we proposed that the non-eruptive sigmoid, heated by the continuous magnetic reconnection, leads to the extremely energetic EUV late phase.</description>

      <title>Small-scale bright point characteristics at high-resolution with the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bright points (BPs) are small-scale, dynamic features that are ubiquitous across the solar disc and are often associated with the underlying magnetic field. Using broadband photospheric images obtained with the Visible Broadband Imager at the National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), the properties of BPs have been analyzed with DKIST for the first time at the highest spatial resolutions achievable. BPs were observed to have an average lifetime of 95$\pm$29 s and a mean transverse velocity of 1.60$\pm$0.41 km/s. The BPs had a log-normal area distribution with a peak at 2300 km$^2$. Transverse velocity and lifetimes across the DKIST images were comparable and consistent with previous studies. The area distribution of the DKIST data peaked in areas significantly lower than those from the literature. This was explored further and was observed to be due to an overestimation of BP areas due to the merging of close features when the spatial resolution is reduced, in tandem with possible over-splitting of features in the DKIST images. Furthermore, the effect of variable seeing within the data was determined. This showed that the average spatial resolution of the data was around 0.''034$\pm$0.''007 in comparison to the theoretical diffraction-limit of 0.''022. Accounting for the influence of seeing, the peak of the area distribution of BPs in the DKIST data was estimated as 4800 km$^2$, which is still significantly lower than previously observed.</description>

      <title>Exploring the binary origin of B and Be rapid rotators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational evidence has continued to mount that a significant fraction of rapidly rotating early-B type stars are products of binary mass transfer. However, very few mid- and late-type B stars with rapid rotation have been demonstrated to be post-interaction products, despite a growing sample of SB1 binaries among stars within this range of spectral types. By considering the currently available information over the entire range of rapidly rotating B-type binaries, we argue that a significant fraction of the mid- and late-type rapid rotators found in binaries are also likely the result of past mass transfer episodes. The observed properties of this sample are compared to the predictions from the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis code (BPASS), with attention given to the expected evolutionary pathways of stripped stars and the stellar and binary properties of both components of post-interaction systems across a range of initial conditions. Prospects for directly detecting and characterizing the stripped cores of the previous mass donors in such systems are described, and the implications for the role of binary interaction in causing rapid rotation are discussed. An accurate description of prevalence of binary interaction, the physics of mass transfer, and the post-interaction configuration of systems over a range of initial conditions has far-reaching implications including double-degenerate binaries and their eventual mergers, the output of ionizing UV flux of stellar populations, and the supernova explosions that can arise from stripped or rapidly-rotating progenitors.</description>

      <title>Near-IR CO and CN in classical Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present medium resolution near-infrared spectral measurements of the carbon monoxide (CO) and the cyano radical (CN) features in 12 Galactic classical Cepheids. The pulsation periods of our sample range from 5.5 to 69 days, and the stars studied each had five or more near-IR spectral observations. The CO and CN measurements were used to probe CNO abundances of these stars, and elemental abundance values from the literature were used to identify the trends of [C/N] and [O/N] with CN and CO. To put these measurements in context, we performed stellar atmosphere fitting to obtain estimates of stellar parameters, with a primary focus on effective temperature. Our measurements and temperature estimates show that CN is significantly affected by dredge-up of processed material. We provide discussion as to the potential nature of the recently confirmed classical Cepheid, ET~Vul, and connect our near-infrared CO measurements to the mid-infrared period-colour-metallicity relation.</description>

      <title>Detection of 27 Candidate Circumbinary Planets Through Apsidal Precession of Eclipsing Binaries Observed by TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most circumbinary planets have been discovered by their transits, limiting our understanding of such systems to those with mutually coplanar architectures. This bias makes it difficult to infer the true circumbinary planet population, highlighting the need for alternative detection methods that do not rely on transits. In this work, we explore one such approach by leveraging apsidal precession as a dynamical signature of planetary companions. We analyse TESS photometry of a sample of 1,590 eclipsing binaries from the Gaia DR3 Catalogue of Eclipsing Binary Candidates to identify systems exhibiting detectable apsidal precession. We rule general relativistic, tidal, and rotational contributions as insufficient to account for the measured apsidal precession, demonstrating that an additional gravitational perturber is required. This enables us to constrain the possible masses and orbital separations of a companion that would cause the observed precession. We present a new set of 27 candidate circumbinary planets identified through this precession-based method as well as 6 candidate companions with a higher minimum mass. Their inferred properties remain degenerate, as the same dynamical signatures can arise from lower-mass planets at less than 1 AU or from more massive companions on wider, few-AU orbits, reflecting the current uncertainty in characterising these systems. Radial velocities can help break this degeneracy and provide direct confirmation.</description>

      <title>Stellar Multiplicity via Speckle Interferometry with the 3.6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional ground-based optical telescopes, even those with large apertures, primarily observe stars, close binaries, and multiple systems as unresolved point sources through photometric measurements. Spectroscopy can identify multiple stellar components within a system, but both techniques are fundamentally limited in resolving stellar surfaces and providing direct angular separations. Although photometric and spectroscopic observations yield critical information on magnitudes/flux, metallicities, and orbital properties, complementary high-angular-resolution methods are required to constrain additional system characteristics, including angular orbital parameters, model-independent distances, radii, and stellar masses. The limitations of these two methods arise due to the Diffraction Limit of the telescopes and atmospheric turbulence. Speckle Interferometry (SI) is a clever and affordable method for ground-based telescopes to work around atmospheric turbulence. In this work, we utilize the speckle images obtained by the 3.6 m DOT and demonstrate the capability of SI to resolve binary systems, measure their orbital separations, and determine their position angles. For systems with faint companions where conventional analysis fails, we employ Bayesian inference to model speckle patterns and estimate orbital parameters with high precision. These results establish the effective methodology for using a medium-sized, 4-m class telescope like the DOT as a high-resolution stellar interferometer and demonstrate the potential of speckle interferometry as a powerful technique to advance optical interferometric studies within Indian astronomy.</description>

      <title>Was the Solar System's dynamical instability triggered by a (sub)stellar flyby?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An instability among the giant planets' orbits can match many aspects of the Solar System's current orbital architecture. We explore the possibility that this dynamical instability was triggered by the close passage of a star or substellar object during the Sun's embedded cluster phase. We run N-body simulations starting with the giant planets in a resonant chain and an outer planetesimal disk, with a wide-enough planet-disk separation to preserve the planets' orbital stability for $&gt;$100 Myr. We subject the system to a single flyby, testing a wide range in flyby mass, velocity and closest approach distance. We find a variety of outcomes, from flybys that over-excite the system (or strip the planets entirely) to flybys too weak to perturb the planets at all. An intermediate range of flybys triggers a dynamical instability that matches the present-day Solar System. Successful simulations -- that match the giant planets' orbits without over-exciting the cold classical Kuiper belt -- are characterized by the flyby of a substellar object ($3-30 M_{Jup}$) passing within 20 au of the Sun. We performed Monte Carlo simulations of the Sun's birth cluster phase, parameterized by the product of the stellar density $\eta$ and the cluster lifetime $T$. The balance between under- and over-excitation of the young Solar System is at $\eta T \approx 5 \times 10^4$~Myr pc$^{-3}$, in a range consistent with previous work. We find a probability of $\sim$1% that the Solar System's dynamical instability was triggered by a substellar flyby. The probability increases to $\sim$5% if the occurrence rate of free-floating planets and low-mass brown dwarfs is modestly higher than predicted by standard stellar initial mass functions.</description>

      <title>The Two-Infall Model Revisited: Constraints on Milky Way Bulge Assembly from &gt;30,000 Galactic Chemical Evolution Models and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain the formation history of the Milky Way bulge using a two-infall Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) framework implemented in the OMEGA++ code. We recover a best-fit scenario in which the bulge forms through an early, rapid starburst (t1 ~ 0.1Gyr, tau1 ~ 0.09Gyr, star-formation efficiency (SFE) ~ 3Gyr^-1 followed by a delayed, lower mass second infall (t2 ~ 5.1Gyr, tau2 ~ 1.7Gyr, sigma2 ~ 0.69). Our model adopts mass- and metallicity-dependent nucleosynthetic yields from modern stellar grids and explores a wide GCE parameter space in infall timing, star formation efficiency, mass partitioning, IMF upper mass, and SN Ia normalization, optimized via a hybrid genetic algorithm with MCMC refinement. The later infall features a reduced star formation efficiency (Delta SFE ~ 0.72), reproducing the metal-rich peak of the bulge metallicity distribution function (MDF) and the decline in [alpha/Fe] at high [Fe/H]. Our model naturally favors the Joyce et al. (2023) age -- metallicity relation over the ages in Bensby et al. (2017). Degeneracy and principal component analysis show that the infall history, SFE, and mass partitioning are strongly covariant -- the bulge's observed MDF, abundance trends, and age distribution constrain only their combinations, not each parameter independently. The results support a composite bulge origin -- a classical collapse builds the majority of the mass, while a younger component is required to match the late stage enrichment.</description>

      <title>Supernovae Shock Breakout from Red Supergiants in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of supernova shock breakout from red supergiants using the $\texttt{CASTRO}$ code. Our progenitors are 20 and 25 M$_{\odot}$ solar-metallicity stars evolved from the zero-age main sequence with $\texttt{MESA}$ and exploded in one dimension using $\texttt{FLASH}$. We consider a range of circumstellar media (CSM) produced by stellar winds to investigate how pre-explosion mass-loss affects shock breakout. The multigroup flux-limited diffusion scheme in $\texttt{CASTRO}$ captures the interaction between the explosion shock, its radiation precursor, and the surrounding CSM. We find that strong radiation precursors, generated by radiation leakage behind the shock, can drive fluid instabilities and move the effective photosphere outward before the shock reaches the stellar surface. The resulting breakout emissions reach peak luminosities of ${\sim}10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ with full-width half-maximum durations of 1-3 hr, which are much dimmer and longer than those from blue supergiants. The light-curve colors gradually evolve from blue to red after the peak. The 25 M$_{\odot}$ model with explosion energy $E \sim 1.69\times10^{51}$ erg produces ${\sim}$10-30\% higher maximum luminosity than the 20 M$_{\odot}$ model with $E \sim 1.09\times10^{51}$ erg. The dense CSM further extends the breakout rise time by increasing the photon diffusion. These results provide new constraints on red supergiant atmospheres and mass-loss histories prior to core collapse.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Irradiation on the Radius and Thermal Evolution of Transiting Brown Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masses and radii of transiting brown dwarfs can be measured directly in contrast to isolated field brown dwarfs, whose mass and radius inferences are model dependent. Therefore, transiting brown dwarfs are a testbed for the interior and evolutionary models of brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets. We have developed atmospheric and evolutionary models for this emerging population. We show that intense stellar irradiation can cause a large enhancement in the radius of transiting brown dwarfs at all masses, especially if the incident flux exceeds $log_{10}(F/cgs)\ge$9 ($T_{\rm eq}\ge 1450$ K). Stellar irradiation can significantly alter rates of nuclear burning in irradiated brown dwarfs, making the Deuterium-burning and Hydrogen-burning minimum masses strong functions of incident stellar flux. We show that the D-burning and H-burning minimum masses can decrease by 16% and 13%, respectively, between isolated and strongly irradiated brown dwarfs ( $log_{10}(F/cgs)\ge$10 ($T_{\rm eq}\ge 2570$ K)). This shows that stellar irradiation has a larger impact on the planet-brown dwarf-star mass boundaries than metallicity or clouds. We show that metal cores or migration affect their evolution to a much lesser extent, whereas low mass highly irradiated old sources can help us test the physics of hot Jupiter radius anomaly. We fit the observed radii of 46 transiting brown dwarfs and show that our irradiated evolutionary models fit their radii better than models that ignore the host star, especially for highly irradiated objects. However, the measured radii of 10 objects are still inconsistent at $&gt;3\sigma$ level, indicating residual gaps in our irradiated evolutionary model.</description>

      <title>Chemical analysis of the Milky Way's Nuclear Star Cluster: Evidence for a metallicity gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Milky Way nuclear star cluster (MWNSC) is located together with its surrounding nuclear stellar disc (MWNSD) in the Galactic centre and they dominate the gravitational potential within the inner 300\,pc. However, the formation and evolution of both systems and their possible connections are still under debate. We reanalyse the low-resolution KMOS spectra in the MWNSC with the aim to improve the stellar parameters ($\rm T_{eff}$, $\rm \log\,g$, and $\rm [M/H])$ for the MWNSC. We use an improved line-list, especially dedicated for cool M giants allowing to improve the stellar parameters and to obtain in addition global $\rm \alpha$-elements. A comparison with high-resolution IR spectra (IGRINS) gives very satisfactory results pinning down the uncertainties to $\rm T_{eff} \simeq 150\,K$, $\rm log\,g \simeq 0.4\,dex$, and $\rm [M/H] \simeq 0.2\,dex$. Our $\rm \alpha$-elements agree within 0.1\,dex compared to the IGRINS spectra. We obtain a high-quality sample of 1140 M giant stars where we see an important contribution of a metal-poor population ($\rm \sim 20\,\%$) centered at $\rm [M/H] \simeq -0.7\,dex$ while the most dominant part comes from the metal-rich population with $\rm [M/H] \simeq 0.26\,dex$. We construct a metallicity map and find a metallicity gradient of $\rm \sim -0.1 \pm 0.02 \,dex/pc$ favouring the inside-out formation scenario for the MWNSC.</description>

Abstract: Astrochemistry is a well-established multidisciplinary field devoted to study molecules in space. While most astrochemists are oriented to observe molecules in the gas phase and reproduce their abundances by modeling the physical conditions of the medium, the microscopic dust particles wandering in the interstellar medium deserve the attention of a smaller community. Radiation and thermally-driven processes taking place in the bare dust, and particularly in dust particles covered by ice mantles, are mimicked in the laboratory. In addition to water, interstellar ice contains other simple species. In this Review we present our current knowledge on ice photochemistry and thermal processing that ultimately leads to formation of complex organic molecules (COMs). Numerous COMs are of astrobiological interest and match those present in comets and asteroids. Upon impact of these minor bodies, water and COMs were delivered to the earth and might have intervened in the first prebiotic reactions.</description>

      <title>Collisional rate coefficients for OH-H$_2$ at high temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: OH is a cornerstone molecule in the chemistry of interstellar and circumstellar media and is ubiquitously detected in warm gas thanks to its infrared rotational lines. However, the excitation processes of OH remain poorly characterized. We provide a new set of collisional rate coefficients for OH with H$_2$, expanding the existing data to $j$ levels up to $j=15/2$ and temperatures up to 750 K. These rate coefficients are obtained from state-to-state collision cross sections calculated by means of well-converged close-coupling quantum scattering calculations for collisions of OH with para- and ortho-H$_2$ with energies up to 1700 cm$^{-1}$ ($\simeq 2450$ K). We reproduce the rate coefficients computed by Klos et al. (2017) and extend their results to higher temperatures and higher rotational levels of OH. The de-excitation rate coefficients are lower in collisions with para-H$_2$ ($j_{\rm H_2} = 0$) due to the absence of a quadrupole moment, but this difference decreases at higher temperatures. We find that the rate coefficients follow scaling relations with the energy gap between the upper and lower levels of a given transition, which allows extrapolation to higher OH rotational states $j_{\rm OH}$. As a first application, we show that under astrophysical conditions typical of warm and dense gas around nascent stars, the populations of low-$j_{\rm OH}$ states are dominated by collisions, even when chemical pumping is included. The full set of rate coefficients is made available in the LAMDA database.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Reconnaissance of Exoplanetary Systems (ARES). I. Methodology validation with HST point-source images of Proxima Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first results of the Astrometric Reconnaissance of Exoplanetary Systems (ARES) project, aimed at validating and characterizing candidate exoplanets around the nearest systems using multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. In this first paper, we focus on Proxima Centauri, leveraging archival and recent HST observations in point-source imaging mode. We refine the geometric-distortion calibration of the HST detector used, and develop a robust methodology to derive high-precision astrometric parameters by combining HST measurements with the Gaia DR3 catalog. We determine Proxima's position, proper motion, and parallax with uncertainties at the $\sim$0.4-mas, 50-$\mu$as yr$^{-1}$, and 0.2-mas level, respectively, achieving consistent results with what measured by Gaia within $\sim$1$\sigma$. We further investigate the presence of the candidate exoplanet Proxima c by analyzing the proper-motion anomaly derived from combining long-term HST-based and short-term Gaia astrometry. Under the assumption of a circular, face-on orbit, we obtain an estimated mass of $m_c = 3.4^{+5.2}_{-3.4}$ $M_\odot$, broadly consistent with radial-velocity constraints but limited by our current uncertainties. These results establish the foundation for the next phase of ARES, which will exploit HST spatial-scanning observations to achieve astrometric precisions of a few tens of $\mu$as and enable a direct search for astrometric signatures of low-mass companions.</description>

      <title>Centrifugal instability of Taylor-Couette flow in stratified and diffusive fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linear and non-linear dynamics of centrifugal instability in Taylor-Couette flow are investigated when fluids are stably stratified and highly diffusive. One-dimensional local linear stability analysis (LSA) on cylindrical Couette flow confirms that the stabilising role of stratification on centrifugal instability is suppressed by strong thermal diffusion (i.e. low Prandtl number $Pr$). For $Pr\ll1$, it is verified that the instability dependence on thermal diffusion and stratification with the non-dimensional Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency $N$ can be prescribed by a single rescaled parameter $P_{N}=N^{2}Pr$. From direct numerical simulation (DNS), various non-linear features such as axisymmetric Taylor vortices at saturation, secondary instability leading to non-axisymmetric patterns or transition to chaotic states are investigated for various values of $Pr\leq1$ and the Reynolds number $Re_{i}$. Two-dimensional bi-global LSA on axisymmetric Taylor vortices, which appear as primary centrifugal instability saturates nonlinearly, is also performed to find the secondary critical Reynolds number $Re_{i,2}$ at which the Taylor vortices become unstable by non-axisymmetric perturbation. The bi-global LSA reveals that $Re_{i,2}$ increases (i.e. the onset of secondary instability is delayed) in the range $10^{-3}&lt;Pr&lt;1$ at $N=1$ or as $N$ increases at $Pr=0.01$. Secondary instability leading to highly non-axisymmetric or irregular chaotic patterns is further investigated by the 3D DNS. The Nusselt number $Nu$ is also computed from the torque at the inner cylinder for various $Pr$ and $Re_{i}$ at $N=1$ to describe how the angular momentum transfer increases with $Re_{i}$ and how $Nu$ varies differently for saturated and chaotic states.</description>

      <title>Low-Mass Neutron Stars and Effective Phase Transitions from a Hybrid Van der Waals-Polytropic Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study phase-transition-like behavior in neutron stars using a simplified, piecewise equation of state that couples a modified van der Waals-type core to a polytropic crust. The model remains analytically tractable while allowing for nonlinear density dependence. We impose thermodynamic and causal consistency conditions and determine the critical densities at which the curvature of the pressure-energy density relation changes. In the non-relativistic limit, the generalized Lane-Emden equations describe a smooth core-crust transition layer. We integrate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations across different $(\tau_1,\sigma_1)$ regimes, where these parameters encode thermal and interaction effects in the core. The resulting mass-radius sequences yield low neutron star masses $(0.99-2.05)M_{\odot}$, and the chemical potential exhibits the characteristic signatures of phase-transition behavior at densities well above the matching point. Our results show that analytic EOS models can reproduce the key phenomenology of phase transitions and provide a controlled framework for exploring low-mass neutron star configurations.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Quick Data Release (Q1) -- A photometric search for ultracool dwarfs in the Euclid Deep Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a catalogue of 5306 new ultracool dwarf (UCD) candidates in the three Euclid Deep Fields in the Q1 data release. They range from late M to late T dwarfs, and include 1200 L and T dwarfs. A total of 546 objects have been spectroscopically confirmed, including 329 L dwarfs and 26 T dwarfs. We also provide empirical Euclid colours as a function of spectral type. Our UCD selection criteria are based only on colour ($I_\mathrm{E}-Y_\mathrm{E}&gt;2.5$). The combined requirement for optical detection and stringent signal-to-noise ratio threshold ensure a high purity of the sample, but at the expense of completeness, especially for T dwarfs. The detections range from magnitudes 19 and 24 in the near-infrared bands, and extend down to 26 in the optical band. We discuss Euclid's capability to identify UCD candidates based on its photometric passbands. The average surface density of detected UCDs on the sky is approximately 100 objects per $\mathrm{deg}^2$, including 20 L and T dwarfs per $\mathrm{deg}^2$. This leads to an expectation of at least 1.4 million ultracool dwarfs in the final data release of the Euclid Wide Survey, including at least $300\,000$ L dwarfs, and more than 2600 T dwarfs, using the strict selection criteria from this work.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from stars in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinos are produced during stellar evolution by means of thermal and thermonuclear processes. We model the cumulative neutrino flux expected at Earth from all stars in the Milky Way: the Galactic stellar neutrino flux (GS$\nu$F). We account for the star formation history of our Galaxy and reconstruct the spatial distribution of Galactic stars by means of a random sampling procedure based on Gaia Data Release 2. We use the stellar evolution code $\texttt{MESA}$ to compute the neutrino emission for a suite of stellar models with solar metallicity and zero-age-main-sequence mass between $0.08M_\odot$ and $100\ M_\odot$, from their pre-main sequence phase to their final fates. We then reconstruct the evolution of the neutrino spectral energy distribution for each stellar model in our suite. The GS$\nu$F lies between $\mathcal{O}(1)$ keV and $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV, with thermal (thermonuclear) processes responsible for shaping neutrino emission at energies smaller (larger) than $0.1$ MeV. Stars with mass larger than $\mathcal{O}(1\ M_\odot)$, located in the thin disk of the Galaxy, provide the largest contribution to the GS$\nu$F. Moreover, most of the GS$\nu$F originates from stars distant from Earth about $5-10$ kpc, implying that a large fraction of stellar neutrinos can reach us from the Galactic Center. Solar neutrinos and the diffuse supernova neutrino background have energies comparable to those of the GS$\nu$F, challenging the detection of the latter. However, directional information of solar neutrino and GS$\nu$F events, together with the annual modulation of the solar neutrino flux, could facilitate the GS$\nu$F detection; this will kick off a new era for low-energy neutrino astronomy, also providing a novel probe to discover New Physics.</description>

      <title>Testing stellar yield prescriptions in OMEGA+: Implications for rising sodium abundances in young thick disc stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We recently identified an upturn in [Na/Fe] for the population of Solar-type stars in the Galactic young thick disc ($-0.3 &lt; \mathrm{[Fe/H]} &lt; +0.3$) at super-Solar metallicity in data from the GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey. In this work, we investigate the origin of this unexplained sodium enrichment ([Na/Fe] $\approx 0$--$0.6$~dex) using the OMEGA$+$ galactic chemical evolution code. We explore the rise of [Na/Fe] using four combinations of nucleosynthetic yields from the literature, considering contributions from core-collapse supernovae, asymptotic giant branch stars, and Type~Ia supernovae. Our analysis focuses on two possible drivers of the Na enhancement: a metallicity-dependent increase in Na production from core-collapse supernovae at super-Solar metallicities, and enrichment from metal-rich AGB stars. We adopt two sets of Type~Ia supernova yields, one assuming exclusively Chandrasekhar-mass explosions and the other assuming only sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions. We find that the assumed Type~Ia explosion scenario has little influence on the resulting [Na/Fe] evolution, and that all chemical evolution models tested fail to reproduce the observed Na enrichment in the young thick-disc population at super-Solar metallicity. Our results suggest a possible ``under-pollution effect'' by Type~Ia supernovae -- the dominant producers of iron -- in the Solar-type stellar population of the Galactic disc. These findings provide a step toward understanding the origin of the anomalous sodium enrichment at super-Solar metallicities in the Galactic disc.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx: Aromatics, Aliphatics and PAH Size across the Iris Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations by the SpectroPhotometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) are combined with Spitzer spectral map data to study the aromatic, aliphatic, and PAH size evolution across the northwest photo-dissociation region (PDR) of the Iris Nebula (NGC7023). The 3.3-3.4 $\mu$m complex (I$_{3.3}$) and 11.2 $\mu$m (I$_{11.2}$) PAH band strength are determined through direct integration. In addition, the former is decomposed into a 3.3 (I'$_{3.3}$) and 3.4 $\mu$m (I'$_{3.4}$) sub-feature by fitting SPHEREx bandpass-integrated photometry using a modeled, highly sampled, multi-component spectrum. I$_{3.3}$, I$_{11.2}$, I'$_{3.3}$, and I'$_{3.4}$ all peak at the PDR. The NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database is used to obtain the average number of carbon atoms ($\overline{\rm N_{C}}$) and small PAH fraction ($f_{\rm small}$) by fitting the isolated PAH component of the Spitzer segment; $70\lesssim\overline{N_{C}}\lesssim76$ and $0.24\lesssim\text{f}_{\rm small}\lesssim0.36$. I'$_{3.4}$/I'$_{3.4}$, I$_{11.2}$/I$_{3.3}$, $\overline{\rm N_{C}}$, and $f_{\rm small}$ all show a demarcation that matches the large-scale morphology of the region. For I'$_{3.3}$ and I'$_{3.4}$ this is reflected by two distinct trends when plotted against each other, one associated with the dense, the other with the diffuse medium; $[N_{\rm H,ali}/N_{\rm H,aro}]_{\rm dense}$ = 0.42$\pm$0.01 and $[N_{\rm H,ali}/N_{\rm H,aro}]_{\rm diffuse}$ = 0.10$\pm$0.01. $\overline{\rm N_{C}}$ and $f_{\rm small}$ are tentatively correlated with I$_{11.2}$/I$_{3.3}$ (R=0.54$\pm$0.05 and -0.45$\pm$0.05, respectively). A wider variety of large(r) extended interstellar medium objects is required to tighten the correlations, turn them into quantitative calibrators for PAH size, and pin down the discrepancy of correlations with I'$_{3.3}$ involved.</description>

      <title>The Transition from Giant Planets to Brown Dwarfs beyond 1 au from the Stellar Metallicity Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Giant planets and brown dwarfs are thought to form via a combination of pathways, including bottom-up mechanisms in which gas is accreted onto a solid core and top-down mechanisms in which gas collapses directly into a gravitationally-bound object. One can distinguish the prevalence of these mechanisms using host star metallicities. Bottom-up formation thrives in metal-rich environments, whereas top-down formation is weakly dependent on ambient metal content. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model and the results of the California Legacy Survey (CLS), a low-bias and homogeneously analyzed radial velocity survey, we find evidence for a transition in the stellar metallicity distribution at a companion mass of $\gamma = 27_{-8}^{+12} \, M_{\rm Jup}$ for companions with orbital separations between $1-50$ au. Companions below and above this threshold tend to orbit stars with higher ($\rm{[Fe/H]} = 0.17 \pm 0.12$ dex) and lower ($\rm{[Fe/H]} = -0.03 \pm 0.10$ dex) metallicities, respectively. Previous studies of relatively close-in companions reported evidence of a lower transition mass of $\leq 10 \, {\rm M_{\rm Jup}}$. When applied to the CLS sample, our model predicts the probability of a transition in the stellar metallicity distribution at or below $10 \, { M_{\rm Jup}}$ to be $&lt; 1 \%$. We compare our results to estimates of $\gamma$ gleaned from other observational metrics and discuss implications for planet formation theory.</description>
