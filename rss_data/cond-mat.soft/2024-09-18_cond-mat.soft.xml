      <title>Selection Principle for the Screening Parameters in the Mechanical Response of Amorphous Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical response of amorphous solids to external strains is riddled with plastic events that create topological charges in the resulting displacement field. It was recently shown that the latter leads to screening phenomena that are accompanied by the breaking of both translational and Chiral symmetries. The screening effects are quantified by two screening parameters $\kappa_e$ and $\kappa_o$, which are inverse characteristic lengths that do not exist in classical elasticity. The screening parameters (and the associated lengths) are emergent, and it is important to understand how they are selected. This Letter explores the mechanism of selection of these characteristic lengths in two examples of strain protocols that allow analytic scrutiny.</description>

      <title>Lifting a granular box by a half-buried rod</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied an interesting experiment that showed a half-buried chopstick lifting a full bottle of granules off the table. In Janssen theory, the friction force provided by the container wall helps alleviate the weight of the granules. How can a thin rod with a much less contact area support the full weight plus that of the container? Insights are gained by allowing the friction on the wall to change direction before solving the Janssen equation. We obtained the analytic expression for the critical depth of granules that enables a successful lift off. In addition, we established that the stick and slip phenomenon exists during a failed lift off by analyzing the frequency of fluctuations in the pull force. Finally, a photoelasticity experiment was employed to directly visualize the stress field sensitive to the pull force, and verify the directional change of friction force from the wall.</description>

      <title>Not-so-glass-like Caging and Fluctuations of an Active Matter Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simple active models of matter recapitulate complex biological phenomena. Their out-of-equilibrium nature, however, often makes these models beyond the reach of first-principle descriptions. This limitation is particularly perplexing when attempting to distinguish between different glass-forming mechanisms. We here consider a minimal active system in various spatial dimensions to identify the underlying processes at play. Activity is found to markedly impact cage escape processes and critical fluctuations, thus offering a distinct perspective on the role of activity sluggish dynamics.</description>

      <title>The elastica sling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear mechanics of a flexible elastic rod constrained at its edges by a pair of sliding sleeves is analyzed. The planar equilibrium configurations of this variable-length elastica are found to have shape defined only by the inclination of the two constraints, while their distance is responsible only for scaling the size. By extending the theoretical stability criterion available for systems under isoperimetric constraints to the case of variable domains, the existence of no more than one stable equilibrium solution is revealed. The set of sliding sleeves' inclination pairs for which the stability is lost are identified. Such critical conditions allow the indefinite ejection of the flexible rod from the sliding sleeves, thus realizing an elastica sling. Finally, the theoretical findings are validated by experiments on a physical prototype. The present results lead to a novel actuation principle that may find application as a mechanism in energy harvesting, wave mitigation devices, and soft robotic locomotion.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Analyzing Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Images Generated from Polymer Blends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new machine learning workflow with unsupervised learning techniques to identify domains within atomic force microscopy images obtained from polymer films. The goal of the workflow is to identify the spatial location of the two types of polymer domains with little to no manual intervention and calculate the domain size distributions which in turn can help qualify the phase separated state of the material as macrophase or microphase ordered or disordered domains. We briefly review existing approaches used in other fields, computer vision and signal processing that can be applicable for the above tasks that happen frequently in the field of polymer science and engineering. We then test these approaches from computer vision and signal processing on the AFM image dataset to identify the strengths and limitations of each of these approaches for our first task. For our first domain segmentation task, we found that the workflow using discrete Fourier transform or discrete cosine transform with variance statistics as the feature works the best. The popular ResNet50 deep learning approach from computer vision field exhibited relatively poorer performance in the domain segmentation task for our AFM images as compared to the DFT and DCT based workflows. For the second task, for each of 144 input AFM images, we then used an existing porespy python package to calculate the domain size distribution from the output of that image from DFT based workflow. The information and open source codes we share in this paper can serve as a guide for researchers in the polymer and soft materials fields who need ML modeling and workflows for automated analyses of AFM images from polymer samples that may have crystalline or amorphous domains, sharp or rough interfaces between domains, or micro or macrophase separated domains.</description>

      <title>Optical Label-Free Microscopy Characterization of Dielectric Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to relate nanoparticle properties to function, fast and detailed particle characterization, is needed. The ability to characterize nanoparticle samples using optical microscopy techniques has drastically improved over the past few decades; consequently, there are now numerous microscopy methods available for detailed characterization of particles with nanometric size. However, there is currently no ``one size fits all'' solution to the problem of nanoparticle characterization. Instead, since the available techniques have different detection limits and deliver related but different quantitative information, the measurement and analysis approaches need to be selected and adapted for the sample at hand. In this tutorial, we review the optical theory of single particle scattering and how it relates to the differences and similarities in the quantitative particle information obtained from commonly used microscopy techniques, with an emphasis on nanometric (submicron) sized dielectric particles. Particular emphasis is placed on how the optical signal relates to mass, size, structure, and material properties of the detected particles and to its combination with diffusivity-based particle sizing. We also discuss emerging opportunities in the wake of new technology development, with the ambition to guide the choice of measurement strategy based on various challenges related to different types of nanoparticle samples and associated analytical demands.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-State Predictive Information Bottleneck (GNN-SPIB) approach for learning molecular thermodynamics and kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations offer detailed insights into atomic motions but face timescale limitations. Enhanced sampling methods have addressed these challenges but even with machine learning, they often rely on pre-selected expert-based features. In this work, we present the Graph Neural Network-State Predictive Information Bottleneck (GNN-SPIB) framework, which combines graph neural networks and the State Predictive Information Bottleneck to automatically learn low-dimensional representations directly from atomic coordinates. Tested on three benchmark systems, our approach predicts essential structural, thermodynamic and kinetic information for slow processes, demonstrating robustness across diverse systems. The method shows promise for complex systems, enabling effective enhanced sampling without requiring pre-defined reaction coordinates or input features.</description>

      <title>Shock propagation in a driven hard sphere gas: molecular dynamics simulations and hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous injection of energy at a localized region in space in a stationary gas creates a shock wave that propagates radially outwards. We study the hydrodynamics of this disturbance using event driven molecular dynamics of a hard sphere gas in three dimensions, the numerical solution of the Euler equation with a virial equation of state for the gas, and the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equation. We show that the results from the Euler equation do not agree with the data from hard sphere simulations. Including dissipative terms through the Navier-Stokes equation results in reasonably good description of the data, when the coefficients of dissipation are chose parametrically.</description>

      <title>Mirages in the Energy Landscape of Soft Sphere Packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy landscape is central to understanding low-temperature and athermal systems, like jammed soft spheres. The geometry of this high-dimensional energy surface is controlled by a plethora of minima and their associated basins of attraction that escape analytical treatment and are thus studied numerically. We show that the ODE solver with the best time-for-error for this problem, CVODE, is orders of magnitude faster than other steepest-descent solvers for such systems. Using this algorithm, we provide unequivocal evidence that optimizers widely used in computational studies destroy all semblance of the true landscape geometry, even in moderate dimensions. Using various geometric indicators, both low- and high-dimensional, we show that results on the fractality of basins of attraction originated from the use of inadequate mapping strategies, as basins are actually smooth structures with well-defined length scales. Thus, a vast number of past claims on energy landscapes need to be re-evaluated due to the use of inadequate numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Enhancing (quasi-)long-range order in a two-dimensional driven crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently shown that 2D systems can exhibit crystalline phases with long-range translational order showcasing a striking violation of the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner (HMW) theorem which is valid at equilibrium. This is made possible by athermal driving mechanisms that inject energy into the system without exciting long wavelength modes of the density field, thereby inducing hyperuniformity. However, as thermal fluctuations are superimposed on the non-equilibrium driving, long-range translational order is inevitably lost. Here, we discuss the possibility of exploiting non-equilibrium effects to suppress arbitrarily large density fluctuations even when a global thermal bath is coupled to the system. We introduce a model of a harmonic crystal driven both by a global thermal bath and by a momentum conserving noise, where the typical observables related to density fluctuations and long-range translational order can be analytically derived and put in relation. This model allows us to rationalize the violation of the HMW theorem observed in previous studies through the prediction of large-wavelength phonons which thermalize at a vanishing effective temperature when the global bath is switched off. The conceptual framework introduced through this theory is then applied to numerical simulations of a hard-disk solid in contact with a thermal bath and driven out-of-equilibrium by active collisions. Our numerical analysis demonstrates how varying driving and dissipative parameters can lead to an arbitrary enhancement of the quasi-long-range order in the system regardless of the applied global noise amplitude. Finally, we outline a possible experimental procedure to apply our results to a realistic granular system.</description>

      <title>Quasiphase transition of a single-file water chain influenced by atomic charges in a water model using orientational-biased replica exchange Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently observed temperature-dependent quasiphase transition of the single-file water chain confined within a carbon nanotube in experiments has been validated by the simple lattice theory and molecular dynamics simulations. It has been pointed out that the atomic charges in water models are important, yet how the values will affect the structural details and thermodynamic properties of the quasiphase transition has not been fully revealed. In this work, we perform orientational-biased replica exchange Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble to explore the effect of atomic charges in the SPC/E water model on the quasiphase transition of a single-file water chain. Based on the atomic charge values reported in literature, three distinct quasiphases are reproduced, comprising a fully hydrogen-bonded water chain at lower temperatures, a more ordered dipolar orientation along the tube axis at intermediate temperatures, and a completely disordered structure at higher temperatures. Then by increasing the atomic charge values, we find that the fragmentation of the entire water chain into shorter water segments, the orientational ordering of water dipoles along the tube axis, and the transition towards complete disorder are all inhibited. Consequently, the transition temperatures between three quasiphases have been shifted to higher temperatures. The thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that the increased atomic charge values enhance the hydrogen bonding between neighbouring water molecules also the electrostatic attraction within the water chain, leading to a longer water dipole correlation length even at higher temperatures. These findings highlight the vital role of atomic charges in water models also the electrostatic interaction in regulating the orientational ordering of water molecules under nanoconfinement.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic thinning of a coating film induced by a small solid defect: evidence of a time-minimum thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During coating processes, dust deposition can lead to an uneven thickness in the resulting film, posing significant problems in industrial processes. Our study explores the effects of solid defects using a vertical cylindrical fiber deposited on a silicone oil film coating a horizontal solid substrate. We use a hyperspectral camera to measure the film thickness by interferometry in the vicinity of the defect. As predicted and observed in many studies in various geometries, a circular groove appears around the fiber because of the capillary suction induced by the meniscus that grows at the bottom of the fiber. We measure the evolution of the thickness of the film at the groove over time. The thickness decreases before increasing again leading to the healing of the perturbation at long time. We propose that healing is due to the arrest of the suction when the meniscus reaches its equilibrium shape. By combining geometric analysis with the thin film equation, we have developed scaling laws that predict both the minimum thickness of the groove, that we call the time-minimum thickness, and the time required to reach this minimum. If the time-minimum thickness reaches the thickness at which intermolecular forces begin to play a role prior to healing, the thickness of the groove will stop decreasing and saturate due to the competition between drainage and repulsive intermolecular forces. Based on the previous scaling law, we developed a scaling law accounting for the critical initial thickness of the film below which the intermolecular repulsion will start to have an effect, which is in good agreement with our experiments. These results thus offer valuable insights into predicting and preventing defects in coating processes, thereby improving the quality and reliability of coated products in various industries.</description>

      <title>The Properties of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polypropylene Filaments Recycled from Fishing Gear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plastic pollution, mainly from lost fishing gear composed of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP), poses a significant environmental obstacle. This study evaluates the potential of recycling PP from fishnet/rope and reinforcing it with glass fiber (GF) in the form of 3D printer filaments as a way to reduce/prevent ocean plastic. Two materials, one virgin (vPP-GF) and one made up of recycled polypropylene and virgin glass fibers (rPP-GF), were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry, tensile, and Charpy impact tests. From the results, it was found that rPP-GF often outperformed vPP-GF. rPP-GF had a higher melting and crystallization point, likely a higher crystallinity, and could withstand a higher tensile stress, while vPP-GF could withstand a higher tensile strain. Further analysis revealed the potential presence of HDPE within the rPP-GF composite, which was not reported by the manufacturer. This significantly affected the Charpy test and made it difficult to draw conclusions from the resulting data. Nevertheless, their comparability in terms of mechanical and material properties indicates the strong potential of recycling polypropylene fishnet/rope and reinforcing it with glass fibers to extend their lifespan and reduce ocean plastic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11267v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have implemented resetting by means of an external trap, whereby a system relaxes to the minimum of the trap and is reset in a finite time. In this work, we set up and analyse the thermodynamics of such a protocol. We present a general framework, even valid for non-Poissonian resetting, that captures the thermodynamic work required to maintain a resetting process up to a given observation time, and exactly calculate the moment generating function of this work. Our framework is valid for a wide range of systems, the only assumption being relaxation to equilibrium in the resetting trap. Examples and extensions are considered. In the case of Brownian motion, we investigate optimal resetting schemes that minimise work and its fluctuations, the mean work for arbitrary switching protocols and comparisons to previously studied resetting schemes. Numerical simulations are performed to validate our findings.</description>

Abstract: Active matter encompasses many-particle systems with self-propelling units, such as flocks of birds or schools of fish. Here, we show how self-propelling domain walls can be realised in a solid-state system when a ferrimagnet is weakly driven out of thermal equilibrium by an oscillating field. This activates the Goldstone mode, inducing a rotation of the antiferromagnetic xy-order in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction, determined by the sign of the ferromagnetic component. Two opposite directions of rotation meet at a domain wall in the ferromagnetic component, resulting in `dynamical frustration', with three main consequences. (i) Domain walls move actively in a direction chosen by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Their speed is proportional to the square root of the driving power across large parameter regimes. (ii) In one dimension (1D), after a quench into the ferrimagnetic phase, this motion and strong hydrodynamic interactions lead to a linear growth of the magnetic correlation length over time, much faster than in equilibrium. (iii) The dynamical frustration makes the system highly resilient to noise. The correlation length of the weakly driven 1D system can be orders of magnitude larger than in the corresponding equilibrium system with the same noise level.</description>
