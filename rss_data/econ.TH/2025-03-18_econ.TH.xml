      <title>A Note on Obvious Manipulations of Quantile Stable Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-sided matching markets with contracts, quantile (or generalized median) stable mechanisms represent an interesting class that produces stable allocations which can be viewed as compromises between both sides of the market. These mechanisms balance the competing priorities of the parties while maintaining stability. This paper explores obvious manipulations of quantile stable mechanisms. Unfortunately, we get that any quantile stable mechanism different to the doctor-proposal DA is obviously manipulable. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between robustness to manipulation and other desirable properties, such as equity, in the design of stable matching mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Local and Global Optima: Sheaves and Polynomial Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze how global optima of an agent's preferences can be reconstructed from the solutions found for local problems. A sheaf-theoretic analysis provides an abstract characterization of the global solution, and polynomial approximations are obtained when only a few local instances are available.</description>

      <title>Correlation uncertainty: a decision-theoretic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a decision-theoretic foundation for uncertainty about the correlation structure on a Cartesian product of probability spaces. Our contribution is two-fold: we first provide a full characterization of the set of possible correlations between subspaces as a convex polytope. Its extreme points are identified as the local maxima of mutual information and as maximally zero probability measures. Second, we derive an axiomatic characterization of preferences narrowing down the set of correlations a decision maker considers, making behavior about correlation testable. Thereby, she may regard collections of subspaces as independent from one another. We illustrate our model and results in simple examples on climate change, insurance and portfolio choice.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Predictability of Performative, Social Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social predictions do not passively describe the future; they actively shape it. They inform actions and change individual expectations in ways that influence the likelihood of the predicted outcome. Given these dynamics, to what extent can social events be predicted? This question was discussed throughout the 20th century by authors like Merton, Morgenstern, Simon, and others who considered it a central issue in social science methodology. In this work, we provide a modern answer to this old problem. Using recent ideas from performative prediction and outcome indistinguishability, we establish that one can always efficiently predict social events accurately, regardless of how predictions influence data. While achievable, we also show that these predictions are often undesirable, highlighting the limitations of previous desiderata. We end with a discussion of various avenues forward.</description>

      <title>Online Assortment and Price Optimization Under Contextual Choice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an assortment selection and pricing problem in which a seller has $N$ different items available for sale. In each round, the seller observes a $d$-dimensional contextual preference information vector for the user, and offers to the user an assortment of $K$ items at prices chosen by the seller. The user selects at most one of the products from the offered assortment according to a multinomial logit choice model whose parameters are unknown. The seller observes which, if any, item is chosen at the end of each round, with the goal of maximizing cumulative revenue over a selling horizon of length $T$. For this problem, we propose an algorithm that learns from user feedback and achieves a revenue regret of order $\widetilde{O}(d \sqrt{K T} / L_0 )$ where $L_0$ is the minimum price sensitivity parameter. We also obtain a lower bound of order $\Omega(d \sqrt{T}/ L_0)$ for the regret achievable by any algorithm.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Distribution of Welfare from Discrete Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical welfare analyses often impose stringent parametric assumptions on individuals' preferences and neglect unobserved preference heterogeneity. We develop a framework to conduct individual and social welfare analysis for discrete choice that does not suffer from these drawbacks. We first adapt the class of individual welfare measures introduced by Fleurbaey (2009) to settings where individual choice is discrete. Allowing for unrestricted, unobserved preference heterogeneity, these measures become random variables. We then demonstrate that their distribution can be derived from choice probabilities, which can be estimated nonparametrically from cross-sectional data. Additionally, we derive nonparametric results for the joint distribution of welfare and welfare differences, and for social welfare. The former is an important tool in determining whether the winners of a price change belong disproportionately to those groups who were initially well-off.</description>

      <title>Incentive Contracts and Peer Effects in the Workplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11712v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze how firms should design wage contracts when workers collaborate in teams and effort costs depend on colleagues through a peer network. Performance-based compensation generates incentives that cascade through the organization, which firms target to boost profits. We analyze optimal incentive design if firms can -- and can't -- fully discriminate across workers, and when the production technology is separable or complementary across divisions. When workers' effort is substitutable, the most central workers -- those who influence most colleagues directly and indirectly -- receive the steepest incentives only when output risk is sufficiently large; otherwise firms prioritize workers that are closer to those they influence. We derive a sufficient network statistic that measures the surplus loss when firms must compensate workers of varying centrality equally. Finally, when production technology exhibits complementarity across teams, stronger incentives are assigned to workers who influence colleagues in small teams that receive little influence from others. We apply our findings to organizational design questions, such as optimal firm structure and workforce investments.</description>

      <title>The Division of Surplus and the Burden of Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A surplus must be divided between a principal and an agent. Only the agent knows the surplus' true size and decides how much of it to reveal initially. Both parties can exert costly effort to conclusively prove the surplus' true size. The agent's liability is bounded by the revealed surplus. The principal is equipped with additional funds. The principal designs a mechanism that allocates the burden of proof and divides the surplus. In principal-optimal mechanisms, the principal's effort to acquire proof decreases in the revealed surplus. The agent's effort initially decreases, but then the sign of its slope alternates across five intervals. Applications include wealth taxation, corporate finance, and public procurements.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Clones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models, trained on personal data, may soon be able to mimic individual personalities. These ``AI clones'' or ``AI agents'' have the potential to transform how people search over one another in contexts ranging from marriage to employment -- indeed, several dating platforms have already begun using AI clones to evaluate potential pairings between users. This paper presents a theoretical framework to study the tradeoff between the substantially expanded search capacity of AI clones, and their imperfect representation of humans. Individual personalities are modeled as points in $k$-dimensional Euclidean space, and their AI clones are modeled as noisy approximations of these personalities. I compare two search regimes: an ``in-person regime'' -- where each person randomly meets some number of individuals and matches to the most compatible among them -- against an ``AI representation regime'' -- in which individuals match to the person whose AI clone is most compatible with their AI clone. I show that a finite number of in-person encounters exceeds the expected payoff from search over infinite AI clones. Moreover, when the dimensionality of personality is large, simply meeting two people in person produces a better expected match than entrusting the process to an AI platform, regardless of the size of its candidate pool.</description>

      <title>Shinohara Rock-Paper-Scissors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes Shinohara Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS), a variant of the classic RPS game introduced by board game designer Yoshiteru Shinohara. In this game, players compete against a host who always plays rock, so players choose either rock or paper. The twist is that if two or more players choose paper, they are eliminated, creating strategic tension among the players. The last remaining player wins. We derive subgame perfect equilibria (SPE) of Shinohara RPS. A unique symmetric SPE exists, in which the probability of choosing paper satisfies the equation $(1-p)^{n-1} + p^{n-1}/n = 1/n$. The game also admits a continuum of asymmetric SPE.</description>
