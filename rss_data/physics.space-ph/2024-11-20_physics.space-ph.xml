      <title>First observations of a geomagnetic superstorm with a sub-L1 monitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting the geomagnetic effects of solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is currently an unsolved problem. CMEs, responsible for the largest values of the north-south component of the interplanetary magnetic field, are the key driver of intense and extreme geomagnetic activity. Observations of southward interplanetary magnetic fields are currently only accessible through in situ measurements by spacecraft in the solar wind. On 10-12 May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm since 2003 took place, caused by five interacting CMEs. We clarify the relationship between the CMEs, their solar source regions, and the resulting signatures at the Sun-Earth L1 point observed by the ACE spacecraft at 1.00 AU. The STEREO-A spacecraft was situated at 0.956 AU and 12.6{\deg} west of Earth during the event, serving as a fortuitous sub-L1 monitor providing interplanetary magnetic field measurements of the solar wind. We demonstrate an extension of the prediction lead time, as the shock was observed 2.57 hours earlier at STEREO-A than at L1, consistent with the measured shock speed at L1, 710 km/s, and the radial distance of 0.04 AU. By deriving the geomagnetic indices based on the STEREO-A beacon data, we show that the strength of the geomagnetic storm would have been decently forecasted, with the modeled minimum SYM-H=-478.5 nT, underestimating the observed minimum by only 8%. Our study sets an unprecedented benchmark for future mission design using upstream monitoring for space weather prediction.</description>

      <title>Recent advances in space sailing missions and technology: review of the 6th International Symposium on Space Sailing (ISSS 2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 6th International Symposium on Space Sailing (ISSS 2023) took place on June 5-9, 2023 at the New York City College of Technology, the City University of New York. Since its inauguration in Herrsching (Germany, 2007), the ISSS has been held in New York (USA, 2010), Glasgow (UK, 2013), Kyoto (Japan, 2017) and Aachen (Germany, 2019). During the five-day symposium, participants from 14 countries gathered to discuss recent advances in space sailing, investigating new concepts and designs, describing innovative hardware and enabling technologies, strategies for dynamics and control, and providing updates on testing results for systems under development and future mission applications. As part of the 18 sessions, almost 50 oral presentations were held and, subsequently, 17 papers were submitted for review and publication. This paper aims to give an overview of all the cutting-edge technologies, detailed analysis and promising results shared with the scientific community as part of the event. Following the noteworthy deployment of the world's first solar sail IKAROS in 2010, missions like NanoSail-D2 (2011) and LightSail-2 (2019) have showcased the potential of solar sailing technology through successful demonstrations. Besides highlighting advancements in present and future programs, the symposium was an opportunity to reflect on objectives, design and test results from research centers and universities, as well as illustrate applications for interstellar travel, evaluate degrading performance and suggest alternative solutions for known limitations. The following Symposium is scheduled for early summer 2025 and will be hosted by TU Delft.</description>

      <title>Revisit of discrete energy bands in Galilean moon's footprint tails: remote signals of particle absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the Juno spacecraft during its transit over flux tubes of the Galilean moons have identified sharp enhancements of particle fluxes at discrete energies. These banded structures have been suspected to originate from a bounce resonance between particles and standing Alfven waves generated by the moon-magnetospheric interaction. Here, we show that predictions from the above hypothesis are inconsistent with the observations, and propose an alternative interpretation that the banded structures are remote signals of particle absorption at the moons. In this scenario, whether a particle would encounter the moon before reaching Juno depends on the number of bounce cycles it experiences within a fixed section of drift motion determined by moon-spacecraft longitudinal separation. Therefore, the absorption bands are expected to appear at discrete, equally-spaced velocities consistent with the observations. This finding improves our understanding of moon-plasma interactions and provides a potential way to evaluate the Jovian magnetospheric models.</description>

      <title>Electron Irradiation of Crystalline Nitrous Oxide Ice at Low Temperatures: Applications to Outer Solar System Planetary Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radiation chemistry and physics of solid N2O have been increasingly studied due to its potential presence on the surfaces of cold, outer Solar System bodies. However, to date, no study has investigated systematically the influence of temperature on this chemistry and physics. In this present study, crystalline N2O ices were irradiated using 2 keV electrons at five different temperatures in the 20-60 K range and the radiolytic dissociation of the molecular solid (as well as the radiolytic formation of seven product molecules) was quantified through the G-value. Our results indicate that temperature does indeed play a role in the radiolytic destruction of crystalline N2O, with higher temperatures being associated with higher destruction G-values. The formation G-values of NO, NO2, N2O2, N2O3, N2O4, N2O5, and O3 were also noted to vary with temperature, with each product molecule exhibiting a distinct trend. The applications of our experimental results to further understanding solid-phase radiation chemistry in the outer Solar System are discussed.</description>

      <title>A coronal mass ejection encountered by four spacecraft within 1 au from the Sun: Ensemble modelling of propagation and magnetic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the structure and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the heliosphere remains one of the most sought-after goals in heliophysics and space weather research. A powerful tool for improving current knowledge and capabilities consists of multi-spacecraft observations of the same event, which take place when two or more spacecraft fortuitously find themselves in the path of a single CME. Multi-probe events can not only supply useful data to evaluate the large-scale of CMEs from 1D in-situ trajectories, but also provide additional constraints and validation opportunities for CME propagation models. In this work, we analyse and simulate the coronal and heliospheric evolution of a slow, streamer-blowout CME that erupted on 23 September 2021 and was encountered in situ by four spacecraft approximately equally distributed in heliocentric distance between 0.4 and 1 au. We employ the Open Solar Physics Rapid Ensemble Information (OSPREI) modelling suite in ensemble mode to predict the CME arrival and structure in a hindcast fashion and to compute the "best-fit" solutions at the different spacecraft individually and together. We find that the spread in the predicted quantities increases with heliocentric distance, suggesting that there may be a maximum (angular and radial) separation between an inner and an outer probe beyond which estimates of the in-situ magnetic field orientation (parameterised by flux rope model geometry) increasingly diverge. We discuss the importance of these exceptional observations and the results of our investigation in the context of advancing our understanding of CME structure and evolution as well as improving space weather forecasts.</description>

      <title>Photospheric Hot Spots at Solar Coronal Loop Footpoints Revealed by Hyperspectral Imaging Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Poynting flux generated by random shuffling of photospheric magnetic footpoints is transferred through the upper atmosphere of the Sun where the plasma is heated to over 1 MK in the corona. High spatiotemporal resolution observations of the lower atmosphere at the base of coronal magnetic loops are crucial to better understand the nature of the footpoint dynamics and the details of magnetic processes that eventually channel energy into the corona. Here we report high spatial resolution ($\sim$0.1\arcsec) and cadence (1.33 s) hyperspectral imaging of the solar H$\alpha$ line, acquired by the Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager prototype installed at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, that reveal photospheric hot spots at the base of solar coronal loops. These hot spots manifest themselves as H$\alpha$ wing enhancements, occurring on small spatial scales of $\sim$0.2\arcsec, and timescales of less than 100 s. By assuming that the H$\alpha$ wings and the continuum form under the local thermodynamic equilibrium condition, we inverted the H$\alpha$ line profiles and found that the hot spots are compatible with a temperature increase of about 1000 K above the ambient quiet-Sun temperature. The H$\alpha$ wing integrated Stokes $V/I$ maps indicate that hot spots are related to magnetic patches with field strengths comparable to or even stronger than the surrounding network elements. But they do not show the presence of parasitic polarity magnetic field that would support the interpretation that these hot spots are reconnection-driven Ellerman bombs. Therefore, we interpret these features as proxies of locations where convection-driven magnetic field intensification in the photosphere can lead to energy transfer into higher layers. We suggest that such hot spots at coronal loop footpoints may be indicative of the specific locations and onset of energy flux injection into the upper atmosphere.</description>
