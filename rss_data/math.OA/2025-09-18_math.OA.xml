      <title>Ortho-isomorphisms of von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $\mathscr M$ and $\mathscr N$ are von Neumann algebras. Two operators $A$ and $B$ in $\mathscr M$ are said to be orthogonal if $A^*B=0$, meaning their ranges are orthogonal. Let $\varphi\colon\mathscr M\to\mathscr N$ be a map. We say that $\varphi$ is an ortho-isomorphism if it is bijective and satisfies that $A^*B=0$ if and only if $\varphi(A)^*\varphi(B)=0$ for all $A,B\in\mathscr M$. The map $\varphi$ is called ortho-additive if the additive relation $\varphi(A+B)=\varphi(A)+\varphi(B)$ holds for all $A,B\in \mathscr M$ with $A^*B=0$. In this paper, we characterize the complete structure of ortho-additive ortho-isomorphisms between von Neumann algebras, which is an analogue of Dye's theorem and Uhlhorn's theorem.</description>

      <title>On definability of C*-tensor norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of definability (in the model-theoretic sense) of C*-tensor norms. We show that neither the minimal nor maximal tensor norms are definable uniformly over all C*-algebras. The proof in the case of the minimal tensor product norm uses a deep theorem of Kirchberg characterizing exactness in terms of tensor products with matrix ultraproducts while the case of maximal tensor products uses Pisier's recent characterization of the lifting property in terms of maximal tensor products and ultraproducts. We also study the question of when one of these tensor products can be definable in a particular C*-algebra. We establish some negative results along these lines for particular C*-algebras and when the definability condition is strengthened to be computable and of a restricted quantifier-complexity; these results use the quantum complexity results MIP$^*$=RE and MIP$^{co}=$coRE. As a byproduct of our arguments, we answer a question of Fritz, Netzer, and Thom by showing that the norm on $C^*(\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{F}_n)$ is not computable for any $n\in \{2,3,\ldots,\infty\}$.</description>

      <title>Discrete measured groupoid von Neumann algebras via the Gaussian deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a discrete measured groupoid $\mathcal{G}$, we study properties of the corresponding von Neumann algebra $L(\mathcal{G})$ using the techniques of Popa's deformation/rigidity theory. More specifically, we define and study the Gaussian deformation associated with any $1$-cocycle of $\mathcal{G}$ and use it to prove primeness and fullness under appropriate assumptions. We also characterize the maximal rigid subalgebras of $L(\mathcal{G})$ and produce unique prime factorization results for algebras of the form $L(\mathcal{G}_1\times\ldots\times\mathcal{G}_n)$.</description>

      <title>Dehn fillings, equivariant homology, and the Baum-Connes conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between Cohen-Lyndon triples and equivariant homology theory, with a focus on the Baum-Connes conjecture. In the first part of this work, we establish an excision sequence for the classifying spaces for proper actions in equivariant homology theories. This provides a direct link between Cohen-Lyndon triples and the left-hand side of the Baum-Connes conjecture. Independently of these, we prove that the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients (BCC) with finite wreath products holds for all discrete hyperbolic groups, building on the monumental work of Lafforgue. Combining this with permanence properties and the work of Dahmani-Guirardel-Osin on relatively hyperbolic groups, we identify a broad class of groups, including all lattices in simple Lie groups of real rank one that satisfy the BCC with finite wreath products. This significantly broadens the scope of our first result, as Cohen-Lyndon triples arise naturally in the context of relatively hyperbolic groups, thereby connecting both sides of the Baum-Connes conjecture.</description>

      <title>Positive maps and extendibility hierarchies from copositive matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characterization of positive, non-CP linear maps is a central problem in operator algebras and quantum information theory, where such maps serve as entanglement witnesses. This work introduces and systematically studies a new convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the classical cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the well-studied theory of copositive forms and the structure of positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC. As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs.
  On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of symmetric states, such as the Dicke states. We prove that the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy. Leveraging this duality, we provide an explicit construction of bipartite (mixture of) Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $\mathcal{K}_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n \geq 5$.</description>

      <title>Operator systems, contextuality and non-locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an operator system, universal for the probabilistic models of a contextuality scenario, and identify its maximal C*-cover via the right C*-algebra of a canonical ternary ring of operators, arising from a hypergraph version of stochastic operator matrices. We study dilating contextuality scenarios, which have the property that each positive operator representation thereof admits a dilation to a projective representation on a larger Hilbert space, and characterise them via the equality of the aforementioned universal operator system and the operator system arising from the canonical generators of the respective hypergraph C*-algebra. We characterise the no-signalling probabilistic models over a pair of contextuality scenarios of different types, which arise from either the positive operator representations or from the projective representations of these scenarios, in terms of states on operator system tensor products. Generalising the notion of a synchronous no-signalling correlation to the hypergraph framework, we define coherent probabilistic models associated with a given contextuality scenario and characterise various classes thereof via different types of traces of the hypergraph C*-algebra, associated with the scenario. We establish several equivalent formulations of the Connes Embedding Problem in terms of no-signalling probabilistic models and hypergraph operator systems.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Plancherel weight and factoriality of the group von Neumann algebras of non-unimodular almost unimodular groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact group, $L(G)$ be its group von Neumann algebra equipped with the Plancherel weight $\varphi_G$. In this paper, we consider the following two questions. (1) When is the restriction of $\varphi_G$ to the subalgebra generated by a closed subgroup $H$ semifinite? If so, is it equal (up to a constant) to $\varphi_H$? (2) When is $L(G)$ a factor? We give a complete answer to (1), and when $G$ is second countable, $G_1 := \text{ker}\Delta_G$ is open in $G$ (called almost unimodular) and admits a sufficiently large non-unimodular part, we provide an answer to (2). When $L(G)$ is a factor, we also provide the formula of the S-invariant of $L(G)$.</description>

      <title>A notion of fractality for a class of states and noncommutative relative distance zeta functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18896v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we first recall the definition of the relative distance zeta function in [42, 43, 44, 46, 47] and slightly generalize this notion from sets to probability measures, and then move on to propose a novel definition a relative distance (and tube) zeta functional for a class of states over a C* algebra. With such an extension, we look into the chance to define relative Minkowski dimensions in this context, and explore the notion of fractality for this class of states. Relative complex dimensions as poles of this newly proposed relative distance zeta functional, as well as its geometric and transformation properties, decomposition rules and properties that respects tensor products are discussed. We then explore some examples that possess fractal properties with this new zeta functional and propose functional equations similar to [11,35,36,42].</description>
