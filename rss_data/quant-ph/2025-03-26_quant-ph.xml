      <title>Note on Von Neumann Entropy and the Ordering of Inverse Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I show that for two inverse temperatures $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$, the von Neumann entropy $S(\rho_\beta)$ of the Gibbs state $\rho_\beta$ for a given Hamiltonian $H$ satisfies $S(\rho_{\beta_1}) \geq S(\rho_{\beta_2}) \iff \beta_{1} \leq \beta_{2}$. That is, von Neumann entropy is a monotonically increasing function of temperature.</description>

      <title>The Mathematics of Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I report the existence of exactly one non-trivial solution to the equation $i(A,B)+i(A,\neg B)+i(\neg A,B)+i(\neg A,\neg B)= 0$, where $i(A,B)=\log\frac{P(A\text{ and }B)}{P(A)P(B)}$, and $P(A)$ is the probability of the proposition $A$. The equation specifies an information balance condition between two logical propositions, which is satisfied only by independence and by this new solution. The solution is a new elementary informational relationship between logical propositions, which we denote as $A \sim B$.
  The $\sim$ relation cannot be expressed as a relationship between probabilities without the use of complex numbers. It can, however, be greatly simplified by expressing each proposition as a combination of a question and an answer, for example, writing, ``All men are mortal'', as (Are all men mortal?, Yes).
  We will study the mathematics of questions and find out what role the $\sim$ relationship plays inside the algebra. We will find that, like propositions, questions can act on probability distributions. A proposition, $X$, can be given, setting $P(X)$ to 1. The question of $X$ can be raised, setting $P(X)$ to $1/2$. Giving the proposition adds information to the probability distribution, but raising the question takes information away. Introducing questions into probability theory makes it possible to represent subtraction of information as well as addition.
  We will examine how questions can be related to each other geometrically. Remarkably, the simplest way of orienting questions in space has the same structure as the simplest quantum system -- the two-state system. We will find that the essential mathematical structure of the two-state quantum system can be derived from the mathematics of questions, including non-commutativity, complementarity, wavefunction collapse, the Hilbert space representation and the Born rule, as well as quantum entanglement and non-locality.</description>

      <title>Quantum Complex-Valued Self-Attention Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-attention mechanism has revolutionized classical machine learning, yet its quantum counterpart remains underexplored in fully harnessing the representational power of quantum states. Current quantum self-attention models exhibit a critical limitation by neglecting the indispensable phase information inherent in quantum systems when compressing attention weights into real-valued overlaps. To address this fundamental gap, we propose the Quantum Complex-Valued Self-Attention Model (QCSAM), the first framework that explicitly leverages complex-valued similarities between quantum states to capture both amplitude and phase relationships. Simultaneously, we enhance the standard Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCUs) method by introducing a Complex LCUs (CLCUs) framework that natively supports complex-valued coefficients. This framework enables the weighting of corresponding quantum values using fixed quantum complex self-attention weights, while also supporting trainable complex-valued parameters for value aggregation and quantum multi-head attention. Experimental evaluations on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST demonstrate our model's superiority over recent quantum self-attention architectures including QKSAN, QSAN, and GQHAN, with multi-head configurations showing consistent advantages over single-head variants. We systematically evaluate model scalability through qubit configurations ranging from 3 to 8 qubits and multi-class classification tasks spanning 2 to 4 categories. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we establish the critical advantage of complex-valued quantum attention weights over real-valued alternatives.</description>

      <title>Recursive Cartan decompositions for unitary synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recursive Cartan decompositions (CDs) provide a way to exactly factorize quantum circuits into smaller components, making them a central tool for unitary synthesis. Here we present a detailed overview of recursive CDs, elucidating their mathematical structure, demonstrating their algorithmic utility, and implementing them numerically at large scales. We adapt, extend, and unify existing mathematical frameworks for recursive CDs, allowing us to gain new insights and streamline the construction of new circuit decompositions. Based on this, we show that several leading synthesis techniques from the literature-the Quantum Shannon, Block-ZXZ, and Khaneja-Glaser decompositions-implement the same recursive CD. We also present new recursive CDs based on the orthogonal and symplectic groups, and derive parameter-optimal decompositions. Furthermore, we aggregate numerical tools for CDs from the literature, put them into a common context, and complete them to allow for numerical implementations of all possible classical CDs in canonical form. As an application, we efficiently compile fast-forwardable Hamiltonian time evolution to fixed-depth circuits, compiling the transverse-field XY model on $10^3$ qubits into $2\times10^6$ gates in 22 seconds on a laptop.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian dynamics of a qubit due to accelerated light in a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emission of a qubit weakly coupled to a one-band coupled-cavity array where, due to an engineered gradient in the cavity frequencies, photons are effectively accelerated by a synthetic force F. For strong F, a reversible emission described by an effective Jaynes-Cummings model occurs, causing a chiral time-periodic excitation of an extensive region of the array, either to the right or to the left of the qubit depending on its frequency. For weak values of F instead, a complex non-Markovian decay with revivals shows up. This is reminiscent of dynamics induced by mirrors in standard waveguides, despite the absence of actual mirrors, and can be attributed to the finite width of the energy band which confines the motion of the emitted photon. In a suitable regime, the decay is well described by a delay differential equation formally analogous to the one governing the decay of an atom in a multi-mode cavity where the cavity length and time taken by a photon to travel between the two mirrors are now embodied by the amplitude and period of Bloch oscillations, respectively.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Witnesses Mediated Via Axion-Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is solely a quantum property and it can be extremely helpful to test the physics beyond the Standard Model in tabletop experiments with the advent of future quantum technologies. In this work, we provide an entanglement-based partial positive transpose (PPT) witness for Yukawa-type potentials in the infrared regime between pairs of neutral/charged particles in a spatial quantum superposition. The entanglement is created by the interaction beyond the Standard Model such as Axion-like particle (ALP) or physics motivated by string theory such as extra dimensions in the context of gravity. We will constrain the couplings along with the decoherence rate to show what parameters can be searched for in near future entanglement-driven experiments for the search of new physics.</description>

      <title>A Multilevel Framework for Partitioning Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Executing quantum algorithms over distributed quantum systems requires quantum circuits to be divided into sub-circuits which communicate via entanglement-based teleportation. Naively mapping circuits to qubits over multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) results in large communication overhead, increasing both execution time and noise. This can be minimised by optimising the assignment of qubits to QPUs and the methods used for covering non-local operations. Formulations which are general enough to capture the spectrum of teleportation possibilities lead to complex problem instances which can be difficult to solve effectively. This highlights a need to exploit the wide range of heuristic techniques used in the graph partitioning literature. This paper formalises and extends existing constructions for graphical quantum circuit partitioning and designs a new objective function which captures further possibilities for non-local operations via nested state teleportation. We adapt the traditional Fiduccia-Mattheyses heuristic to the constraints and problem objective and explore multilevel techniques which coarsen hypergraphs and partition at multiple levels of granularity. We find that this reduces runtime and improves solution quality of standard partitioning. We place these techniques within a larger framework, through which we can extract full distributed quantum circuits including teleportation instructions. We compare the entanglement requirements and runtimes with state-of-the-art methods, finding that we can achieve the lowest entanglement costs in most cases, while always being close to the best performing method. We achieve an average improvement of 35% over the next best performing method across a wide range of circuits. We also find that our techniques can scale to much larger circuit sizes than state-of-the-art methods, provided the number of partitions is not too large.</description>

      <title>Study of the EPR-type entanglement characteristics of a NDPA with time-delayed coherent feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An open non-degenerate parametric oscillator (NDPO) is studied below threshold in the undepleted pump regime with time-delayed coherent feedback (TDCF). The figure of merit is the two-mode squeezing spectrum measuring the strength of continuous-valued Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-type (EPR-type) entanglement between the down-converted modes in the output field. Exploring different areas of the parameter space reveals the possibility of significantly enhanced entanglement with tunable characteristic frequency. These resonance-like features are closely related to the unique dynamics emerging as a result of delayed feedback. The system is very sensitive to phase matching, which can be adjusted by various parameters of the setup. Further advantage of the current scheme is that significant enhancement of entanglement can be achieved even with finite extraneous losses.</description>

      <title>Bounding fidelity in quantum feedback control: Theory and applications to Dicke state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving unit fidelity in quantum state preparation is often impossible in the presence of environmental decoherence. While continuous monitoring and feedback control can improve fidelity, perfect state preparation remains elusive in many scenarios. Inspired by quantum speed limits, we derive an ultimate bound on the steady-state average fidelity achievable via continuous monitoring and feedback control. This bound depends only on the unconditional Lindblad dynamics, the maximum control Hamiltonian strength, and the target state. We also adapt the bound to the case of Markovian feedback strategies. We then focus on preparing Dicke states in an atomic ensemble subject to collective damping and dispersive coupling. By imposing additional constraints on control Hamiltonians and monitoring strategies, we derive tighter fidelity bounds. Finally, we propose specific control strategies and validate them using reinforcement learning. Benchmarking their performance against our theoretical bounds highlights the relevance and usefulness of these bounds in characterizing quantum feedback control strategies.</description>

      <title>Fast and Error-Correctable Quantum RAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum devices can process data in a fundamentally different way than classical computers. To leverage this potential, many algorithms require the aid of a quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM), i.e. a module capable of efficiently loading datasets (both classical and quantum) onto the quantum processor. However, a realization of this fundamental building block is still outstanding, since existing proposals require prohibitively many resources for reliable implementations, or are not compatible with current architectures. Moreover, present approaches cannot be scaled-up, as they do not allow for efficient quantum error-correction. Here we develop a QRAM design, that enables fast and robust QRAM calls, naturally allows for fault-tolerant and error-corrected operation, and can be integrated on present hardware. Our proposal employs a special quantum resource state that is consumed during the QRAM call: we discuss how it can be assembled and processed efficiently in a dedicated module, and give detailed blueprints for modern neutral-atom processors. Our work places a long missing, fundamental component of quantum computers within reach of currently available technology; this opens the door to algorithms featuring practical quantum advantage, including search or oracular problems, quantum chemistry and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Entanglement cones and horizons in analogue cosmological production of Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although gravitational particle production in curved quantum field theories (cQFTs) is key to our understanding of the early universe and black hole physics, its direct observation requires extreme conditions or unrealistic sensitivities. Recent progress in quantum simulators indicates that analogues of gravitational particle production can be observed in table-top experiments of cold atomic gases described by effective cQFTs. This promises a high degree of tunability in the synthesised curved spacetimes and, moreover, sets a clear roadmap to explore the interplay of gravitational particle production with other non-perturbative effects genuine to interacting QFTs. We hereby focus on the appearance of fermion condensates for self-interacting Dirac fermions, and study how dynamical mass generation and spontaneous symmetry breaking affects real-time dynamics. We use the entanglement contour as a tool to analyze the spatio-temporal causal structure of particle production, showing how it can account for the cosmological horizon in accelerating spacetimes, while also being sensitive to the effect of different symmetry-breaking processes. In particular, we show that the combined breakdown of time-reversal symmetry due to the expanding spacetime, and parity due to a pseudo-scalar condensate, manifest through the structure of the light-cone-like propagation of entanglement in this analogue cQFT.</description>

      <title>Critical quantum metrology in a stabilized two-photon Rabi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a generalized quantum Rabi model (QRM) with two- and four-photon terms with respect to applications for non-linear critical quantum metrology. In the introduced model, the spectral collapse occurring in the standard two-photon QRM is stabilized by the presence of the quartic potential. The collapse is then transformed into a quantum phase transition, which occurs in the low-frequency limit of the light mode, whose remnant at finite ratio between qubit and mode frequencies can be applied to critically enhanced quantum metrology. We find that the four-photon term entails a much higher measurement precision compared to the standard two-photon QRM. The mechanism behind the higher precision can be traced to the different behavior of the ground state wave function as the system is tuned through the transition. As the standard two-photon QRM, despite the absence of the spectral collapse, our model allows for a finite preparation time for the probe state (PTPS).</description>

      <title>Space-time tradeoff in networked virtual distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to monolithic devices, modular, networked quantum architectures are based on interconnecting smaller quantum hardware nodes using quantum communication links, and offer a promising approach to scalability. Virtual distillation (VD) is a technique that can, under ideal conditions, suppress errors exponentially as the number of quantum state copies increases. However, additional gate operations required for VD introduce further errors, which may limit its practical effectiveness. In this work, we analyse three practical implementations of VD that correspond to edge cases that maximise space-time tradeoffs. Specifically, we consider an implementation that minimises the number of qubits but introduces significantly deeper quantum circuits, and contrast it with implementations that parallelise the preparation of copies using additional qubits, including a constant-depth implementation. We rigorously characterise their circuit depth and gate count requirements, and develop explicit architectures for implementing them in networked quantum systems -- while also detailing implementations in early fault-tolerant quantum architectures. We numerically compare the performance of the three implementations under realistic noise characteristics of networked ion trap systems and conclude the following. Firstly, VD effectively suppresses errors even for very noisy states. Secondly, the constant-depth implementation consistently outperforms the implementation that minimises the number of qubits. Finally, the approach is highly robust to errors in remote entangling operations, with noise in local gates being the main limiting factor to its performance.</description>

      <title>Quantum speed limits in dephasing dynamics of a qubit system coupled to thermal environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the quantum speed limits (QSLs) of a qubit system coupled to a thermal dephasing environment with an Ohmic-like spectral density. Based on the geometric QSLs time bound, which is derived by employing the trace distance to quantify the geodesic between two distinguishable states in dynamical evolution, we study the influences of the temperature and spectral density of the environment on the QSLs time of the dephasing qubit. We also investigate the interplay between the QSLs time, the environmental temperature, and the spectral density of the environment. It has been demonstrated that, the QSLs time closely depends on the transition frequency and the dynamical behavior (e.g., coherence trapping) of the dephasing qubit. For a fixed Ohmicity parameter of the environmental spectral density, the increase of environmental temperature can enhance the QSLs time bound. In addition, when the environmental temperature remains constant, the increase in the Ohmicity parameter initially leads to a reduction in the QSLs time bound, which is then followed by an increase of the time bound of QSLs. Our results can help to better understand the QSLs in the dynamics of open quantum systems and have potential application in the modulation of QSLs time in the dephasing qubit by engineering the spectral density of the environment.</description>

      <title>Leveraging quantum statistics to enhance heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key focus of designing quantum thermal devices is the potential advantage that can be gleaned from genuine quantum effects when compared to classical devices. The recent experimental realization of the Pauli engine, where energy is extracted via changes in particle statistics as an alternative to conventional heat sources has opened new avenues of research where quantum statistics can be considered as a thermodynamic resource. In this work we propose hybrid quantum heat engines which utilize additional strokes that change the single particle statistics between bosonic and fermionic descriptions during the cycle. To accomplish this we consider the 1D Lieb Liniger gas whereby the s wave interactions can be tuned between the non interacting and the hard core limit, which are described by bosonic and fermionic statistics respectively. We show that by suitably choosing where to implement these statistical strokes during an Otto like cycle, the efficiency and work output can be significantly enhanced when compared to fully bosonic or fully fermionic engines. Furthermore, in the degenerate regime our engine can operate at the Carnot efficiency, due to the interplay between the different contributions of heat and work induced by the statistical strokes. Finally, we highlight how our thermodynamic cycles can realize other thermal operations,such as refrigerators, promising similar statistical enhancements for a wide range of temperatures.</description>

      <title>Creation of Negatively Charged GeV and SnV centers in Nanodiamonds via Ion Implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid state quantum emitters, in particular group-IV vacancy centers in diamond, are at the forefront of research in quantum technologies due to their unique optical and spin properties. Reduction of the diamond host size to the nanoscale enables new opportunities in terms of integration and scalability. However, creating optically coherent quantum emitters in nanodiamonds remains a major challenge. Here, we present the fabrication of germanium- and tin- vacancy centers by means of ion implantation. We describe the fabrication process and present the optical properties of the created color centers. We achieve high purity single photon emission via resonant excitation and strong coherent drive of a SnV$^-$ center. The successful integration of heavier group-IV vacancy centers in nanodiamonds paves the way for further advances in fields like hybrid quantum photonics or sensing on the nanoscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A microwave memory using a superconducting artificial chiral atom embedded in a one-dimensional open transmission line is theoretically investigated. By applying a coupling field to a single artificial atom, we modify its dispersion, resulting in a slow probe pulse similar to electromagnetically induced transparency. The single atom's intrinsic chirality, along with optimal control of the coupling field, enables a storage efficiency exceeding 99% and near-unity fidelity across a broad range of pulse durations. Our scheme provides a feasible pathway toward highly efficient quantum information processing in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Photon-Mediated Atomic Interactions in Curved Surface Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subwavelength atomic lattices have emerged as a promising platform for quantum applications, leveraging collective superradiant and subradiant effects to enhance light-matter interactions. Integrating atomic lattices into nanostructures is at the front of effort toward any application with atomic lattices, but is still a challenging theoretical task, as the dipole interactions are hard to model in arbitrary dielectric environment. Here, we develop a formalism that allows the embedding of emitters to a wide class of thin curved waveguides, by greatly simplifying the wave equation and consequentially the dipole interactions. We demonstrate the formalism for locally constant positive curved surfaces, where we derive a new surface Green function that allows exact computation of the collective superradiant and subradiant states. We also show how the curvature and the thickness of the waveguides affects the collective states through an effective surface wavelength.</description>

      <title>Terahertz electro-optic modulation of single photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manipulation of visible and near-infrared light at the single-photon level plays a key role in quantum communication systems where information is encoded into photonic degrees of freedom. In practical implementations, it is important to achieve this manipulation with high speeds, low loss, and low noise. In this work, we propose the use of terahertz~(THz) electric fields as a pump source for electro-optic modulation of single photons in bulk media. We demonstrate spectral modulations of single photons in the form of frequency translation and bandwidth manipulations as the terahertz field imparts linear and quadratic phases on the photons at various time delays within 1~ps. Our results show frequency translations exceeding 500~GHz at multi-THz modulation speeds and loss levels of $\approx$1~dB, complementing the current state-of-the-art electro-optic modulation techniques limited to speeds up to 100~GHz. The proposed approach leverages recent developments in terahertz generation techniques, introducing new avenues to manipulate non-classical light in an unexplored regime for quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Tailoring nuclear spins order with defects: a Quantum-TCAD study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full design of relevant systems for quantum applications, ranging from quantum simulation to sensing, is presented using a combination of atomistic methods. A prototypical system features a two-dimensional ordered distribution of spins interacting with out-of-plane spin drivers/probes. It could be realized in wide-bandgap semiconductors through open-volume point defects and functionalized surfaces with low Miller indexes. We study the case of defect electron spins (driver / probe) interacting via hyperfine coupling with $S=1/2$ nuclear spins of H atoms chemisorbed onto \hkl(001) and \hkl(111) 3C-SiC surfaces. We simulate the system fabrication processes with super lattice kinetic Monte Carlo, demonstrating that epitaxial growth under time-dependent conditions is a viable method for achieving controlled abundance or depletion of near-surface point defects. Quantum features are evaluated by means of extensive numerical analysis at a full quantum mechanical level based on calibrated models of interacting spin systems. This analysis includes both stationary (relative stability of ordered states) and time-dependent (protocols) conditions, achieved varying the model parameters (in our case the atomic structure and the external field). We identify a rich scenario of metastable spin-waves in the quantum simulation setting. The interaction between protocols and variable system configurations could hinder the effectiveness of the preparation/measurement phases.</description>

      <title>QuCOOP: A Versatile Framework for Solving Composite and Binary-Parametrised Problems on Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing interest in solving computer vision problems such as mesh or point set alignment using Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC). Unfortunately, modern experimental AQC devices such as D-Wave only support Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) problems, which severely limits their applicability. This paper proposes a new way to overcome this limitation and introduces QuCOOP, an optimisation framework extending the scope of AQC to composite and binary-parametrised, possibly non-quadratic problems. The key idea of QuCOOP~is to iteratively approximate the original objective function by a sequel of local (intermediate) QUBO forms, whose binary parameters can be sampled on AQC devices. We experiment with quadratic assignment problems, shape matching and point set registration without knowing the correspondences in advance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple instances of tested problems.</description>

      <title>Magic teleportation with generalized lattice surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel, distillation-free scheme for the fault-tolerant implementation of non-Clifford gates at the logical level, thereby completing the universal gate set. Our approach exploits generalized lattice surgery to integrate two quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes. Specifically, non-Clifford gates are executed transversally on one QEC code and then teleported to the main circuit via a logical-level joint measurement that connects two distinct QEC codes. In contrast to conventional magic state distillation (MSD) combined with gate teleportation, our method obviates the need for concatenating separate codes for distillation and logical qubits, thus reducing the total overhead from multiplicative to additive scaling. We illustrate our approach by explicitly demonstrating its implementation for a 3D color code interfaced with a surface code of the same code distance, and comment on its potential advantage over the conventional MSD-teleportation scheme.</description>

      <title>Applications of Certified Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certified randomness can be generated with untrusted remote quantum computers using multiple known protocols, one of which has been recently realized experimentally. Unlike the randomness sources accessible on today's classical computers, the output of these protocols can be certified to be random under certain computational hardness assumptions, with no trust required in the hardware generating the randomness. In this perspective, we explore real-world applications for which the use of certified randomness protocols may lead to improved security and fairness. We identify promising applications in areas including cryptography, differential privacy, financial markets, and blockchain. Through this initial exploration, we hope to shed light on potential applications of certified randomness.</description>

      <title>Collapse-based models for gravity do not violate the Entanglement-Based Witness of non-classicality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that an entanglement-based witness of non-classicality can be applied to testing quantum effects in gravity. Specifically, if a system can create entanglement between two quantum probes by local means only, then it must be non-classical. Recently, claims have been made that collapse-based models of classical gravity, i.e. Di\'osi-Penrose model, can predict gravitationally induced entanglement between quantum objects, resulting in gravitationally induced entanglement is insufficient to conclude that gravity is fundamentally quantum, contrary to the witness statement. Here we vindicate the witness. We analyze the underlying physics of collapse-based models for gravity and show that these models have nonlocal features, violating the principle of locality.</description>

      <title>Clifford gates with logical transversality for self-dual CSS codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes with high encoding rate are good candidates for large-scale quantum computers as they use physical qubits more efficiently than codes of the same distance that encode only a few logical qubits. Some logical gate of a high-rate code can be fault-tolerantly implemented using transversal physical gates, but its logical operation may depend on the choice of a symplectic basis that defines logical Pauli operators of the code. In this work, we focus on $[\![n,k,d]\!]$ self-dual Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes with $k \geq 1$ and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the code to have a symplectic basis such that (1) transversal logical Hadamard gates $\bigotimes_{j=1}^{k} \bar{H}_j$ can be implemented by transversal physical Hadamard gates $\bigotimes_{i=1}^{n} H_i$, and (2) for any $(a_1,\dots,a_k)\in\{-1,1\}^k$, transversal logical phase gates $\bigotimes_{j=1}^{k} \bar{S}_j^{a_j}$ can be implemented by transversal physical phase gates $\bigotimes_{i=1}^{n} S_i^{b_i}$ for some $(b_1,\dots,b_n)\in\{-1,1\}^n$. Self-dual CSS codes satisfying the conditions include any codes with odd $n$. We also generalize the idea to concatenated self-dual CSS codes and show that certain logical Clifford gates have multiple transversal implementations, each by logical gates at a different level of concatenation. Several applications of our results for fault-tolerant quantum computation with low overhead are also provided.</description>

      <title>Entanglement fidelity limits of photonically-networked atomic qubits from recoil and timing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remote entanglement of two atomic quantum memories through photonic interactions is accompanied by atomic momentum recoil. When the interactions occur at different times, such as from the random emission over the lifetime of the atomic excited state, the difference in recoil timing can expose ``which-path'' information and ultimately lead to decoherence. Time-bin encoded photonic qubits can be particularly sensitive to asynchronous recoil timing. In this paper we study the limits of entanglement fidelity in atomic systems due to recoil and other timing imbalances and show how these effects can be suppressed or even eliminated through proper experimental design.</description>

      <title>Long-distance quantum communication using concatenated ring graph codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To realize long-distance quantum communication, it is crucial to design quantum repeater architectures that can deal with transmission losses and operational errors. Code concatenation of photonic graph codes is a promising way to achieve this; however, existing concatenated codes that can correct both transmission losses and operational errors are extremely hardware-demanding. We propose a one-way quantum repeater architecture based on concatenated ring graph codes and linear optical Bell-state measurements. We construct a scheme to generate the concatenated ring graph codes using quantum emitters, where the number of matter qubits scales linearly with concatenation depth. Furthermore, we devise a measurement strategy at each repeater station with a simple experimental setup where photons are measured in the order that they are created and show that entanglement swapping is fault-tolerant to both transmission losses and operational errors. This allows for long-distance quantum communication ($&gt; 10^4$ km) at a kHZ rate even in the presence of single qubit error rates $\epsilon &gt; 10^{-3}$.</description>

Abstract: The realization of quantum networks requires the development of robust low size, weight and power (SWaP) systems suitable for operation under harsh environments in remote and mobile nodes such as satellites. We present a source of polarization-entangled photon-pairs in a folded linear displacement interferometer based on spontaneous parametric down conversion using a Type-0 periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate crystal. Featuring a compact and stable double-pass geometry using a corner-cube retroreflector, the source has a detected pair rate of 2.5 M pairs/s/mW with a Bell state fidelity of 94.1% +/- 2.1%. The quality and demonstrated performance of the source are suitable for deployment in entanglement-based quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Versatile Cross-platform Compilation Toolchain for Schr\"odinger-style Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While existing quantum hardware resources have limited availability and reliability, there is a growing demand for exploring and verifying quantum algorithms. Efficient classical simulators for high-performance quantum simulation are critical to meeting this demand. However, due to the vastly varied characteristics of classical hardware, implementing hardware-specific optimizations for different hardware platforms is challenging.
  To address such needs, we propose CAST (Cross-platform Adaptive Schr\"odiner-style Simulation Toolchain), a novel compilation toolchain with cross-platform (CPU and Nvidia GPU) optimization and high-performance backend supports. CAST exploits a novel sparsity-aware gate fusion algorithm that automatically selects the best fusion strategy and backend configuration for targeted hardware platforms. CAST also aims to offer versatile and high-performance backend for different hardware platforms. To this end, CAST provides an LLVM IR-based vectorization optimization for various CPU architectures and instruction sets, as well as a PTX-based code generator for Nvidia GPU support.
  We benchmark CAST against IBM Qiskit, Google QSimCirq, Nvidia cuQuantum backend, and other high-performance simulators. On various 32-qubit CPU-based benchmarks, CAST is able to achieve up to 8.03x speedup than Qiskit. On various 30-qubit GPU-based benchmarks, CAST is able to achieve up to 39.3x speedup than Nvidia cuQuantum backend.</description>

      <title>Energetic advantages for quantum agents in online execution of complex strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agents often execute complex strategies -- adapting their response to each input stimulus depending on past observations and actions. Here, we derive the minimal energetic cost for classical agents to execute a given strategy, highlighting that they must dissipate a certain amount of heat with each decision beyond Landauer's limit. We then prove that quantum agents can reduce this dissipation below classical limits. We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a strategy to guarantee quantum agents have energetic advantage, and illustrate settings where this advantage grows without bound. Our results establish a fundamental energetic advantage for agents utilizing quantum processing to enact complex adaptive behaviour.</description>

      <title>New Diamond Magnet CaCo2TeO6: Strong Quantum Fluctuations and Enhanced Competing Exchange Interactions Enabled by Octahedral Co2+ Ligand Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Technology Job Market: A Quantitative Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Quantum Technology (QT) has created a growing demand for a specialized workforce, spanning across academia and industry. This study presents a quantitative analysis of the QT job market by systematically extracting and classifying thousands of job postings worldwide. The classification pipeline leverages large language models (LLMs) whilst incorporating a "human-in-the-loop" validation process to ensure reliability, achieving an F1-score of 89%: a high level of accuracy. The research identifies key trends in regional job distribution, degree and skill requirements, and the evolving demand for QT-related roles. Findings reveal a strong presence of the QT job market in the United States and Europe, with increasing corporate demand for engineers, software developers, and PhD-level researchers. Despite growing industry applications, the sector remains in its early stages, dominated by large technology firms and requiring significant investment in education and workforce development. The study highlights the need for targeted educational programs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and industry-academic partnerships to bridge the QT workforce gap.</description>

      <title>Tensor-Network Study of the Roughening Transition in (2 + 1)D lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the confined phase of (2+1)D lattice gauge theories a roughening transition arises between a weakly confined regime with floppy string excitations and a strongly confined regime with stiff string excitations. In this work, we use an infinite Density Matrix Renormalization Group (iDMRG) algorithm to quantitatively characterize the properties of confined strings. To this end, we stabilize the state with a string excitation by 't Hooft loop operators. While for zero gauge-matter coupling we can use bare 't Hooft loop operators to do so, for finite gauge-matter coupling we have to transform them to emergent ones, which we achieve with an adiabatic protocol. By analyzing the scaling of both a novel order parameter and the entanglement entropy, our approach allows us to accurately determine the roughening transition, even at finite gauge-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Jahn-Teller Effect for Controlling Quantum Correlations in Hexanuclear Fe$^{3+}$ Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the low-temperature magnetic and quantum properties of hexanuclear Fe$^ {3+}_6$ complexes under an external magnetic field. We primarily study the impact of competing exchange interactions and their asymmetries induced by the Jahn-Teller distortion on the quantum properties of the complexes. The inequality in exchange interactions lifts the ground-state degeneracy that gives rise to complex quantum behavior. By constructing the ground-state phase diagram and analyzing magnetization, we identify key magnetic phases and critical phenomena. We further quantify quantum correlations using tripartite entanglement negativity and conditional von Neumann entropy to unveil how the Jahn-Teller effect enhances intra-triangle entanglement while modulating inter-triangle correlations. Our findings highlight the Fe$^{3+}_6$ complex as a promising molecular platform for tunable quantum correlations, with potential applications in quantum information processing and molecular qubits.</description>

Abstract: This document explores the potential of quantum computing in Thermal Science. Conceived as a living document, it will be continuously updated with experimental findings and insights for the research community in Thermal Science. By experiments, we refer both to the search for the most effective algorithms and to the performance of real quantum hardware. Those are fields that are evolving rapidly, driving a technological race to define the best architectures. The development of novel algorithms for engineering problems aims at harnessing the unique strengths of quantum computing. Expectations are high, as users seek concrete evidence of quantum supremacy - a true game changer for engineering applications. Among all heat transfer mechanisms (conduction, convection, radiation), we start with conduction as a paradigmatic test case in the field being characterized by a rich mathematical foundation for our investigations.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Quantum Computing for Accelerated Classical Algorithms in Power Systems Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advent of commercially available quantum annealing hardware (QAH) has expanded opportunities for research into quantum annealing-based algorithms. In the domain of power systems, this advancement has driven increased interest in applying such algorithms to mixed-integer problems (MIP) like Unit Commitment (UC). UC focuses on minimizing power generator operating costs while adhering to physical system constraints. Grid operators solve UC instances daily to meet power demand and ensure safe grid operations. This work presents a novel hybrid algorithm that leverages quantum and classical computing to solve UC more efficiently. We introduce a novel Benders-cut generation technique for UC, thereby enhancing cut quality, reducing expensive quantum-classical hardware interactions, and lowering qubit requirements. Additionally, we incorporate a $k$-local neighborhood search technique as a recovery step to ensure a higher quality solution than current QAH alone can achieve. The proposed algorithm, QC4UC, is evaluated on a modified instance of the IEEE RTS-96 test system. Results from both a simulated annealer and real QAH are compared, demonstrating the effectiveness of this algorithm in reducing qubit requirements and producing near-optimal solutions on noisy QAH.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Quantum Kinetic Treatment of Impact Ionization in Avalanche Photodiodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix based quantum kinetic simulations have been widely used for the predictive modeling of electronic devices. Inelastic scattering from phonons and electrons are typically treated as higher order processes in these treatments, captured using mean-field approximations. Carrier multiplication in Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs), however, relies entirely on strongly inelastic impact ionization, making electron-electron scattering the dominant term requiring a rigorous, microscopic treatment. We go well beyond the conventional Born approximation for scattering to develop a matrix-based quantum kinetic theory for impact ionization, involving products of multiple Green's functions. Using a model semiconductor in a reverse-biased p-i-n configuration, we show how its calculated non-equilibrium charge distributions show multiplication at dead-space values consistent with energy-momentum conservation. Our matrix approach can be readily generalized to more sophisticated atomistic Hamiltonians, setting the stage for a fully predictive, `first principles' theory of APDs.</description>

      <title>Towards entropic uncertainty relations for non-regular Hilbert spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Entropic Uncertainty Relations (EUR) result from inequalities that are intrinsic to the Hilbert space and its dual with no direct connection to the Canonical Commutation Relations. Bialynicky-Mielcisnky obtained them in \cite{bialynicki1975uncertainty} attending Hilbert spaces with a Lebesgue measure. The analysis of these EUR in the context of singular Hilbert spaces has not been addressed. Singular Hilbert spaces are widely used in scenarios where some discretization of the space (or spacetime) is considered, e.g., loop quantum gravity, loop quantum cosmology and polymer quantum mechanics. In this work, we present an overview of the essential literature background and the road map we plan to follow to obtain the EUR in polymer quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the study of 1D elementary cellular automata (CA) to the nonlinear rules, following our study of the linear rules in Ref.[arXiv:2309.08059]. We thus construct the respective classical spin models and obtain their zero temperature ground states. We argue that these models are examples of frustrated systems where their ground state space can be exactly and systematically calculated. By including quantum fluctuations through the addition of a transverse field, we study their ground state quantum phases and phase transitions. We use rules 30, 54 and 201 as a probe of our two main results: (a) for small transverse fields we identify an order-by-disorder mechanism which stabilizes the classical phase, and (ii) we observe a first-order quantum phase transition between the classical and quantum paramagnetic phases when the transverse field strength equals the classical coupling strength, as for the linear rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian of two disjoint blocks in the harmonic chain on the line and in its ground state. In the regime of large mass, the non vanishing terms are only the on-site and the nearest-neighbour ones. Analytic expressions are obtained for their profiles, which are written in terms of piecewise linear functions that can be discontinuous and display sharp transitions as the separation between the blocks changes. In the regime of vanishing mass, where the matrices characterising the entanglement Hamiltonian contain couplings at all distances, we explore the location of the subdominant terms and some combinations of matrix elements that are useful for the continuum limit, comparing the results with the corresponding ones for the free chiral current. The single-particle entanglement spectra of these entanglement Hamiltonians are also investigated.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally induced entanglement at finite temperature: A memory-driven time-crystalline phase?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of thermal effects on gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) in a system of quantum harmonic oscillators interacting with classical linearly polarized gravitational waves (GWs). Specifically, we model the endpoints of interferometer arms in LIGO-like detectors as two-dimensional oscillators. Following the thermofield dynamics (TFD) approach, our analysis reveals that while thermal effects alone do not generate entanglement between independent oscillator modes, they serve as a catalyst, modifying the dynamical imprint of GWs. Notably, we identify a mixing of Bose-Einstein and Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions driven by thermal influences, which affects the statistical behavior of the quantum subsystem. Furthermore, gravitational interactions induce a quantum memory effect, leading to emergent periodic behavior in the reduced subsystem. This suggests a novel gravitationally induced breaking of time-translation symmetry, reminiscent of a prethermal time crystal (PTC). Our findings indicate that such effects could provide new theoretical insights into classical gravitational wave interactions.</description>

      <title>Biorthogonal basis approach to fractional Chern physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fractional Chern insulator is thought to emerge from the competition between one-particle band topology and strong repulsive interactions. As an attempt to study lattice models of fractional Chern insulators, we introduce a biorthogonal basis constructed from coherent-like states on the von Neumann lattice. Focusing on the fact that this basis is diagonal to the vortex attachment in the infinite-volume limit, we convert the original fermions into composite fermions by applying a two-dimensional Jordan-Wigner transformation to the creation and annihilation operators of the biorthogonal basis. Furthermore, we apply the Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation to handle the interaction Hamiltonian of composite fermions. Due to the biorthogonal nature, the representation of the new Hamiltonian is no longer Hermitian, which implies that the introduction of the approximation does not guarantee the reality of the energy spectrum. In fact, there are many self-consistent solutions with complex spectra. Nevertheless, we numerically find that it is possible to construct a self-consistent solution where the band dispersion is nearly real and the ground-state energy is lower than in other solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a broad class of strongly interacting quantum lattice gases, including the Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models. We focus on macroscopic particle clusters of size $\theta N$, with $\theta\in(0,1)$ and $N$ the total particle number, and we study the quantum probability that such a cluster is transported across a distance $r$ within time $t$. Conventional effective light cone arguments yield a bound of the form $\exp(v t-r)$. We report a substantially stronger bound $\exp(\theta N(vt-r))$, which provides exponential suppression that scales with system size. Our result establishes a universal dynamical principle: macroscopic suppression of supersonic macroscopic transport (MASSMAT).</description>

      <title>Geometric Meta-Learning via Coupled Ricci Flow: Unifying Knowledge Representation and Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a unified framework integrating geometric flows with deep learning through three fundamental innovations. First, we propose a thermodynamically coupled Ricci flow that dynamically adapts parameter space geometry to loss landscape topology, formally proved to preserve isometric knowledge embedding (Theorem~\ref{thm:isometric}). Second, we derive explicit phase transition thresholds and critical learning rates (Theorem~\ref{thm:critical}) through curvature blowup analysis, enabling automated singularity resolution via geometric surgery (Lemma~\ref{lem:surgery}). Third, we establish an AdS/CFT-type holographic duality (Theorem~\ref{thm:ads}) between neural networks and conformal field theories, providing entanglement entropy bounds for regularization design. Experiments demonstrate 2.1$\times$ convergence acceleration and 63\% topological simplification while maintaining $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ complexity, outperforming Riemannian baselines by 15.2\% in few-shot accuracy. Theoretically, we prove exponential stability (Theorem~\ref{thm:converge}) through a new Lyapunov function combining Perelman entropy with Wasserstein gradient flows, fundamentally advancing geometric deep learning.</description>

      <title>Predicted third-order sweet spots for phi-junction Josephson parametric amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire Josephson junctions exhibit skewed and phi-shifted current phase relations when an in-plane magnetic field is applied along the weak link's spin-orbit effective field direction. These junctions can have an asymmetric Josephson potential with odd-order nonlinearities. A dominant third-order nonlinearity can be achieved by tuning the magnetic field to a sweet spot. Sweet spots persist when higher order Josephson harmonics are included. This makes it possible to have a single Josephson junction dipole element with three-wave mixing capability, which is favorable for pump-efficient amplification. Electrostatic gate tunability of the semiconductor weak link can make it operable within an extended range of working frequencies, and the inclusion of micromagnets can facilitate near-zero magnetic field operation.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble of Real Random Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:1802.04588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct pseudo-Gaussian orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$ even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $ \mathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ independent and identically distributed random numbers as their elements and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When $\lambda \mu &gt;0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu &lt;0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \mathcal{D}^t \zeta \mathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.</description>

      <title>Operational Quantum Reference Frame Transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14002v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum reference frames are needed in quantum theory for much the same reasons that reference frames are in classical theories: to manifest invariance in line with fundamental relativity principles and to provide a basis for the definition of observable quantities. Though around since the 1960s, and used in a wide range of applications, only recently has the means for transforming descriptions between different quantum reference frames been tackled in detail. In this work, we provide a general, operationally motivated framework for quantum reference frames and their transformations, holding for locally compact groups. The work is built around the notion of operational equivalence, in which quantum states that cannot be physically distinguished are identified. For example, we describe the collection of relative observables as a subspace of the algebra of invariants on the composite of system and frame, and from here the set of relative states is constructed through the identification of states which cannot be distinguished by relative observables. Through the notion of framed observables -- the formation of joint observables of system and frame -- of which the relative observables can be understood as examples, quantum reference frame transformations are then maps between equivalence classes of relative states which respect the framing. We give an explicit realisation in the setting that the initial frame admits a highly localized state with respect to the frame observable. The transformations are invertible exactly when the final frame also has such a localizability property. The procedure we present is in operational agreement with other recent inequivalent constructions on the domain of common applicability, but extends them in a number of ways, and weakens claims of entanglement generation through frame changes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm for the Trellis based Viterbi Decoding of Classical Error Correcting Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a hybrid quantum-classical Viterbi decoder for the classical error-correcting codes. Viterbi decoding is a trellis-based procedure for maximum likelihood decoding of classical error-correcting codes. In this article, we demonstrate that the quantum approximate optimization algorithm can find any path on the trellis with the minimum Hamming distance relative to the received erroneous vector. We construct a generalized method to map the Viterbi decoding problem into optimization of a parameterized quantum circuit for any classical linear block code. Also, we propose a uniform parameter optimization strategy to optimize the parameterized quantum circuit using a classical optimizer. We observe that the proposed method efficiently generates low-depth trainable parameterized quantum circuits. Our approach makes the hybrid decoder more efficient than previous attempts at making quantum Viterbi algorithm. We show that using uniform parameter optimization, we obtain parameters more efficiently for the parameterized quantum circuit than previously used methods such as random sampling and fixing the parameters.</description>

      <title>Optimized trajectory unraveling for classical simulation of noisy quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of open quantum systems can be simulated by unraveling it into an ensemble of pure state trajectories undergoing non-unitary monitored evolution, which has recently been shown to undergo measurement-induced entanglement phase transition. Here, we show that, for an arbitrary decoherence channel, one can optimize the unraveling scheme to lower the threshold for entanglement phase transition, thereby enabling efficient classical simulation of the open dynamics for a broader range of decoherence rates. Taking noisy random unitary circuits as a paradigmatic example, we analytically derive the optimum unraveling basis that on average minimizes the threshold. Moreover, we present a heuristic algorithm that adaptively optimizes the unraveling basis for given noise channels, also significantly extending the simulatable regime. When applied to noisy Hamiltonian dynamics, the heuristic approach indeed extends the regime of efficient classical simulation based on matrix product states beyond conventional quantum trajectory methods. Finally, we assess the possibility of using a quasi-local unraveling, which involves multiple qubits and time steps, to efficiently simulate open systems with an arbitrarily small but finite decoherence rate.</description>

      <title>Emergent non-Markovianity and dynamical quantification of the quantum switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical aspects of the quantum switch and find a particular form of quantum memory emerging out of the switch action. We first analyze the loss of information in a general quantum evolution subjected to a quantum switch and propose a measure to quantify the switch-induced memory. We then derive an uncertainty relation between information loss and switch-induced memory. We explicitly consider the example of depolarizing dynamics and show how it is affected by the action of a quantum switch. For a more detailed analysis, we consider both the control qubit and the final measurement on the control qubit as noisy and investigate the said uncertainty relation. Further, while deriving the Lindblad-type dynamics for the reduced operation of the switch action, we identify that the switch-induced memory actually leads to the emergence of non-Markovianity. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the emergent non-Markovianity can be explicitly attributed to the switch operation by comparing it with other standard measures of non-Markovianity. Our investigation thus paves the way forward to understanding the quantum switch as an emerging non-Markovian quantum memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation into the learning capabilities of a simple d-level system (qudit). Our study is specialized for classification tasks using real-world databases, specifically the Iris, breast cancer, and MNIST datasets. We explore various learning models in the metric learning framework, along with different encoding strategies. In particular, we employ data re-uploading techniques and maximally orthogonal states to accommodate input data within low-dimensional systems.
  Our findings reveal optimal strategies, indicating that when the dimension of input feature data and the number of classes are not significantly larger than the qudit's dimension, our results show favorable comparisons against the best classical models. This trend holds true even for small quantum systems, with dimensions d&lt;5 and utilizing algorithms with a few layers (L=1,2). However, for high-dimensional data such as MNIST, we adopt a hybrid approach involving dimensional reduction through a convolutional neural network. In this context, we observe that small quantum systems often act as bottlenecks, resulting in lower accuracy compared to their classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Spectral Signatures of Vibronic Coupling in Trapped Cold Ionic Rydberg Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atoms and ions confined with electric and optical fields form the basis of many current quantum simulation and computing platforms. When excited to high-lying Rydberg states, long-ranged dipole interactions emerge which strongly couple the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom through state-dependent forces. This vibronic coupling and the ensuing hybridization of internal and external degrees of freedom manifest through clear signatures in the many-body spectrum. We illustrate this by considering the case of two trapped Rydberg ions, for which the interaction between the relative vibrations and Rydberg states realizes a quantum Rabi model. We proceed to demonstrate that the aforementioned hybridization can be probed by radio frequency spectroscopy and discuss observable spectral signatures at finite temperatures and for larger ion crystals.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a Lie group theoretic approach for parametric representation of unitary matrices. This leads to develop a quantum neural network framework for quantum circuit approximation of multi-qubit unitary gates. Layers of the neural networks are defined by product of exponential of certain elements of the Standard Recursive Block Basis, which we introduce as an alternative to Pauli string basis for matrix algebra of complex matrices of order $2^n$. The recursive construction of the neural networks implies that the quantum circuit approximation is scalable i.e. quantum circuit for an $(n+1)$-qubit unitary can be constructed from the circuit of $n$-qubit system by adding a few CNOT gates and single-qubit gates.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces quantum edge detection, aimed at locating boundaries of quantum domains where all particles share the same pure state. Focusing on the 1D scenario of a string of particles, we develop an optimal protocol for quantum edge detection, efficiently computing its success probability through Schur-Weyl duality and semidefinite programming techniques. We analyze the behavior of the success probability as a function of the string length and local dimension, with emphasis in the limit of long strings. We present a protocol based on square root measurement, which proves asymptotically optimal. Additionally, we explore a mixed quantum change point detection scenario where the state of particles transitions from known to unknown, which may find practical applications in detecting malfunctions in quantum devices</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Correlations in Dual-Unitary Quantum Circuits: Partial Spectral Form Factor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19929v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the notion of quantum chaos is tied to random matrix spectral correlations, also eigenstate properties in chaotic systems are often assumed to be described by random matrix theory. Analytic insights into eigenstate correlations can be obtained by the recently introduced partial spectral form factor. Here, we study the partial spectral form factor in chaotic dual-unitary quantum circuits in the thermodynamic limit. We compute the latter for a finite subsystem in a brickwork circuit coupled to an infinite complement. For initial times, shorter than the subsystem's size, spatial locality and (dual) unitarity implies a constant partial spectral form factor, clearly deviating from the linear ramp of the random matrix prediction. In contrast, for larger times we prove, that the partial spectral form factor follows the random matrix result up to exponentially suppressed corrections. We supplement our exact analytical results by semi-analytic computations performed in the thermodynamic limit as well as with numerics for finite-size systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Steady-state quantum thermal machines are typically characterized by a continuous flow of heat between different reservoirs. However, at the level of discrete stochastic realizations, heat flow is unraveled as a series of abrupt quantum jumps, each representing an exchange of finite quanta with the environment. In this work, we present a framework that resolves the dynamics of quantum thermal machines into cycles classified as engine-like, cooling-like, or idle. We analyze the statistics of individual cycle types and their durations, enabling us to determine both the fraction of cycles useful for thermodynamic tasks and the average waiting time between cycles of a given type. Central to our analysis is the notion of intermittency, which captures the operational consistency of the machine by assessing the frequency and distribution of idle cycles. Our framework offers a novel approach to characterizing thermal machines with significant relevance to experiments involving mesoscopic transport through quantum dots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a biased atomic qubit, universally implementable across all atomic platforms, encoded as a `spin-cat' within ground state Zeeman levels. The key characteristic of our configuration is the coupling of the ground state spin manifold of size $F_g \gg 1$ to an excited Zeeman spin manifold of size $F_e = F_g - 1$ using light. This coupling results in eigenstates of the driven atom that include exactly two dark states in the ground state manifold, which are decoupled from light and immune to spontaneous emission from the excited states. These dark states constitute the `spin-cat', leading to the designation `dark spin-cat'. We demonstrate that under strong Rabi drive and for large $F_g$, the `dark spin-cat' is autonomously stabilized against common noise sources and encodes a qubit with significantly biased noise. Specifically, the bit-flip error rate decreases exponentially with $F_g$ relative to the dephasing rate. We provide an analysis of dark spin-cats, their robustness to noise, and discuss bias-preserving single qubit and entangling gates, exemplified on a Rydberg tweezer platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) provides a promising avenue toward enabling quantum chemistry calculations, which are classically impossible due to a computational complexity that increases exponentially with system size. As fully fault-tolerant algorithms and hardware, for which an exponential speedup is predicted, are currently out of reach, recent research efforts are dedicated to developing and scaling algorithms for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices to showcase the practical utility of such machines. To demonstrate the utility of NISQ devices in the field of chemistry, we apply our recently developed FAST-VQE algorithm and a novel quantum gate reduction strategy based on propositional satisfiability together with standard optimization tools for the simulation of the rate-determining proton transfer step for CO2 hydration catalysed by carbonic anhydrase resulting in the first application of a quantum computing device for the simulation of an enzymatic reaction. To this end, we have combined classical force field simulations with quantum mechanical methods on classical and quantum computers in a hybrid calculation approach. The presented technique significantly enhances the accuracy and capabilities of QC-based molecular modeling and finally pushes it into compelling and realistic applications. The framework is general and can be applied beyond the case of computational enzymology.</description>

      <title>RESCQ: Realtime Scheduling for Continuous Angle Quantum Error Correction Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to realize large scale quantum error correction (QEC), resource states, such as $|T\rangle$, must be prepared which is expensive in both space and time. In order to circumvent this problem, alternatives have been proposed, such as the production of continuous angle rotation states \cite{akahoshi2023partially, choi2023fault, toshio2024practicalquantumadvantagepartially}. However, the production of these states is non-deterministic and may require multiple repetitions to succeed. The original proposals suggest architectures which do not account for realtime (or dynamic) management of resources to minimize total execution time. Without a realtime scheduler, a statically generated schedule will be unnecessarily expensive. We propose RESCQ (pronounced rescue), a realtime scheduler for programs compiled onto these continuous angle systems. Our scheme actively minimizes total cycle count by on-demand redistribution of resources based on expected production rates. Depending on the underlying hardware, this can cause excessive classical control overhead. We further address this by dynamically selecting the frequency of our recomputation.

      <title>First- and second-order quantum phase transitions in the long-range unfrustrated antiferromagnetic Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the ground-state phase diagram of an unfrustrated antiferromagnetic Ising chain with longitudinal and transverse fields in the full range of interactions: from all-to-all to nearest-neighbors. First, we solve the model analytically in the strong long-range regime, confirming in the process that a mean-field treatment is exact for this model. We compute the order parameter and the correlations and show that the model exhibits a tricritical point where the phase transition changes from first to second order. This is in contrast with the nearest-neighbor limit where the phase transition is known to be second order. To understand how the order of the phase transition changes from one limit to the other, we tackle the analytically-intractable interaction ranges numerically, using a variational quantum Monte Carlo method with a neural-network-based ansatz, the visual transformer. We show how the first-order phase transition shrinks with decreasing interaction range and establish approximate boundaries in the interaction range for which the first-order phase transition is present. Finally, we establish that the key ingredient to stabilize a first-order phase transition and a tricritical point is the presence of ferromagnetic interactions between spins of the same sublattice on top of antiferromagnetic interactions between spins of different sublattices. Tunable-range unfrustrated antiferromagnetic interactions are just one way to implement such staggered interactions.</description>

      <title>Halving the Cost of Quantum Algorithms with Randomization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03744v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) provides a systematic framework for implementing a polynomial transformation of a linear operator, and unifies nearly all known quantum algorithms. In parallel, recent works have developed randomized compiling, a technique that promotes a unitary gate to a quantum channel and enables a quadratic suppression of error (i.e., $\epsilon \rightarrow O(\epsilon^2)$) at little to no overhead. Here we integrate randomized compiling into QSP through Stochastic Quantum Signal Processing. Our algorithm implements a probabilistic mixture of polynomials, strategically chosen so that the average evolution converges to that of a target function, with an error quadratically smaller than that of an equivalent individual polynomial. Because nearly all QSP-based algorithms exhibit query complexities scaling as $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ -- stemming from a result in functional analysis -- this error suppression reduces their query complexity by a factor that asymptotically approaches $1/2$. By the unifying capabilities of QSP, this reduction extends broadly to quantum algorithms, which we demonstrate on algorithms for real and imaginary time evolution, phase estimation, ground state preparation, and matrix inversion.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body simulations with PauliStrings.jl</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Julia package PauliStrings ( https://github.com/nicolasloizeau/PauliStrings.jl ) for quantum many-body simulations, which performs fast operations on the Pauli group by encoding Pauli strings in binary. All of the Pauli string algebra is encoded into low-level logic operations on integers, and is made efficient by various truncation methods which allow for systematic extrapolation of the results. We illustrate the effectiveness of our package by (i) performing Heisenberg time evolution through direct numerical integration and (ii) by constructing a Liouvillian Krylov space. We benchmark the results against tensor network methods, and we find our package performs favorably. In addition, we show that this representation allows for easy encoding of any geometry. We present results for chaotic and integrable spin systems in 1D as well as some examples in 2D. Currently, the main limitations are the inefficiency of representing non-trivial pure states (or other low-rank operators), as well as the need to introduce dissipation to probe long-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gaussianity and Simulability of Cliffords and Matchgates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Though Cliffords and matchgates are both examples of classically simulable circuits, they are considered simulable for different reasons. The celebrated Gottesman-Knill explains the simulability Cliffords, and the efficient simulability of matchgates is understood via Pfaffians of antisymmetric matrices. We take the perspective that by studying Clifford-matchgate hybrid circuits, we expand the set of known simulable circuits and reach a better understanding of what unifies these two circuit families. While the simulability of Clifford conjugated matchgate circuits for single qubit outputs has been briefly considered, the simulability of Clifford and matchgate hybrid circuits has not been generalized up to this point. In this paper we extend that work, studying simulability of marginals as well as Pauli expectation values of Clifford and matchgate hybrid circuits. We describe a hierarchy of Clifford circuits, and find that as we consider more general Cliffords, we lose some amount of simulability of bitstring outputs. We then show that the known simulability of Pauli expectation values of Clifford circuits acting on product states can be generalized to Clifford circuits acting after any matchgate circuit. We conclude with general discussion about the relationship between Cliffords and matchgates, and show that both circuit families can be understood as being Gaussian.</description>

      <title>p-SWAP: A Generic Cost-Effective Quantum Boolean-Phase SWAP Gate Using Two CNOT Gates and the Bloch Sphere Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Boolean-Phase swapping gate is introduced for quantum generality and cost-effectiveness, which is termed the "p-SWAP gate", where p is a customizable phase difference for a set of swapped qubits and 0 &lt;= p &lt;= ${\pm \pi}$ radians. The generality of the p-SWAP gate is proposed for quantum Phase oracles requiring a desirable p for a set of swapped qubits, as well as for quantum Boolean oracles when p is ignored. The cost-effectiveness of the p-SWAP gate comes from the lower quantum cost and depth for its final synthesized (transpiled) quantum circuit into a quantum computer, as compared to the standard SWAP gate. In general, the standard SWAP gate is constructed using three Feynman (CNOT) gates, while our p-SWAP gate only utilizes two CNOT gates. In this paper, the desirability of p is geometrically chosen using our proposed Bloch sphere approach, without using any matrices multiplication and unitary representations. After transpilation, the final transpiled p-SWAP gate has approximately 23% quantum cost reduction and 26% depth minimization than those of the final transpiled standard SWAP gate.</description>

      <title>A Universal Circuit Set Using the $S_3$ Quantum Double</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One potential route toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computation is to use non-Abelian topological codes. In this work, we investigate how to achieve this goal with the quantum double model $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ -- a specific non-Abelian topological code. By embedding each on-site Hilbert space into a qubit-qutrit pair, we give an explicit construction of the circuits for creating, moving, and locally measuring all non-trivial anyons. We also design a specialized anyon interferometer to remotely measure the total charge of well-separated anyons; this avoids fusion, which would compromise fault tolerance. These protocols enable the implementation of a universal gate set proposed by Cui et al. and active quantum error correction of the circuit-level noise during the computation process. To further reduce the error rate and facilitate error correction, we encode each physical degree of freedom of $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ into a novel, quantum, error-correcting code, enabling fault-tolerant realization, at the logical level, of all gates in the anyon manipulation circuits. Our proposal offers a promising path to realize robust universal topological quantum computation in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Efficient and controlled symmetric and asymmetric Bell-state transfers in a dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing efficient and controlled state transfer is necessary for implementing a wide range of classical and quantum information protocols. Recent studies have demonstrated that both asymmetric and symmetric state transfer can be achieved by encircling an exceptional point (EP) in non-Hermitian (NH) systems. However, the application of this phenomenon has been restricted to scenarios where an EP exists in single-qubit systems and is associated with a specific type of dissipation. In this work, we demonstrate efficient and controlled symmetric and asymmetric Bell-state transfers by modulating system parameters within a Jaynes-Cummings model while accounting for atomic spontaneous emission and cavity decay. The effective suppression of nonadiabatic transitions enables a symmetric exchange of Bell states irrespective of the encircling direction. Furthermore, we report a counterintuitive finding: the presence of an EP is not indispensable for implementing asymmetric state transfers in NH systems. We achieve perfect asymmetric Bell-state transfers even in the absence of an EP, by dynamically orbiting around an approximate EP. Our work presents an approach to effectively and reliably manipulate entangled states with both symmetric and asymmetric characteristics, through the dissipation engineering in NH systems.</description>

      <title>Transmon qutrit-based simulation of spin-1 AKLT systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qutrit-based quantum circuits could help reduce the overall circuit depths, and hence the noise, when the system of interest has local dimension of three. Accessing second excited states in superconducting transmons provides a straightforward hardware realization of three-level systems, or qutrits, useful for such ternary encoding. In this work, we successfully calibrate pulse gates to a low error rate to obtain transmon qutrits. We use these qutrits to simulate one-dimensional spin-1 AKLT states (Affleck, Lieb, Kennedy, and Tasaki) which exhibit a multitude of interesting phenomena such as topologically protected ground states, string order and the existence of a robust Berry phase. We demonstrate the efficacy of qutrit-based simulation by preparing high-fidelity ground states of the AKLT Hamiltonian with open boundaries for various chain lengths. We then use ground state preparations of the perturbed AKLT Hamiltonian with periodic boundaries to calculate the Berry phase and illustrate non-trivial ground state topology. We further present scalable methods for preparing the AKLT state and computing its Berry phase, and use tensor network simulations to establish the advantage of qutrit-based implementation over qubit-based ones in the presence of noise. Our work provides a pathway toward more general spin-1 physics simulations using transmon qutrits, with applications in chemistry, magnetism, and topological phases of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a mapping from qubit quantum error correction codes (QECCs) to bosonic QECCs, yielding new families of bosonic codes that encode more information per excitation than multiple uses of the well-known binomial codes or permutation-invariant codes. In the asymptotic regime where many logical qubits are encoded, our construction improves the code rate by a factor of \(w+1\), enabling the correction of up to weight-\((w+1)\) amplitude-damping (AD) errors. Moreover, this mapping gives rise to a code family that mitigates undesired dephasing arising from collective coherent (CC) errors. By extending the original binomial codes to allow the simultaneous encoding of multiple logical qubits, our work can be seen as the bosonic analogue of converting \(K\) uses of \([[N_1,1,D]]\) qubit codes into a single use of \([[N_K,K,D]]\) qubit codes, with \(N_K \ll K\cdot N_1\).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network quantum steering plays a pivotal role in quantum information science, enabling robust certification of quantum correlations in scenarios with asymmetric trust assumptions among network parties. The intricate nature of quantum networks, however, poses significant challenges for the detection and quantification of steering. In this work, we develop a neural network-based method for measuring network quantum steerability, which can be generalized to arbitrary quantum networks and naturally applied to standard steering scenarios. Our method provides an effective framework for steerability analysis, demonstrating remarkable accuracy and efficiency in standard bipartite and multipartite steering scenarios. Numerical simulations involving isotropic states and noisy GHZ states yield results that are consistent with established findings in these respective scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate its utility in the bilocal network steering scenario, where an untrusted central party shares two-qubit isotropic states of different visibilities, $\nu$ and $\omega$, with trusted endpoint parties and performs a single Bell state measurement. Through explicit construction of a network local hidden state model derived from numerical results and incorporation of the entanglement properties of network assemblages, we analytically demonstrate that the network steering thresholds are determined by the curve $\nu \omega = {1}/{3}$ under the corresponding configuration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of a collection of identical particles is intimately linked to the symmetries of their wavefunction under particle exchange. Topological anyons, arising as quasiparticles in low-dimensional systems, interpolate between bosons and fermions, picking up a complex phase when exchanged. Recent research has demonstrated that similar statistical behavior can arise with mixtures of bosonic and fermionic pairs, offering theoretical and experimental simplicity. We introduce an alternative implementation of such statistical anyons, based on promoting or suppressing the population of symmetric states via a symmetry generating Hamiltonian. The scheme has numerous advantages: anyonic statistics emerge in a single particle pair, extending straightforwardly to larger systems; the statistical properties can be dynamically adjusted; and the setup can be simulated efficiently. We show how exchange symmetry can be exploited to improve the performance of heat engines, and demonstrate a reversible work extraction cycle in which bosonization and fermionization replace compression and expansion strokes. Additionally, we investigate emergent thermal properties, including critical phenomena, in large statistical anyon systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anderson localization physics features three fundamental types of eigenstates: extended, localized, and critical. Confirming the presence of critical states necessitates either advancing the analysis to the thermodynamic limit or identifying a universal mechanism which can rigorously determine these states. Here we report the unambiguous experimental realization of critical states, governed by a rigorous mechanism for exact quantum critical states, and further observe a generalized mechanism that quasiperiodic zeros in hopping couplings protect the critical states. Leveraging a superconducting quantum processor with up to 56 qubits, we implement a programmable mosaic model with tunable couplings and on-site potentials. By measuring time-evolved observables, we identify both delocalized dynamics and incommensurately distributed zeros in the couplings, which are the defining features of the critical states. We map the localized-to-critical phase transition and demonstrate that critical states persist until quasiperiodic zeros are removed by strong long-range couplings, highlighting a novel generalized mechanism discovered in this experiment and shown with rigorous theory. Finally, we resolve the energy-dependent transition between localized and critical states, revealing the presence of anomalous mobility edges.</description>

Abstract: In this article we present analytical results on the exact tensor network representations and correlation functions of the first examples of 2D ground states with quantum phase transitions between area law and extensive entanglement entropy. The tensor networks constructed are one dimension higher than the lattices of the physical systems, allowing entangled physical degrees of freedoms to be paired with one another arbitrarily far away. Contraction rules of the internal legs are specified by a simple translationally invariant set of rules in terms of the tesselation of cubes or prisms in 3D space. The networks directly generalize the previous holographic tensor networks for 1D Fredkin and Motzkin chains. We also analyze the correlation in the spin and color sectors from the scaling of the height function of random surfaces, revealing additional characterizations of the exotic phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: H. Lamb considered the classical dynamics of a vibrating particle embedded in an elastic medium before the development of quantum theory. Lamb was interested in how the back-action of the elastic waves generated can damp the vibrations of the particle. We propose a quantum version of Lamb's model. We show that this model is exactly solvable by using a multimode Bogoliubov transformation. We find that the exact system ground state is a multimode squeezed vacuum state, and we obtain the exact Bogoliubov frequencies by numerically solving a nonlinear integral equation. A closed-form expression for the damping rate of the particle is obtained, and it agrees with the result obtained by perturbation theory. The model provides a solvable example of the damped quantum harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of quantum computers has significantly challenged the security of traditional cryptographic systems, prompting a surge in research on quantum key distribution (QKD). Among various QKD approaches, continuous-variable QKD (CVQKD) offers superior resilience against background noise. However, the local local oscillator (LLO) CVQKD scheme faces substantial physical limitations in scenarios with high channel attenuation, and the large attenuation CVQKD remains unrealized. Bottleneck challenges include ensuring stable low-noise transmission and accurately estimating parameters under fluctuating channel conditions. In this paper, we introduce a continuous-time mode theory for high-precision estimation of time-varying parameters and design a free-space experimental system with a main quantum system and an auxiliary counterpart. We further develop advanced digital signal post-processing techniques for compensating time-varying frequency offset and phase noise under dynamic channel. Notably, the estimation of the time-varying free-space channel is achieved through the use of the auxiliary quantum system. Through experimental validation, we first demonstrate high-rate secure quantum key distribution over high-loss free-space channels. Specifically, we achieve asymptotic key rates of 76.366 kbps and 403.896 kbps in 25 dB attenuation free-space channels without turbulence and 21.5 dB average attenuation free-space channels with turbulence, respectively. Additionally, we confirm the feasibility of experiments on mildly turbulent atmospheric channels spanning at least 10.5 km using current equipments. Our scheme provides direct insight into constructing an integrated air-ground quantum communication network.</description>

      <title>Noise-strength-adapted approximate quantum codes inspired by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that machine learning provides a powerful tool for discovering new approximate quantum error-correcting (AQEC) codes beyond conventional algebraic frameworks. Building upon direct observations through hybrid quantum-classical learning, we discover two new 4-qubit amplitude damping codes with an innovative noise-strength-adaptive (NSA) feature where the codeword varies with noise strength. They are NSA self-complementary and NSA pair-complementary codes. We show that they can both outperform conventional codes for amplitude damping (AD) noise. The 4-qubit self-complementary NSA code outperforms the standard LNCY AD code in fidelity and Knill-Laflamme condition violation. The pair-complementary code, which has no known non-NSA analog, achieves even better performance with higher-order loss suppression and better fidelity. We further generalize both approaches to families of NSA AD codes for arbitrary system size, as well as an NSA variant of the 0-2-4 binomial code for single-photon loss. Our results demonstrate that adaptation to noise strength can systematically lead to significant improvements in error correction capability, and also showcase how machine learning can help discover new valuable code formalisms that may not emerge from traditional design approaches.</description>

      <title>Twin-Polaritons: Classical versus Quantum Features in Polaritonic Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding whether a polaritonic phenomenon is inherently quantum or classical is essential for developing accurate models and optimizing experimental designs. We investigate this question in the context of polaritonic rotational-vibrational spectra and report a new feature, the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the usual primary resonant polariton splitting that arises from light-matter entanglement. Through ab-initio calculations of HCl molecules and a corresponding model system coupled to a cavity, we demonstrate that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule case and follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary resonant polariton splitting. This finding reveals a novel mechanism to tune a quantum feature using a classical one, offering new insights into the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.</description>

      <title>Recoil-induced errors and their correction in photon-mediated entanglement between atom qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonically-interconnected matter qubit systems have wide-ranging applications across quantum science and technology, with entanglement between distant qubits serving as a universal resource. While state-of-the-art heralded entanglement generation performance thus far has been achieved in trapped atomic systems modelled as stationary emitters, the improvements to fidelities and generation rates demanded by large-scale applications require taking into account their motional degrees of freedom. Here, we derive the effects of atomic motion on spontaneous emission coupled into arbitrary optical modes, and study the implications for commonly-used atom-atom entanglement protocols. We arrive at a coherent physical picture in the form of "kick operators" associated with each instant in the photonic wavepackets, which also suggests a method to mitigate motional errors by disentangling qubit and motion post-herald. This proposed correction technique removes overheads associated with the thermal motion of atoms, and may greatly increase entanglement rates in long-distance quantum network links by allowing single-photon-based protocols to be used in the high-fidelity regime.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical quantum bus for donor spins in silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon is the foundation of current information technology, and also a very promising platform for the future quantum information technology. This is because the silicon-based qubits exhibit some of the longest coherence times and silicon is the underlying material for advanced photonics. In addition, photonics structures in silicon can be used to define optomechanical cavities where the vibrations of nanoscale mechanical resonators can be probed down to the quantum level with laser light. Here, we propose to bring all these developments together by coupling silicon donor spins into optomechanical structures. We show theoretically and numerically that this allows telecom wavelength optical readout of the spin-qubits and implementing high-fidelity entangling two-qubit gates between donor spins that are spatially separated by tens of micrometers. We present an optimized geometry of the proposed device and discuss with the help of numerical simulations the predicted performance of the proposed quantum bus. We analyze the optomechanical spin readout fidelity find the optimal donor species for the strain and magnetic field gradient coupling. We also study the gate fidelity of a two-qubit gate for a universal gate set and discuss future developments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the trajectories of $d$-dimensional cellular automata (CA) can be used to determine the ground states of $(d+1)$-dimensional classical spin models, and we characterise their quantum phase transition, when in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. For each of the 256 one-dimensional elementary CA we explicitly construct the simplest local two-dimensional classical spin model associated to the given CA, and we also describe this method for $d&gt;1$ through selected examples. We illustrate our general observations with detailed studies of: (i) the $d=1$ CA Rule 150 and its $d=2$ four-body plaquette spin model, (ii) the $d=2$ CA whose associated model is the $d=3$ square-pyramid plaquette model, and (iii) two counter-propagating $d=1$ Rule 60 CA that correspond to the two-dimensional Baxter-Wu spin model. For the quantum spin models, we show that the connection to CAs implies a sensitivity on the approach to the thermodynamic limit via finite size scaling for their quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pockels effect is essential for controlling optical signals at the highest speeds, particularly for electro-optic modulators in photonic integrated circuits. Lithium niobate (LN) and barium titanate (BTO) are two excellent Pockels materials to this end. Here, we measure the Pockels coefficients and permittivity in LN and BTO over a continuous frequency range from 100 MHz to 330 GHz. These properties are constant across this frequency range in LN but have a significant frequency dependence in BTO. Still, our measurements show that BTO has remarkably large electro-optic properties compared to LN. Furthermore, we show how BTO devices can be designed with a flat electro-optic frequency response despite the Pockels coefficient dispersion. Finally, we expound our method for broadband characterization of these vital electro-optic properties, utilizing specialized integrated electro-optic phase shifters. Altogether, this work empowers the design of high-speed BTO devices and the development of new electro-optic materials.</description>

      <title>The quantum Newman-Moore model in a longitudinal field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum Newman-Moore model, or quantum triangular plaquette model (qTPM), in the presence of a longitudinal field (qTPMz). We present evidence that indicates that the ground state phase diagram of the qTPMz includes various frustrated phases breaking translational symmetries, dependent on the specific sequence of system sizes used to take the large-size limit. This phase diagram includes the known first-order phase transition of the qTPM, but also additional first-order transitions due to the frustrated phases. Using the average longitudinal magnetization as an order parameter, we analyze the magnetization plateaus that characterize the ground state phases, describe their degeneracies, and obtain the qTPMz phase diagram using classical transfer matrix and quantum matrix product state techniques. We identify a region of parameter space which can be effectively described by a Rydberg blockade model on the triangular lattice and also find indications of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order connecting the quantum paramagnetic and classical frustrated phases.</description>

      <title>Addressing general measurements in quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among present quantum many-body computational methods, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is one of the most promising approaches for dealing with large-scale complex systems. It has played an extremely important role in understanding quantum many-body physics. However, two dark clouds, namely the sign problem and general measurement issues, have seriously hampered its scope of application. We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of partition functions $\langle \mathrm{O} \rangle=\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\bar{Z}=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{Oe^{-\beta H}})$ and $Z=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{e^{-\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and time. Essentially, this scheme solves the long-standing problem of calculating the overlap between different distribution functions in mathematical statistics, which can be widely used in statistical problems, such as quantum many-body computation, big data and machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale objects moving relative to a thermal radiation bath experience a drag force due to the imbalance in their interaction with the blue- and redshifted components of the electromagnetic field. Here, we show that, in addition to this drag force, moving nanostructures with an anisotropic optical response experience a lateral force and a torque that substantially modify their trajectory. These phenomena emerge from the additional coupling between the electromagnetic field components polarized parallel and perpendicular to the trajectory, enabled by the anisotropic response of the nanostructure. This work unveils the intricate dynamics of anisotropic nanostructures moving in a thermal radiation bath.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photon recoil is one of the fundamental limitations for high-fidelity control of trapped-atom qubits such as neutral atoms and trapped ions. In this work, we derive an analytical model for efficiently evaluating the motion-induced infidelity in remote entanglement generation protocols. Our model is applicable for various photonic qubit encodings such as polarization, time bin, and frequency, and with arbitrary initial motional states, thus providing a crucial theoretical tool for realizing high-fidelity quantum networking. For the case of tweezer-trapped neutral atoms, our results indicate that operating in the bad-cavity regime with cavity decay rate exceeding atom-photon coupling rate, and near-ground-state cooling with motional quanta below 1, are desired to suppress the motion-induced infidelity sufficiently below the 1% level required for efficient quantum networking. Finite temperature effects can be mitigated efficiently by detection time filtering at the moderate cost of success probability and network speed. These results extend the understanding of infidelity sources in remote entanglement generation protocols, establishing a concrete path towards fault-tolerant quantum networking with scalable trapped-atom qubit systems.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Neural Network Transfer-Learning Model for Forecasting Problems with Continuous and Discrete Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces simple yet effective continuous- and discrete-variable quantum neural network (QNN) models as a transfer-learning approach for forecasting tasks. The CV-QNN features a single quantum layer with two qubits to establish entanglement and utilizes a minimal set of quantum gates, including displacement, rotation, beam splitter, squeezing, and a non-Gaussian cubic-phase gate, with a maximum of eight trainable parameters. A key advantage of this model is its ability to be trained on a single dataset, after which the learned parameters can be transferred to other forecasting problems with little to no fine-tuning. Initially trained on the Kurdistan load demand dataset, the model's frozen parameters are successfully applied to various forecasting tasks, including energy consumption, traffic flow, weather conditions, and cryptocurrency price prediction, demonstrating strong performance. Furthermore, the study introduces a discrete-variable quantum model with an equivalent 2- and 4-wire configuration and presents a performance assessment, showing good but relatively lower effectiveness compared to the continuous-variable model.</description>

      <title>Complex Frequency Detection in a Subsystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we systematically explore the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and its associated complex-frequency detection in the context of a frequency-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian arises from the self-energy correction of the subsystem and can be calculated exactly within our theoretical model, without the need for any approximations. Additionally, complex frequency detection, which encompasses complex frequency excitation, synthesis, and fingerprint, enables us to detect the physical responses induced by the complex driving frequencies. Our calculations reveal that both complex frequency excitation and synthesis are incompatible with the non-Hermitian approximation and are unable to characterize the presence or abscence of the NHSE. In contrast, the complex-frequency fingerprint successfully detects the novel responses induced by the NHSE through the introduction of a double-frequency Green's function. Our work provides a platform for studying non-Hermitian physics and their novel response in quantum systems rigorously without relying on any approximations.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Sensors for Ultraheavy Dark Matter Searches via Long-range Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale are theoretically well-motivated, and it has been suggested that it might be possible to search for dark matter solely via gravitational interactions in this mass range. In this work, we explore the pathway towards searching for dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale using mechanical sensors while considering realistic experimental constraints, and develop analysis techniques needed to conduct such searches. These dark matter particles are expected to leave tracks as their signature in mechanical sensor arrays, and we show that we can effectively search for such tracks using statistical approaches to track-finding. We analyze a range of possible experimental setups and compute sensitivity projections for searches for ultraheavy dark matter coupling to the Standard Model via long-range forces. We find that while a search for Planck-scale dark matter purely via gravitational couplings would be exceedingly difficult, requiring $\sim 80\,\mathrm{dB}$ of quantum noise reduction with a $100^3$ array of devices, there is a wide range of currently unexplored dark matter candidates which can be searched for with already existing or near-term experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Efficient optimization and conceptual barriers in variational finite Projected Entangled-Pair States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) on finite two-dimensional lattices are a natural ansatz for representing ground states of local many-body Hamiltonians, as they inherently satisfy the boundary law of entanglement entropy. In this paper, we propose the optimization of PEPS via an improved formulation of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), namely the minimum-step stochastic-reconfguration scheme recently introduced for neural quantum states. We further discuss possible numerical issues that might arise in such a sampling-based approach. In this context, investigate the entanglement properties of random PEPS and find an entanglement phase transition. We note that on one side of this transition, we can identify positive random tensors as product states. To demonstrate the power of the framework described in this paper, we apply the PEPS to study the notoriously challenging chiral spin liquids. Moreover, we exhibit our approach's capability to naturally handle long-range interactions by exploring the phase diagram of Rydberg atom arrays with long-range interactions. We further provide parallelized easy-to-use code, allowing the straightforward application of our method to general Hamiltonians composed of local interaction terms.</description>

      <title>A Scalable and Robust Compilation Framework for Emitter-Photonic Graph State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum graph states are critical resources for various quantum algorithms, and also determine essential interconnections in distributed quantum computing. There are two schemes for generating graph states probabilistic scheme and deterministic scheme. While the all-photonic probabilistic scheme has garnered significant attention, the emitter-photonic deterministic scheme has been proved to be more scalable and feasible across several hardware platforms.
  This paper studies the GraphState-to-Circuit compilation problem in the context of the deterministic scheme. Previous research has primarily focused on optimizing individual circuit parameters, often neglecting the characteristics of quantum hardware, which results in impractical implementations. Additionally, existing algorithms lack scalability for larger graph sizes. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel compilation framework that partitions the target graph state into subgraphs, compiles them individually, and subsequently combines and schedules the circuits to maximize emitter resource utilization. Furthermore, we incorporate local complementation to transform graph states and minimize entanglement overhead. Evaluation of our framework on various graph types demonstrates significant reductions in CNOT gates and circuit duration, up to 52% and 56%. Moreover, it enhances the suppression of photon loss, achieving improvements of up to x1.9.</description>

      <title>Long-term excitation energy transfer predicted by a modified convolutional neural networks in the FMO complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In machine learning (ML), the risk of recursive strategies overfitting historical data has driven the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in simulating quantum dissipative dynamics. In this work, we propose an efficient CNNs scheme incorporating novel redundant time-functions to predict 100 picosecond (ps) excitation energy transfer (EET) in Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complexes, in which the original time $t$ is normalized by mapping it to the [0, 1] range, allowing different functions focus on distinct time intervals, thereby effectively capturing the multi-timescale characteristics of EET dynamics. This method simplifies optimization and enhances learning efficiency, and demonstrate the superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of our approach in predicting quantum dissipative dynamics.</description>

      <title>Are Pseudo-Hermiticity and Generalized PT-Symmetry Equivalent at Exceptional Points?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a diagonalizable linear operator $H:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ acting in a separable Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$, i.e., an operator with a purely point spectrum, eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities, and a set of eigenvectors that form a Reisz basis of $\mathscr{H}$, the pseudo-Hermiticity of $H$ is equivalent to its generalized PT-symmetry, where the latter means the existence of an antilinear operator $X:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ satisfying $[X,H]=0$ and $X^2=1$. We show that this equivalence is generally valid for block-diagonalizable operators, i.e., those which have a purely point spectrum, eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities, and a set of generalized eigenvectors that form a Jordan Reisz basis of $\mathscr{H}$. In particular, we establish the equivalence of pseudo-Hermiticity and generalized $PT$-symmetry for arbitrary linear operators acting in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Dataset Distillation for Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) on large amount of classical data can be both time consuming as well as expensive. Higher amount of training data would require higher number of gradient descent steps to reach convergence. This, in turn would imply that the QNN will require higher number of quantum executions, thereby driving up its overall execution cost. In this work, we propose performing the dataset distillation process for QNNs, where we use a novel quantum variant of classical LeNet model containing residual connection and trainable Hermitian observable in the Parametric Quantum Circuit (PQC) of the QNN. This approach yields highly informative yet small number of training data at similar performance as the original data. We perform distillation for MNIST and Cifar-10 datasets, and on comparison with classical models observe that both the datasets yield reasonably similar post-inferencing accuracy on quantum LeNet (91.9% MNIST, 50.3% Cifar-10) compared to classical LeNet (94% MNIST, 54% Cifar-10). We also introduce a non-trainable Hermitian for ensuring stability in the distillation process and note marginal reduction of up to 1.8% (1.3%) for MNIST (Cifar-10) dataset.</description>

      <title>EIT in V+ inverted $\Xi$ system using Rydberg state in thermal Rb atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg excitation using blue and IR transition is an advantageous path for quantum computation in alkali elements. Aiming to stabilize the IR laser for quantum computation, we study electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectrum using Rydberg state in V+inverted $\Xi$ system (${5S_{1/2}}$ $\rightarrow$ ${5P_{3/2}}$ and ${5S_{1/2}}$ $\rightarrow$ ${6P_{1/2}}$ $\rightarrow$ ${r=69D_{3/2}}$) in Rb vapour cell at room temperature. The probe laser absorption at 780 nm is monitored in the presence of the two control lasers at 421 nm and 1003 nm. In comparison to the previously studied inverted $\Xi$ system, this system has a good signal-to-noise ratio even at room temperature with similar linewidth (around $10$~MHz). We also observe Autler-Towns splitting of the EIT due to the high power of probe and blue control lasers. For completeness and comparison, we also study the EIT in an inverted $\Xi$ system using $5S_{1/2}\rightarrow6P_{1/2}\rightarrow 69D_{3/2}$ transitions.</description>
