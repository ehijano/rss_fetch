      <title>Evaluating Electric Micro-Mobility Related Mode Choice Stated Preferences: A Latent Class Choice Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines mode choice behaviour regarding Electric Micro-Mobility (EMM) among car and public transport users using a Latent Class Choice Modelling (LCCM) approach. Utilizing stated preference survey data from 1,671 Brisbane residents, the study identifies distinct user segments with heterogeneous sensitivities to EMM attributes. Results reveal significant potential for EMM adoption, notably among segments inclined toward multimodal trips or personal micromobility, driven primarily by weather conditions, travel time, and cost. Conversely, resistant segments characterized by demographic factors such as age, gender, income, and lack of EMM experience highlight challenges in shifting mode choices. Further analyses, including class profiles, elasticities, and geographical distribution, are conducted to generate comprehensive insights that inform policy decisions. These insights support targeted investments in micromobility infrastructure and integrated pricing strategies, thereby enhancing EMM adoption and promoting sustainable urban mobility.</description>

      <title>Identity-Based Language Shift Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preservation of endangered languages is a widely discussed issue nowadays. Languages represent essential cultural heritage and can provide valuable botanical, biological, and geographical information. Therefore, it is necessary to develop efficient measures to preserve and revitalize endangered languages. However, the language shift process is complex and requires an interdisciplinary approach, including mathematical modeling techniques. This paper develops a new mathematical model that extends previous works on this topic. We introduce the factor of ethnic identity, which is a proxy for a more complex nexus of variables involved in an individual's self-identity and/or a group's identity. This proxy is socially constructed rather than solely inherited, shaped by community-determined factors, with language both indexing and creating the identity. In our model, we divide speakers into groups depending on with which language they identify themselves with. Moreover, every group includes monolinguals and bilinguals. The proposed model naturally allows us to consider cases of language coexistence and describe a broader class of linguistic situations. For example, the simulation results show that our model can result in cyclic language dynamics, drawing a parallel to cell population models. In this way, the proposed mathematical model can serve as a useful tool for developing efficient measures for language preservation and revitalization.</description>

      <title>The gravity model for social systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravity is one of the most prominent models used across various social areas, including economics, demography, mobility, politics, and other systems where spatial interactions are relevant. The model represents a flexible approach that captures important regularities that might be detected when thousands or millions of people are observed, i.e. bigger origins and bigger destinations increase the intensity of interactions, but it tends to decay with longer distances between them. Therefore, the number of interactions between two locations is frequently modelled with an equation that resembles Newton's Law of Gravitation (also known as the Law of Gravity). Here, I explore different aspects, i.e. essential components, techniques for estimating the parameters, interpretation of results, and settings where gravity is a helpful tool, including mobility and migration.</description>

      <title>Modeling Urban Population Dynamics and City-to-City Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Migration plays a crucial role in urban growth. Over time, individuals opting to relocate led to vast metropolises like London and Paris during the Industrial Revolution, Shanghai and Karachi during the last decades and thousands of smaller settlements. Here, we analyze the impact that migration has on population redistribution. We use a model of city-to-city migration as a process that occurs within a network, where the nodes represent cities, and the edges correspond to the flux of individuals. We analyze metrics characterizing the urban distribution and show how a slight preference for some destinations might result in the observed distribution of the population.</description>

      <title>Automatic Estimation of Pedestrian Gait Features using a single camera recording: Algorithm and Statistical Analysis for Gender Difference and Obstacle Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pedestrian gait features - body sway frequency, amplitude, stride length, and speed, along with pedestrian personal space and directional bias, are important parameters to be used in different pedestrian dynamics studies. Gait feature measurements are paramount for wide-ranging applications, varying from the medical field to the design of bridges. Personal space and choice of direction (directional bias) play important roles during crowd simulations. In this study, we formulate an automatic algorithm for calculating the gait features of a trajectory extracted from video recorded using a single camera attached to the roof of a building. Our findings indicate that females have 28.64% smaller sway amplitudes, 8.68% smaller stride lengths, and 8.14% slower speeds compared to males, with no significant difference in frequency. However, according to further investigation, our study reveals that the body parameters are the main variables that dominate gait features rather than gender. We have conducted three experiments in which the volunteers are walking towards the destination a) without any obstruction, b) with a stationary non-living obstacle present in the middle of the path, and c) with a human being standing in the middle of the path. From a comprehensive statistical analysis, key observations include no significant difference in gait features with respect to gender, no significant difference in gait features in the absence or presence of an obstacle, pedestrians treating stationary human beings and stationary obstacles the same given that the gender is same to match the comfort level, and a directional bias towards the left direction, likely influenced by left-hand traffic rule in India.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Siege of Syracuse: Resources, strategy, and collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Siege of Syracuse ($214-212$ BC) was a decisive event in the Second Punic War, leading to the city's fall to Rome despite its formidable defenses, including the war machines devised by Archimedes. In this work, we propose a mathematical model to describe the dynamics of the siege, incorporating the depletion of resources, the decline of Syracuse's population, and the persistence of the Roman army. Our analysis reveals the existence of a critical threshold $\lambda_{c}$, which determines the outcome of the siege. This threshold marks a phase transition: if the effectiveness of Syracuse's defenses, represented by $\lambda$, had exceeded $\lambda_{c}$, the city could have withstood the Roman assault. However, since history records Syracuse's fall, we conclude that $\lambda &lt; \lambda_{c}$. This result provides a quantitative framework to understand the inevitability of the city's conquest and demonstrates how mathematical modeling can offer new insights into historical military conflicts. We also explore different scenarios and assess the impact of key factors such as siege duration, supply constraints, and defensive capabilities. The results provide insight into how strategic elements influenced the eventual fall of Syracuse and demonstrate the applicability of mathematical modeling in historical military analysis.</description>

      <title>Study of scaling laws in language families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates scaling laws within language families using data from over six thousand languages and analyzing emergent patterns observed in Zipf-like classification graphs. Both macroscopic (based on number of languages by family) and microscopic (based on numbers of speakers by language on a family) aspects of these classifications are examined. Particularly noteworthy is the discovery of a distinct division among the fourteen largest contemporary language families, excluding Afro-Asiatic and Nilo-Saharan languages. These families are found to be distributed across three language family quadruplets, each characterized by significantly different exponents in the Zipf graphs. This finding sheds light on the underlying structure and organization of major language families, revealing intriguing insights into the nature of linguistic diversity and distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have been prevalent in particle physics for over three decades, shaping many aspects of High Energy Physics (HEP) analyses. As AI's influence grows, it is essential for physicists $\unicode{x2013}$ as both researchers and informed citizens $\unicode{x2013}$ to critically examine its foundations, misconceptions, and impact. This paper explores AI definitions, examines how ML differs from traditional programming, and provides a brief review of AI/ML applications in HEP, highlighting promising trends such as Simulation-Based Inference, uncertainty-aware machine learning, and Fast ML for anomaly detection. Beyond physics, it also addresses the broader societal harms of AI systems, underscoring the need for responsible engagement. Finally, it stresses the importance of adapting research practices to an evolving AI landscape, ensuring that physicists not only benefit from the latest tools but also remain at the forefront of innovation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From science to industry, teamwork plays a crucial role in knowledge production and innovation. Most studies consider teams as static groups of individuals, thereby failing to capture how the micro-dynamics of collaborative processes and organizational changes determine team success. Here, we leverage fine-grained temporal data on software development teams from three software ecosystems -- Rust, JavaScript, and Python -- to gain insights into the dynamics of online collaborative projects. Our analysis reveals an uneven workload distribution in teams, with stronger heterogeneity correlated with higher success, and the early emergence of a lead developer carrying out the majority of work. Moreover, we find that a sizeable fraction of projects experience a change of lead developer, with such a transition being more likely in projects led by inexperienced users. Finally, we show that leadership change is associated with faster success growth. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the link between team evolution and success in collaborative processes.</description>

      <title>Exploring Citation Diversity in Scholarly Literature: An Entropy-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the citation diversity in scholarly literature, analyzing different patterns of citations observed within different countries and academic disciplines. We examine citation distributions across top institutions within certain countries and find that the higher end of the distribution follows a Power Law or Pareto Law pattern; the scaling exponent of the Pareto Law varies depending on the number of top institutions included in the analysis. By adopting a novel entropy-based diversity measure, our findings reveal that countries with both small and large economies tend to cluster similarly in terms of citation diversity. The composition of countries within each group changes as the number of top institutions considered in the analysis varies. Moreover, we analyze citation diversity among award-winning scientists across six scientific disciplines, finding significant variations. We also explore the evolution of citation diversity over the past century across multiple fields. A gender-based study in several disciplines confirms varying citation diversities among male and female scientists. Our innovative citation diversity measure stands out as a valuable tool for assessing the unevenness of citation distributions, providing deeper insights that go beyond what traditional citation counts alone can reveal. This comprehensive analysis enhances our understanding of global scientific contributions and fosters a more equitable view of academic achievements.</description>

      <title>CosForce: A Force-Based General Pedestrian Model with Anticipation and Reaction Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we developed a force-based general pedestrian model named CosForce. To the best of our knowledge, this may represent the simplest version of the force-based method. The model employs cosine functions to characterize asymmetric interactions, implicitly incorporating anticipation and reaction mechanisms. By focusing on binary interactions, the CosForce model provides new insights into pedestrian modeling while achieving linear computational complexity. Two specific scenarios in crowd dynamics were analyzed: self-organization (entropy decrease) and crowd collapse (entropy increase). The average normalized speed and order parameter were introduced to quantitatively describe the processes of crowd dynamics. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that phase separation in crowds is effectively reproduced by the model, including lane formation, stripe formation, and cross-channel formation. Next, in the simulation of mass gathering, within a density-accumulating scenario, processes of critical phase transition in high-density crowds are clearly revealed through time series observations of the order parameter. These findings provide valuable insights into crowd dynamics.</description>

      <title>Variable Goal Approach (VGA) Enhancing Pedestrian Dynamics Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pedestrian dynamics models have provided valuable insights into pedestrian interactions, collision avoidance, and self-organized crowd behavior using mathematical, computational, AI-based, and heuristic approaches. However, existing models often fail to capture fundamental aspects of human decision-making, particularly the tendency to adopt indirect routes by sequentially selecting intermediate goals within the line of sight. In this study, we propose a novel Variable Goal Approach (VGA) that integrates human intelligence into pedestrian dynamics models by introducing multiple intermediate goals, termed variable goals, which guide pedestrians toward their final destination. These variable goals function as an adaptive guidance mechanism, enabling smoother transitions and dynamic navigation. VGA also enhances the efficiency of a model while minimizing interactions and disruptions. By strategically positioning variable goals, VGA introduces an element of stochasticity. This allows the model to simulate varied pedestrian paths under identical conditions, reflecting the diversity in human decision-making. In addition to its effectiveness in simple scenarios, VGA demonstrates strong performance in replicating high-density scenarios, such as lane formation, providing results that closely match real-world data.</description>

      <title>Modeling biases in binary decision-making within the generalized nonlinear q-voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective decision-making is a process by which a group of individuals determines a shared outcome that shapes societal dynamics; from innovation diffusion to organizational choices. A common approach to model these processes is using binary dynamics, where the choices are reduced to two alternatives. One of the most popular models in this context is the $q$-voter model, which assumes that opinion changes are driven by peer pressure from a unanimous group. However, real-world decisions are also shaped by prior personal choices and external influences, such as mass media, which introduce biases that can favor certain options over others. To address this, we propose a generalized $q$-voter model that incorporates these biases. In our model, when the influence group is not unanimous, the probability that an individual changes its opinion depends on its current state, breaking the symmetry between opinions. In limiting cases, our model recovers both the original $q$-voter model and several recently introduced modifications of the $q$-voter model, while extending the framework to capture a broader range of scenarios. We analyze the model on a complete graph using analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations. Our results highlight two key findings: (1) for larger influence groups ($q&gt;3$), a phase emerges where both adopted and partially adopted states coexist, (2) in small systems, greater initial support for an opinion does not necessarily increase its likelihood of widespread adoption, as reflected in the unique form of the exit probability. These results point to one of the key issues in social science, the importance of group size in collective action.</description>

      <title>IPSR Model: Misinformation Intervention through Prebunking in Social Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present digital world, the rapid spread of misinformation is not just an annoyance but a real threat to public safety, and our collective decision-making. Prebunking, a type of psychological immunization, can educate people about misinformation and lay a foundation of cognitive resilience that makes them more robust against future misinformation. We use a compartmental modeling approach inspired by vaccination models from epidemiology to model the effectiveness of prebunking misinformation. Populations are classified into different compartments based on the exposure to prebunking and the propagation of misinformation through online social networks. Specific rates dictate the transitions between such states, similar to how people traverse between susceptible, infected, and recovered compartments in classical epidemiological models. This model integrates different levels of prebunking potency, the fraction of the population prebunked initially, and the forgetting rate effects. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work which study the extent of prebunking interventions to reduce the scale of misinformation, much as vaccinations curtail the spread of infectious diseases.</description>

      <title>Detection of an extraterrestrial technical civilisation on the extrasolar planet GJ 1132b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of whisky in the atmosphere of the extrasolar super-Earth planet GJ 1132b from transmission spectroscopic data. It is seen both in atmospheric absorption as well as in chromospheric emission, the latter probably due to the intense heating of the co-rotating planet's day-side surface. This detection cannot be explained using natural sources of alcohol, implying that there must be a technically advanced civilisation -- possibly originating from the neighboring habitable planet GJ 1132c -- that is engaged in massive distilling operations accompanied by high levels of industrial pollution. The reason for the necessarily vast scale of production is either to produce rocket fuel for an interplanetary economy or, more likely, for an unusually high level of personal consumption. The latter hypothesis suggests a novel explanation for the Fermi Paradox (the lack of indirect or direct contact with extraterrestrials): a technically versed civilisation would be incapable of achieving the higher technical levels necessary for the development of a detectable radio signature -- much less interstellar travel -- at the suggested rates of consumption.</description>
