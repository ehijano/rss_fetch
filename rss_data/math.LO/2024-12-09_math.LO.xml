      <title>Approximate Completeness of Hypersequent Calculus for First-Order {\L}ukasiewicz Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypersequent calculus G{\L}$\forall$ for first-order {\L}ukasiewicz logic was first introduced by Baaz and Metcalfe, along with a proof of its approximate completeness with respect to standard $[0,1]$-semantics. The completeness result was later pointed out by Gerasimov that it only applies to prenex formulas. In this paper, we will present our proof of approximate completeness of G{\L}$\forall$ for arbitrary first-order formulas by generalizing the original completeness proof to hypersequents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1506.04162v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bounded automorphism of a field or a group with trivial approximate centre is definable. In an expansion of a field by a Pfaffian family F of additive endomorphisms such that algebraic closure in the expansion coincides with relative field-algebraic closure of the F-substructure generated, a bounded endomorphism, possibly composed with a power of the Frobenius, is a composition of endomorphisms associated with F.</description>

      <title>Open questions about Ramsey-type statements in reverse mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:1506.04780v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ramsey's theorem states that for any coloring of the n-element subsets of N with finitely many colors, there is an infinite set H such that all n-element subsets of H have the same color. The strength of consequences of Ramsey's theorem has been extensively studied in reverse mathematics and under various reducibilities, namely, computable reducibility and uniform reducibility. Our understanding of the combinatorics of Ramsey's theorem and its consequences has been greatly improved over the past decades. In this paper, we state some questions which naturally arose during this study. The inability to answer those questions reveals some gaps in our understanding of the combinatorics of Ramsey's theorem.</description>

      <title>More about the cofinality and the covering of the ideal of strong measure zero sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve the previous work of Yorioka and the first author about the combinatorics of the ideal $\mathcal{SN}$ of strong measure zero sets of reals. We refine the notions of dominating systems of the first author and introduce the new combinatorial principle $\mathrm{DS}(\delta)$ that helps to find simple conditions to deduce $\mathfrak{d}_\kappa \leq \mathrm{cof}(\mathcal{SN})$ (where $\mathfrak{d}_\kappa$ is the dominating number on $\kappa^\kappa$). In addition, we find a new upper bound of $\mathrm{cof}(\mathcal{SN})$ by using products of relational systems and cardinal characteristics associated with Yorioka ideals. In addition, we dissect and generalize results from Pawlikowski to force upper bounds of the covering of $\mathcal{SN}$, particularly for finite support iterations of precaliber posets.
  Finally, as applications of our main theorems, we prove consistency results about the cardinal characteristics associated with $\mathcal{SN}$ and the principle $\mathrm{DS}(\delta)$. For example, we show that $\mathrm{cov}(\mathcal{SN})&lt;\mathrm{non}(\mathcal{SN})=\mathfrak{c}&lt;\mathrm{cof}(\mathcal{SN})$ holds in Cohen model, and we refine a result (and the proof) of the first author about the consistency of $\mathrm{cov}(\mathcal{SN})&lt;\mathrm{non}(\mathcal{SN})&lt;\mathrm{cof}(\mathcal{SN})$, with $\mathfrak{c}$ in any desired position with respect to $\mathrm{cof}(\mathcal{SN})$, and the improvement that $\mathrm{non}(\mathcal{SN})$ can be singular here.</description>

      <title>Equational theories of idempotent semifields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides answers to several open problems about equational theories of idempotent semifields. In particular, it is proved that (i) no equational theory of a non-trivial class of idempotent semifields has a finite basis; (ii) there are continuum-many equational theories of classes of idempotent semifields; and (iii) the equational theory of the class of idempotent semifields is co-NP-complete.</description>

      <title>On Halin's end-degree Conjecture and $\omega$-strong cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new instances of \emph{Halin's end degree conjecture} within $\mathrm{ZFC}$. In particular, we prove that there is a proper class of cardinals $\kappa$ for which Haliln's end-degree conjecture holds. This answers two questions posed by Geschke, Kurkofka, Melcher and Pitz in 2023. Furthermore, we comment on the relationship between Halin's conjecture and the \emph{Singular Cardinal Hypothesis}, deriving consistency strength from failures of the former. We also show that Halin's conjecture fails on finite intervals of successors of singular cardinals in Meremovich's model.</description>

      <title>Primitive permutation groups of finite Morley rank and affine type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a review of one of the lines in development of the theory of groups of finite Morley rank. These groups naturally appear in model theory as model-theoretic analogues of Galois groups, therefore their actions and their role as permutation groups is of primary interest. We restrict our story to the study of connected groups of finite Morley rank $G$ acting in a definably primitive way on a set $X$ and containing a definable abelian normal subgroup $V$ which acts on $X$ regularly -- the so-called \emph{primitive groups of affine type}. For reasons explained in the paper, this case plays a central role in the theory.</description>
