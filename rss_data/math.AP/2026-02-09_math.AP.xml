      <title>Transmission Eigenvalues and Non-scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we survey some recent results concerning scattering and non-scattering in the context of the linear Helmholtz equation and inhomogeneities of nontrivial contrast. We examine isotropic as well as anisotropic media. Part of the survey deals with the so-called transmission spectrum, namely those wave numbers at which non-scattering potentially may occur. For wave numbers that are not transmission eigenvalues any incident wave leads to scattering, however, being at a transmission eigenvalue is far from su!cient to guarantee the occurence of non-scattering for even a single incident wave. For instance the inhomogeneity generically has to be smooth for non-scattering to occur. Similarly many smooth geometric shapes will be scattering for natural incident waves even at a transmission eigenvalue. Part of the survey discusses recent results of that nature.</description>

      <title>Global weak solutions with higher regularity to the two-dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes and magnetohydrodynamic equations with far-field vacuum and unbounded density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the global existence of a class of weak solutions to the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations on the whole plane under a suitably small initial energy. The solutions constructed here admit far-field vacuum and unbounded densities. Moreover, they possess an intermediate regularity regime between the finite-energy weak solutions of Lions-Feireisl and the framework of Hoff. This particularly extends our previous half-plane case with Dirichlet boundary conditions (arXiv:2601.11852) to the whole-plane MHD coupling, and we also generalize the works of Hoff (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 55 (2002), pp. 1365-1407) and Suen and Hoff (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 205 (2012), pp. 27-58) by allowing vacuum states and unbounded density. Our analysis lies in a new perspective that exploits the spatial integrability of the density and the resulting integrability of the pressure, together with the specific structure of the MHD system.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform Continuity for the MHD equations with only Magnetic Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the non-uniform continuity of the data-to-solution map for the incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations with only magnetic diffusion in Sobolev spaces $H^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for all $s&gt;0$ and $d=2,3$. Our results are first studies on the non-uniform continuity of the data-to-solution map for the resistive MHD equations. Moreover, our results permit the solution perturbation around an arbitrary constant background magnetic fields $\mathbf{B_0} \in \mathbb{R}^d$, which reveal that the strong magnetic background fields may provide the stabilization effect but still preserve the analytical feature of non-uniform continuity of the data-to-solution map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for general $n\geq2$, we classify solutions to $n$-Laplacian Liouville equation with positive nonlinear Neumann boundary condition on the half-space $\mathbb{R}^{n}_{+}$. Under the positive nonlinear Neumann boundary condition, our result extend the classification result for the second order Liouville equation in \cite{Li} from $n=2$ to general $n\geq2$, and also extend the classification result for critical $p$-Laplacian equation in \cite{Zhou} from $p&lt;n$ to $p=n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the study of semilinear fractional diffusion-wave equations in the context of critical nonlinearities. Firstly, we address the issue of local well-posedness for the problem, examine spatial regularity, and the continuous dependence of the solutions on initial data. Secondly, we establish the existence of global mild solutions and investigate their asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Extremal Alexandrov estimates: singularities, obstacles, and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Alexandrov estimate controls the oscillation of a convex function by the mass of its associated Monge-Amp\`ere measure and yields, for two convex functions of $n$ variables with the same boundary values, a sup-norm bound with exponent $1/n$ in the measure discrepancy. We show that this exponent is not optimal in the small-discrepancy regime once one of the functions is non-degenerate in the sense of having Monge-Amp\`ere density bounded above and below by two positive constants.
  We prove sharp quantitative estimates comparing two convex functions by the total variation of the difference of their Monge-Amp\`ere measures: in dimensions $n\ge 3$ the optimal dependence is quadratic in the natural mass scale, while in dimension $n=2$ the optimal dependence contains a logarithmic correction. These rates are shown to be optimal for all small discrepancies.
  A key structural ingredient is a characterization of extremizers. We identify the pointwise minimizers and maximizers in the admissible class and prove that they are realized, respectively, by solutions to Monge-Amp\`ere equations with an isolated singularity and by solutions to Monge-Amp\`ere equations with a linear obstacle. This extremal description reduces the sharp estimates to a precise asymptotic analysis of these two model configurations.
  Assuming further that the domain and the non-degenerate reference function are $C^{2,\alpha}$ and uniformly convex, we obtain sharp pointwise two-sided asymptotics at interior points with explicit leading constants. Finally, in dimensions $n\ge 3$ we establish a stability phenomenon: if the pointwise estimate is nearly saturated, then the measure discrepancy must concentrate near the point at the natural scale, quantifying rigidity of almost-extremal configurations.</description>

      <title>Sharp global Alexandrov estimates and entire solutions of Monge-Amp\`ere equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper continues our work [19] on sharp Alexandrov estimates. We obtain a sharp global uniform distance estimate from a convex function to the class of unimodular convex quadratic polynomials in terms of the total variation of its Monge-Amp\`ere defect measure relative to Lebesgue measure. The estimate has an explicit optimal constant, and the inequality is strict in the regime of positive finite defect mass. In this regime we further prove asymptotic rigidity at infinity: every such convex function admits a unique quadratic asymptote with an explicit convergence rate, and satisfies a sharp affine invariant global Alexandrov estimate with equality if and only if the function solves the isolated singularity problem or the hyperplane obstacle problem. Standard subsolution methods are not well suited to this measure-theoretic setting and typically do not yield sharp constants, while the sharp Alexandrov estimates developed in our earlier work [19] play a central role here.
  As an application, for entire solutions of Monge-Amp\`ere equations with multiple (possibly infinitely many) isolated singularities, we give an explicit quantitative mass-separation condition ensuring strict convexity and hence smoothness away from the set of the isolated singularities.</description>

      <title>The Fractional-Logarithmic Laplacian:Fundamental Properties and Eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the fractional--logarithmic Laplacian \( (-\Delta)^{s+\log} \), defined as the derivative of the fractional Laplacian \( (-\Delta)^t \) at \( t=s \). It is a singular integral operator with Fourier symbol \( |\xi|^{2s}(2\ln|\xi|) \), and we prove the pointwise integral representation \[ (-\Delta)^{s+\log}u(x) = c_{n,s}\,\mathrm{PV}\!\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \frac{u(x)-u(y)}{|x-y|^{n+2s}}\bigl(-2\ln|x-y|\bigr)\,dy + b_{n,s}(-\Delta)^s u(x), \] where \( c_{n,s} \) is the normalization constant of the fractional Laplacian and \( b_{n,s}:=\frac{d}{ds}c_{n,s}.\) We also establish several equivalent formulations of \( (-\Delta)^{s+\log} \), including the singular-integral representation, the Fourier-multiplier representation, the spectral-calculus definition, and an extension characterization.
  We develop the associated functional framework on both \( \mathbb{R}^n \) and bounded Lipschitz domains, introducing the natural energy spaces and proving embedding results. In particular, we obtain a compact embedding at the critical exponent \( 2_s^*=\frac{2n}{n-2s},\) a phenomenon that differs from the classical Sobolev and fractional Sobolev settings. We further study the Poisson problem, proving existence and \( L^\infty \)-regularity results. We then investigate the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem and establish qualitative spectral properties. Finally, we derive a Weyl-type asymptotic law for the eigenvalue counting function and for the \( k \)-th Dirichlet eigenvalue, showing that the high-frequency behavior combines the fractional Weyl scaling with a logarithmic growth factor, thereby interpolating between the fractional Laplacian and the logarithmic Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Regularity properties of energy densities on the Sierpinski gasket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the regularity properties of energy densities associated with harmonic functions on the Sierpinski gasket with respect to the Kusuoka measure. While energy measures themselves have been extensively studied in the framework of analysis on fractals, the fine pointwise behavior of their densities has remained less well understood. We prove that the density of the energy measure of a nonconstant harmonic function is almost everywhere discontinuous, whereas it is H\"older continuous when restricted to each one-dimensional edge of the gasket.</description>

      <title>Sharp Sobolev inequalities on noncompact Riemannian manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth, complete Riemannian manifold $M$ with bounded Ricci curvature and positive injectivity radius, we derive a sharp Sobolev inequality for the embedding of $W^{1,p}(M)$ into $L^{\frac{np}{n-p}}(M)$, when $1\le p&lt; n$. We will first reduce the inequality to functions having support with small enough volume. In turn, we will show that the inequality for small volumes is implied by a first order uniform asymptotic expansion of the isoperimetric profile for $M$, for small volumes. We will then show that such an expansion follows from a local, uniform Sobolev inequality for functions in $W^{1,1}$, having support with small enough diameter.</description>

      <title>Radially symmetric transition-layer solutions in mass-conserving reaction-diffusion systems with bistable nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass-conserving reaction-diffusion (MCRD) systems are widely used to model phase separation and pattern formation in cell polarity, biomolecular condensates, and ecological systems. Numerical simulations and formal asymptotic analysis suggest that such models can support stationary patterns with sharp internal interfaces. In this work, we establish for a general class of bistable MCRD systems the existence of nonconstant radially symmetric stationary solutions with a single internal transition layer on an $N$-dimensional ball, for general spatial dimension $N$. Our approach incorporates the global mass constraint directly into a refined matched-asymptotic framework complemented by a uniform spectral/linear analysis. Beyond mere existence, our framework yields arbitrarily high-order asymptotic approximations of the constructed solutions together with quantitative uniform error estimates, which provides a quantitative higher-dimensional theory of transition-layer patterns in MCRD systems and a rigorous justification for their use in modeling phase separation and pattern formation in biological and ecological settings.</description>

      <title>Sharp threshold dynamics for a bistable age-structured population model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the long-term dynamics of solutions to the Gurtin-MacCamy population model with a bistable birth function. We consider a one-parameter monotone family of initial distributions for the population such that for small values of the parameter, the corresponding population density gets extinct as time passes, whereas for large values of them, the solutions exhibit a different behavior. We are interested in the intermediate set of values for the parameters, which are called threshold parameters. We prove the existence of a sharp transition between these two asymptotic dynamics; that is, there exists exactly one threshold value when the age-dependent birth rate of the population has compact support, utilizing the theory of monotone dynamical systems. The case when the birth rate is non-compactly supported is more intricate to deal with, as has been observed in several works, even if the nonlinear birth function is monostable. Nevertheless, the approach used in the present work turns out to be effective to handle a particular birth rate with noncompact support by translating the dynamics of the age-structured model into an integro-differential system.</description>

      <title>An elementary approach to the pressureless Euler-Navier-Stokes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pressureless Euler-Navier-Stokes system can be obtained formally from the Vlasov-Navier-Stokes system, under the assumption that the distribution function describing the density of particles is monokinetic. Its study has been the subject of several recent papers, which have established the global existence of solutions with high enough regularity, for small initial data. In this work, we demonstrate the global existence of strong solutions in the whole space case, without assuming the initial density to be small and regular: it suffices for it to be bounded and for the total mass to be finite. In passing, we obtain optimal decay estimates for the energy and dissipation functionals. As a corollary, we get a long-time description of the density. All these results are based on an elementary energy method, with no need of sophisticated Fourier analysis tools.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the partial differential equation on the circle that was heuristically obtained by Steinerberg [32] on the real line and which represents the evolution of the density of the roots of polynomials under differentiation. After integrating the partial differential equation in question, we observe that it can be treated with the theory of viscosity solutions. This equation at hand is a non linear parabolic integro-differential equation which involves the elliptic operator called the half-Laplacian. Due to the singularity of the equation, we restrict our study to strictly positive initial condition. We obtain a comparison principle for solutions of the primitive equation which yields uniqueness, existence, continuity with respect to initial condition. We also present heuristics to justify that the system of particles indeed approximates the solution of the equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nearest neighbor, Lagrangian particle discretization of the one dimensional porous medium equation. We prove that the particle model satisfies a discrete analog of the celebrated Aronson-B\'enilan estimate, which we use to prove a growth estimate for the evolution of the support and an $L^\infty$ decay estimate which are both known to hold in the continuum. These estimates are uniform with respect to the number of particles. We also prove convergence of the scheme towards the solution to the porous medium equation in the full generality of $L^1$ initial data.</description>

      <title>A global stability result for incompressible magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a result of global stability for the equations of homogeneous, incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on a torus of any dimension $d \in \{2,3,...\}$, with positive viscosity and resistivity. This result applies to the $C^\infty$ global solutions, with a conveniently defined decay property for large times; it is expressed by fully explicit estimates, formulated via $H^p$-type Sobolev norms of arbitrarily high order $p$. The present stability result is similar to that proposed by one of us for the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation \cite{glosta}; it is derived from a suitable formulation of the MHD equations proposed in our previous work \cite{MHD}, emphasizing strong structural analogies with the NS case. A basic tool in the proof of the present stability result is a general theory of approximate solutions of the MHD Cauchy problem, that we developed in \cite{MHD} on the grounds of previous results on the NS equation \cite{smooth} and of the above structural similarities. We also introduce a class of Beltrami-type initial data for the MHD equations; although being arbitrarily large, these data produce global and decaying MHD solutions, fitting the framework of the present stability result. Comparisons with the previous literature on these subjects are performed.</description>

      <title>Shielding of breathers for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16696v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a deterministic gas of breathers for the Focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. The gas of breathers is obtained from a $N$-breather solution in the limit $N\to \infty$.\\ The limit is performed at the level of scattering data by letting the $N$-breather spectrum to fill uniformly a suitable compact domain of the complex plane in the limit $N\to\infty$. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function and scaled as $1/N$. For particular choices of the domain and the interpolating function, the gas of breathers behaves as finite breathers solution. This extends the shielding effect discovered in "M. Bertola, T. Grava, and G. Orsatti - Physical Review Letters, 130.12 (2023): 1" for a soliton gas also to a breather gas.</description>

      <title>The modulated Fourier expansion for waves propagating through time-modulated media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling waves by actively changing the material parameters of a medium enables the development of new acoustic and electrical devices. Modulating the material breaks classical properties like reciprocity and the conservation of energy, which complicates the mathematical analysis. Without a limiting amplitude principle, time-harmonic formulations are generally inapplicable. The present manuscript develops an alternative tool for the time-modulated acoustic wave equation, that is based on a modulated Fourier expansion (MFE). The solution is characterized by multiple smoothly varying coefficient functions, which solve a coupled system of evolutionary partial differential equations with temporally constant coefficients. For small-amplitude fast-time modulations, this system of evolutionary partial differential equations is shown to possess a smoothly varying solution, which characterizes the exact solution up to a small defect.
  Discretization of the derived coupled system yields integrators that are stable and accurate when larger time steps are used, compared to those schemes that are applied to the time-modulated acoustic wave equation directly. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results and the use of the approach.</description>

      <title>On large-scale oceanic wind-drift currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the Navier--Stokes equations in rotating spherical coordinates with constant density and eddy viscosity varying only with depth, and appropriate, physically motivated boundary conditions, we derive an asymptotic model for the description of non-equatorial wind-generated oceanic drift currents. We do not invoke any tangent-plane approximations, thus allowing for large-scale flows that would not be captured by the classical $f$-plane approach. The strategy is to identify two small intrinsic scales for the flow (namely, the ratio between the depth of the Ekman layer and the Earth's radius, and the Rossby number) and, after a careful scaling, perform a double asymptotic expansion with respect to these small parameters. This leads to a system of linear ordinary differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions for the leading-order dynamics, in addition to which we identify the governing equations for the first-order correction with respect to the Rossby number. First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the leading-order equations and show that the solution behaves like a classical Ekman spiral for any eddy viscosity profile; moreover, we discuss the solution of the equations for the first-order correction, for which we also provide a priori bounds in terms of the leading-order solution. Finally, we discuss several cases of explicit eddy viscosity profiles (constant, linearly decreasing, linearly increasing, piecewise linear, and exponentially decaying) and compute the surface deflection angle of the wind-drift current. We obtain results that are remarkably consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Dynamics of Conformable Semigroups via Classical Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformable derivatives involve a fractional parameter while preserving locality: on smooth functions they reduce to a classical derivative multiplied by an explicit weight. Exploiting this structural feature, we show that conformable time evolution does not give rise to a genuinely new semigroup theory. Rather, it can be fully interpreted as a classical $C_0$--semigroup observed through a nonlinear change of time. For $\delta\in(0,1]$, we introduce the conformable clock \[ \Psi(t)=\frac{t^\delta}{\delta}, \] and prove that every $C_0$--$\delta$--semigroup $\mathcal S_\delta$ admits the representation \[ \mathcal S_\delta(t)=\mathcal T(\Psi(t)), \] where $\mathcal T$ is a uniquely determined classical $C_0$--semigroup on the same state space. This correspondence is exact at the infinitesimal level: the $\delta$--generator of $\mathcal S_\delta$ coincides with the generator of $\mathcal T$ on a common domain, and conformable mild solutions are in one-to-one correspondence with classical mild solutions under the reparametrization $s=\Psi(t)$. In particular, orbit sets are unchanged by the conformable clock, so orbit-based linear dynamical properties are invariant; $\delta$--hypercyclicity and $\delta$--chaos coincide with their classical counterparts. As an application, we derive a conformable version of the Desch--Schappacher--Webb chaos criterion by transporting the classical result. The analysis is carried out in conformable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p,\delta}$, which are shown to be isometrically equivalent to standard $L^p$ spaces, allowing a direct transfer of estimates and spectral arguments. Altogether, the results clarify which dynamical features of conformable models are intrinsic and which arise solely from a nonlinear change of time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce new function spaces $\mathcal{L}_{W,s}^{q,p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ that yield a natural reformulation of the $\ell^{q}L^{p}$ decoupling inequalities for the sphere and the light cone. These spaces are invariant under the Euclidean half-wave propagators, but not under all Fourier integral operators unless $p=q$, in which case they coincide with the Hardy spaces for Fourier integral operators. We use these spaces to obtain improvements of the classical fractional integration theorem and local smoothing estimates.</description>

Abstract: We present a stability result for ground states of a Schr\"odinger-Poisson system in $(2+1)$ dimension, modelling the propagation of a light beam through a liquid crystal with nonlocal nonlinear response. The core of the proof is a coercivity bound on the second derivative of the action, where non scaling nonlinearities and the coupled system present the major difficulties. In addition we prove existence of a ground state with frequency $\sigma$ for any $\sigma \in (0,1)$ as a minimal point over an appropriate Nehari manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a construction proposed in \cite{acharyaQAM} that builds on the notion of weak solutions for incompressible fluids to provide a scheme that generates variationally a certain type of dual solutions. If these dual solutions are regular enough one can use them to recover standard solutions. The scheme provides a generalisation of a construction of Y.Brenier for the Euler equations. We rigorously analyze the scheme, extending the work of Y.Brenier for Euler, and also provide an extension of it to the case of the Navier-Stokes equations. Furthermore we obtain the inviscid limit of Navier-Stokes to Euler as a $\Gamma$-limit.</description>

Abstract: We prove new lossless Strichartz and spectral projection estimates on asymptotically hyperbolic surfaces, and, in particular, on all convex cocompact hyperbolic surfaces. In order to do this, we also obtain log-scale lossless Strichartz and spectral projection estimates on manifolds of uniformly bounded geometry with nonpositive and negative sectional curvatures, extending the recent works of the first two authors for compact manifolds. We are able to use these along with known $L^2$-local smoothing and new $L^2 \to L^q$ half-localized resolvent estimates to obtain our lossless bounds.</description>

      <title>A new approach for the unitary Dyson Brownian motion through the theory of viscosity solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the unitary Dyson Brownian motion through a partial differential equation approach recently introduced for the real Dyson case. The main difference with the real Dyson case is that the spectrum is now on the circle and not on the real line, which leads to particular attention to comparison principles. First we recall why the system of particles which are the eigenvalues of unitary Dyson Brownian motion is well posed thanks to a containment function. Then we proved that the primitive of the limit spectral measure of the unitary Dyson Brownian motion is the unique solution to a viscosity equation obtained by primitive the Dyson equation on the circle. Finally, we study some properties of solutions of Dyson's equation on the circle. We prove a L $\infty$ regularization. We also look at the long time behaviour in law of a solution through a study of the so-called free entropy of the system. We conclude by discussing the uniform convergence towards the uniform measure on the circle of a solution of the Dyson equation.</description>

The results extend and refine previous considerations for anisotropic total variations and area-type cases, and they pave the way for a variational approach to the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations, which involve the signed measure as right-hand-side datum.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Numerical Approximation of a Class of Nonlocal Elliptic Equations with Gaussian Kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the mathematical properties and numerical approximation of a class of nonlocal elliptic partial differential equations of the form \begin{equation*} -\Delta u + \lambda \, G(u) = f, \end{equation*} where $\Delta$ denotes the Laplacian, $\lambda &gt; 0$ is a regularization parameter, and $G$ is a nonlocal operator defined by integral convolution with a kernel $K$. We establish the well-posedness of the problem in the Sobolev space $H_0^1(\Omega)$ using the Lax--Milgram theorem, providing rigorous proofs for the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of the weak solution under standard assumptions on the kernel $K$ and the source term $f \in L^2(\Omega)$. For the numerical treatment, we employ a finite difference discretization for the Laplacian and a Gaussian-based approximation for the nonlocal term. We analyze a fixed-point iterative scheme for solving the discrete system and derive explicit conditions for its convergence and stability. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, demonstrating the monotonic decay of the residual and the robustness of the approximation scheme on bounded domains with various padding strategies.</description>

Abstract: Non-cooperative Fisher-KPP systems with space-time periodic coefficients are motivated for instance by models for structured populations evolving in periodic environments. This paper is concerned with entire solutions describing the invasion of open space by a persistent population at constant speed. These solutions are important in the understanding of long-time behaviors for the Cauchy problem. Adapting methods developed for scalar equations satisfying the comparison principle as well as methods developed for systems with homogeneous coefficients, we prove, in each spatial direction, the existence of a critical speed such that: there exists no almost planar generalized transition waves with a smaller speed; if the direction is rational, each rational speed not smaller than the critical speed is the speed of a planar pulsating traveling wave with time and transverse space periodicity; if the coefficients are homogeneous in space, each speed not smaller than the critical speed is the speed of a planar pulsating traveling wave with time periodicity.</description>

Abstract: The goal of these expository notes is to give an introduction to random matrices for non-specialist of this topic focusing on the link between random matrices and systems of particles in interaction. We first recall some general results about the random matrix theory that create a link between random matrices and systems of particles through the knowledge of the law of the eigenvalues of certain random matrices models. We next focus on a continuous in time approach of random matrices called the Dyson Brownian motion. We detail some general methods to study the existence of system of particles in singular interaction and the existence of a mean field limit for these systems of particles. Finally, we present the main result of large deviations when studying the eigenvalues of random matrices. This method is based on the fact that the eigenvalues of certain models of random matrices can be viewed as log gases in dimension 1 or 2.</description>

      <title>Lowest eigenvalues and formally self-adjoint fourth order elliptic differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a closed, smooth Riemannian manifold of dimension $m \geq 1$. It is not difficult to produce an example of a fourth order formally self-adjoint elliptic differential operator $P: C^4(M) \rightarrow C^0(M)$ that has the property that there exists a sign-changing eigenfunction that is associated with the lowest eigenvalue. Indeed, $\Delta_g^2 + \lambda_2 \Delta_g$ does the job, where $\Delta_g :=div_g \nabla_g$. and where $\lambda_2$ is the second lowest eigenvalue of the operator $-\Delta_g$. The question that remains is how rare are formally self-adjoint elliptic differential operators whose lowest eigenvalue has this property. In this paper, the author proves that elliptic operators of the form $\Delta_g^2 - div_g(T-\lambda_2 g^{-1})d$, where $T$ is a smooth, symmetric, negative semi-definite $(2,0)$-tensor field on $M$, and where $g^{-1}$ is the inverse metric tensor, have the property that there exists a sign-changing eigenfunction that is associated with the lowest eigenvalue of the operator. This suggests that there exists a lot of formally self-adjoint fourth order elliptic operators with the property that there exists a sign-changing eigenfunction that is associated with the lowest eigenvalue of the operator.</description>

Abstract: Using a discrete Bakry-{\'E}mery method based on the JKO scheme, relying on the dissipation of entropy and Fisher information along a discrete flow, we establish new generalized logarithmic Sobolev inequality for log-concave measures of the form $e^{-V}$ under strict convexity assumptions on $V$ . We then show how this method recovers some well-known inequalities. This approach can be viewed as interpolating between the Bakry-{\'E}mery method and optimal transport techniques based on geodesic convexity.</description>

      <title>Global regularity of the multi-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system with large initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we establish the global existence of strong solutions to the 2D and 3D compressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system with arbitrarily large initial data on the torus. This system was derived by Dunn and Serrin [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 88(2):95-133, 1985] and is widely used to model capillarity in compressible fluids. Via an original modified Nash-Moser type iteration, we establish a critical novel estimate linking the effective velocity and the lower bound of the density, which plays a crucial role in deriving the positive lower bound of the density. To our knowledge, this can be viewed as the first existence result of global strong solutions for the compressible fluid dynamics equations with physical significance in general three-dimensional domains with arbitrarily large initial data.</description>

      <title>Instability of solutions in a degenerate reaction diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectral stability of travelling and stationary front and pulse solutions in a class of degenerate reaction-diffusion systems. We characterise the essential spectrum of the linearised operator in full generality and identify conditions under which it lies entirely in the left-half plane. For a number of special cases we obtain analytical results, including explicit Evans functions, and complete spectral descriptions for certain stationary waves. In regimes where analytical methods are not available, we compute the point spectrum numerically using a Riccati-Evans function approach. Our results show that stable travelling fronts can occur, while travelling pulses are typically unstable.</description>

      <title>Renormalization flow for the 2D nonlinear stochastic heat equation: pointwise statistics and universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional stochastic heat equation with noise correlated at scale $\rho \ll 1$ and of strength $|\log\rho|^{-1/2}\sigma(v)$ depending nonlinearly on the solution $v$. Under certain conditions, the first author and Gu have shown that the one-point statistics of $v$ converge in law as $\rho\to 0$ to the terminal value of an associated forward-backward SDE. Here, we show that the 2D stochastic heat equation is stable under renormalization with a new effective nonlinearity tied to the decoupling function of the forward-backward SDE. This allows us to extend the pointwise results to a much broader class of nonlinearities. We also show that these limiting pointwise statistics are insensitive to the fine details of the noise, and thus universal.</description>

      <title>First Eigenvalue of Jacobi operator and Rigidity Results for Constant Mean Curvature Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain geometric upper bounds for the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1(J)$ of the Jacobi operator for both closed and compact with boundary hypersurfaces having constant mean curvature (CMC). As an application, we derive new rigidity results for the area of CMC hypersurfaces under suitable conditions on $\lambda_1(J)$ and the curvature of the ambient space. We also address the Jacobi--Steklov problem, proving geometric upper bounds for its first eigenvalue $\sigma_1(J)$ and deriving rigidity results related to the length of the boundary. Additionally, we present some results in higher dimensions related to the Yamabe invariants.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for resolutions and smoothings of Calabi-Yau conifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Calabi-Yau metrics with isolated conical singularities of Hein-Sun admit polyhomogeneous expansions near their singularities. Moreover, we show that, under certain generic assumptions, natural families of smooth Calabi-Yau metrics on crepant resolutions and on polarized smoothings of conical Calabi-Yau manifolds degenerating to the initial conical Calabi-Yau metric admit polyhomogeneous expansions where the singularities are forming. The construction proceeds by performing weighted Melrose-type blow-ups and then gluing conical and scaled asymptotically conical Calabi-Yau metrics on the fibers, close to the blow-up's front face without compromising polyhomogeneity. This yields a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics that are approximately Calabi-Yau. Solving formally a complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation, we obtain a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics with Ricci potential converging rapidly to zero as the family is degenerating. We can then conclude that the corresponding family of degenerating Calabi-Yau metrics is polyhomogeneous by using a fixed point argument.</description>

      <title>Cohomology for linearized Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish solvability and uniqueness conditions for the linearized Ricci curvature equations on compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary, obtained without imposing restrictions on the interior geometry. The proof recasts the problem in cohomological terms by means of a generalized Hodge theory, based on the Boutet de Monvel calculus. The first cohomology, obstructing uniqueness, is always finite dimensional, whereas the second cohomology, obstructing solvability, is finite dimensional either in dimension three or when the boundary is empty. Through the Bochner technique, we prove vanishing theorems for these cohomologies; for the second cohomology, the argument also uses stress potentials and the sharp Poincar\'e inequality on spheres.</description>

      <title>The heat trace for domains with curved corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the short-time asymptotics of the Dirichlet heat trace on planar curvilinear polygons. For such domains we show that the coefficient of $t^{1/2}$ in the expansion splits into a boundary integral of $\kappa^2$ and a sum of local corner contributions, one for each vertex. Each curved corner contribution depends only on the interior angle $\alpha$ and on the limiting curvatures $\kappa_{\pm}$ on the adjacent sides. Using a conformal model and a parametrix construction on the sector heat space, we express this contribution in the form $c_{1/2}(\alpha)\,r_0(\alpha,\kappa_+, \kappa_-)$, where $c_{1/2}(\alpha)$ is given by a Hadamard finite part of an explicit trace over the exact sector. For right-angled corners we compute $c_{1/2}(\pi/2)=1/(16\sqrt{\pi})$ and obtain a closed formula for the $t^{1/2}$ coefficient. As an application we extend a previous result in the literature by showing that any admissible curvilinear polygon that is Dirichlet isospectral to a polygon must itself be a polygon with straight sides.</description>

      <title>Radon--Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Interacting-Particle Sampling in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient flows of the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence, such as the Fokker--Planck equation and Stein Variational Gradient Descent, evolve a distribution toward a target density known only up to a normalizing constant. We introduce new gradient flows of the KL divergence with a remarkable combination of properties: they admit accurate interacting-particle approximations in high dimensions, and the per-step cost scales linearly in both the number of particles and the dimension. These gradient flows are based on new transportation-based Riemannian geometries on the space of probability measures: the Radon--Wasserstein geometry and the related Regularized Radon--Wasserstein (RRW) geometry. We define these geometries using the Radon transform so that the gradient-flow velocities depend only on one-dimensional projections. This yields interacting-particle-based algorithms whose per-step cost follows from efficient Fast Fourier Transform-based evaluation of the required 1D convolutions. We additionally provide numerical experiments that study the performance of the proposed algorithms and compare convergence behavior and quantization. Finally, we prove some theoretical results including well-posedness of the flows and long-time convergence guarantees for the RRW flow.</description>
