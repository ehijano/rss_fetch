      <title>Coupled Fire-Cloud Simulations Reveal Mechanisms of Pyrocumulonimbus Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) firestorms occur when the updraft from a wildfire forms a precipitating cloud. These clouds create unpredictable winds, posing threats to life and property. The coupled fire-atmosphere interactions that govern the behavior of pyroCb are incompletely understood, with previous simulations either treating the fire as static or using semi-empirical rate of spread models. It is disputed whether fuel moisture serves as an energy source or sink for pyroCB events. We use a fine-scale cloud model coupled with a fire model with combustion physics to simulate and analyze the co-evolution of pyroCb and its associated fire. Here we show fuel moisture acts as an energy sink attenuating fire intensity and suppressing pyroCb development, and we also identify and quantify a positive feedback loop, the self-amplifying fire-induced recirculation (SAFIR) mechanism, where precipitation-induced downdrafts intensify the parent fire. Our results demonstrate fuel moisture is an insignificant source of moisture for the pyroCb, contradicting previous forecasting guidance. Our analysis of the SAFIR mechanism shows weak upper-level winds favor a pyroCb downdraft close to the parent fire, creating conditions for rapid intensification. These findings provide a new mechanistic framework for understanding pyroCb behavior, offering insight towards improved prediction of these extreme events.</description>

      <title>Using Large Eddy Simulations to Study How Climate Change Influences Aerosol-Cloud Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because aerosol-cloud interactions are the most uncertain climate forcing in the Earth system, it is important to better understand the aerosol-cloud interactions, especially how they will change with climate. This study carries out large eddy simulations (LES) of a 3-day stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition (SCT) along an airmass-following trajectory in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. By perturbing aerosol concentrations within the marine boundary layer (MBL) in the SCT simulations, we evaluate aerosol-cloud interactions in both the present day as well as in a double-CO2 climate. We find that aerosol-induced cloud changes, including first (Twomey effect) and second adjustments of cloud fraction and liquid water path (LWP) indirect effects of aerosols, tend to be inhibited in a double-CO2 climate. The LWP adjustment is more sensitive to global warming than the Twomey effect. By decomposing the aerosol-induced cloud radiative effect change ($\Delta$CRE), we find that the aerosol-induced cloud fraction change ($\Delta$CF) shows the largest contribution to $\Delta$CRE in our simulations. Aerosol-induced droplet number concentration change ($\Delta$Nc) shows a cooling effect, while the LWP change shows a warming effect that is consistent with aerosol-induced cloud thinning. Overall, the cooling effect associated with increased aerosol concentrations will weaken in a double-CO2 climate. Our results can also help to understand and predict the cooling potential of marine cloud brightening (MCB) in a changing climate.</description>

      <title>Efficient Kilometer-Scale Precipitation Downscaling with Conditional Wavelet Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective hydrological modeling and extreme weather analysis demand precipitation data at a kilometer-scale resolution, which is significantly finer than the 10 km scale offered by standard global products like IMERG. To address this, we propose the Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM), a generative framework that achieves 10x spatial super-resolution (downscaling to 1 km) and delivers a 9x inference speedup over pixel-based diffusion models. WDM is a conditional diffusion model that learns the learns the complex structure of precipitation from MRMS radar data directly in the wavelet domain. By focusing on high-frequency wavelet coefficients, it generates exceptionally realistic and detailed 1-km precipitation fields. This wavelet-based approach produces visually superior results with fewer artifacts than pixel-space models, and delivers a significant gains in sampling efficiency. Our results demonstrate that WDM provides a robust solution to the dual challenges of accuracy and speed in geoscience super-resolution, paving the way for more reliable hydrological forecasts.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Earth's Core-Mantle boundary from nutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic variations in the Sun and Moon's gravitational pull cause small changes in Earth's rotational axis direction called nutation. Nutation components in the retrograde quasi-diurnal frequency band measured in the terrestrial reference frame are amplified by resonance with the Free Core Nutation (FCN), a rotational mode of Earth's fluid core. Dissipative processes at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) dampen this resonance, contributing to the observed phase lag between tidal forcing and Earth's rotational response. This phase lag is commonly attributed to electromagnetic (EM) coupling between the core and the electrically conducting lower mantle. However, estimates of mantle conductivity and radial magnetic field strength at the CMB suggest these effects are insufficient. We show that the missing dissipation arises naturally from the excitation of internal waves in the fluid core by topographic features at the CMB. Adapting a theoretical framework originally developed for tidal flow over oceanic topography, we compute the form drag and associated power flux induced by CMB topography. Our results are consistent with a CMB topography characterized by a root mean square amplitude of a few kilometers. The model favors weak stratification at the top of the core, though stronger stratification remains compatible with increased topographic amplitude. This mechanism provides independent constraints on CMB topography and stratification, complementing seismological and magnetic observations. Its generality offers a new framework for probing deep-interior dynamics across terrestrial planets.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Abrupt Shifts in CMIP6 Models using Edge Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Past research has shown that multiple climate subsystems might undergo abrupt shifts, such as the Arctic Winter sea ice or the Amazon rainforest, but there are large uncertainties regarding their timing and spatial extent. In this study we investigated when and where abrupt shifts occur in the latest generation of earth system models (CMIP6) under a scenario of 1\% annual increase in CO$_2$. We considered 82 ocean, atmosphere, and land variables across 57 models. We used a Canny edge detection method to identify abrupt shifts occurring on yearly to decadal timescales, and performed a connected component analysis to quantify the spatial extent of these shifts. The systems analyzed include the North Atlantic subpolar gyre, Tibetan Plateau, land permafrost, Amazon rainforest, Antarctic sea ice, monsoon systems, Arctic summer sea ice, Arctic winter sea ice, and Barents sea ice. Except for the monsoon systems, we found abrupt shifts in all of these across multiple models. Despite large inter-model variations, higher levels of global warming consistently increase the risk of abrupt shifts in CMIP6 models. At a global warming of 1.5 $^\circ \text{C}$, six out of ten studied climate subsystems already show large-scale abrupt shifts across multiple models.</description>
