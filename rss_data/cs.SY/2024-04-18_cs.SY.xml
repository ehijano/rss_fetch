      <title>Perspectives on Contractivity in Control, Optimization, and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contraction theory is a mathematical framework for studying the convergence, robustness, and modularity properties of dynamical systems and algorithms. In this opinion paper, we provide five main opinions on the virtues of contraction theory. These opinions are (i) contraction theory is a unifying framework emerging from classical and modern works, (ii) contractivity is computationally-friendly, robust, and modular stability, (iii) numerous dynamical systems are contracting, (iv) contraction theory is relevant to modern applications, and (v) contraction theory can be vastly extended in numerous directions. We survey recent theoretical and applied research in each of these five directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research focused on the development of a cost-effective IoT solution for energy and environment monitoring geared towards manufacturing industries. The proposed system is developed using open-source software that can be easily deployed in any manufacturing environment. The system collects real-time temperature, humidity, and energy data from different devices running on different communication such as TCP/IP, Modbus, etc., and the data is transferred wirelessly using an MQTT client to a database working as a cloud storage solution.

      <title>Hybrid Navigation Acceptability and Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vessels have emerged as a prominent and accepted solution, particularly in the naval defence sector. However, achieving full autonomy for marine vessels demands the development of robust and reliable control and guidance systems that can handle various encounters with manned and unmanned vessels while operating effectively under diverse weather and sea conditions. A significant challenge in this pursuit is ensuring the autonomous vessels' compliance with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). These regulations present a formidable hurdle for the human-level understanding by autonomous systems as they were originally designed from common navigation practices created since the mid-19th century. Their ambiguous language assumes experienced sailors' interpretation and execution, and therefore demands a high-level (cognitive) understanding of language and agent intentions. These capabilities surpass the current state-of-the-art in intelligent systems. This position paper highlights the critical requirements for a trustworthy control and guidance system, exploring the complexity of adapting COLREGs for safe vessel-on-vessel encounters considering autonomous maritime technology competing and/or cooperating with manned vessels.</description>

      <title>A New Hybrid Automaton Framework with Partial Differential Equation Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the syntax and semantics of a novel type of hybrid automaton (HA) with partial differential equation (PDE) dynamic, partial differential hybrid automata (PDHA). In PDHA, we add a spatial domain $X$ and harness a mathematic conception, partition, to help us formally define the spatial relations. While classically the dynamics of HA are described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and differential inclusions, PDHA is capable of describing the behavior of cyber-physical systems (CPS) with continuous dynamics that cannot be modelled using the canonical hybrid systems' framework. For the purposes of analyzing PDHA, we propose another model called the discrete space partial differential hybrid automata (DSPDHA) which handles discrete spatial domains using finite difference methods (FDM) and this simple and intuitive approach reduces the PDHA into HA with ODE systems. We conclude with two illustrative examples in order to exhibit the nature of PDHA and DSPDHA.</description>

      <title>Segmented Model-Based Hydrogen Delivery Control for PEM Fuel Cells: a Port-Hamiltonian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an extended interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control technique (IDA-PBC) to control the pressure dynamics in the fuel delivery subsystem (FDS) of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. The fuel cell stack is a distributed parameter model which can be modeled by partial differential equations PDEs). In this paper, the segmentation concept is used to approximate the PDEs model by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) model. Therefore, each segments are having multiple ODEs to obtain the lump-sum model of the segments. Subsequently, a generalized multi-input multi-output lumped parameters model is developed in port-Hamiltonian framework based on mass balance to minimize the modeling error. The modeling errors arises due to the difference between spatially distributed pressures in FDS segments, and also due to the difference between the actual stack pressure and the measured output pressure of the anode. The segments interconnection feasibilities are ensured by maintaining passivity of each segment. With consideration of re-circulation and bleeding of the anode in the modeling, an extended energy-shaping and output tracking IDA-PBC based state-feedback controller is proposed to control the spatially distributed pressure dynamics in the anode. Furthermore, a sliding mode observer of high order is designed to estimate the unmeasurable pressures in FDS with known disturbances. Performance recovery of output feedback control is accomplished with explicit stability analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed IDA-PBC approach is validated by the simulation results.</description>

      <title>Cost and CO2 emissions co-optimisation of green hydrogen production in a grid-connected renewable energy system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Green hydrogen is essential for producing renewable fuels that are needed in sectors that are hard to electrify directly. Hydrogen production in a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy plant necessitates smart planning to meet long-term hydrogen trading agreements while minimising costs and emissions. Previous research analysed economic and environmental impact of hydrogen production based on full foresight of renewable energy availabilty, electricity price, and CO2 intensity in the electricity grid. However, the full foresight assumption is impractical in day-to-day operation, often leading to underestimations of both the cost and CO2 emissions associated with hydrogen production. Therefore, this research introduces a novel long-term planner that uses historical data and short-term forecasts to plan hydrogen production in the day-to-day operation of a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy plant. The long-term planner co-minimises cost and CO2 emissions to determine the hydrogen production for the next day taking into account the remaining hydrogen production and the time remaining until the end of the delivery period, which can be a week, a month, or a year. Extended delivery periods provide operation flexibility, enabling cost and CO2 emissions reductions. Significant reductions in CO2 emissions can be achieved with relatively small increases in the levelised cost. Under day-to-day operation, the levelised cost of hydrogen is marginally higher than that of the full foresight; the CO2 emissions can be up to 60% higher. Despite a significant portion of the produced hydrogen not meeting the criteria for green hydrogen designation under current rules, CO2 emissions are lower than those from existing alternative hydrogen production methods. These results underscore the importance of balancing cost considerations with environmental impacts in operational decision-making.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater Unmanned Vehicles (UUVs) have to constantly compensate for the external disturbing forces acting on their body. Adaptive Control theory is commonly used there to grant the control law some flexibility in its response to process variation. Today, learning-based (LB) adaptive methods are leading the field where model-based control structures are combined with deep model-free learning algorithms. This work proposes experiments and metrics to empirically study the stability of such a controller. We perform this stability analysis on a LB adaptive control system whose adaptive parameters are determined using a Cross-Entropy Deep Learning method.</description>

      <title>Mapping back and forth between model predictive control and neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) for linear systems with quadratic costs and linear constraints is shown to admit an exact representation as an implicit neural network. A method to "unravel" the implicit neural network of MPC into an explicit one is also introduced. As well as building links between model-based and data-driven control, these results emphasize the capability of implicit neural networks for representing solutions of optimisation problems, as such problems are themselves implicitly defined functions.</description>

      <title>MPC of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems with Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Neural Predictive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of reference tracking in uncertain nonlinear systems. A neural State-Space Model (NSSM) is used to approximate the nonlinear system, where a deep encoder network learns the nonlinearity from data, and a state-space component captures the temporal relationship. This transforms the nonlinear system into a linear system in a latent space, enabling the application of model predictive control (MPC) to determine effective control actions. Our objective is to design the optimal controller using limited data from the \textit{target system} (the system of interest). To this end, we employ an implicit model-agnostic meta-learning (iMAML) framework that leverages information from \textit{source systems} (systems that share similarities with the target system) to expedite training in the target system and enhance its control performance. The framework consists of two phases: the (offine) meta-training phase learns a aggregated NSSM using data from source systems, and the (online) meta-inference phase quickly adapts this aggregated model to the target system using only a few data points and few online training iterations, based on local loss function gradients. The iMAML algorithm exploits the implicit function theorem to exactly compute the gradient during training, without relying on the entire optimization path. By focusing solely on the optimal solution, rather than the path, we can meta-train with less storage complexity and fewer approximations than other contemporary meta-learning algorithms. We demonstrate through numerical examples that our proposed method can yield accurate predictive models by adaptation, resulting in a downstream MPC that outperforms several baselines.</description>

      <title>Stability Certificates for Receding Horizon Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Game-theoretic MPC (or Receding Horizon Games) is an emerging control methodology for multi-agent systems that generates control actions by solving a dynamic game with coupling constraints in a receding-horizon fashion. This control paradigm has recently received an increasing attention in various application fields, including robotics, autonomous driving, traffic networks, and energy grids, due to its ability to model the competitive nature of self-interested agents with shared resources while incorporating future predictions, dynamic models, and constraints into the decision-making process. In this work, we present the first formal stability analysis based on dissipativity and monotone operator theory that is valid also for non-potential games. Specifically, we derive LMI-based certificates that ensure asymptotic stability and are numerically verifiable. Moreover, we show that, if the agents have decoupled dynamics, the numerical verification can be performed in a scalable manner. Finally, we present tuning guidelines for the agents' cost function weights to fulfill the certificates and, thus, ensure stability.</description>

      <title>Stability-informed Bayesian Optimization for MPC Cost Function Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing predictive controllers towards optimal closed-loop performance while maintaining safety and stability is challenging. This work explores closed-loop learning for predictive control parameters under imperfect information while considering closed-loop stability. We employ constrained Bayesian optimization to learn a model predictive controller's (MPC) cost function parametrized as a feedforward neural network, optimizing closed-loop behavior as well as minimizing model-plant mismatch. Doing so offers a high degree of freedom and, thus, the opportunity for efficient and global optimization towards the desired and optimal closed-loop behavior. We extend this framework by stability constraints on the learned controller parameters, exploiting the optimal value function of the underlying MPC as a Lyapunov candidate. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is underlined in simulations, highlighting its performance and safety capabilities.</description>

      <title>Long Duration Battery Sizing, Siting, and Operation Under Wildfire Risk Using Progressive Hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery sizing and siting problems are computationally challenging due to the need to make long-term planning decisions that are cognizant of short-term operational decisions. This paper considers sizing, siting, and operating batteries in a power grid to maximize their benefits, including price arbitrage and load shed mitigation, during both normal operations and periods with high wildfire ignition risk. We formulate a multi-scenario optimization problem for long duration battery storage while considering the possibility of load shedding during Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) events that de-energize lines to mitigate severe wildfire ignition risk. To enable a computationally scalable solution of this problem with many scenarios of wildfire risk and power injection variability, we develop a customized temporal decomposition method based on a progressive hedging framework. Extending traditional progressive hedging techniques, we consider coupling in both placement variables across all scenarios and state-of-charge variables at temporal boundaries. This enforces consistency across scenarios while enabling parallel computations despite both spatial and temporal coupling. The proposed decomposition facilitates efficient and scalable modeling of a full year of hourly operational decisions to inform the sizing and siting of batteries. With this decomposition, we model a year of hourly operational decisions to inform optimal battery placement for a 240-bus WECC model in under 70 minutes of wall-clock time.</description>

      <title>Practical Considerations for Discrete-Time Implementations of Continuous-Time Control Barrier Function-Based Safety Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety filters based on control barrier functions (CBFs) have become a popular method to guarantee safety for uncertified control policies, e.g., as resulting from reinforcement learning. Here, safety is defined as staying in a pre-defined set, the safe set, that adheres to the system's state constraints, e.g., as given by lane boundaries for a self-driving vehicle. In this paper, we examine one commonly overlooked problem that arises in practical implementations of continuous-time CBF-based safety filters. In particular, we look at the issues caused by discrete-time implementations of the continuous-time CBF-based safety filter, especially for cases where the magnitude of the Lie derivative of the CBF with respect to the control input is zero or close to zero. When overlooked, this filter can result in undesirable chattering effects or constraint violations. In this work, we propose three mitigation strategies that allow us to use a continuous-time safety filter in a discrete-time implementation with a local relative degree. Using these strategies in augmented CBF-based safety filters, we achieve safety for all states in the safe set by either using an additional penalty term in the safety filtering objective or modifying the CBF such that those undesired states are not encountered during closed-loop operation. We demonstrate the presented issue and validate our three proposed mitigation strategies in simulation and on a real-world quadrotor.</description>

      <title>Equitably allocating wildfire resilience investments for power grids: The curse of aggregation and vulnerability indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wildfires ignited by power systems infrastructure are among the most destructive wildfires; hence some utility companies in wildfire-prone regions have pursued a proactive policy of emergency power shutoffs. These shutoffs, while mitigating the risk of disastrous ignition events, result in power outages that could negatively impacts vulnerable communities. In this paper, we consider how to equitably allocate funds to underground and effectively de-risk power lines in transmission networks. We explore the impact of the 2021 White House resource allocation policy called the Justice40 initiative, which states that 40% of the benefits of federally-funded climate-related investments should go to socially vulnerable communities. The definition of what constitutes a vulnerable community varies by organization, and we consider two major recently proposed vulnerability indices: the Justice40 index created under the 2021 White House and the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) developed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We show that allocating budget according to these two indices fails to reduce power outages for indigenous communities and those subject to high wildfire ignition risk using a high-fidelity synthetic power grid dataset that matches the key features of the Texas transmission system. We discuss how aggregation of communities and "one size fits all" vulnerability indices might be the reasons for the misalignment between the goals of vulnerability indices and their realized impact in this particular case study. We provide a method of achieving an equitable investment plan by adding group-level protections on percentage of load that is shed across each population group of interest.</description>

      <title>Continuous Dynamic Bipedal Jumping via Adaptive-model Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic and continuous jumping remains an open yet challenging problem in bipedal robot control. The choice of dynamic models in trajectory optimization (TO) problems plays a huge role in trajectory accuracy and computation efficiency, which normally cannot be ensured simultaneously. In this letter, we propose a novel adaptive-model optimization approach, a unified framework of Adaptive-model TO and Adaptive-frequency Model Predictive Control (MPC), to effectively realize continuous and robust jumping on HECTOR bipedal robot. The proposed Adaptive-model TO fuses adaptive-fidelity dynamics modeling of bipedal jumping motion for model fidelity necessities in different jumping phases to ensure trajectory accuracy and computation efficiency. In addition, conventional approaches have unsynchronized sampling frequencies in TO and real-time control, causing the framework to have mismatched modeling resolutions. We adapt MPC sampling frequency based on TO trajectory resolution in different phases for effective trajectory tracking. In hardware experiments, we have demonstrated robust and dynamic jumps covering a distance of up to 40 cm (57% of robot height). To verify the repeatability of this experiment, we run 53 jumping experiments and achieve 90% success rate. In continuous jumps, we demonstrate continuous bipedal jumping with terrain height perturbations (up to 5 cm) and discontinuities (up to 20 cm gap).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a cooperative inspection system designed to efficiently control and coordinate a team of distributed heterogeneous UAV agents for the inspection of 3D structures in cluttered, unknown spaces. Our proposed approach employs a two-stage innovative methodology. Initially, it leverages the complementary sensing capabilities of the robots to cooperatively map the unknown environment. It then generates optimized, collision-free inspection paths, thereby ensuring comprehensive coverage of the structure's surface area. The effectiveness of our system is demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative results from extensive Gazebo-based simulations that closely replicate real-world inspection scenarios, highlighting its ability to thoroughly inspect real-world-like 3D structures.</description>

      <title>Designing a sector-coupled European energy system robust to 60 years of historical weather data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As energy systems transform to rely on renewable energy and electrification, they encounter stronger year-to-year variability in energy supply and demand. However, most infrastructure planning is based on a single weather year, resulting in a lack of robustness. In this paper, we optimize energy infrastructure for a European energy system designed for net-zero CO$_2$ emissions in 62 different weather years. Subsequently, we fix the capacity layouts and simulate their operation in every weather year, to evaluate resource adequacy and CO$_2$ emissions abatement. We show that interannual weather variability causes variation of $\pm$10\% in total system cost. The most expensive capacity layout obtains the lowest net CO$_2$ emissions but not the highest resource adequacy. Instead, capacity layouts designed with years including compound weather events result in a more robust and cost-effective design. Deploying CO$_2$-emitting backup generation is a cost-effective robustness measure, which only increase CO$_2$ emissions marginally as the average CO$_2$ emissions remain less than 1\% of 1990 levels. Our findings highlight how extreme weather years drive investments in robustness measures, making them compatible with all weather conditions within six decades of historical weather data.</description>

      <title>ASID: Active Exploration for System Identification in Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-free control strategies such as reinforcement learning have shown the ability to learn control strategies without requiring an accurate model or simulator of the world. While this is appealing due to the lack of modeling requirements, such methods can be sample inefficient, making them impractical in many real-world domains. On the other hand, model-based control techniques leveraging accurate simulators can circumvent these challenges and use a large amount of cheap simulation data to learn controllers that can effectively transfer to the real world. The challenge with such model-based techniques is the requirement for an extremely accurate simulation, requiring both the specification of appropriate simulation assets and physical parameters. This requires considerable human effort to design for every environment being considered. In this work, we propose a learning system that can leverage a small amount of real-world data to autonomously refine a simulation model and then plan an accurate control strategy that can be deployed in the real world. Our approach critically relies on utilizing an initial (possibly inaccurate) simulator to design effective exploration policies that, when deployed in the real world, collect high-quality data. We demonstrate the efficacy of this paradigm in identifying articulation, mass, and other physical parameters in several challenging robotic manipulation tasks, and illustrate that only a small amount of real-world data can allow for effective sim-to-real transfer.

      <title>Investigation on the Impact of Heat Waves on Distribution System Failures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses some aspects referring to the characterization and modelling of the resilience of distribution systems in the presence of heat waves. The aim is to identify the specific features that can lead to more detailed modelling of the impact of heat waves on the failures that happen in distribution systems. In particular, with heat waves there are differences between the cumulative distribution function of the time to failure in practical cases and in the theoretical reference used for reliability analysis. These differences may be considered to refine the resilience models due to heat waves. Examples taken from real cases are illustrated and commented.</description>

Abstract: We address the challenge of dimension reduction in the discrete-time optimal control problem which is solved repeatedly online within the framework of model predictive control. Our study demonstrates that a reduced-order approach, aimed at identifying a suboptimal solution within a low-dimensional subspace, retains the stability and recursive feasibility characteristics of the original problem. We present a necessary and sufficient condition for ensuring initial feasibility, which is seamlessly integrated into the subspace design process. Additionally, we employ techniques from optimization on Riemannian manifolds to develop a subspace that efficiently represents a collection of pre-specified high-dimensional data points, all while adhering to the initial admissibility constraint.</description>

      <title>Intention-Aware Control Based on Belief-Space Specifications and Stochastic Expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a correct-by-design controller for an autonomous vehicle interacting with opponent vehicles with unknown intentions. We use discrete-valued random variables to model unknown intentions. Based on this, we define an intention-aware control problem for an autonomous vehicle and a collection of opponent agents with epistemic uncertainty. To this end, we focus on a control objective specified in the belief space with temporal logic specifications. From this stochastic control problem, we derive a sound deterministic control problem using stochastic expansion and solve it using shrinking-horizon model predictive control. The solved intention-aware controller allows a vehicle to adjust its behaviors according to its opponents' intentions. It ensures provable safety by restricting the probabilistic risk under a desired level. We show with experimental studies that the proposed method ensures strict limitation of risk probabilities, validating its efficacy in autonomous driving cases. This work provides a novel solution for the risk-aware control of interactive vehicles with formal safety guarantees.</description>

      <title>A Game-Theoretic Approach for PMU Deployment Against False Data Injection Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are used in the measurement, control and protection of power grids. However, deploying PMUs at every bus in a power system is prohibitively expensive, necessitating partial PMU placement that can ensure system observability with minimal units. One consequence of this economic approach is increased system vulnerability to False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs). This paper proposes a zero-sum game-based approach to strategically place an additional PMU (following the initial optimal PMU deployment that ensures full observability) to bolster robustness against FDIAs by introducing redundancy in attack-susceptible areas. To compute the Nash equilibrium (NE) solution, we leverage a reinforcement learning algorithm that mitigates the need for complete knowledge of the opponent's actions. The proposed PMU deployment algorithm increases the detection rate of FDIA by 36% compared to benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>Infinite Horizon Average Cost Optimality Criteria for Mean-Field Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study mean-field control problems in discrete-time under the infinite horizon average cost optimality criteria. We focus on both the finite population and the infinite population setups. We show the existence of a solution to the average cost optimality equation (ACOE) and the existence of optimal stationary Markov policies for finite population problems under (i) a minorization condition that provides geometric ergodicity on the collective state process of the agents, and (ii) under standard Lipschitz continuity assumptions on the stage-wise cost and transition function of the agents when the Lipschitz constant of the transition function satisfies a certain bound. For the infinite population problem, we establish the existence of a solution to the ACOE, and the existence of optimal policies under the continuity assumptions on the cost and the transition functions. Finally, we relate the finite population and infinite population control problems: (i) we prove that the optimal value of the finite population problem converges to the optimal value of the infinite population problem as the number of agents grows to infinity; (ii) we show that the accumulation points of the finite population optimal solution corresponds to an optimal solution for the infinite population problem, and finally (iii), we show that one can use the solution of the infinite population problem for the finite population problem symmetrically across the agents to achieve near optimal performance when the population is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Gait Modeling and Optimization for Principally Kinematic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic adaptation to unanticipated operating conditions is crucial to achieving persistence and robustness in complex real world settings. For a wide range of cutting-edge robotic systems, such as micro- and nano-scale robots, soft robots, medical robots, and bio-hybrid robots, it is infeasible to anticipate the operating environment a priori due to complexities that arise from numerous factors including imprecision in manufacturing, chemo-mechanical forces, and poorly understood contact mechanics. Drawing inspiration from data-driven modeling, geometric mechanics (or gauge theory), and adaptive control, we employ an adaptive system identification framework and demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing the performance of principally kinematic locomotors (those governed by Rayleigh dissipation or zero momentum conservation). We showcase the capability of the adaptive model to efficiently accommodate varying terrains and iteratively modified behaviors within a behavior optimization framework. This provides both the ability to improve fundamental behaviors and perform motion tracking to precision. Notably, we are capable of optimizing the gaits of the Purcell swimmer using approximately 10 cycles per link, which for the nine-link Purcell swimmer provides a factor of ten improvement in optimization speed over the state of the art. Beyond simply a computational speed up, this ten-fold improvement may enable this method to be successfully deployed for in-situ behavior refinement, injury recovery, and terrain adaptation, particularly in domains where simulations provide poor guides for the real world.</description>

      <title>Switching Frequency Limitation with Finite Control Set Model Predictive Control via Slack Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Past work proposed an extension to finite control set model predictive control to track both a current reference and a switching frequency reference, simultaneously. Such an objective can jeopardize the current tracking performance, and this can potentially be alleviated by instead limiting the switching frequency. To this end, we propose to limit the switching frequency in finite control set model predictive control. The switching frequency is captured with an infinite impulse response filter and bounded by an inequality constraint; its corresponding slack variable is penalized in the cost function. To solve the resulting problem efficiently, a sphere decoder with a computational speed-up is presented.</description>

      <title>Beacon, a lightweight deep reinforcement learning benchmark library for flow control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the increasing use of deep reinforcement learning for flow control problems has led to a new area of research, focused on the coupling and the adaptation of the existing algorithms to the control of numerical fluid dynamics environments. Although still in its infancy, the field has seen multiple successes in a short time span, and its fast development pace can certainly be partly imparted to the open-source effort that drives the expansion of the community. Yet, this emerging domain still misses a common ground to (i) ensure the reproducibility of the results, and (ii) offer a proper ad-hoc benchmarking basis. To this end, we propose Beacon, an open-source benchmark library composed of seven lightweight 1D and 2D flow control problems with various characteristics, action and observation space characteristics, and CPU requirements. In this contribution, the seven considered problems are described, and reference control solutions are provided. The sources for the following work are available at https://github.com/jviquerat/beacon.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Algorithms Applied to Ship Trajectory Planning and Behavior Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithms, notably used for nonholonomic vehicle navigation in complex environments, are often not thoroughly evaluated for their specific challenges. This paper presents a first such comparison study of the variants Potential-Quick RRT* (PQ-RRT*), Informed RRT* (IRRT*), RRT*, and RRT, in maritime single-query nonholonomic motion planning. Additionally, the practicalities of using these algorithms in maritime environments are discussed and outlined. We also contend that these algorithms are beneficial not only for trajectory planning in Collision Avoidance Systems (CAS) but also for CAS verification when used as vessel behavior generators.
  Optimal RRT variants tend to produce more distance-optimal paths but require more computational time due to complex tree wiring and nearest neighbor searches. Our findings, supported by Welch`s t-test at a significance level of Alpha = 0.05, indicate that PQ-RRT* slightly outperform IRRT* and RRT* in achieving shorter trajectory length but at the expense of higher tuning complexity and longer run-times. Based on the results, we argue that these RRT algorithms are better suited for smaller-scale problems or environments with low obstacle congestion ratio. This is attributed to the curse of dimensionality, and trade-off with available memory and computational resources.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained Control for Safe Spacecraft Autonomy: Convex Programming Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust path-planning framework for safe spacecraft autonomy under uncertainty and develops a computationally tractable formulation based on convex programming. We utilize chance-constrained control to formulate the problem. It provides a mathematical framework to solve for a sequence of control policies that minimizes a probabilistic cost under probabilistic constraints with a user-defined confidence level (e.g., safety with 99.9% confidence). The framework enables the planner to directly control state distributions under operational uncertainties while ensuring the vehicle safety. This paper rigorously formulates the safe autonomy problem, gathers and extends techniques in literature to accommodate key cost/constraint functions that often arise in spacecraft path planning, and develops a tractable solution method. The presented framework is demonstrated via two representative numerical examples: safe autonomous rendezvous and orbit maintenance in cislunar space, both under uncertainties due to navigation error from Kalman filter, execution error via Gates model, and imperfect force models.</description>

      <title>Control-based Graph Embeddings with Data Augmentation for Contrastive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of unsupervised graph representation learning by harnessing the control properties of dynamical networks defined on graphs. Our approach introduces a novel framework for contrastive learning, a widely prevalent technique for unsupervised representation learning. A crucial step in contrastive learning is the creation of 'augmented' graphs from the input graphs. Though different from the original graphs, these augmented graphs retain the original graph's structural characteristics. Here, we propose a unique method for generating these augmented graphs by leveraging the control properties of networks. The core concept revolves around perturbing the original graph to create a new one while preserving the controllability properties specific to networks and graphs. Compared to the existing methods, we demonstrate that this innovative approach enhances the effectiveness of contrastive learning frameworks, leading to superior results regarding the accuracy of the classification tasks. The key innovation lies in our ability to decode the network structure using these control properties, opening new avenues for unsupervised graph representation learning.</description>

      <title>HCL-MTSAD: Hierarchical Contrastive Consistency Learning for Accurate Detection of Industrial Multivariate Time Series Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multivariate Time Series (MTS) anomaly detection focuses on pinpointing samples that diverge from standard operational patterns, which is crucial for ensuring the safety and security of industrial applications. The primary challenge in this domain is to develop representations capable of discerning anomalies effectively. The prevalent methods for anomaly detection in the literature are predominantly reconstruction-based and predictive in nature. However, they typically concentrate on a single-dimensional instance level, thereby not fully harnessing the complex associations inherent in industrial MTS. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised hierarchical contrastive consistency learning method for detecting anomalies in MTS, named HCL-MTSAD. It innovatively leverages data consistency at multiple levels inherent in industrial MTS, systematically capturing consistent associations across four latent levels-measurement, sample, channel, and process. By developing a multi-layer contrastive loss, HCL-MTSAD can extensively mine data consistency and spatio-temporal association, resulting in more informative representations. Subsequently, an anomaly discrimination module, grounded in self-supervised hierarchical contrastive learning, is designed to detect timestamp-level anomalies by calculating multi-scale data consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on six diverse MTS datasets retrieved from real cyber-physical systems and server machines, in comparison with 20 baselines, indicate that HCL-MTSAD's anomaly detection capability outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark models by an average of 1.8\% in terms of F1 score.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous compensation of input delay and state/input quantization for linear systems via switched predictor feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a switched predictor-feedback law, which achieves global asymptotic stabilization of linear systems with input delay and with the plant and actuator states available only in (almost) quantized form. The control design relies on a quantized version of the nominal predictor-feedback law for linear systems, in which quantized measurements of the plant and actuator states enter the predictor state formula. A switching strategy is constructed to dynamically adjust the tunable parameter of the quantizer (in a piecewise constant manner), in order to initially increase the range and subsequently decrease the error of the quantizers. The key element in the proof of global asymptotic stability in the supremum norm of the actuator state is derivation of solutions' estimates combining a backstepping transformation with small-gain and input-to-state stability arguments, for addressing the error due to quantization. We extend this result to the input quantization case and illustrate our theory with a numerical example.</description>
