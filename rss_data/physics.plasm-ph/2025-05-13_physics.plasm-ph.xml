      <title>Detachment control in KSTAR with Tungsten divertor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KSTAR has recently undergone an upgrade to use a new Tungsten divertor to run experiments in ITER-relevant scenarios. Even with a high melting point of Tungsten, it is important to control the heat flux impinging on tungsten divertor targets to minimize sputtering and contamination of the core plasma. Heat flux on the divertor is often controlled by increasing the detachment of Scrape-Off Layer plasma from the target plates. In this work, we have demonstrated successful detachment control experiments using two different methods. The first method uses attachment fraction as a control variable which is estimated using ion saturation current measurements from embedded Langmuir probes in the divertor. The second method uses a novel machine-learning-based surrogate model of 2D UEDGE simulation database, DivControlNN. We demonstrated running inference operation of DivControlNN in realtime to estimate heat flux at the divertor and use it to feedback impurity gas to control the detachment level. We present interesting insights from these experiments including a systematic approach to tuning controllers and discuss future improvements in the control infrastructure and control variables for future burning plasma experiments.</description>

      <title>Nanosecond and microsecond-pulsed plasma-in-liquid treated copper oxide surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanosecond and microsecond plasma-in liquid systems are explored to oxidize or regenerate a copper oxide surface in situ to serve as a catalyst for electrochemical CO$_2$ conversion. The plasma excitation generates H$_2$O$_2$ in the liquid, which induces the dissolution of Cu into Cu(OH)$_2$ and the recrystallization into Cu$_2$O nanocubes at the interface. The plasma performance of the two excitation schemes is analyzed, showing that the H$_2$O$_2$ production of nanosecond plasma is more efficient than of microsecond plasmas. The nature of the Cu$_2$O nanocubes is evaluated using electron microscopy and electrochemical characterization.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen oxidation on a plasma-exposed surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elementary processes during the fixation of nitrogen by plasma catalysis are studied in a low-pressure plasma experiment using N$_2$ and O$_2$ as source gases. The formation of surface groups on an iron oxide foil are monitored with infrared reflection spectroscopy. Surface nitrates (NO$_3$) are formed when the samples are exposed to a 1:1 N$_2$:O$_2$ plasma, as well as O$_3$, NO$_2$, NO, and N$_2$O in the gas phase. During plasma exposure, bidentate nitrates are formed. The structure of this surface group changes after plasma exposure. It is postulated that adsorption plasma created NO$_x$(g) yields the formation of these NO$_3$ species. This constitutes an intermediate step for NO$_x$ formation by plasma catalysis.</description>

      <title>Improved ion bunch quality of conical target irradiated by ultra-intense and ultra-short laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct particle-in-cell simulations to estimate the effects of circularly and linearly polarized SEL 100 PW lasers on flat Th targets with thicknesses of 50 nm, 100 nm and 250 nm, as well as easy to manufacture conical Th targets with angularity either on the left or right. As the thickness of the three types of targets increases and under the same polarized laser, the average energy, maximum energy and energy conversion efficiency of Th ions decrease as it is well-known, and except for the circularly polarized laser hit on the conical target with angularity on the left, the Th ion beam emittance also decreases, while its beam intensity increases conversely. The linearly polarized laser, compared to the circularly polarized laser with the same laser intensity, exhibits higher beam intensity, beam emittance and energy conversion efficiency for the same type and thickness of Th target. The conical Th target with angularity on the left and intermediate thickness, compared to the flat target and conical target with angularity on the right of the same thickness, possesses both higher ion average energy up to 7 GeV and virtually the same beam intensity up to 0.8 MA under the linearly polarized laser. The results lead us to an easier way of controlling laser-accelerated high-quality heavy ion beam by switching to an optimal laser-target configuration scheme, which may enable the synthesis of superheavy nuclei in a high-temperature and high-density extreme plasma environment in astronuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Electron density structure measurements with scattered intense laser beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-pulse intense lasers have the potential to model extreme astrophysical environments in laboratories. Although there are diagnostics for energetic electrons and ions resulting from laser-plasma interactions, the diagnostics to measure velocity distribution functions at the interaction region of laser and plasma are limited. We have been developing the diagnostics of the interaction between intense laser and plasma using scattered intense laser. We performed experiments to measure electron density by observing the spatial distributions and ratio of horizontal to vertical polarization components of scattered laser beam using optical imaging. The observed ratio of polarization components is consistent with the drive laser beam indicating the observed light originates from the drive laser. Imaging of the scattered light shows the structure of electron density, the zeros moment of electron velocity distribution function, interacting with the intense laser. We observed the change of structure due to the laser pre-pulse that destroys the target before the arrival of the main pulse.</description>

      <title>A Non-planar ReBCO Test Coil with 3D-printed Aluminum Support Structure for the EPOS Stellarator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the test of a small scale, non-planar coil using non-insulated ReBCO tape wound on a 3D-printed aluminum support structure. A 3D-scan of the winding frame which was printed out of AlSi10Mg using selective laser melting, showed peak manufacturing deviations of 0.3 mm. We tested the coil with 21 turns of 3 mm wide tape cooled both by liquid nitrogen and with a cryocooler. We achieved a central field strength of up to 21 mT which agrees with the prediction suggesting that we manufactured the coil without defects. The peak field was reached at a supply current of 120 A. The current leads showed a contact resistance of $\left(2.25\pm0.13\right)\mu\Omega$. The discharge time $L/R$ was found to be 0.63 s in liquid nitrogen and 2.92 s when cooled by the cryocooler. From this we estimate a winding pack temperature of 41 K.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit interactions induced by light drag in moving media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit interactions (SOIs) of light are manifestations of coupling between components of light's angular momentum. They are at play in most basic optical processes, offering opportunities both to understand their fundamental origin and to control light in novel ways. Because SOIs become significant at subwavelength scale, they have largely been explored in the context of inhomogeneous materials exhibiting wavelength-scale structures, and notably metamaterials. Here we demonstrate that spin-orbit interactions can in fact analogously emerge in moving matter through the well-known light-dragging effects. SOIs in moving media are shown to manifest through a Berry phase induced by vorticity, which then leads to a rotation of the wave's polarization. In bringing together electrodynamics of moving media and SOIs of light, our work not only paves the way for the discovery of new fundamental effects but also uncovers novel means to harness SOIs to control light.</description>

      <title>Dark energy as a battery for magnetic field generation in plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that in the spacetime dominated by a cosmological constant, in the far region of a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, a seed magnetic field can be generated in an ambient plasma (in a state of no magnetic field) by a general-relativistic battery, which depends on the interaction of spacetime curvature with inhomogeneous plasma thermodynamics. Thus, at large distances, dark energy becomes the only gravitational source for magnetic field generation. This allows a mechanism that make dark energy manifest through its conversion to cosmic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>The effect of plasmoid drifts on the pellet rocket effect in magnetic confinement fusion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We detail here a semi-analytical model for the pellet rocket effect, which describes the acceleration of pellets in a fusion plasma due to asymmetries in the heat flux reaching the pellet surface and the corresponding ablation rate. This effect was shown in experiments to significantly modify the pellet trajectory, and projections for reactor scale devices indicate that it may severely limit the effectiveness of pellet injection methods. We account for asymmetries stemming both from plasma parameter gradients and an asymmetric plasmoid shielding caused by the drift of the ionized pellet cloud. For high temperature, reactor relevant scenarios, we find a wide range of initial pellet sizes and speeds where the rocket effect severely limits the penetration depth of the pellet. In these cases, the plasma parameter profile variations dominate the rocket effect. We find that for small and fast pellets, where the rocket effect is less pronounced, plasmoid shielding induced asymmetries dominate.</description>

      <title>Observations of Turbulence and Particle Transport at Interplanetary Shocks: Transition of Transport Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of energetic particles is intimately related to the properties of plasma turbulence, a ubiquitous dynamic process that transfers energy across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. However, the mechanisms governing the interactions between plasma turbulence and energetic particles remain incompletely understood. Here we present comprehensive observations from the upstream region of a quasi-perpendicular interplanetary (IP) shock on 2004 January 22, using data from four Cluster spacecraft to investigate the interplay between turbulence dynamics and energetic particle transport. Our observations reveal a transition in energetic proton fluxes from exponential to power-law decay with increasing distance from the IP shock. This result provides possible observational evidence of a shift in transport behavior from normal diffusion to superdiffusion. This transition correlates with an increase in the time ratio from $\tau_s/\tau_{c}&lt;1$ to $\tau_s/\tau_{c}\gg1$, where $\tau_s$ is the proton isotropization time, and $\tau_{c}$ is the turbulence correlation time. Additionally, the frequency-wavenumber distributions of magnetic energy in the power-law decay zone indicate that energetic particles excite linear Alfv\'en-like harmonic waves through gyroresonance, thereby modulating the original turbulence structure. These findings provide valuable insights for future studies on the propagation and acceleration of energetic particles in turbulent astrophysical and space plasma systems.</description>

      <title>10$^4$-fold amplification of a tiny magnetic field to megagauss scale in femtosecond, ultraintense laser-solid interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating a powerful and quasistatic magnetic field within the confines of a tabletop laboratory experiment has proven to be a persistent challenge. The creation of magnetized high-energy-density plasma through such experiments presents significant opportunities for exploring several terrestrial as well as astrophysical phenomena, apart from controlling relativistic electron transport, directly relevant for fusion schemes. Here we demonstrate that the modest magnetic field (10$^{-3}$ megagauss ) in a common, readily available Neodymium magnet is amplified to 10's of megagauss levels lasting a few picoseconds, when excited by an ultraintense, femtosecond laser pulse. The experimental findings are strongly supported by particle-in-cell simulations, which not only validate the observations but also unveil a potential dynamo mechanism responsible for the enhancement and amplification of the axial magnetic field. These outcomes are of utmost importance in comprehending the intricacies of relativistic electron transport and the realm of magnetized laboratory astrophysics.</description>
