      <title>Kinematical breaking of symmetry : A physical interpretation of Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new interpretation of the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) mechanism is proposed. According to the basic premise of relativistic quantum field theory, the primitive world before the mass generation in fermions is a relativistic many-body state of virtual massless fermion and antifermion taking both timelike and spacelike paths. In order for the many-body state to have a physical meaning independently of observers, virtual massless fermions and antifermions there should move along a common direction of time, even if they are observed from any inertial fame. As a lowest-energy-state satisfying this condition, the physical vacuum with broken symmetry is derived. Since it is a kinematical breaking of symmetry, whatever effective interaction acts on massless fermion, it generates fermion's mass in the physical vacuum, because it escapes from the role of causing symmetry breaking. In the physical vacuum, virtual massless pairs of fermion and antifermion behave as quasi bosons. Due to Bose statistics, their transverse excitations are suppressed by an energy gap, which explains the origin of the vacuum condensate in the BEH potential. As a dynamical part of the above effective interaction, a Higgs-like excitation appears. This interpretation sheds a new light on the BEH mechanism.</description>

      <title>Impossible Galaxies, the Hubble Tension and the Ricci soliton miracle,</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard model of cosmology has begun to show signs of internal inconsistencies under the relentless onslaught of precision data from the James Webb Telescope (JWST), the Hubble Telescope (HST) and other space-based observation platforms as well as those from the ground. The most statistically significant tension, the so-called Hubble Tension currently stands at between 4 {\sigma} to 6 {\sigma} statistical significance. The JWST high resolution images reveal mature and sometimes quenched galaxies at high redshifts (z&gt;6) which standard cosmological models have failed to both predict and explain. This is the impossible galaxies problem. These short comings of the standard model of cosmology have led to a plethora of new models attempting to explain the inconsistencies between theory and observation. Thus far, none of them adequately address these tensions. In this article, we demonstrate that by including a Ricci soliton into Einstein's field equations both tensions can be adequately resolved. The Ricci soliton is sourced from gravitational energy.</description>
