      <title>SymTFT actions, Condensable algebras and Categorical anomaly resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs) of non-abelian and non-invertible symmetries and the different Lagrangian algebras associated with a given Drinfeld center. For several examples we analyze the condensable algebras of the Drinfeld center to identify the intrinsically gapless symmetry protected topological (igSPT) phases. In previous work, the relation between igSPT phases and resolving anomalies by embedding an anomalous symmetry inside a larger fusion category was demonstrated. Here we present more examples of this mechanism that involve both group-like and categorical symmetries.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Hilbert spaces: invariant and co-invariant states, inner products, gauge-fixing, and BRST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hilbert spaces in theories of gravity are notoriously subtle due to the Hamiltonian constraints, particularly regarding the inner product. To demystify this subject, we review and extend a collection of ideas in canonical gravity, and connect to the sum-over-histories approach by clarifying the Hilbert space interpretation of various gravitational path integrals. We use one-dimensional (or mini-superspace) models as the simplest context to exemplify the conceptual ideas. We emphasise that a physical Hilbert space can be defined either by requiring states to be annihilated by constraint operators (e.g., the Wheeler-DeWitt equation) or by equivalence relations between wavefunctions, and explain that these two approaches are related by an inner product. We advocate that the group averaging procedure constructs the correct physical inner product. The Klein-Gordon inner product is not positive-definite, which we explain as arising from a bad gauge choice; nonetheless, it agrees with group averaging when such a problem is absent. These concepts are all embedded in the BRST/BFV formalism, which provides a systematic way to construct these and other physically equivalent inner products (e.g., from maximal-volume gauge and Gaussian averaged gauges). Finally we discuss the application of these ideas in the semi-classical approximation, including non-perturbative gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>The Making of von Neumann Algebras from Bulk Focusing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The single-trace, infinite-N algebra of an arbitrary region may or may not be a von Neumann algebra depending on the GNS sector. In this paper we identify the holographic dual of this mechanism as a consequence of the focusing of null geodesics; more precisely, this GNS sector-dependence corresponds to the well-known difference between null congruences fired from the bulk and those fired from the boundary. As part of establishing this property, we give a rigorous formulation and proof of causal wedge reconstruction for those general boundary subregions whose single trace algebras support von Neumann algebras at large-N. We discuss a possible finite-N extension and interpretation of our results as an explanation for the Hawking area theorem.</description>

      <title>A folded string dual for the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a folded string moving in rigid AdS$_2$ with imaginary radius squared as a dual of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model at its conformal fixed point. In standard AdS$_2$, the string is represented by two massless particles connected by straight string segments. The particles move at the speed of light, abruptly reversing direction at turning points. We describe the system using the lightcone coordinates of these points, with the Poisson structure obtained from the Peierls bracket. In AdS$_2$ with imaginary radius squared, quantization of the string's mass-squared in momentum-fraction space yields a P\"oschl-Teller equation, reproducing the SYK operator spectrum.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamics for group field theories II: Methods for nonequilibrium renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our earlier work, which aimed to develop methods for understanding the renormalization group of tensorial group field theories within the stochastic quantization framework. In that first study, we showed that the equations governing melonic structures, together with Ward identities, make it possible to close the hierarchy of flow equations, thereby reproducing the results of equilibrium theory. In the present work, we go further by extending the formalism to the out-of-equilibrium regime, while also examining the stability of dynamical equilibrium, specifically, potential violations of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Our objective here is purely methodological, and we focus on a simplified ``toy'' Abelian model that retains only the characteristic non-localities of group field theories.</description>

      <title>Universal relations with the non-extensive entropy in the RPS and CFT framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an in-depth investigation of the thermodynamic relations for AdS Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m black holes immersed in perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) is presented. This investigation is conducted within both the restricted phase space (RPS) and the conformal field theory (CFT) frameworks. The influence of non-extensive forms of entropy is also systematically examined. Our results demonstrate that the Goon-Penco (GP) relation for charged AdS black holes holds within both the RPS and CFT frameworks, irrespective of the specific form of entropy modification. The conclusion of the present study demonstrates that the GP relation constitutes a universal thermodynamic relation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Black Hole Shadow Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a generalized perturbative framework for gravitational shadows in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. Building upon the recent two-parameter perturbative framework of Kobialko et al. \cite{Kobialko:2024zhc}, this work extends the expansion in particle energy and metric deviation to encompass arbitrary, simultaneous deformations of all metric functions. By relaxing the common restriction of a fixed area radius ($\beta(r) = r^2$), our formalism applies to a significantly broader class of alternative gravity theories and exotic compact objects. We derive analytical formulae for the massive shadow radius up to the second order in the deformation parameter, explicitly revealing the phenomenological signatures that arise from the coupling between temporal and spatial metric perturbations. The key result is that the distinct energy dependence of the massive shadow provides a powerful method to disentangle these different types of geometric deformations, breaking observational degeneracies inherent in the photon shadow alone. We demonstrate this principle with applications to traversable wormholes and canonical scalar-tensor solutions, showing how each produces a unique, distinguishable energy-dependent fingerprint. This generalized framework provides a robust, theory-agnostic tool for testing strong-field gravity. It offers a clear methodology for reconstructing metric parameters from potential multi-messenger observations of massive particle shadows.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Asymmetry and Quantum Mpemba Effect for Non-Abelian Global Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a measure that quantifies the degree of symmetry breaking at the level of a subsystem. In this work, we investigate the entanglement asymmetry in $\widehat{su}(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and discuss the quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry, the phenomenon that the more symmetry is initially broken, the faster it is restored. Due to the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, spontaneous breaking of continuous global symmetries is forbidden in $1+1$ dimensions. To circumvent this no-go theorem, we consider excited initial states which explicitly break non-Abelian global symmetry. We particularly focus on the initial states built from primary operators in the fundamental and adjoint representations. In both cases, we study the real-time dynamics of the R\'enyi entanglement asymmetry and provide clear evidence of quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry. Furthermore, we find a new type of quantum Mpemba effect for the primary operator in the fundamental representation: increasing the rank $N$ leads to stronger initial symmetry breaking but faster symmetry restoration. Also, increasing the level $k$ leads to weaker initial symmetry breaking but slower symmetry restoration. On the other hand, no such behavior is observed for adjoint case, which may suggest that this new type of quantum Mpemba effect is not universal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantize the Friedberg-Lee-Pang-Ren (FLPR) model within the framework of Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky (BFV) formalism. We construct the nilpotent Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) charges using constraints and the fermionic gauge-fixing function by means of admissible gauge conditions. We also derive the BRST invariant effective action and corresponding symmetries of the model in both polar and Cartesian coordinates. Additionally, with the help of BRST charge, we demonstrate that the physical states of the system are annihilated by the first-class constraints, which is consistent with the Dirac formalism.</description>

      <title>Classification of standard Manin triples in dimension 4+4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four- and six-dimensional Drinfeld doubles were classified in the past in terms of Manin triples. We provide an important step towards classification of eight-dimensional Drinfeld doubles by presenting an extensive list of Manin triples formed by pairs of four-dimensional Lie algebras. Due to the high complexity of the classification we focus on Manin triples formed by algebras in a certain standard form. The list contains 188 non-isomorphic Manin triples plus their duals.
  To apply the results we construct several four-dimensional WZW models on non-semisimple Lie groups. Some of the WZW models are known from literature, but new cases are presented as well. As a consequence of the construction method the WZW models are Poisson--Lie dualizable.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy and Thermodynamics of Dynamical Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamic and entanglement properties of dynamical black holes based on the recently proposed dynamical black hole entropy by Hollands-Wald-Zhang. We first provide a direct proof that, under first order perturbations, the dynamical black hole entropy in any $f(R)$ theory equals the Wald entropy evaluated on the generalized apparent horizon. Then, we compute the gravitational entanglement entropy explicitly using both the event horizon and the apparent horizon as the entangling surfaces, and show that only the apparent horizon prescription reproduces the correct dynamical black hole entropy satisfying the physical process first law. Furthermore, we reinterpret the generalized second law by identifying the modified von Neumann entropy as the matter entanglement across the (generalized) apparent horizon. This allows us to express the total entropy as the renormalized generalized entropy evaluated on this surface for both Einstein's gravity and $f(R)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba-like effect in Unruh thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the thermal nature of the Unruh effect within a quantum thermodynamic framework. For a Unruh-deWitt (UDW) detector in $n$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, we demonstrate that its irreversible thermalization to a Gibbs equilibrium state follows distinct trajectories on the Bloch sphere, which depend on the types of fields the detector interacts with, as well as the spacetime dimensionality. Using thermodynamic process functions, particularly quantum coherence and heat that form the quantum First Law, we characterize the Unruh thermalization through a complementary time evolution between the trajectory-dependent rates of process functions. Grounded in information geometry, we further explore the kinematics of the detector state as it "flows" along the trajectory. In particular, we propose two heating/cooling protocols for the UDW detector undergoing Unruh thermalization. We observe a quantum Mpemba-like effect, characterized by faster heating than cooling in terms of Uhlmann fidelity "distance" change. Most significantly, we establish the maximum fidelity difference as a novel diagnostic that essentially distinguishes between Unruh thermalization and its classical counterpart, i.e., classical thermal bath-driven thermalization of an inertial UDW detector. This compelling criterion may serve as a hallmark of the quantum origin of the Unruh effect in future experimental detection and quantum simulation. Finally, we conclude with a general analysis of Unruh thermalization, starting from equal-fidelity non-thermal states, and demonstrate that the detectors' fidelity and "speed" of quantum evolution still exhibit a Mpemba-like behavior.</description>

      <title>Gauge Invariants at Arbitrary $N$ and Trace Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate conformal field theories with gauge group $U(N)$ at arbitrary rank $N$, focusing on the role of trace relations in determining the structure of the Hilbert space. Working in the free trace algebra without imposing relations, we identify a class of evanescent states that vanish at finite $N$. Using the Koszul complex of [1], we implement trace relations systematically via ghosts and a fermionic charge $Q_b$. This framework allows us to define and compute transition amplitudes between evanescent and physical states, which we show correspond precisely to ordinary CFT amplitudes analytically continued in $N$. Our results provide a direct algebraic realization of the proposals which realize trace relations in the bulk as over-maximal giant gravitons [1-3] and establish analytic continuation in $N$ as a powerful tool for understanding finite-$N$ effects.</description>

      <title>Worldline formalism in phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement the worldline formalism in phase space to compute scattering amplitudes. First, the Feynman rules exhibit several useful universal features, reflecting elements of the symplectic geometry of the phase space target. Next, noncompact worldline topologies automate LSZ reductions in accordance with the boundary conditions available in phase space, provided correct identifications of the associated moduli spaces. Further, employing noncanonical coordinates cubicizes the Feynman rules and manifests gauge invariance. As a result, our phase space implementation could provide a framework optimized for computing scattering amplitudes while retaining the nice features of the original formalism. For an explicit demonstration, we compute the multi-photon Compton amplitudes up to six points in the classical limit. Compton amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory and gravity are also computed in a uniform fashion by supposing the backgrounds of nonlinearly superposed plane waves.</description>

      <title>Reduction of topological invariants on null hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational helicity flux density represents the angular distribution of helicity flux in general relativity. In this work, we explore its relationship to the reduction of topological invariants at future null infinity. Contrary to initial expectations, the Pontryagin term, which contributes to the gravitational chiral anomaly, is not related to the gravitational helicity flux density. Instead, the Nieh-Yan term, another topological invariant within the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR), can reproduce this flux density. We also reduce these two topological invariants to null hypersurfaces describing near-horizon geometry. In this near-horizon context, the Pontryagin term yields a non-trivial quantity that may characterize a Carrollian fluid helicity relevant to near-horizon physics.</description>

      <title>A Celestial Soft Symmetry Algebra in the ${\cal N}=8$ Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the classical $SO({\cal N}=8)$ extended superconformal algebra between the lowest ${\cal N}=8$ multiplet in two dimensions obtained by Ademollo et al. (1976), we generalize it for the arbitrary ${\cal N}=8$ multiplet with manifest $SU(8)$ symmetry containing the bosonic $w_{1+\infty}$ algebra. By modifying this ${\cal N}=8$ supersymmetric $w_{1+\infty}$ algebra, we show that the celestial soft current algebra between the graviton, the gravitinos, the graviphotons, the graviphotinos, and the scalars in two dimensions appears in the ${\cal N}=8$ supergravity theory with $SO(8)$ (or $SU(8)$) global symmetry in four dimensions initiated by de Wit and Freedman (at Stony Brook in 1977). The twenty five couplings in this celestial algebra can be written in terms of eight arbitrary couplings via the Jacobi identity.</description>

      <title>Thermalization dynamics of finite-size quantum critical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using holographic duality, we investigate thermalization process when two finite-size quantum critical systems are brought into thermal contact along a perfectly transmitting interface. Through real-time simulations of gravitational dynamics, which are spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic and are confined within two dynamical bulk branes, we identify three distinct thermalization patterns governed by the energy imbalance (temperature difference) and system size. For systems with large size and small energy imbalance, we observe recurrent cycles of formation and collapse of non-equilibrium steady states (NESS). Under large energy imbalance, shock waves persist for a prolonged period with sustained boundary reflections, while rarefaction waves rapidly homogenize. When the system size is sufficiently small, dissipation dominates and leads to oscillatory decay without sustained NESS or shock structure. In sharp contrast to diffusive systems, we uncover that wave-propagated energy transfer together with boundary reflections enables nearly complete energy swapping between subsystems during thermalization. Our results reveal rich thermalization dynamics in finite-size quantum critical systems across spatial scales and energy gradient regimes.</description>

      <title>Holographic Reflected Entropy: Islands and Defect Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mixed state entanglement structure through the reflected entropy for disjoint radiation subsystems coupled to a 2d eternal brane world black hole in a time dependent defect AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$ scenario. Utilizing the island prescription and the defect extremal surface (DES) formula, we demonstrate a complex mixed state entanglement structure through the reflected entropy corresponding to distinct entanglement entropy phases. In each case we verify the holographic duality of the reflected entropy with the bulk entanglement wedge cross section (EWCS) and also obtain the Page curves for both the entanglement entropy and the associated reflected entropy phases. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to adjacent radiation subsystems and obtain consistent results using both the island and the DES prescription.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron-positron annihilation process is investigated within the framework of Podolsky's generalized electrodynamics at finite temperature. In this theory, a higher-derivative term modifies the photonic kinetic sector, introducing a massive mode while preserving gauge invariance. Thermal effects are incorporated using the real-time Thermo Field Dynamics formalism. The total cross section is calculated, and the individual contributions of the Podolsky parameter and thermal effects are analyzed to highlight their influence on the scattering process.</description>

Abstract: Off-shell actions for massless higher-spin $\mathcal{N}=1$ supermultiplets in five dimensions (5D) are constructed in harmonic superspace in terms of unconstrained prepotentials. Cubic couplings of these supermultiplets to the $q$-hypermultiplet are derived. We also provide a detailed derivation of the unconstrained prepotential for the 5D Weyl supermultiplet which has been used within the conformal superspace approach to $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Positivity bounds from thermal field theory entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to deriving positivity bounds on effective field theories by analyzing the thermodynamic behavior of thermal quantum field systems. Focusing on scalar theories with higher-dimensional operators, we compute the finite-temperature entropy using thermal field theory techniques. We argue that consistency with fundamental thermodynamic principles-specifically, the expectation that entropy increases with the introduction of new degrees of freedom-imposes nontrivial constraints on Wilson coefficients. In particular, we show that the coefficient of the leading dimension-8 operator must be strictly positive. This thermodynamic perspective offers an alternative to traditional S-matrix-based derivations of positivity bounds and provides fresh insight into the interplay between entropy, unitarity, and causality in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>General Relativity in IIB Matrix Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matrix models are non-perturbative formulations of string theory, from which many believe that spacetime arises. The matrix fluctuations around the spacetime thus created should represent both matter and gravitational fields. In this paper, we discuss how the gravitational field emerges from the IIB matrix model. In particular, we consider how diffeomorphism invariance arises and how unitarity is guaranteed in this theory. Specifically, we consider matrices as bilocal fields and discuss how the Lorentz-invariant vacuum and low-energy excitations around it can be expressed. We then discuss how the conditions for the theory to be unitary can be written in terms of bilocal fields. We show that in the low-energy limit, the bilocal fields are reduced to local fields consisting of a finite number of massless fields and an infinite number of massive fields, satisfying unitarity.</description>

      <title>Modulated Accelerating Mirrors as a Physical Realization of the Kappa-Gamma Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulated accelerating mirrors provide a concrete dynamical origin for the $\kappa\gamma$ vacuum-a thermal, single-mode squeezed state with a tunable angle. The Carlitz-Willey trajectory fixes the Planckian weights (set by $\kappa$), while a weak, chiral, frequency-diagonal boundary drive-equivalently a time-dependent Robin impedance-rotates the squeeze angle (set by $\gamma$) without changing those weights at leading order. On future null infinity, the two-point function cleanly splits into a stationary thermal piece and a phase-sensitive, non-stationary piece. Inertial Unruh-DeWitt detectors see an exact Planck law; uniformly accelerated detectors expose $\gamma$ through interference and can show mode-selective suppression under frequency matching. Numerical wave-packet simulations corroborate the phase imprint and parametric amplification. In short: trajectory sets scale, boundary sets angle. This separation turns abstract squeeze parameters into laboratory-tunable signatures and offers a practical route to engineer and diagnose $\kappa\gamma$ vacua in moving-mirror analogs.</description>

      <title>NSVZ-Compatible Three-Loop Gauge $\beta$-Functions and Regulator-Driven Scheme Structure in Supersymmetric Theories with Exponential Higher Covariant Derivative Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the three-loop gauge $\beta$-functions in general $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories regularized by higher covariant derivatives (HCD) supplemented with Pauli--Villars subtraction. The all-structure three-loop form is known in the HCD framework (e.g.~\cite{Kazantsev2020,Haneychuk2022,Haneychuk2025}) and involves regulator-dependent parameters. Here we evaluate these parameters explicitly for the exponential regulators $R(x)=e^{x^n}$ and $F(x)=e^{x^m}$. We obtain the constants $A(n)$ and $B(m)$ in closed form, together with their large-$n,m$ asymptotics, and substitute them into the general three-loop expressions. This yields fully explicit, regulator-parameterized $\beta$-functions and a systematic expansion in $1/n$ and $1/m$ that cleanly organizes finite, scheme-dependent terms. We then exhibit finite coupling redefinitions that map the renormalized $\overline{\mathrm{DR}}$ result to an NSVZ-compatible scheme. Our analysis clarifies how exponential higher-derivative regulators preserve the NSVZ relation at the bare level and illustrates the regulator-driven structure of supersymmetric RG flows.</description>

      <title>The Higgs Field Governs the Interior Spacetime of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Higgs field is conventionally treated as a small local perturbation atop a large, constant vacuum value that uniformly permeates the universe. I propose instead that in regions of extreme gravitational intensity -- such as near gravitational singularities -- the Higgs field behaves in a profoundly non-perturbative manner. In such environments, spacetime and the Higgs field engage in a dynamic interplay that extends spacetime beyond the singularity, achieving geodesic completeness. The continuation beyond the singularity is dominated by antigravity effects, reshaping the causal structure of spacetime and enabling novel flows of matter and information, including traversal through singularities. In its standard form, the combined framework of the Standard Model (SM) and General Relativity (GR), as well as most of its extensions, fails to capture these phenomena due to its geodesic incompleteness. By contrast, a refined, locally conformal-symmetric formulation -- denoted i(SM+GR) -- naturally incorporates these effects. GR is not an optional component of i(SM+GR) but an essential ingredient. This framework preserves the empirical success of SM+GR in the low-energy regime while predicting striking new phenomena in extreme gravitational settings, including within black holes (on both sides of the singularity) and in pre--Big Bang cosmology. At the classical field theory level, i(SM+GR) offers fresh perspectives on the black hole information puzzle and provides a platform for locally scale-invariant generalizations, such as geodesically complete quantum field theory, string theory, and unified models of fundamental interactions. This paper presents the detailed derivations and explanations that underlie a condensed letter version recently published in [1].</description>

      <title>Impact of space-time curvature coupling on the vacuum energy induced by a magnetic topological defect in flat space-time of arbitrary dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated vacuum polarization of a quantized charged massive scalar field in the presence of a magnetic topological defect, modeled as an impenetrable tube of finite thickness carrying magnetic flux. At the tube's surface, we imposed a generalized Robin boundary condition. Our analysis demonstrates that, in flat space-time, the total induced vacuum energy is independent of the coupling $\xi$ of the scalar field's interaction with the space-time curvature only in the special cases of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. For general Robin boundary conditions, however, the total induced vacuum energy depends on the coupling $\xi$ in a flat space-time and exhibits a nontrivial dependence on the parameter of the Robin boundary condition. We investigated the dependence of this effect not only on Robin's boundary condition parameter, but also on the tube thickness and the space-time dimensionality. We conclude that careful measurements of vacuum polarization effects in flat space-time may, in principle, provide an independent way to probe the $\xi$ coupling.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the renormalizability of interacting quantum field theory on the curved-space background with an additional external antisymmetric tensor (two-form) field requires nonminimal interaction of the antisymmetric field with quantum fermions and scalars. The situation is qualitatively similar to the metric and torsion background. In both cases, one can explore the renormalization group running for the parameters of nonminimal interaction and see how this interaction behaves in the UV limit. General considerations are confirmed by the one-loop calculations in the well-known gauge model based on the $SU(2)$ gauge group.</description>

      <title>Unitary equivalence in Generalized Uncertainty Principle theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the fundamental issue of unitary equivalence within the framework of Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) theories in the one-dimensional case. Given a deformed Heisenberg algebra, its representation in terms of the Hilbert space and quantum conjugate operators is not uniquely determined. This raises the question of whether two different realizations of the same algebra are equivalent and thus whether they describe the same physics. Having agreed on the formal definition of a quantum GUP theory, we establish the conditions that must be satisfied to discuss unitary equivalence. We use this framework to rigorously prove that two of the main representations used in the literature are actually unitarily equivalent, and we specify the conditions that must be met for this equivalence to hold. We explicitly demonstrate unitary equivalence by providing the unitary map and then discuss two relevant physical examples, the quantum harmonic oscillator and the quantum particle in free fall, showing, for each of them, how both GUP formulations yield the same physical results. Finally, we discuss the relationship between these standard GUP representations and the polymer-like representation, inspired by Polymer Quantum Mechanics and related to Loop Quantum Cosmology. We show that, whenever a GUP theory leads to the emergence of a minimal length, these formulations are not unitarily equivalent and therefore describe different quantum physics. This is particularly relevant, as it may indicate that a generalization of the Stone-von Neumann theorem, which holds in ordinary Quantum Mechanics, may not be possible in the GUP framework, at least within our definition of unitary equivalence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, we investigate the vacuum structure of an extended standard model with a $U(1)_D$ global symmetry. The scalar sector consists of three $SU(2)$ doublets as well as one complex singlet and one real singlet, resulting in a more complicated vacuum structure compared to that of the Standard Model. We analyze various theoretical constraints, including the conditions for being bounded from below, the existence of a global minimum, and perturbativity up to the Planck scale. Additionally, we consider experimental constraints from the Higgs invisible decay. Through a detailed statistical analysis using numerical methods, we show that the extended scalar potential can accommodate a stable vacuum while satisfying both theoretical and experimental constraints for a small region of the parameter space.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the anomalous Chromomagnetic Dipole Moment (CMDM), $\hat{\mu}_t^{\mathrm{BLHM}}$, of the top quark within the Bestest Little Higgs Model (BLHM). Our study incorporates novel interactions arising from the extended CKM matrix in the BLHM and explores a broad region of the experimentally allowed parameter space, yielding CMDM values on the order of $10^{-3}$. This result represents an improvement over previous CMDM calculations within the BLHM and makes it competitive with other beyond the Standard Model scenarios. Experimental and model parameter uncertainties are considered and propagated through our calculations, using a Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>The 21 cm forest one-dimensional power spectrum as a probe of dark matter particles and primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of dark matter (DM) particles remains a pivotal challenge in modern cosmology. Current cosmological research on these phenomena primarily utilizes cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and other late-time probes, which predominantly focus on large scales. We introduce a novel probe, the 21 cm forest signal, which can be used to investigate DM properties on small scales during the epoch of reionization, thereby addressing the gap left by other cosmological probes. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation from PBHs, can heat the intergalactic medium (IGM). This heating suppresses the amplitude of the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. Therefore, the 1D power spectrum provides an effective method for constraining DM properties. However, astrophysical heating processes in the early universe can also affect the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. In this work, we assess the potential of using the SKA to observe the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum for constraining DM properties, under the assumption that astrophysical heating can be constrained reliably by other independent probes. Under low astrophysical heating conditions, the 1D power spectrum could constrain the DM annihilation cross section and decay lifetime to $\langle\sigma v\rangle \sim {10^{-31}}\,{\rm cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$ and $\tau \sim {10^{30}}\,{\rm s}$ for ${10}\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles, and probe PBHs with masses $\sim {10^{15}}\,{\rm\,g}$ at abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \simeq 10^{-13}$. These constraints represent improvements of 5-6 orders of magnitude over current limits. Furthermore, the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum has the potential to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe PBHs with masses above $10^{18}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how quantum features of spacetime, specifically the curvature of momentum space, can backreact on classical gravity in a semiclassical (2+1)D setting with a negative cosmological constant. Starting from a first-order action, we derive an effective configuration-space action, revealing mass-dependent geodesics and a mild violation of the equivalence principle. Coupling this modified matter source to Einstein gravity, we obtain a corrected BTZ black hole, with ADM mass, Hawking temperature, and entropy acquiring explicit corrections and upper bounds dictated by the momentum-space geometry. We also compute the return time of a massless particle along null geodesics, illustrating observable signatures of underlying quantum-spacetime structures. Our results provide a concrete semiclassical framework showing how Planck-scale kinematic modifications leave imprints on classical geometry.</description>

      <title>Lovelock type brane cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological implications of the geodetic brane gravity model, enhanced by geometrical terms of Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) type and Gibbons-Hawking-York-Myers type (GHYM), carefully constructed as combinations of intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures, are examined. All the geometrical terms under study belong to a set named Lovelock-type brane models. The combined model gives rise to a second-order differential equation of motion. Under a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) geometry defined on a $(3+1)$-dimensional world volume, together with a perfect fluid matter content, the emerging universe of this model evolves in a 5-dimensional Minkowski background, yielding peculiar facts. The resulting Friedmann-type equation is written in terms of energy density parameters, where fine-tuning is needed to probe interesting cosmological processes close to the current data. In this sense, Lovelock-type brane models might underlie the cosmic acceleration. Indeed, we find that these correction terms become significant at low energies/late times. The model exhibits self-accelerating (non-self-accelerating) behavior for the brane expansion, and in the case where the radiation-like contribution due to the existence of the extra dimension vanishes its behavior is the same as the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) brane cosmology and its generalization to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) brane gravity. Likewise, Einstein cosmology is recovered when the radiation-like contribution fades away along with the odd polynomials in brane extrinsic curvature.</description>

      <title>Equality of ADM mass and generalized Komar energy in asymptotically-flat dynamical spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find a relation between the ADM mass and a generalized Komar energy in asymptotically-flat spacetime. We do not need to assume the existence of either a Killing or even asymptotically-Killing vector field. Instead, our generalized Komar energy is constructed from the normal evolution vector (the lapse function times the future-directed unit normal to the spacelike hypersurfaces on which the ADM mass is measured). We find equality between the ADM mass and this generalized Komar energy even for dynamical asymptotically-flat spacetimes provided the 3-dimensional Einstein tensor drops off quickly enough at spatial infinity, in particular, whenever ${}^{(3)}G_{ij}=o(r^{-3})$. No additional assumptions are required for equality. As this generalized energy is fully covariant, it may provide a powerful tool for analyzing energy content in dynamical spacetimes containing compact objects.</description>

      <title>Quantization of bounded symplectic domains associated with compact Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic quantization scheme for bounded symplectic domains of the form $D \times G \subset T^\ast G$, where $D \subset \mathfrak{g}^\ast$ is a bounded region defined by algebraic inequalities and $G$ is a compact Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. The finiteness of the symplectic volume implies that quantization yields a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, with observables represented by Hermitian matrices, for which we provide an explicit realization. Boundary effects necessitate modifications of the standard von Neumann and Dirac conditions, which usually underlie the correspondence principle. Physically, the compact group $G$ plays the role of momentum space, while $\mathfrak{g}^\ast$ corresponds to the (noncommutative) position space of a particle. The assumption of compact momentum space has profound physical consequences, including the supertunneling phenomenon and the emergence of a maximal fermion density.</description>

      <title>Classification of Higgs sectors from group theoretical properties of UV gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended Higgs sectors are often introduced to explain phenomena beyond the standard model (BSM). The existence of multiple scalar fields may cause the Landau pole below the Planck scale. In this case, the low-energy theory may be replaced by an asymptotic-free gauge theory. In this paper, we consider an $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge theory with confinement as such an ultra-violate theory of the extended Higgs sectors. We investigate the relation between scalar particle contents at the low energy and group theoretical properties of fundamental fermions of the gauge theory. We find that particle contents of various extended Higgs sectors previously proposed to explain the BSM problems are deduced by each charge assignment of flavor symmetry of the fundamental fermions of the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge symmetry. Our findings may provide a new picture for the ultra-violate completion of the extended Higgs sectors.</description>

      <title>Kinetic equation from Landau level basis: Beyond relaxation-time approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to formulate a kinetic theory describing transport properties of electrons in a uniform magnetic field of arbitrary magnitude. Exposing an electronic system to a constant magnetic field quenches its energy bands into a series of discrete energy levels, known as Landau levels. The Landau-level states, exact solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation in a constant background magnetic field, are natural and suitable basis to use, especially, for the investigation of strong-magnetic-field phenomena. Starting from the Keldysh formalism, we derive the quantum kinetic equation from the Landau-level basis. As an illustration, we apply the kinetic equation to calculate the electrical conductivity of a two-dimensional electron gas exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: In this perspective review, we present a concise yet multifaceted overview of the pivotal role played by the the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio across various physical contexts. After summarizing some of the main aspects of the bound obtained by Kovtun, Son and Starinets, we examine potential sources of its violation, exploring the insights these may offer and their connections to fundamental causality conditions. We also review a range of experimental tests conducted in diverse, yet complementary, physical systems, discussing the prospects opened by upcoming measurements.</description>

      <title>To Break or Not to Break: A Review of a No-Go Theorem on Chiral Symmetry Breaking in QCD-like Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a pedagogical review of some recent progress in rigorously proving chiral symmetry breaking in a class of QCD-like theories that closely resemble the real-world QCD, namely the $SU(N_c)$ Yang-Mills theory coupled to $N_f$ flavors of massless quarks in the fundamental representation. Based on 't Hooft anomaly matching and persistent mass conditions, a general no-go theorem is formulated: assuming that the theory flows in the infrared to a fully color-screened, infrared-free phase described by color-singlet hadrons, symmetry and anomaly constraints necessarily imply spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking; conversely, any phase with unbroken chiral symmetry must retain unscreened color charges, thereby ruling out a fully color-singlet hadron description in the infrared. While these results have been widely assumed, the recent developments reviewed here establish them with a new level of rigor. The persistent mass condition, carefully formulated here, plays a central role, just as it does in the Vafa-Witten theorem on unbroken vectorlike symmetries.</description>

      <title>Rectifying Power-law $F(R)$ Gravity and Starobinsky Inflation Deformations in View of ACT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we aim to provide a consistent theoretical framework that revives the power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation framework in the Jordan frame. It is known in the literature that the power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation of the form $F(R)=R+\beta R^n$ is non-viable and produces a power-law evolution. We demonstrate that the standard approach in power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation is flawed for many reasons and we introduce a new framework which elevates the role of power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation, making it viable and compatible with both the Planck and ACT data. In our framework the power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation is disentangled from a power-law evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study local unitary invariants of a multi-partite quantum state that are monotonic, on average, under local operations and classical communication (locc). In particular we focus on local unitary invariants that are constructed out of polynomials in the state and its conjugate - called multi-invariants. Multi-invariants are labeled by certain types of graphs. Recently, in \cite{Gadde:2024jfi}, the authors related the condition of monotonicity under locc to a graph theoretic condition on the multi-invariant called edge-convexity. In this paper, we conjecture a complete classification of edge-convex multi-invariants. The conjecture states that the edge-convex multi-invariants are labeled by finite Coxeter groups. We prove this conjecture for all but six cases.</description>

      <title>Resonance in black hole ringdown: Benchmarking quasinormal mode excitation and extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how resonant excitation near exceptional points manifests in Kerr black hole ringdown waveforms and examine its extraction. Using waveforms generated by localized initial data, where quasinormal mode amplitudes are given solely by excitation factors, we establish a controlled benchmark for overtone extraction. Applying an iterative fitting method with mirror modes, we analyze a mild resonance in the $(l,m)=(2,2)$ multipole and a sharp resonance in the $(3,1)$ multipole occurring as part of a sequence of successive resonances. For $(2,2)$, we extract the fundamental mode, the first three overtones, and the fundamental mirror mode with relative errors below $10\%$, and show that residual waveforms exhibit the expected damped sinusoids together with distinctive resonance signatures. For $(3,1)$, we demonstrate that resonances can not only amplify but also reduce QNM excitations, reshaping the overtone hierarchy and rendering the sharp resonance more pronounced in ringdown. Our results clarify the imprint of resonance in Kerr ringdown and highlight both the robustness and limitations of current extraction techniques, providing a foundation for more reliable extraction of higher overtones and for applications to observational data analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective one-body (EOB) theory provides an innovative framework for analyzing the dynamics of binary systems, as articulated by Hamilton's equations. This paper investigates a self-consistent EOB theory specifically tailored for the dynamics of such systems. Our methodology begins by emphasizing how to effectively utilize the metrics derived from scattering angles in the analysis of binary black hole mergers. We then construct an effective Hamiltonian and formulate a decoupled, variable-separated Teukolsky-like equation for $\psi^B_4$. Furthermore, we present the formal solution to this equation, detailing the energy flux, radiation-reaction force (RRF), and waveforms for the ``plus" and ``cross" modes generated by spinless binaries. Finally, we carry out numerical calculations using the EOB theory and compare the results with numerical relativity (NR) data from the SXS collaboration. The results indicate that to the innermost stable circular orbit, the binding energy -- angular momentum relation differs from the NR results by less than $5$\textperthousand, with a larger mass ratio yielding better agreement.</description>

      <title>Core or Halo? Two-Fluid Analysis of Dark Matter-Admixed Quarkyonic Stars in the Multi-Messenger Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we explore dark matter (DM) admixed quarkyonic stars (DAQSs) within a two-fluid formalism, where the normal/visible sector is modeled by a quarkyonic equation of state (EOS) in the Effective Relativistic Mean Field (E-RMF) framework and the DM component is treated as a degenerate fermionic gas with scalar and vector self-interactions. Our analysis begins with the mass-radius (M-R) relation, showing that the inclusion of DM enables stellar configurations to reach the mass range compatible with the GW190814 event. We identify both DM core and DM halo morphologies among the viable EOSs, with core dominated and halo dominated cases exhibiting distinct signatures. By fixing the stellar mass within the GW190814 range, we constrain the possible dark matter fractions and explore the role of different interaction channels. Using the EOSs consistent with these constraints, we further investigate the tidal deformability ($\Lambda$), moment of inertia (MOI), and stellar radius, finding broad agreement with constraints from GW170817, GW190814, and NICER. Finally, we compile the characteristic properties of DAQSs, including EOS type, DM fractions, morphology (core vs halo), and macroscopic observables in a comparative summary. This study provides a unified two-fluid framework to explore dense QCD matter and dark matter in the multi-messenger era, suggesting that the GW190814 secondary object could plausibly be interpreted as either a DM core or a DM halo quarkyonic star.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong magnetic fields of neutron stars are closely linked to their observed thermal, spectral, and timing properties, such as the distribution of spin periods and their derivatives. To understand the evolution of astrophysical observables over time, it is essential to develop robust theoretical frameworks and numerical models that solve the coupled thermal and magnetic field evolution equations, incorporating detailed microphysical inputs like thermal and electrical conductivities and neutrino emission rates. These efforts are key to uncovering how the strength and geometry of magnetic fields change with age, ultimately shedding light on the diverse phenomenology of neutron stars. In this review, we outline the fundamental theory underlying magneto-thermal evolution models, with an emphasis on numerical methods and a comprehensive set of benchmark tests intended to guide current and future code development. We revisit established results from axisymmetric simulations, highlight recent progress in fully three-dimensional models, and offer a perspective on the anticipated developments in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

Abstract: Recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), when combined with Planck and DESI datasets, indicate a scalar spectral index $n_s$ larger than that reported in the Planck 2018 baseline, thereby challenging conventional Starobinsky-type ($\alpha$-attractor) inflationary scenarios at the $2\sigma$ level. In addition, the positive running of the spectral index $\alpha_s$ implied by the data provides strong constraints on these models. In this paper, we explore the possibility that the presence of an additional heavy field during inflation, with a mass of order the Hubble scale and a sizable mixing coupling to the inflaton, can reconcile such inflationary models with the ACT results by increasing both $n_s$ and $\alpha_s$, particularly in the strong-mixing regime. Furthermore, we extend this framework to traditional inflation models such as chaotic inflation and natural inflation, which have already been excluded by Planck alone, and show that they can be revived in certain regions of parameter space. Inflationary observables, including the spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the running $\alpha_s$, are computed within the single-field EFT approach, which is applicable even in the presence of a heavy field with large mixing. We also discuss the non-Gaussianity signatures arising from the heavy field, noting that parts of the parameter space are already excluded or can be tested in future observations. Finally, we present concrete model realizations that allow for such a large mixing.</description>

      <title>Toward Axion Signal Extraction in Semiconductor Spin Qubits Via Spectral Engineering</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum sensing and computational technologies indicate the possibility of improving the precision of measurements aimed at detecting cosmological particles and weakly interacting massive particles using various qubit platforms. While recent progress has been made, mitigating environmental noise remains a challenge in extracting particle parameters with high fidelity. Addressing these challenges requires efforts on two levels. At the device level, the qubit and its array acting as a probe, must be isolated from electrical and magnetic noise through optimized device geometry. At the signal-processing level, it is necessary to develop filtering methods targeting specific noise spectra based on different qubit architectures. In this work, we explore the possibility of using semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits as a platform to search for quantum chromodynamics axions and, more broadly, axion like particles (ALPs). Starting by deriving an effective Hamiltonian for electron-axion interactions, we identify an axion-induced effective magnetic field and determine the characteristic axion oscillation frequency. To suppress charge noise in the devices and environmental noise, we first analyze the charge noise spectrum and then develop a dedicated filtering and noise-reduction protocol, paving the way for exploring feasible axion mass ranges. Our preliminary study holds promise for enhancing the screening of various axion signals using quantum technologies. We expect that our analysis and filtering protocol can help advance the use of semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit arrays in axion detection.</description>

      <title>Transverse momentum Resummation and Analytic continuation into the Deep Infrared</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting information on the three-dimensional structure of hadrons from transverse-momentum data is a challenging task, requiring the separation of perturbative contributions under QCD control from genuinely non-perturbative effects, unavoidably affected by phenomenological bias. Standard approaches model transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) observables in impact-parameter space and compare them with data after Fourier inversion, generating an interplay between perturbative terms, non-perturbative models, and prescriptions used to extend perturbation theory beyond its natural domain. In this work, a consistent methodology to perform the Fourier inversion analytically is proposed, achieving a solid resummation of TMD parton distributions and cross sections directly in transverse-momentum space. The resummation is carried out to next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy, validated against alternative prescriptions, and tested on experimental data. This framework provides a systematic procedure to analytically continue observables into the deep infrared, identifying two primary sources of non-perturbative effects: the low energy behavior of the strong coupling and of the parton distribution functions. This points to a paradigm shift in TMD phenomenology, where the structure of hadrons emerges from the dynamics of QCD itself rather than from flexible parametrizations with only indirect physical interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1805.06467v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Six-dimensional superconformal field theories (6D SCFTs) occupy a central place in the study of quantum field theories encountered in high energy theory. This article reviews the top down construction and study of this rich class of quantum field theories, in particular, how they are realized by suitable backgrounds in string / M- / F-theory. We review the recent F-theoretic classification of 6D SCFTs, explain how to calculate physical quantities of interest such as the anomaly polynomial of 6D SCFTs, and also explain recent progress in understanding renormalization group flows for deformations of such theories. Additional topics covered by this review include some discussion on the (weighted and signed) counting of states in these theories via superconformal indices. We also include several previously unpublished results as well as a new variant on the swampland conjecture for general quantum field theories decoupled from gravity. The aim of the article is to provide a point of entry into this growing literature rather than an exhaustive overview.</description>

Abstract: This study introduces a high-order perturbation methodology to categorize two primary solution types within duality-invariant nonlinear electrodynamic theories, adhering to the differential self-duality criterion. The first solution type aligns with irrelevant stress tensor flows, resembling $T\bar{T}$ dynamics, and the second involves a blend of irrelevant $T\bar{T}$-like and marginal root-$T\bar{T}$-like deformations. Our approach facilitates the investigation of diverse duality-invariant nonlinear electrodynamics theories and their stress tensor flows and confirms the commutativity of flows initiated by irrelevant and marginal operators.</description>

      <title>The 3d $A$-model and generalised symmetries, Part I: bosonic Chern-Simons theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 3d $A$-model is a two-dimensional approach to the computation of supersymmetric observables of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories. In principle, it allows us to compute half-BPS partition functions on any compact Seifert three-manifold (as well as of expectation values of half-BPS lines thereon), but previous results focussed on the case where the gauge group $\widetilde G$ is a product of simply-connected and/or unitary gauge groups. We are interested in the more general case of a compact gauge group $G=\widetilde G/\Gamma$, which is obtained from the $\widetilde G$ theory by gauging a discrete one-form symmetry. In this paper, we discuss in detail the case of pure $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons theories (without matter) for simple groups $G$. When $G=\widetilde G$ is simply-connected, we demonstrate the exact matching between the supersymmetric approach in terms of Seifert fibering operators and the 3d TQFT approach based on topological surgery in the infrared Chern-Simons theory $\widetilde G_k$, including through the identification of subtle counterterms that relate the two approaches. We then extend this discussion to the case where the Chern-Simons theory $G_k$ can be obtained from $\widetilde G_k$ by the condensation of abelian anyons which are bosonic. Along the way, we revisit the 3d $A$-model formalism by emphasising its 2d TQFT underpinning.</description>

      <title>Generalized $T\bar{T}$-like flows for scalar theories in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the necessary condition for $SO(N) \times SO(N)$ duality invariance manifests as a partial differential equation in two-dimensional scalar theories. This condition, expressed as a partial differential equation, corresponds precisely to the integrability condition. We derive a general perturbation solution to this partial differential equation, which includes both a root $T\bar{T}$ flow equation and an irrelevant $T\bar{T}$-like flow equation. Additionally, we identify a general form for these flow equations that commute with each other. Our results establish a general integrable theory characterized by theory-dependent coefficients at each order in the $\lambda$-expansion. This unified framework systematically classifies all integrable theories possessing two Lorentz-invariant variables ($P_1$, $P_2$) while accommodating arbitrary orders of the coupling constants ($\lambda$, $\gamma$). The theory provides a comprehensive classification scheme that encompasses both known and novel integrable systems within this class.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the extremality relations by examining perturbative corrections to both the entropy of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes and their extremality bounds under the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) and the extended uncertainty principle (EUP) respectively under the Nariai limit. We argue that the corrected uncertainty principles including GUP and EUP violate the validity of extremality relations because no matching condition can be imposed to support the Goon-Penco relation unless the influences from GUP and EUP disappear.</description>

      <title>Restricting One-Loop radiative effects in quantum gravity: Demonstrating 4D GR as an EFT and its consistent unification with the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09796v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ``On restricting to one-loop order the radiative effects in quantum gravity" (Brandt, Frenkel, and McKeon, 2020) \cite{Brandt2020}, a Lagrange multiplier (LM) field is introduced into the Einstein-Hilbert action, removing all multi-loop graviton diagrams and confining quantum-gravity corrections to just one loop. The resulting one-loop effective action carries a term proportional to {$\ln(\mu/\Lambda)$}, which they suggest could be experimentally determined, hinting at direct measurements of quantum-gravity effects. We {demonstrate}, however, that {$\mu$ and $\Lambda$} emerge from a chosen renormalization scheme, not from physical observables, implying that {$\ln(\mu/\Lambda)$} signals a finite UV cutoff in this ``LM renormalization scheme.'' Although Newton's constant remains fixed (no running of {$G_N$}), the resulting logarithmic dependence encodes a limited domain of validity for General Relativity (GR) in four dimensions, thereby demonstrating explicitly that 4D GR behaves as an effective field theory (EFT) for energies below the cutoff. {Using the Appelquist-Carazzone decoupling theorem, we prove mathematically that this framework has a well-defined low-energy limit.} We then illustrate how this truncated, renormalized gravity sector can be consistently unified with the Standard Model (SM), yielding a finite and renormalized EFT encompassing both gravity and particle physics up to a scale {$\Lambda_{\text{grav}}$}. As such, we term this unification as the USMEG-EFT (Unified Standard Model with Emergent Gravity-EFT) framework. Our work represents a breakthrough in theoretical physics with a first successful unification of gravity with the Standard Model through a fully renormalizable and EFT framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational signatures of vorton configurations, considering the circular vorton, the Kibble-Turok vorton, and a newly proposed class that incorporates simultaneous excitations of the first, second, and third harmonic modes. Working within the weak-field and thin-lens approximations, we demonstrate that circular vortons produce a sharp lensing discontinuity that separates two regions with qualitatively distinct distortions. The corresponding Einstein ring co-exists alongside an almost undistorted source image. This effect is significantly amplified in the case of non-circular vortons, where asymmetries and higher-harmonic deformations amplify the discontinuity and lead to complex image structures. This distinctive lensing patterns offer potential discriminants between different vorton configurations, suggesting that future high-resolution surveys may provide a novel window into the microphysics of current-carrying cosmic strings.</description>

Abstract: We compute the half-wormhole contribution in a complex SYK model with one time point. When the chemical potential is zero, the result is similar to two decoupled Majorana SYK models. There's a disk contribution in a single copy of the model, which is a bit subdominant to the unlinked half-wormhole. After removing out the disk we find out the linked half-wormhole which restores the factorization in the two copies of the complex SYK model. When the chemical potential is small, the disk gets more enhancement than the wormhole and the half-wormhole. When the chemical potential is finite comparing to the random coupling, thd disk dominates so that there's no wormhole and half-wormhole.</description>

Abstract: We study quantum M2-branes in holographic backgrounds and show that their moduli spaces of zero-modes are localised according to an R-symmetry Killing vector. We discuss the relation with recent results in the context of equivariant localisation in gauged supergravity and argue its origin within M-theory path integrals expanded in saddle points over M2-branes. We argue that the M2-brane partition function, including its non-perturbative corrections, should be compared to the field theory grand canonical partition function. Our results extend recent observations in the context of the giant graviton expansion of superconformal indices to generic supersymmetric AdS boundary conditions. As a byproduct we predict non-perturbative corrections to a variety of supersymmetric observables of the ABJM theory.</description>

      <title>Root-$T\bar{T}$ Deformations on Causal Self-Dual Electrodynamic Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-dual condition, which ensures invariance under electromagnetic duality, manifests as a partial differential equation in nonlinear electromagnetism theories. The general solution to this equation is expressed in terms of an auxiliary field, $\tau$, and Courant-Hilbert functions, $\ell(\tau)$, which depend on $\tau$. Recent studies have shown that duality-invariant nonlinear electromagnetic theories fulfill the principle of causality under the conditions $\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial \tau} \ge 1$ and $\frac{\partial^2 \ell}{\partial \tau^2} \ge 0$.
  In this paper, we investigate theories with two coupling constants that also comply with the principle of causality. We demonstrate that these theories possess a new universal representation of the root-$T\bar{T}$ operator. Additionally, we derive marginal and irrelevant flow equations for the logarithmic causal self-dual electrodynamics and identify a symmetry referred to as $\alpha$-symmetry, which is present in all these models.</description>

Abstract: By generalizing the construction of genuine multi-entropy ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for genuine multi-partite entanglement proposed in the previous paper arXiv:2502.07995, we give a prescription on how to construct ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ systematically for any $\mathtt{q}$. The crucial point is that our construction naturally fits to the partition number $p(\mathtt{a})$ of integer $\mathtt{a}$. For general $\mathtt{q}$, ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ contains $N (\mathtt{q}) = p(\mathtt{q})-p(\mathtt{q}-1)-1$ number of free parameters. Furthermore, these give $N (\mathtt{q})+1$ number of new diagnostics for genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite entanglement. Especially for $\mathtt{q}=4$ case, this reproduces not only the known diagnostics pointed out by arXiv:1406.2663, but also a new diagnostics for quadripartite entanglement. We also study these ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for $\mathtt{q} = 4, 5$ in holography and show that these are of the order of ${\cal{O}}\left(1/G_N \right)$ both analytically and numerically. Our results give evidence that genuine multipartite entanglement is ubiquitous in holography. We discuss the connection to quantum error correction and the role of genuine multipartite entanglement in bulk reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Mutual information and holographic entanglement entropy for strongly-coupled R-charged plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically evaluate, for slab entangling geometries, the mutual information and the holographic entanglement entropy between strongly interacting fields in different spatial regions for two different conformal holographic models at finite temperature and R-charge density. The 1 R-Charge Black Hole (1RCBH) model describes a strongly interacting fluid with a critical point in its phase diagram, while the 2 R-Charge Black Hole (2RCBH) model has no critical point. In both models, we find that the mutual information tends to be overall reduced by increasing the value of $\mu/T$ at larger values of the separation length $x$ between two disjoint spatial regions of the medium, while the opposite tendency is observed at lower values of $x$. We also observe that very close to the critical point of the 1RCBH model, the mutual information tends to increase with increasing $\mu/T$ in the stable branch of black hole solutions. Moreover, the mutual information between the fields in the two disjoint regions is observed to be enhanced by increasing the characteristic size $\ell$ of these regions, with such an enhancement asymptotically saturating, thus suggesting the existence of a finite field correlation length between the disjoint regions of the system. The finite part of the entanglement entropy may change sign depending on the values of $\mu/T$ and $\ell$, and it correctly detects the critical point of the 1RCBH model, a feature that is also adequately detected by the mutual information.</description>

Abstract: Using an infinitesimal approach, this work addresses the renormalization problem to deal with the ultraviolet divergences arising in quantum field theory. Under the assumption that the action has already been renormalized to yield an ultraviolet-finite effective action that satisfies a certain set of renormalization conditions, we analyze how the action must be adjusted to reproduce a first-order change in these renormalization conditions. The analysis then provides the change that is induced on the correlation functions of the theory. This program is successfully carried out in the case of super-renormalizable theories, namely, a scalar field with cubic interaction in four space-time dimensions and with quartic interaction in three space-time dimensions. Relying on existing results in the theory of perturbative renormalization, we derive explicit renormalized expressions for these theories, each of which involves only a finite number of graphs constructed with full propagators and full $n$-point vertices. The renormalizable case is analyzed as well; the derived expressions are ultraviolet finite as the regulator is removed but cannot be written without a regulator. In this sense, the renormalization is not fully explicit in the renormalizable case. Nevertheless, a perturbative solution of the equations starting from the free theory provides the renormalized Feynman graphs, similar to the BPHZ program. For compatibility with the preservation of the renormalization conditions, a projective renormalization scheme, as opposed to a minimal one, is also introduced. The ideas developed are extended to the study of the renormalization of composite operators and the Schwinger-Dyson equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous studies of linearized stability of asymptotically flat Euclidean axion wormholes found that symmetric modes suffered from divergences. We show that such divergences were an artifact of a particular way of solving the constraints, and that a full treatment leads to finite actions for such modes. The modes must thus be included in a stability analysis. However, since the action for these modes turns out to be positive, this turns out not to affect previous statements about stability of axion wormholes. We also introduce a technique that allows us to show this positivity at a pseudo-analytic level that avoids heavy numerics. Our techniques should be useful to future studies of stabilities of other wormholes as well.</description>

Abstract: We investigate dyonic black holes in a weak field expansion of non-linear electrodynamics. The breadth of parameter space permits a rich thermodynamic structure, additional turning points and intricate phase phenomena. Energy conditions are employed to ensure the physical viability of solutions. Analytic special cases illustrate novel properties of black holes in non-linear electrodynamics, including modified extremal limit behaviour. Numerical solutions offer the most elaborate thermodynamic landscape, culminating in up to five turning points, and multiple reentrant phase transitions.</description>

      <title>A Tunable Unruh Effect: Accelerated Detectors in Kappa-Rindler Vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the response of an accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector to a one-parameter family of ``kappa Rindler'' vacua, which generalize the standard Unruh effect. These states, parameterized by $\kappa$, continuously interpolate between the Rindler ($\kappa \to 0$) and Minkowski ($\kappa=1$) vacua. We find the detector registers a perfect thermal bath at a tunable temperature $T_\kappa = \kappa T_U$. This result establishes a framework for environments perceived as both ``hotter'' ($\kappa&gt;1$) and ``colder'' ($\kappa&lt;1$) than the standard Unruh temperature. We establish this thermality by demonstrating the KMS condition for the Wightman function and by analyzing the associated particle creation process. Furthermore, we visualize the spacetime structure of the created field quanta, revealing an intuitive link between the $\kappa$-controlled symmetry of the modes and the perceived temperature. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for a modulated Unruh effect, bridging formal QFT with clear visual intuition.</description>

Abstract: We study large $N$ phase transitions in $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories with gauge group $SU(N)$ and massive hypermultiplets in diverse representations. Using supersymmetric localization we identify cases where phase transitions occur. In particular, we consider deformations of UV superconformal fixed points by giving two different masses to the fundamental hypermultiplets, and show that these theories undergo a third-order phase transition at a critical value of the 't Hooft coupling. This provides the first example of a phase transition driven by a mass deformation of a $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory. We also comment on integrated correlators in these theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersymmetric vacua are protected from vacuum decay by energy positivity. No such argument is known for any non-supersymmetric vacua. In this paper, we try to extend to the latter a simpler argument based on calibrations, to at least protect them from decays mediated by D-brane bubbles, including their abelian bound states. We examine several classes of AdS$_4$ and AdS$_5$ solutions in type II string theory, including some new ones, involving coset spaces, sphere fibrations, K\"ahler--Einstein manifolds. Many of these vacua have resisted against all the decay channels we were able to assess. We also show how to use calibrations for the stability of D-branes already present in a non-supersymmetric solution.</description>

      <title>Holographic Ordering and Negative entropy in Non-equilibrium Euclidean Black Hole Path Integralsl</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) approach was developed for a Euclidean path integral derivation of equilibrial black hole entropy. To extend it to a near-equilibrium Euclidean path integral, we study a static Euclidean shell model. We calculate the Euclidean action shift for the static simple model thin shell held just outside the horizon, and find agreement with Casini's version of Bekenstein bound. We find a negative entropy deficit associated to the gravitational attraction towards the shell. For a holographic interpretation, the deficit corresponds precisely to the apparent horizon area deviation from the extremal surfaces
  Therefore, we develop a Euclidean path integral framework in which gravitational force emerges from negative entropy gradients due to Hawking temperature gradients. This setup allows us to introduce Onsager reciprocity and a linear-response relation to build a dissipating system, and treat the configuration as a near-equilibrium steady state (NESS). This clarify that the gravitational potential is a phenomenon informational and ordering, rather than entropic and disordering.</description>

      <title>Confronting infrared divergences in de Sitter: loops, logarithms and the stochastic formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-established result in quantum field theory in four-dimensional de Sitter space is that the vacuum state of a massless scalar field breaks the de Sitter isometry group, leading to time-dependent (secular) growth in correlation functions computed in inflationary coordinates. This behavior is widely believed to extend to more general theories involving light scalar fields with weak non-derivative interactions. In such cases, secular growth is thought to be further amplified by loop corrections, and the stochastic formalism is often regarded as the appropriate framework to resum these infrared effects. In this article we challenge this prevailing view. A crucial distinction must be made between two cases: a massless scalar field protected by a shift symmetry, and a light scalar without such a symmetry. In the former, the shift symmetry enforces derivative interactions, yielding observables in which secular growth plays no physical role. In the latter, although correlation functions develop infrared divergences in the massless limit, they remain fully invariant under the de Sitter isometry group. We analyze the structure of these divergences arising from loop integrals and show that, in the soft-momentum limit, they do not alter the time dependence of tree-level correlators. In fact, using a de Sitter-invariant renormalization scheme based on Wilson's axioms for integration, these divergences can be systematically removed order by order. We therefore conclude that neither massless nor light scalar fields in de Sitter space exhibit genuine secular growth. We further discuss the implications of these findings for the validity and scope of the stochastic approach to inflation.</description>

Abstract: Neural Network (NN) architectures that break statistical independence of parameters have been proposed as a new approach for simulating local quantum field theories (QFTs). In the infinite neuron number limit, single-layer NNs can exactly reproduce QFT results. This paper examines the viability of this architecture for perturbative calculations of local QFTs for finite neuron number $N$ using scalar $\phi^4$ theory in $d$ Euclidean dimensions as an example. We find that the renormalized $O(1/N)$ corrections to two- and four-point correlators yield perturbative series which are sensitive to the ultraviolet cut-off and therefore have a weak convergence. We propose a modification to the architecture to improve this convergence and discuss constraints on the parameters of the theory and the scaling of N which allow us to extract accurate field theory results.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of the thermodynamic topology for a broad class of asymptotically charged Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theories, examining how scalar coupling parameters and spacetime dimensions influence black hole thermodynamics. Employing a topological approach that utilizes the torsion number of vector fields constructed from the generalized free energy, we characterize black hole states as topological defects within the thermodynamic parameter space. Through analytical solutions spanning dimensions $d = 4$, $d=5$, and $d=6$, including the Gubser-Rocha model, we demonstrate that variations in the dilaton coupling constant $\delta$, particularly near its critical value $\delta_c$, induce transitions between distinct thermodynamic topological phases. Our analysis reveals that certain black hole solutions constitute a novel class designated as $W^{0-\leftrightarrow 1+}$, characterized by a torsion number $W = 1$ that corresponds to a unique stability structure. We establish that Gubser-Rocha models belong to this topological classification. These results significantly expand the existing classification framework while reinforcing thermodynamic topology as a robust analytical tool for probing the universal properties of black holes in both gravitational and holographic contexts. The findings provide new insights into the relationship between microscopic couplings and macroscopic thermodynamic behavior in extended gravity theories.</description>

Abstract: We describe relativistic particles with spin as points moving in phase space $X=T^* R^{1,3}\times C^2_L\times C^2_R$, where $T^* R^{1,3}=R^{1,3}\times R^{1,3}$ is the space of coordinates and momenta, and $C^2_L$ and $C^2_R$ are the spaces of representation of the Lorentz group of type $(\frac12 , 0)$ and $(0, \frac12)$. Passing from relativistic mechanics with a Lorentz-invariant Hamiltonian function $H$ on the phase space $X$ to quantum mechanics with a Hamiltonian operator $\hat H$, we introduce two complex conjugate line bundles $L_C^+$ and $L_C^-$ over $X$. Quantum particles are introduced as sections $\Psi_+$ of the bundle $L_C^+$ holomorphic along the space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$, and antiparticles are sections $\Psi_-^{}$ of the bundle $L_C^-$ antiholomorphic along the internal spin space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$. The wave functions $\Psi_\pm$ are characterized by conserved charges $q_{\sf{v}}=\pm 1$ associated with the structure group U(1)$_{\sf{v}}$ of the bundles $L_C^\pm$. Wave functions $\Psi_\pm$ are governed by relativistic analogue of the Schr\"odinger equation. We show how fields with spin $s=0$ (Klein-Gordon), spin $s=\frac12$ (Dirac) and spin $s=1$ (Proca fields) arise from these equations in the zeroth, first, and second order expansions of the functions $\Psi_\pm^{}$ in the coordinates of the spin space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$. The Klein-Gordon, Dirac and Proca equations for these fields follow from the Schr\"odinger equation on the extended phase space $T^* R^{1,3}\times C^2_L\times C^2_R$. Using these results, we also introduce equations describing first quantized photons. We show that taking into account the charges $q_{\sf{v}}=\pm 1$ of the fields $\Psi_\pm$ changes the definitions of the inner products and currents, which eliminates negative energies and negative probabilities from relativistic quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: We propose a renormalization group flow equation for a functional that generates $S$-matrix elements and which captures similarities to the well-known Wetterich and Polchinski equations. While the latter ones respectively involve the effective action and Schwinger functional, which are genuine off-shell objects, the presented flow equation has the advantage of working more directly with observables, i.e. scattering amplitudes. Compared to the Wetterich equation, our flow equation also greatly simplifies the notion of going on-shell, in the sense of satisfying the quantum equations of motion. In addition, unlike the Wetterich equation, it is polynomial and does not require a Hessian inversion. The approach is a promising direction for non-perturbative quantum field theories, allowing one to work more directly with scattering amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: We apply the background charged bosonic free-field approach to the rational principal quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov (QDS) $\mathcal{W} \big[ \widehat{g} \big](p,p')$ minimal models with boundaries, where $g$ is a simple bosonic Lie algebra. We express their Ishibashi states using the free-field Ishibashi states, and calculate disk two-point correlation functions using the free-field vertex operators with intertwiner insertions. The integral results are obtained by repeatedly applying the Euler-type integral expression and the Taylor expansions of Lauricella's hypergeometric functions $F_{D}^{(n)}$. We also discuss the background free-field approach to the QDS $\mathcal{W} $ algebras related to a semi-simple Lie algebra $g$, and apply a coset free-field resolution to express diagonal ADE coset $\mathcal{W}$ minimal Ishibashi states.</description>

      <title>Connes spectral distance and nonlocality of generalized noncommutative phase spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.11796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Connes spectral distance of quantum states and analyse the nonlocality of a 4D generalized noncommutative phase space. By virtue of the Hilbert-Schmidt operatorial formulation, we obtain the Dirac operator and construct a spectral triple corresponding to the noncommutative phase space. Based on the ball condition, we obtain some constraint relations about the optimal elements, and then calculate the Connes spectral distance between two Fock states. Due to the noncommutativity, the spectral distances between Fock states in generalized noncommutative phase spaces are shorter than those in normal phase spaces. This shortening of distances implies some type of nonlocality caused by the noncommutativity. These spectral distances in the 4D generalized noncommutative phase space are additive and satisfy the normal Pythagoras theorem. When the noncommutative parameters go to zero, the results return to those in normal quantum phase spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18499v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study open boundary conditions for the $D^{(2)}_3$ spin chain, which shares connections with the six-vertex model, under staggering, and also to the antiferromagnetic Potts model. By formulating a suitable transfer matrix that is related to $K$ matrices and to the Jimbo $R$-matrix, we obtain an analytical expression for the Hamiltonian, as a logarithmic derivative of the transfer matrix, under open boundary conditions. Such computations have connections with several objects studied in Integrable Probability, which underlie exactly solvable structures.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic aspects of FLRW Universe in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an FLRW model, thermodynamic phase transitions are investigated in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity framework. Using the work density, the equation of state is derived, and the criticality conditions are employed to determine the critical points where possible phase transitions occur. The appearance of phase transitions strongly depends on the space-time dimension $n$. In this concern, for $n=5$, there is an ``inverted'' first-order phase transition, where the Gibbs free energy presents a swallow-tail behavior. On the other hand, for $n=6$, the system does not exhibit first order phase transition. In such a case, the Gibbs free energy presents a cusp with stable and unstable branches. For the present study, the mentioned phenomena are present for an expanding cosmology, where the matter distribution filling the Universe corresponds to a speculative matter distribution with an equation of state parameter greater than one. Interestingly, there are no phase transitions for dimensions greater than $n=6$, nor for expanding or contracting cosmological scenarios. To gain more insights into the system, the microstructure is analyzed using thermodynamic geometry to quantify the normalized scalar curvature. This invariant shows that an attractive interaction dominates the phase-transition region. Additionally, the topological thermodynamic analysis was performed employing Duan's off-shell map. This study reveals that for $n=5$ we observe a winding number interchange twice, indicating an unstable small/large branch phase transition through an intermediate stable phase. For $n=6$ the number of exotic defects is one. Consequently, we observe a stable small branch and an unstable large branch.</description>

      <title>Loschmidt echo, emerging dual unitarity and scaling of generalized temporal entropies after quenches to the critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14706v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the Loschmidt echo of a product state after a quench to a conformal invariant critical point and its leading finite time corrections can be predicted by using conformal field theories (CFT). We check such predictions with tensor networks, finding excellent agreement. As a result, we can use the Loschmidt echo to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT including the central charge, the operator content, and its generalized temporal entropies. We are also able to predict and confirm an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution at late times, since the spatial transfer matrix operator that evolves the system in space becomes unitary in such limit. Our results on the growth of temporal entropies also imply that, using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms, such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario.</description>

      <title>A Higher Spin-Statistics Theorem for Invertible Quantum Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every unitary invertible quantum field theory satisfies a generalization of the famous spin-statistics theorem. To formulate this extension, we define a `higher spin' action of the stable orthogonal group $O$ on appropriate spacetime manifolds, which extends both the reflection involution and spin flip. On the algebraic side, we define a `higher statistics' action of $O$ on the universal target for invertible field theories, $I\mathbb{Z}$, which extends both complex conjugation and fermion parity $(-1)^F$. We prove that every unitary invertible quantum field theory intertwines these actions.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Mutation-Acyclicity of Quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in mathematical research in recent years. This paper applies ML techniques to the study of quivers -- a type of directed multigraph with significant relevance in algebra, combinatorics, computer science, and mathematical physics. Specifically, we focus on the challenging problem of determining the mutation-acyclicity of a quiver on 4 vertices, a property that is pivotal since mutation-acyclicity is often a necessary condition for theorems involving path algebras and cluster algebras. Although this classification is known for quivers with at most 3 vertices, little is known about quivers on more than 3 vertices. We give a computer-assisted proof of a theorem to prove that mutation-acyclicity is decidable for quivers on 4 vertices with edge weight at most 2. By leveraging neural networks (NNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), we then accurately classify more general 4-vertex quivers as mutation-acyclic or non-mutation-acyclic. Our results demonstrate that ML models can efficiently detect mutation-acyclicity, providing a promising computational approach to this combinatorial problem, from which the trained SVM equation provides a starting point to guide future theoretical development.</description>

      <title>The Gravito-Phononic Effect: A Quantum Signature of Linearised Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The photo-electric effect was a historic milestone in the development of quantum theory, revealing the first evidence of discrete energy of the electromagnetic field through hallmark signatures such as the threshold frequency, intensity-independent energy transfer, and the near instantaneous ejection of photo-electrons. Here, we discuss the photo-electric effect through the lens of semi-classical, quantum, and neo-classical models. We provide a pedagogical outline for how two coupled harmonic oscillators, under a beam-splitter interaction, can exhibit hallmark signatures analogous to the photo-electric effect, including resonance conditions and quantised energy absorption. We discuss the implications of this model for recently proposed graviton detection protocols. This further clarifies that a gravitational version of the photo-electric effect, modelled as discrete energy transfer between harmonic oscillators can provide the first evidence of the graviton.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Viability of $f(Q, T)$ Gravity: Constraining Parameters with Cosmological Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the model of $f(Q,T)$ gravity, an extension of symmetric teleparallel gravity where the nonmetricity scalar $Q$ is non-minimally coupled to the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. To ensure general covariance and theoretical consistency, we adopt the covariant formulation of $f(Q, T)$ gravity, which allows a coordinate-independent treatment of the field equations and facilitates the correct identification of effective energy-momentum components. The model is developed as an alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model and is analyzed using Cosmic Chronometer and Pantheon$^+$ supernovae datasets. Through Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, we constrain the model parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $H_0$, and compare the performance of the model with $\Lambda$CDM by evaluating statistical measures such as chi-square, Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The results show that the $f(Q, T)$ model effectively mimics $\Lambda$CDM while offering an alternative explanation based on modified gravity. We also examine cosmographic parameters like the deceleration parameter, confirming the transition of the Universe from deceleration to acceleration, and the violation of the strong energy condition, which aligns with observed late-time cosmic acceleration. Additionally, the model provides age estimates for the Universe that are consistent with current observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report evidence for an Anti-de Sitter (AdS) vacuum, equivalently, a negative cosmological constant (nCC) in the dark energy (DE) sector at more than $2\sigma$ significance. Our joint analysis uses DESI BAO, DESY5 supernovae, and P-ACT CMB (ACT-DR6 + Planck) measurements. We also use the KiDS weak lensing measurement to cross-check $S_{8}$ consistency. Within the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization for evolving part of the DE, the inclusion of an AdS term eliminates the need for phantom behaviour, opening a theoretically natural, non-phantom parameter space. A negative cosmological constant also implies a finite cosmic lifetime, linking observational DE phenomenology to deep questions in quantum gravity and string theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the properties of the thin accretion disk around a black hole in quantum fluctuation modified gravity (QFMGBH) using the Novikov-Thorne model. We restrict the parameter \( \alpha \) characterizing the quantum fluctuation of metric and compute the ISCO radius, examining its effect on the energy flux, the radiation temperature, the luminosity spectrum, the energy efficiency, and the shadow size for various values of the parameter \( \omega \) characterizing the matter around the black hole. Our findings show that the ISCO radius increases with \( \alpha \) for \( \omega = 1/3, 0, -2/3 \), but decreases for \( \omega = -4/3 \). As \( \alpha \) increases, the energy flux and the temperature show distinct trends, with changes in the luminosity spectrum and the efficiency. The shadow size increases for \( \omega = 1/3, 0, -2/3 \), and decreases for \( \omega = -4/3 \). The accretion disk around the QFMGBH is smaller, hotter, and brighter than that surrounded the Schwarzschild BH in GR, suggesting that the observable differences can potentially distinguish quantum fluctuation modified gravity from standard GR.</description>

Abstract: A new notion of quasilocal mass is defined for generic, compact, two dimensional, spacelike surfaces in four dimensional spacetimes with negative cosmological constant. The definition is spinorial and based on work for vanishing cosmological constant by Penrose and Dougan &amp; Mason. Furthermore, this mass is non-negative, equal to the Misner-Sharp mass in spherical symmetry, equal to zero for every generic surface in AdS, has an appropriate form for gravity linearised about AdS and has an appropriate limit for large spheres in asymptotically AdS spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from merging binary black holes present exciting opportunities for understanding fundamental aspects of gravity, including nonlinearities in the strong-field regime. One challenge in studying and interpreting the dynamics of binary black hole collisions is the intrinsically geometrical nature of spacetime, which in many ways is unlike that of other classical field theories. By exactly recasting Einstein's equations into a set of coupled nonlinear Maxwell equations closely resembling classical electrodynamics, we visualize the intricate dynamics of gravitational electric and magnetic fields during inspiral, merger and ring-down of a binary black hole collision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is devoted to examining particle dynamics and thermodynamic behavior of a black hole in the framework of Kalb-Ramond gravity, framing the investigation through the lens of the optical-mechanical analogy. Within this context, we derive a generalized modified dispersion relation, which inherently depends on the underlying spacetime geometry through its metric components. The analysis begins by exploring some physical quantities influenced by the geometry, including the effective index of refraction, the group velocity, and the time delay experienced by particle modes. We then investigate the interparticle potential, considering both massive and massless cases. The thermodynamic properties of the system are subsequently addressed using ensemble theory. In this treatment, we compute the pressure, internal energy, entropy, and heat capacity across three distinct regions: in the immediate vicinity of the event horizon, at the photon sphere, and in the asymptotic region. Notably, all calculations presented throughout this paper admit closed-form analytical solutions.</description>

      <title>Cosmic superstrings in large volume compactifications: PTAs, LISA and time-varying tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) from cosmic superstrings offers one of the few known possibilities to test String Theory within current experimental reach. However, in order to be compatible with the existing constraints, the tension of a cosmic superstring network is required to lie several orders of magnitude below the Planck scale. This is naturally realized in string compactifications where the volume of the extra dimensions is parametrically large (in string units). We estimate the GW spectrum arising from cosmic superstrings in such scenarios, providing analytical formulae as well as numerical results. Crucially, we do so within a semi-realistic string cosmology scenario, taking into account various modified cosmological epochs (such as kination or early matter domination) induced by the presence of moduli and a time-dependent string tension. We show that part of the spectrum generically lies within reach of LISA and ET, with a large class of models predicting a characteristic drop in the amplitude which may be robustly probed by LISA. The corresponding signal would encode information on the dynamics of moduli and reheating. On the other hand, the ultra-high frequency part of the spectrum can be significantly enhanced by a long, early phase of kination with time-varying tension, yielding a spectral index unique to this set-up.</description>

      <title>Butterfly in Spacetime: Inherent Instabilities in Stable Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07562v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper numerically studies if the stability of a stable black hole is robust against the small perturbation on geometry near its event horizon. As a toy model, it encodes the such perturbation into deformations of Regge-Wheeler potential. It considers three different types of local deformations-the negative static bump potential, the stochastic potential and bump potential modulated by time function in low frequency limit. Our numerical results show that infinitesimal local deformations on Regge-Wheeler potential near the horizon can overturn stability of a stable black hole, implying that late-time behavior of a stable black hole is extremely sensitive to geometry near horizon. Specially, certain deformations that stabilize systems in flat backgrounds can destabilize otherwise stable black holes. It also shows that horizon-induced redshift transforms near-horizon quantum fluctuations into classical-scale stochastic deformations capable of triggering instability, implying that even an isolated black hole cannot keep stable in extended timescales.</description>

      <title>Cosmographic analysis of sign-switching dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the well-studied $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, we propose and investigate a class of dynamical dark energy models that evolve from a negative cosmological constant, transitioning to a positive value at low redshifts. Specifically, we introduce a dark energy framework based on a generalised ladder-step function for the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we present two additional models in which the cosmological constant undergoes a smooth sign change at a specified redshift. We provide a detailed discussion of the construction and theoretical properties of these models, analysing their background cosmological evolution using a cosmographic approach and the statefinder hierarchy parameters. Our results are compared with those obtained for the standard $\Lambda$CDM and $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM models. We also perform a careful analysis of the types of singularities that may arise in these models due to a sign change in the cosmological constant. Notably, we show that a continuous sign change removes the sudden singularity present in the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, replacing it with a milder $w$-singularity.</description>

      <title>Inflationary attractors and radiative corrections in light of ACT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of the recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which have provided a notable shift in the constraints on $(n_s, r)$ and placed several otherwise viable models of inflation in tension with the latest data, we investigate the possible effects that radiative corrections can have on $\xi$-attractor and $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation. These models, which share much in common with Starobinsky-Higgs inflation, have likewise been put under pressure by these results. We find that percent (and even sub-percent) level radiative corrections can easily shift both of these classes of inflation models comfortably into the regions of parameter space favoured by the most recent constraints. However, the flexibility under such corrections (which one can argue should be generally expected) calls into question to what extent it is possible to precisely pin down model-specific predictions for important cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>State updates and useful qubits in relativistic quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge of consistently updating quantum states after selective measurements in a relativistic spacetime. Standard updates along the future lightcones preserve causality but break correlations between causally disconnected parties, whereas updates along the past lightcone either imply retrocausality or do not respect the causal propagation of information. We introduce a minimal extension of multipartite states to encode subsystem-specific contextual information. This "polyperspective" formalism ensures causally consistent covariant state updates, preserves multipartite correlations, and respects conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Enhanced entanglement from quantum ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum chaos conjecture associates the spectral statistics of a quantum system with abstract notions of quantum ergodicity. Such associations are taken to be of fundamental and sometimes defining importance for quantum chaos, but their practical relevance has been challenged by theoretical and experimental developments. Here, in counterpoint, we show that ergodic dynamics can be directly utilized for the preparation of quantum states with parametrically higher entanglement than generated by maximally scrambling dynamics such as in random unitary circuits. Our setting involves quantum systems coupled via a "non-demolition" interaction of conserved charges. We derive an exact relation between the evolving entanglement of an initial product state and a measure of spectral statistics of the interacting charges in this state. This connection is explained via a notion of Krylov vector ergodicity, tied to the ability of quantum dynamics to generate orthonormal states over time. We consider exploiting this phenomenon for the preparation of approximate Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states between complex systems, a crucial resource for tasks such as quantum teleportation. We quantitatively show that the transfer of operators between entangled systems, which underlies the utility of the EPR state, can be performed with parametrically larger capacity for entanglement generated via ergodic dynamics than with maximal scrambling. Our analysis suggests a direct application of "ergodic" spectral statistics as a potential resource for quantum information tasks.</description>

      <title>Modeling HF-QPOs in Microquasars and AGNs: Charged Particles around Black Holes with CDM Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: HF QPOs are among the most intriguing phenomena observed in LMXBs containing BHs or neutron stars. In this work, we investigate charged particles' dynamics in the nearby of a Schwarzschild-like BH embedded in a uniform magnetic field and surrounded on all sides by CDM. Thereby, gaining deeper insight into the influence of magnetic and DM distributions on observable phenomena near compact objects. We first present a modified metric, which incorporates the effects of a CDM, and we explore how both DM and magnetic fields influence the effective potential, stable circular orbits, and escape conditions for ionized particles. Employing a Hamiltonian formalism, we analyze the energy boundaries and ISCO, demonstrating that CDM causes an outward shift of the ISCO, while magnetic fields tend to pull it closer to the event horizon.
  We compute the fundamental oscillation frequencies-radial, latitudinal, Keplerian, and Larmor-and demonstrate how their variation depends on the combined influence of CDM and magnetic field strength. The resulting frequency structure allows us to identify resonance radii associated with HF QPOs, particularly those in 3:2 ratios observed in microquasars. We assess several theoretical models for QPO generation, including the ...... Our results highlight the importance of including both magnetic and dark matter (DM) effects in strong-field astrophysics and support the use of HF QPOs as sensitive probes of BH environments. This study opens new perspectives for exploring particle dynamics, accretion disk structure, and observational signatures of DM near compact objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of higher-order fermionic deformations in multiflavor Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. Focusing specifically on the 6- and 8-fermion interactions, we show that these terms can have significant consequences on the dynamics of the system. In certain regions of parameter space, the theory continues to exhibit second-order phase transitions with mean-field critical exponents and the same critical temperature; however, the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap can deviate markedly from conventional BCS behavior. In other regions, the theory exhibits first-order phase transitions or second-order phase transitions with non-mean field exponents. We conclude by discussing potential phenomenological applications of these theories.</description>

      <title>On the relation between perspective-neutral, algebraic, and effective quantum reference frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The framework of internal quantum reference frames (QRFs) constitutes a universal toolset for dealing with symmetries in quantum theory and has led to new revelations in quantum gravity, gauge theories and foundational physics. Multiple approaches have emerged, sometimes differing in scope and the way symmetries are implemented, raising the question as to their relation. Here, we investigate the relation between three approaches to QRFs for gauge symmetries, namely the effective semiclassical, algebraic, and perspective-neutral (PN) approaches. Rather than constructing Hilbert spaces, as the PN approach, the effective approach is based on a quantum phase space parametrized by expectation values and fluctuations, while the emphasis of the algebraic approach is on the state space of complex linear functionals on a kinematical algebra. Nevertheless, external frame information is treated as gauge in all three formalisms, manifested in constraints on states and algebra. We show that these three approaches are, in fact, equivalent for ideal QRFs, distinguished by sharp orientations, which is the previous setting of the first two approaches. Our demonstration pertains to single constraints, including relativistic ones, and encompasses QRF changes. In particular, the QRF transformations of the PN framework agree semiclassically with those of the older effective approach, by which it was inspired. As a physical application, we explore the QRF covariance of uncertainties and fluctuations, which turn out to be frame-dependent. This is particularly well-suited for the effective and algebraic approaches, for which these quantities form a natural basis. Finally, we pave the way towards extending these two approaches to non-ideal QRFs by studying the projection and gauge-fixing operations of the Page-Wootters formalism, built into the PN framework, on algebraic states.</description>

      <title>Tsunami Solitons Emerging from Superconducting Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting the tsunami-like solitons with rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operators describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductor. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator by Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schr\"odinger-Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we coin \textit{the KdV rocks}. In the Zakharov-Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions comes from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multi-valued Baker-Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider its classification.</description>

      <title>Critical quantum liquids and the cuprate high temperature superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a spin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport observation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$.
  We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a layer construction with a pair of ancilla qubits on each site: the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM). Its mean field yields hole pockets of area $p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region of the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs in photoemission. One route to confinement of FL* upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a charge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement with experiments.
  Increasing doping from the FL* phase in the ALM drives a transition to a Fermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.
  At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (degenerate) geometry of event horizons is linked to Carrollian fluids. We investigate the behavior of event horizons via a perturbative coupling to a massless scalar field, making connections to Carrollian hydrodynamics with a driving source, and discuss the fluid equilibration in tandem with the horizon's relaxation to equilibrium. We observe that after the perturbation dies off, the Carrollian fluid energy and momentum densities approach equilibrium as the horizon asymptotically becomes non-expanding. We connect the equilibration of the Carrollian fluid dual to the black hole horizon through the expansion of its background geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An entropy function is proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 251602] as a way to detect criticality even when the system size is small. In this note we apply this strategy in the search for criticality of lattice transfer matrices constructed based on the topological holographic principle. We find that the combination of strategy is indeed a cost-effective and efficient way of identifying critical boundary conditions, estimating central charges and moreover, plotting entire phase diagrams in a multi-dimensional phase space.</description>
