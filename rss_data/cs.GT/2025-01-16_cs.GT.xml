      <title>A Learning Algorithm That Attains the Human Optimum in a Repeated Human-Machine Interaction Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When humans interact with learning-based control systems, a common goal is to minimize a cost function known only to the human. For instance, an exoskeleton may adapt its assistance in an effort to minimize the human's metabolic cost-of-transport. Conventional approaches to synthesizing the learning algorithm solve an inverse problem to infer the human's cost. However, these problems can be ill-posed, hard to solve, or sensitive to problem data. Here we show a game-theoretic learning algorithm that works solely by observing human actions to find the cost minimum, avoiding the need to solve an inverse problem. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm in an extensive set of human subjects experiments, demonstrating consistent convergence to the minimum of a prescribed human cost function in scalar and multidimensional instantiations of the game. We conclude by outlining future directions for theoretical and empirical extensions of our results.</description>

      <title>Computing Game Symmetries and Equilibria That Respect Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strategic interactions can be represented more concisely, and analyzed and solved more efficiently, if we are aware of the symmetries within the multiagent system. Symmetries also have conceptual implications, for example for equilibrium selection. We study the computational complexity of identifying and using symmetries. Using the classical framework of normal-form games, we consider game symmetries that can be across some or all players and/or actions. We find a strong connection between game symmetries and graph automorphisms, yielding graph automorphism and graph isomorphism completeness results for characterizing the symmetries present in a game. On the other hand, we also show that the problem becomes polynomial-time solvable when we restrict the consideration of actions in one of two ways.
  Next, we investigate when exactly game symmetries can be successfully leveraged for Nash equilibrium computation. We show that finding a Nash equilibrium that respects a given set of symmetries is PPAD- and CLS-complete in general-sum and team games respectively -- that is, exactly as hard as Brouwer fixed point and gradient descent problems. Finally, we present polynomial-time methods for the special cases where we are aware of a vast number of symmetries, or where the game is two-player zero-sum and we do not even know the symmetries.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of voting rules based on majority margins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of voting with ranked ballots, an important class of voting rules is the class of margin-based rules (also called pairwise rules). A voting rule is margin-based if whenever two elections generate the same head-to-head margins of victory or loss between candidates, then the voting rule yields the same outcome in both elections. Although this is a mathematically natural invariance property to consider, whether it should be regarded as a normative axiom on voting rules is less clear. In this paper, we address this question for voting rules with any kind of output, whether a set of candidates, a ranking, a probability distribution, etc. We prove that a voting rule is margin-based if and only if it satisfies some axioms with clearer normative content. A key axiom is what we call Preferential Equality, stating that if two voters both rank a candidate $x$ immediately above a candidate $y$, then either voter switching to rank $y$ immediately above $x$ will have the same effect on the election outcome as if the other voter made the switch, so each voter's preference for $y$ over $x$ is treated equally.</description>

      <title>Personality Modeling for Persuasion of Misinformation using AI Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation on social media platforms has highlighted the need to understand how individual personality traits influence susceptibility to and propagation of misinformation. This study employs an innovative agent-based modeling approach to investigate the relationship between personality traits and misinformation dynamics. Using six AI agents embodying different dimensions of the Big Five personality traits (Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism), we simulated interactions across six diverse misinformation topics. The experiment, implemented through the AgentScope framework using the GLM-4-Flash model, generated 90 unique interactions, revealing complex patterns in how personality combinations affect persuasion and resistance to misinformation. Our findings demonstrate that analytical and critical personality traits enhance effectiveness in evidence-based discussions, while non-aggressive persuasion strategies show unexpected success in misinformation correction. Notably, agents with critical traits achieved a 59.4% success rate in HIV-related misinformation discussions, while those employing non-aggressive approaches maintained consistent persuasion rates above 40% across different personality combinations. The study also revealed a non-transitive pattern in persuasion effectiveness, challenging conventional assumptions about personality-based influence. These results provide crucial insights for developing personality-aware interventions in digital environments and suggest that effective misinformation countermeasures should prioritize emotional connection and trust-building over confrontational approaches. The findings contribute to both theoretical understanding of personality-misinformation dynamics and practical strategies for combating misinformation in social media contexts.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Tax Design in Nonatomic Congestion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multiplayer games, self-interested behavior among the players can harm the social welfare. Tax mechanisms are a common method to alleviate this issue and induce socially optimal behavior. In this work, we take the initial step of learning the optimal tax that can maximize social welfare with limited feedback in congestion games. We propose a new type of feedback named \emph{equilibrium feedback}, where the tax designer can only observe the Nash equilibrium after deploying a tax plan. Existing algorithms are not applicable due to the exponentially large tax function space, nonexistence of the gradient, and nonconvexity of the objective. To tackle these challenges, we design a computationally efficient algorithm that leverages several novel components: (1) a piece-wise linear tax to approximate the optimal tax; (2) extra linear terms to guarantee a strongly convex potential function; (3) an efficient subroutine to find the exploratory tax that can provide critical information about the game. The algorithm can find an $\epsilon$-optimal tax with $O(\beta F^2/\epsilon)$ sample complexity, where $\beta$ is the smoothness of the cost function and $F$ is the number of facilities.</description>

      <title>Equilibria in multiagent online problems with predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the power of (competitive) algorithms with predictions in a multiagent setting. To this goal, we introduce a multiagent version of the ski-rental problem. In this problem agents can collaborate by pooling resources to get a group license for some asset. If the license price is not met then agents have to rent the asset individually for the day at a unit price. Otherwise the license becomes available forever to everyone at no extra cost.
  We investigate the effect of using predictors for self and others' behavior in such a setting, as well as the new equilibria formed in this way.</description>

      <title>On the Parameterized Complexity of Controlling Amendment and Successive Winners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The successive and the amendment procedures have been widely employed in parliamentary and legislative decision making and have undergone extensive study in the literature from various perspectives. However, investigating them through the lens of computational complexity theory has not been as thoroughly conducted as for many other prevalent voting procedures heretofore. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one paper which explores the complexity of several strategic voting problems under these two procedures, prior to our current work. To provide a better understanding of to what extent the two procedures resist strategic behavior, we study the parameterized complexity of constructive/destructive control by adding/deleting voters/candidates for both procedures. To enhance the generalizability of our results, we also examine a more generalized form of the amendment procedure. Our exploration yields a comprehensive (parameterized) complexity landscape of these problems with respect to numerous parameters.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Verification in Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.05556v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of probabilistic verification in mechanism design. The principal elicits a message from the agent and then selects a test to give the agent. The agent's true type determines the probability with which he can pass each test. We characterize whether each type has an associated test that best screens out all other types. If this condition holds, then the testing technology can be represented in a tractable reduced form. We use this reduced form to solve for profit-maximizing mechanisms with verification. As the verification technology varies, the solution continuously interpolates between the no-verification solution and full surplus extraction.</description>

      <title>Improved Algorithms for Contextual Dynamic Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contextual dynamic pricing, a seller sequentially prices goods based on contextual information. Buyers will purchase products only if the prices are below their valuations. The goal of the seller is to design a pricing strategy that collects as much revenue as possible. We focus on two different valuation models. The first assumes that valuations linearly depend on the context and are further distorted by noise. Under minor regularity assumptions, our algorithm achieves an optimal regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$, improving the existing results. The second model removes the linearity assumption, requiring only that the expected buyer valuation is $\beta$-H\"older in the context. For this model, our algorithm obtains a regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{d+2\beta/d+3\beta})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the context space.</description>
