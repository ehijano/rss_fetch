      <title>Denjoy's anachronistic topological viewpoint on Aubry transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Aubry transition is a phase transition between two types of incommensurate states, originally described as a transition by ``breaking of analyticity''. Here we present Denjoy's (anachronistic) viewpoint, who almost hundred years ago described certain mathematical properties of circle homeomorphisms with irrational rotation numbers. The connection between the two lies in the existence of a change of variables from the incommensurate ground state variables to new simple phase variables that rotate by a constant irrational angle. This confers a cyclic order, an essential property of models with the Aubry transition. Denjoy's description indicates that there are two types of cyclic order, distinguished by the regular or singular nature of the change of variables or, in mathematical terms, by the distinction between topological conjugacy versus semiconjugacy. This allows rephrasing the breaking of analyticity as a breaking of topological conjugacy. We illustrate this description with numerical calculations on the Frenkel-Kontorova model.</description>

      <title>Solving boundary time crystals via the superspin method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundary time crystals have been extensively studied through numerical and mean-field methods. However, a comprehensive analytical approach in terms of the Liouvillian eigenvalues, without semiclassical approximations, has yet to be developed. In this work, we analyse the Liouvillian spectrum of dissipative spin models, within a perturbative framework in the weak-dissipation limit. Introducing the superspin method, we compute the eigenvalues to first order in perturbation theory, providing a direct and transparent explanation for the emergence of the time crystal phase. We analytically demonstrate how spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs, leading to persistent oscillations. Our method can be used as a tool to unequivocally identify new dissipative collective spin models that support a boundary time crystal phase. We demonstrate this by applying the technique to four distinct, collective spin Liouvillians, which experience some dissipation. The first of these is the paradigmatic model studied in [1]. We demonstrate how the boundary time crystal phase is a general feature of models that yield a solution solely in terms of a quantity that we term the superspin. Furthermore, we analyse the stability of this phase and demonstrate how, in some cases, it is stable against increasing dissipation.</description>

      <title>Study of entanglement and phase transitions in the coupled top systems with standard and nonstandard symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study classical and quantum versions of a coupled top system in the absence and the presence of nonlinear torsion in the individual top. The model without the torsion and couples two identical tops is well-known in the literature as the Feingold-Peres (FP) model. The permutation and chiral symmetries are preserved in the FP model. This model is classified under the BDI or chiral orthogonal symmetry class, one of the recently proposed nonstandard symmetry classes. For the nonzero torsional cases, we study two different models:(i) identical torsional term in the individual top (NZT-I model); (ii) non-identical torsional term due to their opposite sign in the individual top (NZT-II model). The NZT-I model has the permutation symmetry but no chiral symmetry; hence, this model is classified under the standard three-fold symmetry classes. On the other hand, the NZT-II model does not have permutation symmetry but has chiral symmetry; hence, this model is also classified as a nonstandard BDI symmetry class. In this study, we investigate the role of underlying symmetries on the entanglement between the two tops. Moreover, we explore the interrelations among classical phase space dynamics, energy transitions, and the entanglement between the tops.</description>
