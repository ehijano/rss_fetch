      <title>Effects of intertube dipole-dipole interactions in nearly integrable one-dimensional $^{162}$Dy gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of the intertube dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) in recent experiments with arrays of nearly integrable one-dimensional (1D) dipolar Bose gases of $^{162}$Dy atoms. An earlier theoretical modeling ignored those interactions, which we include here via a modification of the 1D confining potentials. We investigate the effects of the intertube DDI both during the state preparation and during the measurements of the rapidity distributions. We explore how the strength of the contact interactions and the magnetic field angles modify the intertube DDI corrections. We find that those corrections slightly change both the properties of the equilibrium state and the rapidity measurements. Remarkably, however, the changes nearly cancel each other, resulting in measured rapidity distributions that are very close to those predicted in the absence of the intertube DDI.</description>

      <title>From Lasers to Photon Bose--Einstein Condensates: A Unified Description via an Open-Dissipative Bose--Einstein Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon condensation was first experimentally realized in 2010 within a dye-filled microcavity at room temperature. Since then, interest in the field has increased significantly, as a photon Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) represents a prototypical driven-dissipative system. Here, we investigate how its inherent open nature influences the condensation process both quantitatively and qualitatively. To this end, we consider a mean-field model, which can be derived microscopically from a Lindblad master equation. The underlying rate equations depend on various external parameters such as emission and absorption rates of the dye molecules as well as the cavity photon loss rate. In steady state, we obtain an open-dissipative Bose-Einstein distribution for the mode occupations. The chemical potential of this distribution depends on the occupations of the dye molecules in both their ground and excited state and must therefore be determined self-consistently.We find that the resulting photon distribution is strongly influenced by the driven-dissipative parameters. Based on this result, we identify the main differences between a photonic BEC, an atomic BEC, and a laser.</description>

      <title>Encoding a topological gauge theory on a ring-shaped Raman-coupled Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological gauge theories constitute a framework for understanding strongly correlated quantum matter in terms of weakly interacting composite degrees of freedom. Their topological properties become evident when these theories are realized on a space of non-trivial topology. Here, we propose a scheme to realize a one-dimensional topological gauge theory, the chiral BF theory, on a ring geometry. We obtain such a theory by dimensionally reducing Chern-Simons theory on a disk to the so-called chiral BF theory defined on the ring. Then, we encode the theory into a Hamiltonian with a coupling between angular momentum and density, and we propose and numerically benchmark its realization in an optically-dressed Bose gas confined in a ring-shaped trap. There, the topological properties of the underlying theory manifest themselves through a magnetic flux variable that is density-dependent. We quantify such density-dependent magnetic flux in terms of the ground-state angular momentum and the chiral properties of the system through a Bogoliubov analysis. Our proposal enables the observation of the interplay between the topology of the theory and that of the space.</description>

      <title>Spin-spiral instability of the Nagaoka ferromagnet in the crossover between square and triangular lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model in the crossover between square and triangular lattices near half-filling. As was recognized by Nagaoka in the 1960s, on the square lattice the presence of a single hole leads to ferromagnetic spin ordering. On the triangular lattice, geometric frustration instead leads to a spin-singlet ground state, which can be associated with a 120-degree spiral order. On lattices which interpolate between square and triangular, there is a phase transition at which the ferromagnetic order becomes unstable to a spin spiral. We model this instability, finding the exact critical point.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of the neutron and Fermi polarons on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have used the auxiliary-field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) many-body approach on the lattice to study the equation of state for a fermionic impurity interacting with a background sea of spin-polarized fermions. The impurity, or polaron, is an interesting system in both cold atomic and nuclear physics. Our approach is general, and we are able to straightforwardly study the polaron across these regimes. We first study the Fermi polaron at unitarity and for a wide range of scattering lengths, comparing against previous theoretical and experimental studies. We then explore the neutron polaron which has been shown to be an important constraint for nuclear physics. We have also employed the recently developed parametric matrix model to emulate AFQMC solutions to the two-body problem on the lattice, to accelerate the tuning of our lattice Hamiltonian parameters directly to two-body energies in a periodic box, following Lscher's formula. Our lattice Quantum Monte Carlo results for the polaron in both a cold atomic and nuclear physics context can serve as stringent benchmarks for future theoretical and experimental research.</description>

      <title>All-optical bubble trap for ultracold atoms in microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an all-optical method to produce shell-shaped traps for ultracold atoms in microgravity. Our scheme exploits optical double dressing of the ground state to create a short range strongly repulsive central potential barrier. Combined with a long range attractive central potential, this barrier forms the shell trap. We demonstrate that a pure spherical bubble, reaching the quasi 2D regime for standard atom numbers, could be formed from two crossed beams with a parabolic profile. An analytical study shows that the relevant characteristics of the trap depend on the ratio of the ground and excited state polarisabilities and the lifetime of the excited state. As a benchmark, we provide quantitative analysis of a realistic configuration for rubidium ensembles, leading to a 250 Hz transverse confinement for a 35 $\mu$m radius bubble and a trap residual scattering rate of less than 10 s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum-classical analog simulation of two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard models with neutral atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally study the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model using a Rydberg-based quantum processing unit in the analog mode. Our approach avoids encoding directly the original fermions into qubits and instead relies on reformulating the original model onto a system of fermions coupled to spins and then decoupling them in a self-consistent manner. We then introduce the auxiliary spin solver: this hybrid quantum-classical algorithm handles a free-fermion problem, which can be solved efficiently with a few classical resources, and an interacting spin problem, which can be naturally encoded in the analog quantum computer. This algorithm can be used to study both the equilibrium Mott transition as well as non-equilibrium properties of the original Fermi-Hubbard model, highlighting the potential of quantum-classical hybrid approaches to study strongly correlated matter.</description>

Abstract: Mott insulator of atomic transport can be realized in driven optical lattices by choosing particular ratio of driving frequency and amplitude, which has been studied as Floquet engineering with time-independent effective Hamiltonian approach. Here, we give general conditions of frequency-amplitude radio for realization of the driving induced insulator-conductor transition in a double-well open system, using instantaneous eigenstates approach. As we proved here, the instantaneous eigenstates approach is applicable in more wide parameter range compared with the time-independent effective Hamiltonian approach. Analysis from the results of quantum master equation shows that the insulator effect is originated from coherent localization of atom wave packets in optical wells.</description>

      <title>Observation of Temperature Effects on False Vacuum Decay in Atomic Quantum Gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temperature plays a crucial role in metastable phenomena, not only by contributing to determine the state (phase) of a system, but also ruling the decay probability to more stable states. Such a situation is encountered in many different physical systems, ranging from chemical reactions to magnetic structures. The characteristic decay timescale is not always straightforward to estimate since it depends on the microscopic details of the system. A paradigmatic example in quantum field theories is the decay of the false vacuum, manifested via the nucleation of bubbles. In this paper, we measure the temperature dependence of the timescale for the false vacuum decay mechanism in an ultracold atomic quantum spin mixture which exhibits ferromagnetic properties. Our results show that the false vacuum decay rate scales with temperature as predicted by the finite-temperature extension of the instanton theory, and confirm atomic systems as an ideal platform where to study out-of-equilibrium field theories.</description>

      <title>Generalized Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spin-orbit-coupled systems the charge and spin transport are generally coupled to each other, namely a charge current will induce a spin current and vice versa. In the presence of time-reversal symmetry $T$, the cross-coupling transport coefficients describing how one process affects the other are constrained by the famous Onsager reciprocal relations. In this paper, we generalize the Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport to systems that break the time-reversal symmetry but preserve a combined symmetry of $T$ and some other symmetry operation $O$. We show that the symmetry or antisymmetry of the cross-coupling transport coefficients remains in place provided that the operator $O$ meets certain conditions. Among many candidate systems where our generalized Onsager relations apply, we focus on a conceptually simple and experimentally realized model in cold atomic systems for explicit demonstration and use these relations to predict highly non-trivial transport phenomena that can be readily verified experimentally.</description>

      <title>Coupling induced emergent topology in a two-leg fermionic ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state properties of spinless fermions on a two leg ladder, by allowing the nearest-neighbour hopping dimerization in one leg and uniform hopping in the other. In the non-interacting limit, we find that, at half-filling, the system exhibits robust topological behavior if the inter-leg hopping is allowed. Though depending on the dimerization pattern, the dimerized leg can be either topological or trivial in nature, here we show that by connecting such a leg to a uniform leg through inter-chain coupling, the overall system becomes topological irrespective of the dimerization pattern in the dimerized leg. As a result, a topological phase transition occurs as a function of the inter-leg hopping. When the inter-leg interaction is turned on, the topological phase survives, and we obtain an interaction induced topological phase transition. Finally, we reveal that when uniform interactions are included on all the bonds of the ladder, the topological phase transitions to a symmetry-broken charge-density wave (CDW) phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. In particular, models based on strongly-correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter. However, due to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement and feedforward, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering with tunable entangling gates interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram and verify the non-Abelian spin liquid phase by evaluating an odd Chern number. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.</description>

Abstract: We derive the asymptotic forms of the Green's function at the open edges of general non-Hermitian band systems in all dimensions in the long-time limit, using a modified saddle-point approximation and the analytic continuation of the momentum. The edge dynamics is determined by the "dominant saddle point", a complex momentum, which, contrary to previous conjectures, may lie outside the generalized Brillouin zone. From this result, we obtain the effective edge Hamiltonians that evidently, as demonstrated by extensive numerical simulations, characterize the dynamics on the edges, and can be probed in real-time experiments or spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Exact Solution for Two $\delta$-Interacting Bosons on a Ring in the Presence of a $\delta$-Barrier: Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz for Spatially Odd States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we apply the recently proposed Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz method to the problem of two one-dimensional, short-range-interacting bosons on a ring in the presence of a $\delta$-function barrier. Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the "Summary and Future Research" section of our paper.</description>

Abstract: Understanding flux string dynamics can provide insight into quark confinement and hadronization. First-principles quantum and numerical simulations have mostly focused on toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs). With the advent of state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments, it is important to bridge this gap and study string dynamics in non-Abelian LGTs beyond one spatial dimension. Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time string dynamics of a $2\!+\!1$D SU$(2)$ Yang--Mills LGT with dynamical matter. In the strong-coupling regime and at resonance, string breaking occurs through sharp Casimir reduction along with meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a distinctively non-Abelian feature. At finite baryon density, we discover a \textit{baryon blockade} mechanism that delays string breaking. Away from resonance, the magnetic term drives purely non-Abelian fluctuations: glueball loops and self-crossed strings that resolve two SU$(2)$ intertwiners with distinct dynamics. For higher-energy strings, we uncover representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances. Our findings serve as a guide for upcoming quantum simulators of non-Abelian LGTs.</description>
