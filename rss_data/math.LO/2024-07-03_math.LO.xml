      <title>Intermediate models with deep failure of choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following question was asked by Grigorieff: Suppose $V$ is a ZFC model and $V[G]$ is a set-generic extension of $V$. Can there be a ZF model $N$ so that $V\subset N \subset V[G]$ yet $N$ is not equal to $V(A)$ for any set $A\in V[G]$? The first such model was constructed by Karagila. This is the so-called \emph{Bristol model}, an intermediate model between $L$ and $L[c]$ where $c$ is a Cohen-generic real over $L$. Karagila further proves that the Kinna-Wager degree is unbounded in this model.
  We prove that such an intermediate extension can be found in a Cohen-generic extension of \emph{any} ground model, fully resolving Grigorieff's question. That is, let $V$ be \emph{any} ZF model and $c$ a Cohen-generic real over $V$. We prove that there is an intermediate ZF-model $V\subset N \subset V[c]$ so that $N$ is not equal to $V(A)$ for any set $A\in V[c]$, the Kinna-Wagner degree of $N$ is unbounded and, in particular, no set forcing in $N$ forces the axiom of choice.
  Therefore, there are class many different intermediate models of ZF between $V$ and $V[c]$.</description>

      <title>New construction methods for uninorms via functions with q and uninorms on bounded lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the construction methods for uninorms on bounded lattices via functions with the given uninorms and $q\in \mathbb{L_{B}}$ (or $p\in \mathbb{L_{B}}$). Specifically, we investigate the conditions under which these functions can be uninorms on bounded lattices when $q\in (0,\mathfrak{e})\cup I_{\mathfrak{e}}^{\varrho}$ and $q\in I_{\varrho}^{\mathfrak{e}}$ (or $p\in (\mathfrak{e},1)\cup I_{\mathfrak{e}}^{\sigma}$ and $p\in I_{\sigma}^{\mathfrak{e}}$), respectively. Moreover, some illustrative examples and figures are provided.</description>

      <title>Cross-constraint basis theorems and products of partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We both survey and extend a new technique from Lu Liu to prove separation theorems between products of Ramsey-type theorems over computable reducibility. We use this technique to show that Ramsey's theorem for $n$-tuples and three colors is not computably reducible to finite products of Ramsey's theorem for $n$-tuples and two colors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove nonhalting of the Turing machine dubbed "Skelet #17", known to be one of the toughest 5-state, 2-symbol Turing machines to analyze. Combined with the efforts of The Busy Beaver Challenge, we are therefore able to show that BB(5), the fifth Busy Beaver number, equals 47,176,870.</description>

      <title>Valued fields, Metastable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08801</link>
      <description>arXiv:1709.08801v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of theories called metastable, including the theory of algebraically closed valued fields (ACVF) as a motivating example. The key local notion is that of definable types dominated by their stable part. A theory is metastable (over a sort $\Gamma$) if every type over a sufficiently rich base structure can be viewed as part of a $\Gamma$-parametrized family of stably dominated types. We initiate a study of definable groups in metastable theories of finite rank. Groups with a stably dominated generic type are shown to have a canonical stable quotient. Abelian groups are shown to be decomposable into a part coming from $\Gamma$, and a definable direct limit system of groups with stably dominated generic. In the case of ACVF, among definable subgroups of affine algebraic groups, we characterize the groups with stably dominated generics in terms of group schemes over the valuation ring. Finally, we classify all fields definable in ACVF.</description>

      <title>The strange world of transfinite Melodies -- Recognizability for weak and strong infinite time $\alpha$-register machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For exponentially closed ordinals $\alpha$, we consider recognizability of constructible subsets of $\alpha$ for $\alpha$-(w)ITRMs and their distribution in the constructible hierarchy. In particular, for $\alpha$-ITRMs, we show that, there are lost melodies that are recognizable without parameters for all $\alpha$, that the iterated recognizability is absolute between $L$ and $V$ for most values of $\alpha$ and generalize "all or nothing"-phenomenon known from ITRMs occurs for a proper class of $\alpha$. For $\alpha$-wITRMs, we offer a complete characterization of those $\alpha$ for which lost melodies exist and that the relation between the sets of computable and recognizable subsets of $\alpha$ varies wildly, depending on $\alpha$: The computable sets may be included among the recognizable sets (which is usually the case in ordinal computability), but there are also class many values of $\alpha$ for which the set of recognizable sets is empty and such for which the set of recognizable sets is non-empty, but disjoint from the set of computable sets.
  %for class many values of $\alpha$, the sets of $\alpha$-wITRM-computable and $\alpha$-wITRM-recognizable subsets of $\alpha$ are both non-empty, but disjoint, and, also for class many values of $\alpha$, the set of $\alpha$-wITRM-recognizable subsets of $\alpha$ is empty.
  This paper is an extension of our paper in the CiE 2023 proceedings.</description>

      <title>The weakness of finding descending sequences in ill-founded linear orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Weihrauch degree of the problem of finding a bad sequence in a non-well quasi order ($\mathsf{BS}$) is strictly above that of finding a descending sequence in an ill-founded linear order ($\mathsf{DS}$). This corrects our mistaken claim in arXiv:2010.03840, which stated that they are Weihrauch equivalent. We prove that K\"onig's lemma $\mathsf{KL}$ and the problem $\mathsf{wList}_{2^{\mathbb{N}},\leq\omega}$ of enumerating a given non-empty countable closed subset of $2^\mathbb{N}$ are not Weihrauch reducible to $\mathsf{DS}$ either, resolving two main open questions raised in arXiv:2010.03840.</description>

      <title>On Quantifiers for Quantitative Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04936v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a kind of first-order predicate logic with intended semantics in the reals. Compared to other approaches in the literature, we work predominantly in the multiplicative reals $[0,\infty]$, showing they support three generations of connectives, that we call non-linear, linear additive, and linear multiplicative. Means and harmonic means emerge as natural candidates for bounded existential and universal quantifiers, and in fact we see they behave as expected in relation to the other logical connectives. We explain this fact through the well-known fact that min/max and arithmetic mean/harmonic mean sit at opposite ends of a spectrum, that of p-means. We give syntax and semantics for this quantitative predicate logic, and as example applications, we show how softmax is the quantitative semantics of argmax, and R\'enyi entropy/Hill numbers are additive/multiplicative semantics of the same formula. Indeed, the additive reals also fit into the story by exploiting the Napierian duality $-\log \dashv 1/\exp$, which highlights a formal distinction between 'additive' and 'multiplicative' quantities. Finally, we describe two attempts at a categorical semantics via enriched hyperdoctrines. We discuss why hyperdoctrines are in fact probably inadequate for this kind of logic.</description>

      <title>On limit models and parametrized noetherian rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study limit models in the abstract elementary class of modules with embeddings as algebraic objects. We characterize parametrized noetherian rings using the degree of injectivity of certain limit models.
  We show that the number of limit models and how close a ring is from being noetherian are inversely proportional.
  $\textbf{Theorem.}$ Let $n \geq 0$ The following are equivalent.
  1. $R$ is left $(&lt;\aleph_{n } )$-noetherian but not left $(&lt; \aleph_{n -1 })$-noetherian.
  2.The abstract elementary class of modules with embeddings has exactly $n +1$ non-isomorphic $\lambda$-limit models for every $\lambda \geq (\operatorname{card}(R) + \aleph_0)^+$ such that the class is stable in $\lambda$.
  We further show that there are rings such that the abstract elementary class of modules with embeddings has exactly $\kappa$ non-isomorphic $\lambda$-limit models for every infinite cardinal $\kappa$.</description>

      <title>Profinite rigidity of affine Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the irreducible affine Coxeter groups are first-order rigid and deduce from this that they are profinitely rigid in the absolute sense. We then show that the first-order theory of any irreducible affine Coxeter group does not have a prime model. Finally, we prove that universal Coxeter groups of finite rank are homogeneous, and that the same applies to every hyperbolic (in the sense of Gromov) one-ended right-angled Coxeter group.</description>
