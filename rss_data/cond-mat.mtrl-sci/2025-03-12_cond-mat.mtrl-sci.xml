      <title>What is missing from existing Lithium-Sulfur models to capture coin-cell behaviour?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries offer a promising alternative to current lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, with a high theoretical energy density, improved safety and high abundance, low cost of materials. For Li-S to reach commercial application, it is essential to understand how the behaviour scales between cell formats; new material development is predominately completed at coin-cell level, whilst pouch-cells will be used for commercial applications. Differences such as reduced electrolyte-to-sulfur (E/S) ratios and increased geometric size at larger cell formats contribute to the behavioural differences, in terms of achievable capacity, cyclability and potential degradation mechanisms.
  This work focuses on the steps required to capture and test coin-cell behaviour, building upon the existing models within the literature, which predominately focus on pouch-cells. The areas investigated throughout this study, to improve the capability of the model in terms of scaling ability and causality of predictions, include the cathode surface area, precipitation dynamics and C-rate dependence.</description>

      <title>Ab initio thermal conductivity of Ge$_x$Sn$_{1-x}$O$_2$ alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rutile GeO2 is an emerging ultra-wide band gap semiconductor (UWBG) that has demonstrated excellent potential for applications in power electronic devices. Alloys of rutile SnO2, a well-established UWBG semiconducting oxide, with GeO2 are promising for tuning the material properties for applications. The thermal conductivity, in particular, is a key property which is significantly impacted by alloy disorder, but which is also essential in assessing the operation and degradation of materials in high-power electronic applications. Here, we present first-principles calculations of the thermal conductivity of rutile GeO2, SnO2, and their alloys, and quantify the effects of scattering by alloy disorder, temperature, and isotope mass distribution. We show that the relatively high thermal conductivity of the binary compounds is reduced by alloying, grain boundaries, and isotope disorder. However, we also find that the room-temperature thermal conductivity of the alloys is still comparable to or surpasses the values for beta-Ga2O3, an established UWBG semiconducting oxide. Our findings provide a roadmap for the codesign of the thermal properties of rutile GexSn1-xO2 alloys for electronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Computational study of indium oxide photoelectrodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a combination of first principles molecular dynamics simulations (FPMD) and electronic structure calculations, we characterize the atomistic structure and vibrational properties of a photocatalytic surface of In$_2$O$_3$, a promising photoelectrode for the production of hydrogen peroxide. We then investigate the surface in contact with water and show that the electronic states of In$_2$O$_3$ are appropriately positioned in energy to facilitate the two-electron water oxidation reaction (WOR) over the competing four-electron oxygen evolution reaction. We further propose that the use of strained thin films interfaced with water is beneficial in decreasing the optical gap of In$_2$O$_3$ and thus utilizing a wider portion of the solar spectrum for the WOR.</description>

      <title>Catenary-like rippled biphenylene/graphene lateral heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we conduct a first-principles analysis to explore the structural and electronic properties of curved biphenylene/graphene lateral junctions (BPN/G). We start our investigation focusing on the energetic stability of BPN/G by varying the width of the graphene region, BPN/Gn. The electronic structure of BPN/Gn reveals (i) the formation of metallic channels mostly localized along the BPN stripes, where (ii) the features of the energy bands near the Fermi level are ruled by the width (n) of the graphene regions, Gn. In the sequence, we find that the hydrogenation of BPN/Gn results in a semiconductor system with a catenary-like rippled geometry. The electronic states of the hydrogenated system are mainly confined in the curved Gn regions, and the dependence of the bandgap on the width of Gn is similar to that of hydrogenated armchair graphene nanoribbons. The effects of curvature on the electronic structure, analyzed in terms of external mechanical strain, revealed that the increase/decrease of the band gap is also dictated by the width of the Gn region. Further electronic transport calculations reveal a combination of strong transmission anisotropy and the emergence of negative differential resistance. Based on these findings, we believe that rippled biphenylene/graphene systems can be useful for the design of two-dimensional nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics-Inspired High-Entropy Oxide Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy oxide (HEO) thermodynamics transcend temperature-centric approaches, spanning a multidimensional landscape where oxygen chemical potential plays a decisive role. Here, we experimentally demonstrate how controlling the oxygen chemical potential coerces multivalent cations into divalent states in rock salt HEOs. We construct a preferred valence phase diagram based on thermodynamic stability and equilibrium analysis, alongside a high throughput enthalpic stability map derived from atomistic calculations leveraging machine learning interatomic potentials. We identify and synthesize seven equimolar single-phase rock salt compositions that accommodate multivalent Mn, Fe, or both, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction and fluorescence. X-ray absorption fine structure spectra reveal predominantly divalent cations. Ultimately, we introduce oxygen chemical potential overlap as a key complementary descriptor predicting HEO stability and synthesizability. Although we focus on rock salt HEOs, our methods are chemically and structurally agnostic, providing a broadly adaptable framework for navigating HEOs thermodynamics and enabling a broader compositional range with contemporary property interest.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Driven Moir\'e Engineering in Twisted Bilayers of High-Pseudospin Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e engineering offers new pathways for manipulating emergent states in twisted layered materials and lattice-mismatched heterostructures. With the key role of the geometry of the underlying lattice in mind, here we introduce the watermill lattice, a two-dimensional structure with low-energy states characterized by massless pseudospin-3/2 fermions with high winding numbers. Its twisted bilayer is shown to exhibit magic angles, where four isolated flat bands emerge around the Fermi level, featuring elevated Wilson-loop windings and enhanced quantum geometric effects, such as an increase in the ratio of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition temperature to the mean-field critical temperature under a weak Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) pairing. We discuss how the watermill lattice could be realized in the MXene and group-IV materials. Our study highlights the potential of exploiting lattice geometry in moir\'e engineering to uncover novel quantum phenomena and tailor emergent electronic properties in materials.</description>

      <title>Surface Chemistry-Driven Oxidation Mechanisms in Ti$_{\text{3}}$C$_{\text{2}}$T$_{\textit{x}}$ MXenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ is a leading compound within the MXenes family and can find host in widespread applications. It is synthesized by selectively etching layers from the Ti$_3$AlC$_2$ precursor, and this process typically introduces surface terminations, T$_x$, such as $-$OH, $=$O, or $-$F. However, the aggressive chemical conditions required for its preparation, as well as exposure to air, humidity, and heat, can lead to impurity phases that potentially compromise its desirable properties. We reveal a two-step oxidation process during heat treatment, where initial oxidation occurs between layers without altering the integrity of the Ti$_3$C$_2$ layered structure, followed by the formation of anatase TiO$_2$ at elevated temperatures. The process was carefully monitored using \emph{in situ} Raman spectroscopy and \emph{in situ} microwave conductivity measurements, employed to Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ prepared using various etching techniques involving concentrated HF, LiF + HCl, and HF + HCl mixtures. The oxidation process is heavily influenced by the synthesis route and surface chemistry of Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$, with fluoride and oxyfluoride groups playing a pivotal role in stabilizing the anatase phase. The absence of these groups, in contrast, can lead to the formation of rutile TiO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Minimal Hamiltonian of Nonsymmorphic Collinear Antiferromagnet MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\alpha$-MnTe, an $A$-type collinear antiferromagnet, has recently attracted significant attention due to its pronounced spin splitting despite having net zero magnetization, a phenomenon unique for a new class of magnetism dubbed altermagnetism. In this work, we develop a minimal effective Hamiltonian for $\alpha$-MnTe based on realistic orbitals near the Fermi level at both the $\Gamma$ and $A$ points. Our model is derived using group representation theory, first-principles calculations, and tight-binding modeling. The resulting effective Hamiltonian exhibits qualitatively distinct electron transport characteristics between these high-symmetry points and for different in-plane N\'{e}el vector orientations along the $[11\bar{2}0]$ and $[1\bar{1}00]$ directions. Although relativistic correction of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is believed to be not important in altermagnets, we show the dominant role of SOC in the spin splitting and valence electrons of MnTe. These findings provide critical insights into altermagnetic electron transport in MnTe and establish a model playground for future theoretical and experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Robust Anisotropic Spin Hall Effect in Rutile RuO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets, which exhibit the advantages of both antiferromagnets and ferromagnets, have attracted significant attention recently. Among them, ruthenium dioxide (RuO2), a prototypical altermagnet candidate, is under intensive debate on its magnetic order and altermagnetic characters. In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of the spin-to-charge conversion in epitaxial RuO2 thin films with various orientations and fabrication methods. By utilizing thermal spin injections from a ferrimagnetic insulator, we unambiguously reveal a negative spin Hall angle for RuO2, which is opposite to all the previous reports using ferromagnetic metals. Most importantly, we observe robust anisotropic spin-to-charge conversion in RuO2, with voltage ratios of 30% for the (100)- and (110)-orientations and 40% for the (101)-orientations. The ratio remains consistent across RuO2 films fabricated by sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, and molecular-beam epitaxy. These results conclusively show a robust and anisotropic spin Hall effect in RuO2 with the absence of altermagnetic spin-splitting contributions. Our study provides crucial insights and advances the understanding of spin-to-charge conversions in emerging materials with low crystal symmetries.</description>

      <title>First principal investigation of Structural optical and thermoelectric properties of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite $[NH_3-(CH_2)_4-NH_3]CdCl_4$ compound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural, thermoelectric, and optical properties of $[NH_3-(CH_2)_4-NH_3]CdCl_4$ were studied using Density Functional Theory (DFT) within the ABINIT code. The GGA-PBE functional, plane wave pseudopotentials, a kinetic energy cutoff of $35Ha$, and an 11x8x8 Monkhorst-Pack $k$-point grid were employed. The material comprises inorganic $[CdCl_4]^{2-}$ sheets, organic $[NH_3-(CH_2)_4-NH_3]^{2+}$ layers, and $N-H-Cl$ hydrogen bonds, ensuring sublattice cohesion. Structural optimization used reference crystal data, enabling analysis of alkylene-diammonium chain conformation, intermolecular interactions, and crystal stability. The study highlights the role of $Cd$ in influencing optical and thermoelectric properties. Temperature-induced changes lead to a reduced band gap and enhanced optical absorption, indicating significant electronic structure modifications. These findings propose $[NH_3-(CH_2)_4-NH_3]CdCl_4$ as a promising candidate for optoelectronic applications, particularly after thermal cycling, due to its improved performance under varying conditions.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic response of defect bound states to magnetic field in epitaxial FeSn films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal defects, whether intrinsic or engineered, drive many fundamental phenomena and novel functionalities of quantum materials. Here, we report symmetry-breaking phenomena induced by Sn-vacancy defects on the surface of epitaxial Kagome antiferromagnet FeSn films using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Near the Sn-vacancy defects, anisotropic quasiparticle interference patterns are observed in the differential conductance dI/dV maps, indicating two-fold electronic states that break the 6-fold rotational symmetry of the Kagome layer. Furthermore, the Sn-vacancy defects induce bound states that exhibit anomalous Zeeman shifts under an out-of-plane magnetic field, where their energy shifts linearly towards higher energy independent of the direction of the magnetic field. Under an in-plane magnetic field, the shift of the bound state energy also shows a two-fold oscillating behavior as a function of the azimuth angle. These findings demonstrate defect-enabled new functionalities in Kagome antiferromagnets for potential applications in nanoscale spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Functional Unit: A New Perspective on Materials Science Research Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New materials have long marked the civilization level, serving as an impetus for technological progress and societal transformation. The classic structure-property correlations were key of materials science and engineering. However, the knowledge of materials faces significant challenges in adapting to exclusively data-driven approaches for new material discovery. This perspective introduces the concepts of functional units (FUs) to fill the gap in understanding of material structure-property correlations and knowledge inheritance as the "composition-microstructure" paradigm transitions to a data-driven AI paradigm transitions. Firstly, we provide a bird's-eye view of the research paradigm evolution from early "process-structure-properties-performance" to contemporary data-driven AI new trend. Next, we highlight recent advancements in the characterization of functional units across diverse material systems, emphasizing their critical role in multiscale material design. Finally, we discuss the integration of functional units into the new AI-driven paradigm of materials science, addressing both opportunities and challenges in computational materials innovation.</description>

      <title>Topological Nature of Orbital Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground state topologies in quantum materials have unveiled many unique topological phases with novel Hall responses. Recently, the orbital Hall effect in insulators has suggested the existence of orbital Chern insulators (OCIs) in which the orbital angular momentum drives the Hall response. Studies on OCIs, however, have so far been restricted to valley-locked or spinful systems, but candidate materials for systematic studies of OCIs are lacking. Here we discuss a framework for investigating OCIs using the feature-spectrum topology approach. To characterize the ground-state topology in the orbital degree of freedom, we introduce the orbital Chern number and orbital-feature Berry curvature and demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence and orbital Hall response. We also uncover a parameter-driven topological phase transition, which would offer tunability of the OCIs. In this way, we identify monolayer blue-phosphorene (traditionally considered topologically trivial) as the primal 'hydrogen atom' of OCIs as a spinless, valley-free OCI material. Our study gives insight into the nature of orbital-driven topological phases and reveals a new facet of blue-phosphorene, and provides a new pathway for advancements in orbitronics and the discovery of novel topological materials.</description>

      <title>High-throughput computation and machine learning modeling of magnetic moments and M\"ossbauer parameters for Fe-based intermetallics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on high-throughput density functional theory calculations, we evaluate the local magnetic moments and M\"ossbauer properties for Fe-based intermetallic compounds and exploy machine learning to map the local crystalline environments to such properties. It is observed that magnetic moments and M\"ossbauer parameters provide complementary insights into the local crystalline environment, where the statistical features cannot be captured using phenomenological models. Furthermore, we find that the scarcity of existing data in Materials Project (MP) poses a significant challenge in developing predictive machine learning models, whereas SOAP-based descriptors can be applied for reliable modeling of the enriched datasets with extra structural prototypes. This work advances the mapping of local crystalline structures to magnetic and spectroscopic properties, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the charge compensation in topological insulator thin films due to the laser fluence-induced segregation of the Sb2Se3 phase. Sb doped Bi2Se3 films were deposited on commercial Si substrates coated with 300 nm of amorphous SiO2 using the Pulsed Laser Deposition technique at different laser fluence of 1.25 J-cm-2, 1.87 J-cm-2, 2.75 J-cm-2, and 3.25 J-cm-2. The grazing x-ray diffraction measurements revealed the growth of rhombohedral Bi2Se3 films on SiO2 with additional peaks corresponding to the Sb2Se3 peaks. The phase fraction of the segregated Sb2Se3 systematically reduces as the laser fluence increases. The magnetoresistance measured at temperatures 3K-20K was compared across different samples deposited at various laser fluences. The sample deposited at 1.25 J-cm-2 exhibits a bulk-insulating nature with an order decrease in the carrier density. The weak antilocalization quantum correction to the magneto conductivity was analyzed using the Hikami Larkin Nagaoka Theory. As the laser fluence increases the deduced value of coefficient alpha, number of conduction channels was found to be 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 5.0, and the quantum phase coherence length lphi ranges from 10 nm to 150 nm. The power factor gamma of the temperature dependence of lphi also varies as 0.37, 0.45, 0.69, and 0.92, respectively. The charge compensation due to the non-TI, ptype Sb2Se3 phase is believed to cause the reduction in the bulk carrier density n, and enhanced surface state contribution.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Correlation Spectroscopy in CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CrSBr is an air-stable magnetic van der Waals semiconductor with strong magnetic anisotropy, where the interaction of excitons with the magnetic order enables the optical identification of different magnetic phases. Here, we study the magnetic anisotropy of multi-layer CrSBr inside a three-axis vector magnet and correlate magnetic order and optical transitions in emission and absorption. We identify layer by layer switching of the magnetization through drastic changes of the optical emission and absorption energy and strength as a function of the applied magnetic field. We correlate optical transitions in reflection spectra with photoluminescence (PL) emission using a transfer-matrix analysis and find that ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order between layers can coexist in the same crystal. In the multi-peak PL emission the intensity of energetically lower lying transitions reduces monotonously with increasing field strength whereas energetically higher lying transitions around the bright exciton $X_B$ brighten close to the saturation field. Using this contrasting behavior we can therefore correlate transitions with each other.</description>

      <title>The effect of boron incorporation on leakage and wake-up in ferroelectric Al_{1-x}Sc_xN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the influence of boron incorporation on the structural and electrical properties of ferroelectric Aluminum Scandium Nitride (Al_{1-x}Sc_xN ) thin films, focusing on leakage currents, wake-up effects, and imprint behavior. Al_{1-x}Sc_xN films were incorporated with varying boron concentrations and analyzed under different deposition conditions to determine their structural integrity and ferroelectric performance. Key findings include a reduction in leakage currents, non-trivial alterations in bandgap energy as well as an increasing coercive fields with increasing boron content. Films with 6-13 at.% boron exhibited N-polar growth, while those with 16 at.% boron showed mixed polarity after deposition, which affected their ferroelectric response during the initial switching cycles - as did the addition of boron itself compared to pure Al1-xScxN . With increasing boron content, wake-up became gradually more pronounced and was strongest for pure Al_{1-x}B_xN .</description>

      <title>Influence of Crystal Structure and Composition on Optical and Electronic Properties of Pyridinium-based Bismuth Iodide Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impacts of structure and composition on the optical and electronic properties of a series of pyridinium-based bismuth iodide complexes. Organic substrates with various functional groups, such as 4-aminopyridine (4-Ampy), 4-methylpyridine (4-Mepy), 4-dimethyaminopyridine (4-Dmapy), and 4-pyridinecarbonitrile (4-CNpy) with different electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups at the para position of the pyridine ring were employed. Crystallographic analysis reveals various bismuth iodide structures, including 1D chains and discrete 0D motifs. The optical band gap of these materials, identified via Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and verified with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, is influenced by the crystal packing and stabilising interactions. Through a comprehensive analysis, including Hirshfeld surface (HS) and void assessment, the study underscores the influence of noncovalent intermolecular interactions on crystal packing. Spectroscopic evaluations provide insights into electronic interactions, elucidating the role of electron donor and acceptor substituents within the lattice. Thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) indicates structural stability up to 250{\deg}C. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) reveals significant conductivity in the range of 10-20 mS/pixel at 298.15 K. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Bi L3 edge indicates a similar oxidation state and electronic environment across all samples, underscoring the role of bismuth centres surrounded by iodides.</description>

      <title>Improved thermal stability of dielectric properties and energy storage properties of lead-free relaxor Ba(1-x)LaxTi0.89Sn0.11O3 ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-free perovskite ceramics Ba(1-x)LaxTi0.89Sn0.11O3 with x= 0, 0.015, 0.025, and 0.035 (BLTSnx) were synthesized by solid-state reaction method. The enhanced energy storage properties were studied across the ferroelectric relaxor conversion. The pure perovskite structure of all prepared samples was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and the Raman spectroscopy technique. Scanning electron microscopy micrographs show a drastic decrease in the grain size in La-doped ceramics. Furthermore, the doped samples exhibit smeared phase transition and frequency dispersion in dielectric permittivity, typical for relaxors. The P-E hysteresis loops become thin with the increase of the La-doping, demonstrating the ferroelectric-relaxor phase conversion. The enhanced recovered energy density and the energy storage efficiency of 158.8 mJ/cm3 and 82.73 % were observed in the BLTSn2.5 sample at room temperature, respectively. These properties indicate that environmentally friendly BLTSn2.5 is a viable candidate for energy-storage capacitor applications near room temperature.</description>

      <title>Fermiology and Band Structure of Oxygen-Terminated Ti3C2Tx MXene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of two-dimensional carbides and nitrides known as MXenes exhibit remarkable electronic properties. Tailoring these properties, however, requires an in-depth understanding of the band structure and Fermi-surface topology. Surface oxidation of MXenes has previously hampered the characterization of their Fermi surface, which is crucial for understanding the topology and anisotropy in the electronic structure and, ultimately, for tailoring electronic properties. Here, we reveal the Fermi surface topology and band structure of purely oxygen-terminated Ti3C2Tx MXene achieved through rigorous thin film sample preparation and ultrahigh vacuum annealing. Polarized synchrotron radiation-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals electron pockets, bulk band gaps, and a Dirac-like feature in the anisotropic electronic band structure. This paves the way for a fundamental understanding of band engineering of electronic transport properties, providing insights of importance for energy storage devices, transparent conductors, and catalysis.</description>

      <title>Tunable Octdong and Spindle-Torus Fermi Surfaces in Kramers Nodal Line Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been proposed that all achiral non-centrosymmetric crystals host so-called Kramers nodal lines, which are doubly degenerate band crossings connecting time-reversal invariant momenta in the Brillouin zone that arise due to spin-orbit coupling. When Kramers nodal lines intersect the Fermi level, they form exotic three-dimensional Fermi surfaces which is certain configurations can be fully described by two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions. These Fermi surfaces are predicted to realize a quantized optical conductivity with multiple quantized levels a large light- and field-induced anomalous Hall effect. However, until now, no Kramers nodal line metal with such unconventional Fermi surfaces has been experimentally observed. Here, we extend the search for Kramers nodal line metals beyond the previously considered case in which the Fermi surfaces enclose a single time-reversal invariant momentum. Using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy measurements and ab-initio calculations, we present evidence that the 3R polytypes of TaS$_2$ and NbS$_2$ are Kramers nodal line metals with open Octdong and Spindle-torus Fermi surfaces, respectively. We show that by reducing the band filling, a transition between these two configurations can be observed. Moreover, our data suggests a naturally occurring size quantization effect of inclusions of 3R-TaS$_2$ in commercially available 2H-TaS$_2$ crystals, which could enable the observation of quantized optical conductivity. Finally, since the open Fermi-surfaces encircle two time-reversal invariant momenta each, we predict a phase transition from a Kramers nodal line metal to a conventional metal by strain or uniaxial pressure. Our work establishes the 3R phase of metallic transition metal dichalcogenides as a tunable platform to explore new phenomena expected from exotic Fermi surfaces in Kramers nodal line metals.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale electrostatic control in ferroelectric thin films through lattice chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale electrostatic control of oxide interfaces enables physical phenomena and exotic functionalities beyond the realm of the bulk material. In technologically-relevant ferroelectric thin films, the interface-mediated polarization control is usually exerted by engineering the depolarizing field. Here, in contrast, we introduce polarizing surfaces and lattice chemistry engineering as an alternative strategy. Specifically, we engineer the electric-dipole ordering in ferroelectric oxide heterostructures by exploiting the charged sheets of the layered Aurivillius model system. By tracking in-situ the formation of the Aurivillius charged Bi$_{2}$O$_{2}$ sheets, we reveal their polarizing effect leading to the characteristic Aurivillius out-of-plane antipolar ordering. Next, we use the polarizing Bi$_{2}$O$_{2}$ stacking as a versatile electrostatic environment to create new electric dipole configurations. We insert multiferroic BiFeO$_3$ into the Aurivillius framework to stabilize a ferrielectric-like non-collinear electric-dipole order in the final heterostructure while maintaining the antiferromagnetic order of BiFeO$_3$. We thus demonstrate that engineering the lattice chemistry stabilizes unconventional ferroic orderings at the nanoscale, a strategy that may be expanded beyond the realm of electrically ordered materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the optical absorption within the conduction-subbands of a cylindrical GaN/AlN quantum wire. We analyze the optical absorption rate and the real part of the dielectric function for both quantum wire (QWR) and quantum dot (QD) structures in the presence of donor-impurity states. The results cover that the density of states associated with free motion in the QWR structure leads to a lower optical absorption compared to the QDs, as evidenced by the optical spectra. This study advances the understanding of GaN/AlN heterostructures by offering a comprehensive analysis of the optical properties of QWRs and QDs, especially under donor-doping situation. As a result, the outcomes provide a clear evidence of the effect of semiconductor nanostructures on the optical properties of optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Active magneto-mechanical metamaterial with the wave transmission and Poisson's ratio controlled via the magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the significance of active mechanical metamaterials capable of being remotely manipulated through changes in external stimuli. While research in this area has achieved considerable success in controlling reconfiguration to induce shape morphing or alter static mechanical properties, the active control of wave propagation within these systems remains largely unexplored. In this study, we propose a magneto-mechanical metamaterial that can be entirely governed by adjusting the magnitude and direction of an external magnetic field. We demonstrate that such a system offers remote control over its Poisson's ratio, allowing for transitions from strongly auxetic to positive Poisson's ratio configurations. Additionally, our system enables manipulation of the phononic band structure, facilitating the formation of complete band gaps across different frequency ranges depending on the stage of the magnetically guided reconfiguration process. The potential for achieving such active control over the properties and behavior of these materials holds great promise for various applications, including robotics and smart vibration dampers that can be remotely controlled.</description>

      <title>Kagome goldene with flat bands and Dirac nodal line fermions via line-graph epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kagome lattice is a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum phases. However, achieving a single-atomic-layer kagome lattice in elemental materials has remained a significant challenge. Here we introduce line-graph epitaxy, a novel approach that enables the synthesis of single-atomic-layer goldene with a kagome lattice. Through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS), alongside density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide direct evidence of kagome goldene, which exhibits a flat band with a van Hove singularity approximately 1.1 eV below the Fermi level, indicative of strong electron correlation effects. Notably, the flat band breaks down at the zigzag edges of the goldene nanoflakes, underlining the role of edge effects. Additionally, our calculations reveal that weak interlayer interactions between goldene and the Au$_2$Ge substrate give rise to dual Dirac nodal lines due to a proximity effect. These findings offer a strategy for constructing elemental kagome lattices and provide a generalizable approach for fabricating and controlling line-graph materials. This work paves the way for exploring quantum phases driven by strong correlations and designing materials for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Observation of Topological Armchair Edge States in Photonic Biphenylene Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge states in 2D materials are vital for advancements in spintronics, quantum computing, and logic transistors. For graphene nanoribbons, it is well known that the zigzag edges can host edge states, but realization of armchair edge states has been challenging without breaking the time-reversal symmetry. Here, by using a photonic analog of recently synthesized graphene-like biphenylene network (BPN), we demonstrate topological in-gap edge states particularly at the armchair edges. Interestingly, several bulk states preserve the characteristics of edge states along the armchair boundaries, manifesting an unusual hybridization between the edge and bulk states. Experimentally, we observe both zigzag and armchair edge states in photonic BPN lattices written in a nonlinear crystal. Furthermore, we clarify the different features of the armchair boundary between the BPN and graphene lattices. Our results demonstrated here may be applicable to carbon-based BPNs and other artificial platforms beyond photonics, holding promise for expanding the application scope of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Phase-matching of high harmonic generation in twisted solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High harmonic generation (HHG) in solids could enable attosecond and ultraviolet light sources with high compactness, great controllability and rich functions. However, the HHG process is accompanied by a quite large wavevector mismatch that is uncompensated by any traditional phase-matching method, directly limiting its energy conversion efficiency. Here, we propose an effective strategy for phase-matching of HHG with arbitrary harmonic orders in solids. Two flakes of solids with an interlayer twist induce a nonlinear optical phase that depends on the crystal symmetry, twist angle and harmonic order, which can be accurately designed to compensate for the phase mismatch in HHG. Guided by the twist-phase-matching theory, we achieved a record-high conversion efficiency of $~1.5\times10^{-5}$ for the fifth HHG in twisted hexagonal boron nitride crystals with a total thickness of only 1 ${\mu}m$. Our work establishes a foundation for developing ultrashort-wavelength and ultrafast-pulse laser sources in compact solid-state tabletop systems for fundamental and applied sciences.</description>

      <title>Observation of the nonlinear chiral thermoelectric Hall effect in tellurium</title>

Abstract: The nonlinear thermoelectric effect is a key factor for realising unconventional thermoelectric phenomena, such as heat rectification and power generation using thermal fluctuations. Recent theoretical advances have indicated that chiral materials can host a variety of exotic nonlinear thermoelectric transport arising from inversion-symmetry breaking. However, experimental demonstration has yet to be achieved. Here, we report the observation of the nonlinear chiral thermoelectric Hall effect in chiral tellurium at room temperature, where a voltage is generated as a cross product of the temperature gradient and electric field. The resulting thermoelectric Hall voltage is on the order of {\mu}V, consistent with the prediction from the ab initio calculation. Furthermore, the sign of the thermoelectric Hall voltage is reversed depending on the crystal chirality, demonstrating a novel functionality of sign control of the thermoelectric effect by the chirality degrees of freedom. Our findings reveal the potential of chiral systems as nonlinear thermoelectric materials for advanced thermal management and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>To Use or Not to Use a Universal Force Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing scientific research, particularly in computational materials science, by enabling more accurate and efficient simulations. Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as powerful tools for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, potentially offering quantum-mechanical accuracy with the efficiency of classical MD. This Perspective evaluates the viability of universal MLFFs for simulating complex materials systems from the standpoint of a potential practitioner. Using the temperature-driven ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition of PbTiO$_3$ as a benchmark, we assess leading universal force fields, including CHGNet, MACE, M3GNet, and GPTFF, alongside specialized models like UniPero. While universal MLFFs trained on PBE-derived datasets perform well in predicting equilibrium properties, they largely fail to capture realistic finite-temperature phase transitions under constant-pressure MD, often exhibiting unphysical instabilities. These shortcomings stem from inherited biases in exchange-correlation functionals and limited generalization to anharmonic interactions governing dynamic behavior. However, fine-tuning universal models or employing system-specific MLFFs like UniPero successfully restores predictive accuracy. We advocates for hybrid approaches combining universal pretraining with targeted optimization, improved error quantification frameworks, and community-driven benchmarks to advance MLFFs as robust tools for computational materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Gyrotropic metamaterials with tailored magnetization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic materials are crucial in nonreciprocal electromagnetic devices, such as isolators, circulators, and nonreciprocal phase shifters. However, their use is often limited by the need for a uniform bias magnetic field and nonuniform demagnetizing fields, resulting in the restricted aperture of free-space devices, poor temperature stability, and incompatibility with magnetic field-sensitive applications. Alternative methods have been developed to achieve nonreciprocity using active, nonlinear, and time-varying metamaterials, each with its own advantages and limitations. Here, we present a new approach based on self-biased gyrotropic metamaterials composed of magnetically hard magnets (specifically NdFeB) embedded in a magnetically soft ferrite matrix. In this configuration, the NdFeB magnets provide the magnetic bias for the ferrite matrix, which produces a nonreciprocal response. This gyrotropic metamaterial can exhibit zero net magnetization while producing strong and uniform Faraday rotation over a broad temperature range. Without bias and demagnetizing fields, the aperture of this Faraday rotator can be virtually unlimited. Using this method, we demonstrate uniform 45-degree Faraday rotation and effective isolation across the microwave X-band.</description>

      <title>Image-potential states on a 2D Gr-ferromagnet hybrid: enhancing spin and stacking sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy studies of image-potential states on Gr/Fe/Ir(111) show their sensitivity to the spatial variation of the Gr-Fe distance, and of the interfacial charge and spin transfer within the moir\'e unit cell. A stacking contrast between fcc and hcp sites, indistinguishable in the direct tunneling mode, is provided by the image-potential states in both resonant tunneling topography and spectroscopy images. The spin-polarized measurements reveal a site- and energy-dependent spin-polarization of the image-potential states that is mapped across the moir\'e unit cell with a spin contrast between hcp and fcc sites unobservable in direct tunneling mode. On the on-top sites, the lowest image-potential states are found to exhibit a high spin-polarization, in contrast to the electronic states around the Fermi energy evanescent into vacuum, and attributed to their interfacial character at the respective Gr-Fe distance. Since the physisorbed graphene is only weakly spin-polarized on these sites, image-potential states reflect the spin density at buried interfaces covered by non-magnetic passivation layers. The simultaneous imaging of structural, electronic and magnetic properties, both at the surface and the buried interface will prove invaluable in research of 2D hybrids and heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Contribution of Geometry and Non-Abelian Gauge Fields to Aharonov-Bohm Scattering of Massless Fermions in Graphene with Disclinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work examines the effect of disclinations on the scattering of quasipaticles in graphene with the presence of a topological defect. Using the tight-binding method, the electronic properties of graphene with disclination are described, where the topological defects are introduced in the lattice via geometric theory. The massless Dirac equation is modified to account for the curvature induced by these defects, incorporating a gauge field. The results show that disclinations significantly affect the scattering process, altering phase shifts and interference patterns. The differential cross-section and its dependence on the scattering angle are analyzed, highlighting the role of geometric factors like the parameter {\alpha} in shaping the scattering dynamics.</description>

      <title>Chemical reasoning in LLMs unlocks steerable synthesis planning and reaction mechanism elucidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While machine learning algorithms have been shown to excel at specific chemical tasks, they have struggled to capture the strategic thinking that characterizes expert chemical reasoning, limiting their widespread adoption. Here we demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can serve as powerful chemical reasoning engines when integrated with traditional search algorithms, enabling a new approach to computer-aided chemistry that mirrors human expert thinking. Rather than using LLMs to directly manipulate chemical structures, we leverage their ability to evaluate chemical strategies and guide search algorithms toward chemically meaningful solutions. We demonstrate this paradigm through two fundamental challenges: strategy-aware retrosynthetic planning and mechanism elucidation. In retrosynthetic planning, our method allows chemists to specify desired synthetic strategies in natural language to find routes that satisfy these constraints in vast searches. In mechanism elucidation, LLMs guide the search for plausible reaction mechanisms by combining chemical principles with systematic exploration. Our approach shows strong performance across diverse chemical tasks, with larger models demonstrating increasingly sophisticated chemical reasoning. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for computer-aided chemistry that combines the strategic understanding of LLMs with the precision of traditional chemical tools, opening possibilities for more intuitive and powerful chemical reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>Kramers nodal lines in intercalated TaS$_2$ superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kramers degeneracy is one fundamental embodiment of the quantum mechanical nature of particles with half-integer spin under time reversal symmetry. Under the chiral and noncentrosymmetric achiral crystalline symmetries, Kramers degeneracy emerges respectively as topological quasiparticles of Weyl fermions and Kramers nodal lines, anchoring the Berry phase-related physics of electrons. However, an experimental demonstration for ideal Kramers nodal lines (KNLs) well isolated at the Fermi level is lacking. Here, we establish a class of noncentrosymmetric achiral intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductors with large Ising-type spin-orbit coupling, represented by In$_x$TaS$_2$, to host an ideal KNL phase. We provide evidence from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with spin resolution, angle-dependent quantum oscillation (QO) measurements, and ab-initio calculations. Our work not only provides a realistic platform for realizing and tuning KNLs in layered materials, but also paves the way for exploring the interplay between KNLs and superconductivity, as well as applications pertaining to spintronics, valleytronics, and nonlinear transport.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Mitigating Distribution Shifts For Machine Learning Force Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) are a promising alternative to expensive ab initio quantum mechanical molecular simulations. Given the diversity of chemical spaces that are of interest and the cost of generating new data, it is important to understand how MLFFs generalize beyond their training distributions. In order to characterize and better understand distribution shifts in MLFFs, we conduct diagnostic experiments on chemical datasets, revealing common shifts that pose significant challenges, even for large foundation models trained on extensive data. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that current supervised training methods inadequately regularize MLFFs, resulting in overfitting and learning poor representations of out-of-distribution systems. We then propose two new methods as initial steps for mitigating distribution shifts for MLFFs. Our methods focus on test-time refinement strategies that incur minimal computational cost and do not use expensive ab initio reference labels. The first strategy, based on spectral graph theory, modifies the edges of test graphs to align with graph structures seen during training. Our second strategy improves representations for out-of-distribution systems at test-time by taking gradient steps using an auxiliary objective, such as a cheap physical prior. Our test-time refinement strategies significantly reduce errors on out-of-distribution systems, suggesting that MLFFs are capable of and can move towards modeling diverse chemical spaces, but are not being effectively trained to do so. Our experiments establish clear benchmarks for evaluating the generalization capabilities of the next generation of MLFFs. Our code is available at https://tkreiman.github.io/projects/mlff_distribution_shifts/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical phenomena in condensed matter normally arise from the collective effect of all atoms, while selectively addressing a lone atomic sublattice by external stimulus is elusive. The later functionality may, however, be useful for different applications due to a possible response being different from that occurring when the external stimulus affects the whole solid. Here, we introduce cross-chain antiferromagnets, where the stacking of two magnetic sublattices form a pattern of intersecting atomic chains, supportive to the sublattice selectivity. We dub this antiferromagnetic (AFM) stacking X-type and demonstrate that it reveals unique spin-dependent transport properties not present in conventional magnets. Based on high-throughput analyses and computations, we unveil three prototypes of X-type AFM stacking and identify 15 X-type AFM candidates. Using $\beta$-Fe$_{2}$PO$_{5}$ as a representative example, we predict the sublattice-selective spin-polarized transport driven by the X-type AFM stacking, where one magnetic sublattice is conducting, while the other is not. As a result, a spin torque can be exerted solely on a single sublattice, leading to unconventional ultrafast dynamics of the N\`eel vector capable of deterministic switching of the AFM domains. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked type of magnetic moment stacking and reveals sublattice-selective physical properties promising for high-performance spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal-Vacancy Point Defects in Zinc Oxide as Deep-Level Spin Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wide band gap oxides are promising host materials for spin defect qubits, offering unique advantages such as a dilute nuclear spin environment. Zinc oxide (ZnO), in particular, can achieve exceptional high purity, which enables long spin coherence time. In this work, we theoretically search for deep-level point defects in ZnO with optimal physical properties for optically-addressable spin qubits. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the Molybdenum-vacancy complex defect $Mo_{Zn}v_O$ in ZnO to own promising spin and optical properties, including spin-triplet ground state, optical transition in the visible to near-infrared range with high quantum yield, allowed intersystem crossings with a sizable optically-detected magnetic resonance contrast, and long spin T$_2$ and T$^*_2$. Notably, we find the Huang-Rhys factor of the defect to be around 5, which is significantly smaller than the typical range of 10-30 for most known defects in ZnO. Furthermore, we compare the spin decoherence driven by the nuclear spin bath and paramagnetic impurity baths. We find that the paramagnetic impurities are very effective in causing spin decoherence even with very low concentrations, implying that they can likely dominate the spin decoherence in ZnO even after isotopic purification. Using the computed excited-state energies and kinetic rates as inputs, we predict the ODMR contrast and propose a new protocol for spin qubit initialization and readout, which could be generalized to other systems with forbidden axial intersystem crossings.</description>

Abstract: The development of spectroscopic techniques in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range has significantly advanced the understanding of ultrafast interactions in magnetic systems triggered by optical excitation. In this work, we introduce a previously missing geometry that facilitates the observation of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of magnetic systems with an out-of-plane magnetization grown on XUV opaque substrates. This novel approach to probe ultrafast magnetization dynamics combines the magneto-optical Kerr effect with the strong dependence of a sample's reflectance near its Brewster angle. It therefore works with linearly polarized light and does not require any additional polarizing optics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the technique by presenting both simulations and experimental data as a function of the energy and the polarization of the XUV probe radiation as well as of the delay time after optical excitation.</description>

      <title>Materials Map Integrating Experimental and Computational Data through Graph-Based Machine Learning for Enhanced Materials Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials informatics (MI), which emerges from the integration of materials science and data science, is expected to greatly streamline the material discovery and development. The data used for MI are obtained from both computational and experimental studies, while their integration remains challenging. In our previous study, we reported the integration of these datasets by applying a machine learning model that captures trends hidden in the experimental datasets to compositional data stored in the computational database. In this study, we use the obtained data to construct materials maps, which visualize the relation in the structural features of materials, aiming to support study by the experimental researchers. The map is constructed using the MatDeepLearn (MDL) framework, which implements the graph-based representation of material structures, deep learning, and dimensional reduction for the map construction. We evaluate the obtained materials maps through statistical analysis and found that the MDL using message passing neural network (MPNN) enables efficient extraction of features that reflect the structural complexity of materials. Moreover, we found that this advantage does not necessarily translate into improved accuracy in predicting material properties. We attribute this unexpected outcome to the high learning performance inherent in MPNN, which can contribute to the structuring of data points within the materials map.</description>

Abstract: We develop a general stability analysis for objective structures, which constitute a far reaching generalization of crystal lattice systems. We show that these particle systems, although in general neither periodic nor space filling, allow for the identification of stability constants in terms of representations of the underlying symmetry group and interaction potentials. Our main results provide general stability criteria and second order energy bounds for equilibrium configurations. In particular, a general computational algorithm to test objective structures for their stability is derived. By way of example we show that our method can be applied to verify the stability of carbon nanotubes with chirality.</description>

Abstract: Strange metals arise in a variety of platforms for strongly correlated electrons, ranging from the cuprates, heavy fermions to flat band systems. Motivated by recent experiments in kagome metals, we study a Hubbard model on a kagome lattice whose noninteracting limit contains flat bands. A Kondo lattice description is constructed, in which the correlation effects are captured by symmetry preserving and exponentially localized molecular orbitals. These compact molecular orbitals represent the local degrees of freedom that emerge from topological flat bands. We identify a quantum critical point at which quasiparticles are lost and strange metallicity emerges. Our theoretical work opens up a new route for realizing beyond-Landau quantum criticality, as well as the associated strange metallicity and emergent quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Out-of-Equilibrium Quantum Dynamics in Disordered Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a linear-scaling numerical method for exploring nonequilibrium electron dynamics in systems of arbitrary complexity. Based on the Chebyshev expansion of the time evolution of the single-particle density matrix, the method gives access to nonperturbative excitation and relaxation phenomena in models of disordered materials with sizes on the experimental scale. After validating the method by applying it to saturable optical absorption in clean graphene, we uncover that disorder can enhance absorption in graphene and that the interplay between light, anisotropy, and disorder in nanoporous graphene might be appealing for sensing applications. Beyond the optical properties of graphene-like materials, the method can be applied to a wide range of large-area materials and systems with arbitrary descriptions of defects and disorder.</description>

      <title>Hedgehog topological defects in 3D amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20631</link>

Abstract: The underlying structural disorder renders the concept of topological defects in amorphous solids difficult to apply and hinders a first-principle identification of the microscopic carriers of plasticity and of the regions more prone to structural rearrangements (``soft spots''). Recently, it has been proposed that well-defined topological defects can still be identified in glasses, and correlated to local and global plasticity, by looking at the eigenvector field or the particle displacement field. Nevertheless, all the existing proposals and analyses are only valid in two spatial dimensions. In this work, we propose the idea of using hedgehog topological defects to characterize the plasticity of 3D glasses and to geometrically predict the location of their soft spots. We corroborate our proposal by simulating a Kremer-Grest 3D polymer glass, and by using both the normal mode eigenvector field and the displacement field around large plastic events. Contrary to the 2D case, the sign of the topological charge defined from the eigenvector field is ambiguous and the geometry of the topological defects, whether radial or hyperbolic, plays a fundamental role in 3D. In fact, we find that the topological hedgehog defects relevant for plasticity are those exhibiting hyperbolic geometry, resembling the saddle-point structure of 2D topological defects with negative winding number (anti-vortices). Our results confirm that a topological characterization of plasticity in glasses is feasible and provide a concrete realization of this program in 3D amorphous systems.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of supersymmetric spin and charge dynamics observed by inelastic neutron scattering</title>

Abstract: Supersymmetry is an algebraic property of a quantum Hamiltonian that, by giving every boson a fermionic superpartner and vice versa, may underpin physics beyond the Standard Model. Fractional bosonic and fermionic quasiparticles are familiar in condensed matter, as in the spin and charge excitations of the $t$-$J$ model describing electron dynamics in one-dimensional materials, but this type of symmetry is almost unknown. However, the triplet excitations of a quantum spin ladder in an applied magnetic field provide a supersymmetric analogue of the $t$-$J$ chain. Here we perform neutron spectroscopy on the spin-ladder compounds (C$_5$D$_{12}$N)$_2$CuBr$_4$ and (C$_5$D$_{12}$N)$_2$CuCl$_4$ over a range of applied fields and temperatures, and apply matrix-product-state methods to the ladder and equivalent chain models. From the momentum-resolved dynamics of a single charge-like excitation in a bath of fractional spins, we find essential differences in thermal broadening between the supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric sectors. The persistence of a strict zone-centre pole at all temperatures constitutes an observable consequence of supersymmetry that marks the beginning of supersymmetric studies in experimental condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration with antiferromagnetically ordered NaGdP$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the structural, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties, as well as the adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR) performance of NaGdP$_2$O$_7$. Although NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering at a N\'eel temperature of $T_{\rm N} = 570$ mK in zero field, ADR experiments achieved a minimum temperature of 220 mK starting from $T = 2$ K under an applied magnetic field of $\mu_0H = 5$ T. The warm-up time back to $T = 2$ K exceeds 60 hours, which is roughly 50 times longer than that of its Yb-based analogue, underscoring the potential of NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ as an efficient precooling stage in double-stage ADR systems. We show that NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ can be seen as a network of ferromagnetic spin chains with antiferromagnetic interchain couplings and also investigate the influence of antiferromagnetic ordering on the magnetic entropy. We find that the temperature dependence of the entropy plays a more dominant role than its magnetic field dependence in the magnetically ordered state.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Meets Topological Hall Effect in Cr2Ge2Te6 Heterostructures</title>

Abstract: Introducing topologically protected skyrmions in graphene holds significant importance for developing high-speed, low-energy spintronic devices. Here, we present a centrosymmetric ferromagnetic graphene/trilayer Cr2Ge2Te6/graphene heterostructure, demonstrating the anomalous and topological Hall effect due to the magnetic proximity effect. Through gate voltage control, we effectively tune the emergence and size of skyrmions. Micromagnetic simulations reveal the formation of skyrmions and antiskyrmions, which respond differently to external magnetic fields, leading to oscillations in the topological Hall signal. Our findings provide a novel pathway for the formation and manipulation of skyrmions in centrosymmetric two-dimensional magnetic systems, offering significant insights for developing topological spintronics.</description>
