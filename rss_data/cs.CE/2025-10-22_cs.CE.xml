      <title>Regional heterogeneity in left atrial stiffness impacts passive deformation in a cohort of patient-specific models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deformation of the left atrium (LA), or its biomechanical function, is closely linked to the health of this cardiac chamber. In atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial biomechanics are significantly altered but the underlying cause of this change is not always clear. Patient-specific models of the LA that replicate patient atrial motion can allow us to understand how factors such as atrial anatomy, myocardial stiffness and physiological constraints are linked to atrial biomechanics. We created patient-specific LA models from CT images. We fitted regional model stiffness to peak CT-derived deformation during the LA reservoir phase ($\pm0.90$ mm) and used the CT deformation transients through the reservoir and conduit phase for model validation (deformation transients fell within $\pm0.38$ mm per unit time of targets). We found that myocardial stiffness varies regionally across the LA. The regional stiffness values were significant factors contributing to regional physiological LA deformation ($p=0.023$) while features of LA anatomy, including regional wall thickness and adipose volume, were less important. These findings provide insight into the underlying causes of altered LA biomechanics in AF.</description>

      <title>RAISE: A Unified Framework for Responsible AI Scoring and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI systems enter high-stakes domains, evaluation must extend beyond predictive accuracy to include explainability, fairness, robustness, and sustainability. We introduce RAISE (Responsible AI Scoring and Evaluation), a unified framework that quantifies model performance across these four dimensions and aggregates them into a single, holistic Responsibility Score. We evaluated three deep learning models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Tabular ResNet, and a Feature Tokenizer Transformer, on structured datasets from finance, healthcare, and socioeconomics. Our findings reveal critical trade-offs: the MLP demonstrated strong sustainability and robustness, the Transformer excelled in explainability and fairness at a very high environmental cost, and the Tabular ResNet offered a balanced profile. These results underscore that no single model dominates across all responsibility criteria, highlighting the necessity of multi-dimensional evaluation for responsible model selection. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/raise-framework/raise.</description>

      <title>Competitive algorithms for calculating the ground state properties of Bose-Fermi mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we define, analyze, and compare different numerical schemes that can be used to study the ground state properties of Bose-Fermi systems, such as mixtures of different atomic species under external forces or self-bound quantum droplets. The bosonic atoms are assumed to be condensed and are described by the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The fermionic atoms, on the other hand, are treated individually, and each atom is associated with a wave function whose evolution follows the Hartree-Fock equation. We solve such a formulated set of equations using a variety of methods, including those based on adiabatic switching of interactions and the imaginary time propagation technique combined with the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization or the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix. We show how different algorithms compete at the numerical level by studying the mixture in the range of parameters covering the formation of self-bound quantum Bose-Fermi droplets.</description>

      <title>Local-Global Associative Frames for Symmetry-Preserving Crystal Structure Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal structures are defined by the periodic arrangement of atoms in 3D space, inherently making them equivariant to SO(3) group. A fundamental requirement for crystal property prediction is that the model's output should remain invariant to arbitrary rotational transformations of the input structure. One promising strategy to achieve this invariance is to align the given crystal structure into a canonical orientation with appropriately computed rotations, or called frames. However, existing work either only considers a global frame or solely relies on more advanced local frames based on atoms' local structure. A global frame is too coarse to capture the local structure heterogeneity of the crystal, while local frames may inadvertently disrupt crystal symmetry, limiting their expressivity. In this work, we revisit the frame design problem for crystalline materials and propose a novel approach to construct expressive Symmetry-Preserving Frames, dubbed as SPFrame, for modeling crystal structures. Specifically, this local-global associative frame constructs invariant local frames rather than equivariant ones, thereby preserving the symmetry of the crystal. In parallel, it integrates global structural information to construct an equivariant global frame to enforce SO(3) invariance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SPFrame consistently outperforms traditional frame construction techniques and existing crystal property prediction baselines across multiple benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>A surrogate model for topology optimisation of elastic structures via parametric autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A surrogate-based topology optimisation algorithm for linear elastic structures under parametric loads and boundary conditions is proposed. Instead of learning the parametric solution of the state (and adjoint) problems or the optimisation trajectory as a function of the iterations, the proposed approach devises a surrogate version of the entire optimisation pipeline. First, the method predicts a quasi-optimal topology for a given problem configuration as a surrogate model of high-fidelity topologies optimised with the homogenisation method. This is achieved by means of a feed-forward net learning the mapping between the input parameters characterising the system setup and a latent space determined by encoder/decoder blocks reducing the dimensionality of the parametric topology optimisation problem and reconstructing a high-dimensional representation of the topology. Then, the predicted topology is used as an educated initial guess for a computationally efficient algorithm penalising the intermediate values of the design variable, while enforcing the governing equations of the system. This step allows the method to correct potential errors introduced by the surrogate model, eliminate artifacts, and refine the design in order to produce topologies consistent with the underlying physics. Different architectures are proposed and the approximation and generalisation capabilities of the resulting models are numerically evaluated. The quasi-optimal topologies allow to outperform the high-fidelity optimiser by reducing the average number of optimisation iterations by $53\%$ while achieving discrepancies below $4\%$ in the optimal value of the objective functional, even in the challenging scenario of testing the model to extrapolate beyond the training and validation domain.</description>
