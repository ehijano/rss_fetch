      <title>Accuracy and Efficiency Benchmarks of Pretrained Machine Learning Potentials for Molecular Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of pretrained Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) that cover a wide range of molecular species has made it challenging to select the best model for a given application. We benchmark 15 pretrained MLIPs, evaluating each one on accuracy, speed, memory use, and ability to produce stable simulations. This provides an objective basis for practitioners to select the most appropriate MLIP for their own simulations, and offers insight into which factors most strongly influence model accuracy. We find that the number of model parameters and the size of the training set are both strongly correlated with accuracy, while training on charged molecules and including explicit Coulomb energy terms are less essential than one might expect. Speed and memory use are determined as much by the model architecture as by the size of the model.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Training Domain: Robust Generative Transition State Models for Unseen Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition states (TSs) govern the rates and outcomes of chemical reactions, making their accurate prediction a central challenge in computational chemistry. Although recent machine-learning models achieve near chemical accuracy in the prediction of TS structures and the associated reaction barriers for small organic reactions, their ability to generalize beyond the training domain remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce targeted benchmarks to probe chemical and structural novelty in generative TS prediction. Building on Transition1x, a large-scale dataset of reactions involving small organic molecules, we construct curated extensions incorporating controlled elemental substitutions and diverse transition-metal complexes (TMC). These benchmarks reveal fundamental limitations of generative models in the generalization to previously unseen elements. As a result, they produce unphysical geometries and large energetic errors, even for reactions structurally similar to well-predicted organic systems. To address this challenge, we introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on equilibrium conformers that exposes generative TS models to novel chemical environments prior to targeted fine-tuning. Across the newly proposed benchmarks, self-supervised pretraining substantially improves TS prediction for previously unseen systems, lowering the median RMSD of TS geometries on T1x-TMC reactions from 0.39 to 0.19 $\mathring{A}$ and reducing fine-tuning data requirements by up to 75%, enabling reliable performance even in low-data regimes. Overall, the integration of generative TS models with self-supervised pseudo-reaction pretraining provides an efficient, scalable, and chemically robust framework for elucidating TSs well beyond the small organic molecule domain, establishing a foundation for investigating complex and catalytically relevant reaction landscapes.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Geometry for Spin-Adapted Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and numerically analyze an algebraic-geometric framework for spin-adapted coupled-cluster (CC) theory. Since the electronic Hamiltonian is SU(2)-invariant, physically relevant quantum states lie in the spin singlet sector. We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Geometric Quantum Dynamics in the Tensor Network Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometrical molecular dynamics provides a quantum geometric picture for understanding reactive dynamics, especially excited-state conical intersection dynamics, and also a numerically exact method for strongly correlated electron-nuclear dynamics. However, there are substantial challenges in describing medium-sized molecules with tens of nuclear degrees of freedom. The main challenge is that it uses a discrete variable representation to discretize the molecular configuration space, and thus requires a tremendous number of quantum chemistry calculations to construct the electronic overlap matrix. Moreover, the expansion coefficients scale exponentially with molecular size for direct-product basis sets. We address these challenges by first introducing a coarse-grained local diabatic ansatz, followed by a tensor network representation of the expansion coefficients and the molecular time-evolution operator. With a full 24-dimensional demonstration using the pyrazine molecule, we show that such developments provide a highly accurate and computationally tractable method for high-dimensional, fully quantum, strongly coupled electron-nuclear dynamics from first principles.</description>

      <title>Simulating Electron Dynamics with GPU-Accelerated Real-Time Tamm-Dancoff Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent electronic structure methods provide an efficient, accurate, and robust alternative to traditional time dependent methods for computing both linear and non-linear optical properties. With this in mind, we have developed the real-time Tamm-Dancoff approximation (RT-TDA). This is an approach to model electron dynamics by propagating the linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) amplitudes within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) and adiabatic approximation. Because the electronic structure is propagated in real-time in a many-electron basis, RT-TDA overcomes known limitations of adiabatic Kohn-Sham RT-TDDFT for describing dynamics in intense fields. Acceleration by graphic processing units (GPUs) enables simulations of larger molecules and on longer timescales. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present the calculations of the linear absorption spectrum of a large organic molecule (120 heavy atoms), of Rabi oscillations, and of nonlinear 2-photon absorption, in which we observe the AC Stark effect.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Many Body Quantum Embedding and Local Correlation in Crystalline Materials using Interpolative Separable Density Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient implementation of ab initio many-body quantum embedding and local correlation methods for infinite periodic systems through translational symmetry adapted interpolative separable density fitting, an approach which reduces the scaling of the calculations to only linear with the number of k-points. Employing this methodology, we compute correlated ground-state coupled cluster energies within density matrix embedding and local natural orbital correlation frameworks for both weakly and strongly correlated solids, using up to 1000 k-points. By extrapolating the local correlation domains and k-point sampling we further obtain estimates of the full coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples ground-state energies in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>FlashMD: long-stride, universal prediction of molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) provides insights into atomic-scale processes by integrating over time the equations that describe the motion of atoms under the action of interatomic forces. Machine learning models have substantially accelerated MD by providing inexpensive predictions of the forces, but they remain constrained to minuscule time integration steps, which are required by the fast time scale of atomic motion. In this work, we propose FlashMD, a method to predict the evolution of positions and momenta over strides that are between one and two orders of magnitude longer than typical MD time steps. We incorporate considerations on the mathematical and physical properties of Hamiltonian dynamics in the architecture, generalize the approach to allow the simulation of any thermodynamic ensemble, and carefully assess the possible failure modes of such a long-stride MD approach. We validate FlashMD's accuracy in reproducing equilibrium and time-dependent properties, using both system-specific and general-purpose models, extending the ability of MD simulation to reach the long time scales needed to model microscopic processes of high scientific and technological relevance.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation of Noisy Force Labels for Improved Coarse-Grained Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an integral tool for studying the atomistic behavior of materials under diverse conditions. However, they can be computationally demanding in wall-clock time, especially for large systems, which limits the time and length scales accessible. Coarse-grained (CG) models reduce computational expense by grouping atoms into simplified representations commonly called beads, but sacrifice atomic detail and introduce mapping noise, complicating the training of machine-learned surrogates. Moreover, because CG models inherently include entropic contributions, they cannot be fit directly to all-atom energies, leaving instantaneous, noisy forces as the only state-specific quantities available for training. Here, we apply a knowledge distillation framework by first training an initial CG neural network potential (the teacher) solely on AA-to-CG mapped forces to denoise those labels, then distill its force and energy predictions to train refined CG models (the student) in both single- and ensemble-training setups while exploring different force and energy target combinations. We validate this framework on a complex molecular fluid, a deep eutectic solvent, by evaluating two-, three-, and many-body properties and compare the CG and all-atom results. Our findings demonstrate that training a student model on ensemble teacher-predicted forces and per-bead energies improves the quality and stability of CG force fields.</description>

      <title>Phase Space Electronic Structure Theory: From Diatomic Lambda-Doubling to Macroscopic Einstein-de Haas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\Lambda$-doubling of diatomic molecules is a subtle microscopic phenomenon that has long attracted the attention of experimental groups, insofar as rotation of molecular $\textit{nuclei}$ induces small energetic changes in the (degenerate) $\textit{electronic}$ state. A direct description of such a phenomenon clearly requires going beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here we show that a phase space theory previously developed to capture electronic momentum and model vibrational circular dichroism -- and which we have postulated should also describe the Einstein-de Haas effect, a macroscopic manifestation of angular momentum conservation -- is also able to recover the $\Lambda$-doubling energy splitting (or $\Lambda$-splitting) of the NO molecule nearly quantitatively. The key observation is that, by parameterizing the electronic Hamiltonian in terms of both nuclear position ($\mathbf{X}$) and nuclear momentum ($\mathbf{P}$), a phase space method yields potential energy surfaces that explicitly include the electron-rotation coupling and correctly conserve angular momentum (which we show is essential to capture $\Lambda-$doubling). The data presented in this manuscript offers another small glimpse into the rich physics that one can learn from investigating phase space potential energy surfaces $E_{PS}(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{P})$ as a function of both nuclear position and momentum, all at a computational cost comparable to standard Born-Oppenheimer electronic structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Electron Transfer, Diabatic Couplings and Vibronic Energy Gaps in a Phase Space Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the well-known Shin-Metiu model for an electronic crossing, using both a standard Born-Huang (BH) framework and a novel phase space (PS) electronic Hamiltonian framework. We show that as long as we are not in the strongly nonadiabatic region, a phase space framework can obtain a relative error in vibrational energy gap which is consistently one order of magnitude smaller than what is found within a BH framework. In line with recent results showing that dynamics on one phase space surface can outperform dynamics on one Born-Oppenheimer surface, our results indicate that the same advantages should largely hold for curve crossings and dynamics on two or a handful of electronic surfaces, from which several implications can be surmised as far as the possibility of spin-dependent electron transfer dynamics.</description>

      <title>Efficient algorithms for quantum chemistry on modular quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry is a promising application of future quantum computers, but the requirements on qubit count and other resources suggest that modular computing architectures will be required. We introduce an implementation of a quantum chemistry algorithm that is distributed across several computational modules: the distributed unitary selective coupled cluster (dUSCC). We design a packing scheme using the pseudo-commutativity of Trotterization to maximize the parallelism while optimizing the scheduling of all inter-module gates around the buffering of inter-module Bell pairs. We demonstrate dUSCC on a 3-cluster (H$_4$)$_3$ chain and show that it naturally utilizes the molecule's structure to reduce inter-module latency. We show that the run time of dUSCC is unchanged with inter-module latency up to $\sim$20$\times$ slower than intra-module gates in the (H$_4$)$_3$ while maintaining chemical accuracy. dUSCC should be "free" in the weakly entangled systems, and the existence of "free" dUSCC can be found efficiently using classical algorithms. This new compilation scheme both leverages pseudo-commutativity and considers inter-module gate scheduling, and potentially provides an efficient distributed compilation of other Trotterized algorithms.</description>
