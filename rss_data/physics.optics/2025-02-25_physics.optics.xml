      <title>Faster calculations of optical trapping using neural networks trained by T-matrix data: an application to micro and nanoplastics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ neural networks to improve and speed up optical force calculations for dielectric particles. The network is first trained on a limited set of data obtained through accurate light scattering calculations, based on the Transition matrix method, and then used to explore a wider range of particle dimensions, refractive indices, and excitation wavelengths. This computational approach is very general and flexible. Here, we focus on its application in the context of micro and nanoplastics, a topic of growing interest in the last decade due to their widespread presence in the environment and potential impact on human health and the ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Gain-Assisted Optomechanical Position Locking of Metal/Dielectric Nanoshells in Optical Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate gain-assisted optical forces on dye-enriched silver nanoshell in the quasi-static limit by means of a theoretical/numerical approach. We demonstrate the onset of nonlinear optical trapping of these resonant nanostructures in a counterpropagating Gaussian beam configuration. We study the optical forces and trapping behaviour as a function of wavelength, particle gain level, and laser power. We support the theoretical analysis with Brownian dynamics simulations that show how particle position locking is achieved at high gains in extended optical trapping potentials. Finally, for wavelengths blue-detuned with respect to the plasmon-enhanced resonance,we observe particle channeling by the standing wave antinodes due to gradient force reversal. This work opens perspectives for gain-assisted optomechanics where nonlinear optical forces are finely tuned to efficiently trap, manipulate, channel, and deliver externally controlled nanophotonic system.</description>

      <title>An experimental technique for measuring radial coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherence refers to correlations between field vibrations at two separate points in degrees of freedom such as space, time, and polarisation. In the context of space, coherence theory has been formulated between two transverse positions which can be described either in the cartesian coordinates or in the cylindrical coordinates. When expressed in cylindrical coordinates, spatial coherence is described in terms of azimuthal and radial coordinates. The description of spatial coherence in radial degree of freedom has been formulated only recently in JOSA A 40, 411 (2023). In the present article, we demonstrate an efficient experimental technique for measuring radial coherence, and we report measurement of radial coherence of two different types of radially partially coherent optical fields.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion Generation through the Chirality Interplay of Light and Magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light beams, with their rich degrees of freedom, including polarization and phase, along with their flexible tunability, have emerged as an ideal tool for generating magnetic topological textures.However, how to precisely control the light beams to generate a specific number of magnetic topological textures on demand remains a critical scientific issue that needs to be resolved. Based on the numerical simulation of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we propose that circularly polarized Laguerre-Gaussian beams can induce chiral magnetic fields through the interaction of the chirality of these beams'angular momenta. By utilizing these chiral magnetic fields, skyrmions or skyrmionium can be induced in chiral magnets. Moreover, the vectorial magnetic fields can be manipulated by adjusting the angular momenta and light intensity, thereby generating target chiral patterns and strengths, which allows for precise control over the type and number of these topological magnetic textures. This finding not only reveals the underlying physical mechanisms of the interaction between light and magnetic systems but also provides a feasible solution for the on-demand generation and encoding of skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Theory of Plasmon-Induced Hot-carriers in Al Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot electrons generated from the decay of localized surface plasmon (LSP) in metallic nanostructures have significant potential for applications in photocatalysis, photodetection, and other optoelectronic devices. Aluminum nanoparticles are promising for hot-carrier devices since aluminum is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust. However, a comprehensive understanding of hot-carrier generation in practical nanoparticles is still missing. In this study, we present theoretical predictions of hot-carrier generation rates in spherical aluminum nanoparticles with up to 315,75 atoms in different dielectric environments. These predictions are obtained from an approach, which combines a solution of Maxwell equation with large-scale atomistic tight-binding models. By changing the environmental dielectric constants, the LSP frequency can be adjusted over a wide range from deep ultraviolet at 9 eV to the visible spectrum at 2-2.75 eV. Meanwhile, by varying the sizes of nanoparticles, we observed that as the nanoparticle size increases to 10 nm, discrete hot-carrier energy level transitions converge to the continuous energy transitions of bulk metals, and no intraband transitions are observed, unlike in noble metal nanoparticles such as gold and silver.</description>

      <title>Multimode fiber based high-dimensional light analyzer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wavelength and state of polarization (SOP) are fundamental properties of an optical field which are essential for applications in optical communications, imaging and other fields. However, it is challenging for existing spectrometers and polarimeters to measure these parameters simultaneously, resulting in reduced spatial and temporal efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose and demonstrate a compact multimode fiber (MMF)-based high-dimensional light analyzer capable of simultaneously performing high-precision measurements of both wavelength and SOP. Core-offset launching is introduced in the MMF to reshuffle the mode coupling. A neural network named WP-Net has been designed dedicated to wavelength and SOP synchronization measurements. Physics-informed loss function based on optical prior knowledge is used to optimize the learning process. These advancements have enhanced the sensitivity, achieving a wavelength resolution of 0.045 pm and an SOP resolution of 0.0088.</description>

      <title>Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Sensing Within Functionalized Additively Manufactured Microporous Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond has emerged as a powerful tool for measuring diverse physical parameters, yet the versatility of these measurement approaches is often limited by the achievable layout and dimensionality of bulk-crystal platforms. Here, we demonstrate a versatile approach to creating designer quantum sensors by surface-functionalizing multiphoton lithography microstructures with NV-containing nanodiamonds. We showcase this capability by fabricating a 150 $\mu$m x 150 $\mu$m x 150 $\mu$m triply periodic minimal surface gyroid structure with millions of attached nanodiamonds. We demonstrate a means to volumetrically image these structures using a refractive index matching confocal imaging technique, and extract ODMR spectra from 1.86 $\mu$m x 1.86 $\mu$m areas of highly concentrated nanodiamonds across a cross section of the gyroid. Furthermore, the high density of sensing elements enables ensemble temperature measurements with sensitivity of 0.548 {\deg}K/$\sqrt{Hz}$ at 5 mW excitation power. This approach to creating quantum-enabled microarchitectures opens new possibilities for multimodal sensing in complex three-dimensional environments.</description>

      <title>Room temperature mass sensing based on nonlinear optomechanical dynamics: membrane-in-the-middle versus suspended membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to weigh something as precise as possible is a constant endeavor for human being, and mass sensing has been essential to scientific research and many other aspects of modern society. In this work, we explore a special approach to mass sensing, which is purely based on the classical nonlinear dynamics of cavity optomechanical systems. We consider two types of systems, the mechanical resonator as a suspended membrane inside optical cavity or as a larger movable membrane that separates the optical cavity into two parts. Under a driving laser field with two tones satisfying a specific frequency condition, both systems enter a special dynamical pattern correlating the mechanical oscillation and the sidebands of oscillatory cavity field. After adding the nano-particle, which has its mass \delta m to be measured, to the mechanical membrane as the detector, the cavity field sidebands will exhibit detectable changes, so that the tiny mass \delta m can be deduced from the measured sideband intensities. For the latter system with a membrane in the middle, one can apply an additional single-tone laser field to magnify the modified sidebands much further, achieving an ultra-high sensitivity (\delta m/m) \sim 10^{-11} ($m$ is the mass of the membrane), even given a moderate mechanical quality factor. The operation range of the sensors is very wide, covering 7 or 8 orders of magnitudes. Moreover, a particular advantage of this type of mass sensors comes from the robustness of the realized dynamical pattern against thermal noise, and it enables such mass sensors to work well at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound-Coupled Microdroplet Laser Chip for High-Throughput Hyperlipidemia Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of biological fluids can serve as early indicators of disease, offering valuable insights into complex physiological and pathological processes. However, the existing technologies can hardly support high throughput measurement, which hinders their broad applications in disease diagnosis. Here, we propose the ultrasound-coupled microdroplet laser chips to enable high-throughput measurement of the intrinsic mechanical properties of fluids. The microdroplets supporting high-Q (10^4) whispering gallery modes (WGM) lasing were massively fabricated on a hydrophobic surface with inject printing. The ultrasound was used to actuate the mechanical vibration of the microdroplets. We found that the stimulus-response of the laser emission is strongly dependent on the intrinsic mechanical properties of the liquid, which as subsequently employed to quantify the viscosity. The ultrasound-coupled microdroplet laser chips were used to monitor molecular interactions of bovine serum albumin. High-throughput screening of hyperlipidemia disease was also demonstrated by performing over 2,000 measurements using fast laser scanning. Thanks to the small volume of the microdroplets, a single drop of blood can support over eight billion measurements. The high-throughput ability and small sample consumption of the microlaser chip make it a promising tool for clinical diagnoses based on mechanical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-resolution Structured Illumination Microscopy (SR-SIM) enables fluorescence microscopy beyond the diffraction limit at high frame rates. Compared to other super-resolution microscopy techniques, the low photon fluence used in SR-SIM makes it readily compatible with live-cell imaging. Here, we combine SR-SIM with electro-optic fluorescence lifetime imaging (EOFLIM), adding the capability of monitoring physicochemical parameters with 156 nm spatial resolution at high frame rate for live-cell imaging. We demonstrate that our new SIMFLIM technique enables super-resolved multiplexed imaging of spectrally overlapping fluorophores, environmental sensing, and live-cell imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal emission is naturally spatially incoherent and lacks directionality. Here, we demonstrate that by precisely controlling the spatial temperature distribution within a solid, directional thermal emission can be achieved across a broad spectral range. These anisothermal sources open new avenues for manipulating radiative heat flux at the microscale and hold promise for applications in thermal management and energy conversion, enabling more efficient and targeted thermal control.</description>

Abstract: Technological advancements in generation of ultrafast and intense laser pulses have enabled the real-time observation and control of charge migration in molecules on their natural timescale, which ranges from few femtoseconds to several hundreds of attoseconds. Present thesis discusses the effect of symmetry on the adiabatic attosecond charge migration in different molecular systems. The spatial representation of the charge migration is documented by time-dependent electronic charge and flux densities. Furthermore, the induced charge migration is imaged via time resolved x-ray diffraction (TRXD) with atomic-scale spatiotemporal resolution in few cases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between free electrons and laser-induced near-fields provides a platform to study ultrafast processes and quantum phenomena while enabling precise manipulation of electron wavefunctions through linear and orbital momentum transfer. Here, by introducing phase offset between two orthogonally polarized laser pulses exciting a gold nanorod, we generate a rotating plasmonic nearfield dipole with clockwise and counterclockwise circulating orientations and investigate its interaction with a slow electron beam. Our findings reveal that the circulation direction of plasmonic fields plays a crucial role in modulating electron dynamics, enhancing coupling strength, and controlling recoil. Furthermore, synchronizing the interaction time of the electron beam with rotational dipolar plasmonic resonances results in significant transfer of angular momenta to the electron beams and deflects the electron wavepackets from their original trajectory. These findings highlight the potential of plasmon rotors for shaping electron wavepackets, offering promising applications in ultrafast microscopy, spectroscopy, and quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-domain interferometry is an important principle in Fourier transform (FT) and nonlinear femto- to attosecond spectroscopy. To optimize the resolution and sensitivity of this approach, various interferometer stabilization schemes have been developed. Among them, acousto-optical phase modulation (AOPM) of the interferometer arms combined with phase-synchronous lock-in detection has proven as a particular sensitive technique. However, the acousto-optical modulators (AOMs), required for this technique, introduce several disadvantages. Here, we demonstrate an alternative phase modulation scheme which omits AOMs, termed PM scheme here. As a benchmark, we directly compare the performance between the PM and the AOPM scheme in a linear FT spectroscopy experiment and find almost identical sensitivity in both approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quintessential hallmark distinguishing metasurfaces from traditional optical components is the engineering of subwavelength meta-atoms to manipulate light at will. Enabling this freedom, in a reverse manner, to control objects constituted by metasurfaces could expand our capability of optical manipulation to go beyond the predominant microscopic and sub-microscopic scales. Here, we introduce a driving metaphotonic force fully controllable by meta-atoms to manipulate structured objects named metajets. Upon Newton's law of motion that can apply to classical and relativistic mechanics, we develop a first-principles theory to analyze optical forces generated by refraction and reflection at an interface. We find that three-dimensional motions of metajets would be possible if one could introduce an extra wavevector component. We achieve that by creating a spatially distributed phase gradient with deliberately arranged silicon nanopillars. Our experiments and simulations reveal an in-plane propulsion and, very importantly, out-of-plane levitation of the metajets, aligning well with the theory. We also find that the metaphotonic force augments with increased light power but is not limited by the size of metajets, which could unleash new opportunities for metaphotonic control in large settings, such as interstellar light sails.</description>

      <title>Quadrature squeezing in a nanophotonic microresonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezed states of light are essential for emerging quantum technology in metrology and information processing. Chip-integrated photonics offers a route to scalable and efficient squeezed light generation, however, parasitic nonlinear processes and optical losses remain significant challenges. Here, we demonstrate single-mode quadrature squeezing in a photonic crystal microresonator via degenerate dual-pump spontaneous four-wave mixing. Implemented in a scalable, low-loss silicon-nitride photonic-chip platform, the microresonator features a tailored nano-corrugation that modifies its resonances to suppress parasitic nonlinear processes. In this way, we achieve an estimated 7.8 dB of on-chip squeezing in the bus waveguide, with potential for further improvement. These results open a promising pathway toward integrated squeezed light sources for quantum-enhanced interferometry, Gaussian boson sampling, coherent Ising machines, and universal quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: The crucial field of Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) aims to transform chemical structure photographs into machine-readable formats so that chemical databases may be efficiently stored and queried. Although a number of OCSR technologies have been created, little is known about how well they work in different picture deterioration scenarios. In this work, a new dataset of chemically structured images that have been systematically harmed graphically by compression, noise, distortion, and black overlays is presented. On these subsets, publicly accessible OCSR tools were thoroughly tested to determine how resilient they were to unfavorable circumstances. The outcomes show notable performance variation, underscoring each tool's advantages and disadvantages. Interestingly, MolScribe performed best under heavy compression (55.8% at 99%) and had the highest identification rate on undamaged photos (94.6%). MolVec performed exceptionally well against noise and black overlay (86.8% at 40%), although it declined under extreme distortion (&lt;70%). With recognition rates below 30%, Decimer demonstrated strong sensitivity to noise and black overlay, but Imago had the lowest baseline accuracy (73.6%). The creative assessment of this study offers important new information about how well the OCSR tool performs when images deteriorate, as well as useful standards for tool development in the future.</description>

      <title>Valley resolved dynamics of phonon bottleneck in semiconductor molybdenum ditelluride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor molybdenum ditelluride (2H-MoTe2) possess multiple valleys in the band structure, enriching its physical properties and potentials in applications. The understanding of its multivalley nature of fundamental processes involving population and relaxation of carriers and phonons is still evolving; particularly, the possible phonon bottleneck has not yet been addressed. Here, we investigate the carrier intra- and intervalley scattering and the phonon dynamics in different valleys in photoexcited few-layer 2H-MoTe2, by using the time resolved measurements of optical absorption and electron diffraction, together with the density functional theory calculation and molecular dynamics simulation. The pathways and timescales of carrier relaxation, accompanied with the emissions of optical phonons at the Brillouin zone center and acoustic phonons at the zone border are revealed. We present a couple of approaches to estimate the population of different phonon modes based on the results of optical and electron diffraction measurements, hence quantitatively identify the occurrences of phonon bottleneck located in different valleys. Our findings make possible to construct a comprehensive picture of the complex interactions between carriers and phonons in 2H-MoTe2 with the valley degree of freedom resolved.</description>

      <title>Chip-integrated single-mode coherent-squeezed light source using four-wave mixing in microresonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezed light constitutes a key resource for quantum optical technologies including quantum sensing, computing, communication and metrology. For many applications, however, the generation of squeezed light typically requires at least two nonlinear optical stages involving careful phase and frequency matching to achieve the required mixing of squeezed and coherent light. In our work, we introduce an on-chip system that simplifies the generation of coherent-squeezed light, utilizing only a single squeezing stage. We achieved this by pumping a silicon nitride ($\mathrm{Si_3N_4}$) microring resonator to produce single-mode squeezed light through four-wave mixing at the same frequency as the pump mode, leveraging the inherent $\chi^{(3)}$-nonlinearity of the $\mathrm{Si_3N_4}$ resonator. Our on-chip system demonstrates a squeezing of -4.7 dB, and we provide a theoretical model that describes the straightforward yet robust generation of single-mode squeezing at the injection locking point of the ring resonator. Overall, our findings highlight an approach which drastically simplifies the generation of squeezed light in photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Polarization of photoluminescence by optically driven orbital reconstruction in magnetically ordered CrCl3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that photoluminescence from CrCl3 bulk crystal exhibits a preferential polarization direction when films are magnetically ordered or strained. We verify the magnetization as responsible for the polarization by measuring the signal as a function of the temperature in Voigt configuration while applying the in-plane magnetic field. We show that phonon coupling contributing to vibronic transitions depolarizes the signal compared with zero phonon lines. We explain the data using DFT calculations, which reveal a magnetization-selective occupation of the low energy d-orbital triplet state of Cr3+ upon photon absorption. In addition, the calculations find that the excitation of one electron results in the excited state acquiring out-of-plane components of spin and very large orbital magnetic moments, in addition to a lattice deformation.</description>

      <title>Ultrashort 30-fs laser photoablation for high-precision and damage-free diamond machining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A 30-fs, 800 nm, 1 kHz femtosecond was used to photoablate diamond across radiant energy doses of 1 - 500 kJ/cm^2, with fluences of 10 - 50 J/cm^2 and, pulse counts from 100 to 10,000. The objective was to maximise material removal while minimising surface roughness (Ra) by operating above the photoablation threshold. Results demonstrate that 30-fs laser photoablation achieves Ra &lt;0.1 \mum, meeting both high- and ultra-high-precision machining standards, while maintaining surface integrity and preventing heat-affected zone (HAZ) damage. At 1 kJ/cm^2 (10 J/cm^2 fluence, 100 pulses), an Ra of 0.09 \mum was achieved, satisfying ultra-high precision criteria (Ra &lt;0.1 \mum). Additionally, doses below 10 kJ/cm^2 consistently met high-precision machining requirements (Ra &lt;0.2 \mum). Photoablation efficiency peaked below 50 kJ/cm^2, after which material removal diminished, indicating non-linear process limitations. The sp3-diamond phase remained intact, as confirmed by the unchanged T2g Raman mode at 1332 cm^-1, with no detectable Raman G or D modes, confirming the absence of sp2-related graphitization, structural disorder, of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centre annealing. These findings establish 30 fs laser processing as a high-precision, damage-free approach for diamond machining, with promising applications in NV centre-containing quantum materials and advanced tooling.</description>

      <title>Infrared spectroscopy of astrophysical ice analogs at oblique angles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In astrochemical exploration, infrared (IR) spectroscopy is vital for understanding the composition and structure of ice in various space environments. This article explores the impact of incident angles on IR spectroscopy, focusing on molecular components present in interstellar and circumstellar ice mantles such as CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O, CH$_3$OH, NH$_3$, CH$_4$, H$_2$S. The experiment involves changing the angle at which the infrared beam hits the surface used for ice deposition. It is important to measure the density of the ice layer accurately, especially for experiments that involve using different angles in infrared spectroscopy. Furthermore, the experimental methodology allowed us to derive the {\it effective} refraction index values in the infrared range for each ice component. Existing corrections typically consider geometric configurations but overlook the refractive index of the ice ($n$), a factor dependent on ice composition. The study reveals that the incident angle and the refractive index, determine the pathlength of the IR beam across the ice sample. This insight challenges conventional corrections, impacting the integrated absorption values of the IR bands and column densities. In addition, for certain ice components, variations in the incidence angle affect the longitudinal (LO) and transverse (TO) optical modes of the ice, leading to observable changes in the IR band profiles that provide information on the amorphous or crystalline structure of the ice. The practical implications of this work apply to experimental setups where normal IR measurements are unfeasible. Researchers using, for example, the standard 45$^{\circ}$ angle for IR spectroscopy, will benefit from a more accurate estimation of ice column density.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Performance Evaluation of Cs2CuBiCl6 Double Perovskite Solar Cell for Lead-Free Photovoltaic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the previous decade, there has been a significant advancement in the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), characterized by a notable increase in efficiency from 3.8% to 25%. Nonetheless, PSCs face many problems when we commercialize them because of their toxicity and stability. Consequently, lead-PSCs need an alternative solar cell with high performance and low processing cost; lead-free inorganic perovskites have been explored. Recent research showcased Cs2CuBiCl6, a lead-free inorganic double perovskite material with remarkable photoelectric characteristics and exceptional environmental robustness. To investigate the potential of Cs2CuBiCl6 material, the solar cell structure FTO/ETL/Cs2CuBiCl6/HTL/Au was used and analyzed through a solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS-1D). CeO2 is used as the Electron transport layer (ETL), and CuI is the Hole transport layer (HTL). Furthermore, the research examined the optimization of different parameters of the absorber layer (AL), such as thickness, defect density, electron affinity, band gap, and operational temperature. In the end, it has been noticed that by setting the temperature at 300 K and an electron affinity of 4.3 eV of the absorber layer, the PSCs achieve the highest efficiency of 24.51 %, FF of 43.01 %, Voc of 1.73V, and Jsc of 32.82mA/cm2. This is the highest Cs2CuBiCl6 double PSCs efficiency we've reached yet. In theoretical studies, 17.03% of PCE was achieved using Cs2CuBiCl6 as an active layer. The analysis underscores the significant potential of Cs2CuBiCl6 as an absorbing layer in developing highly efficient lead-free all-inorganic PSCs.</description>

      <title>High second harmonic generation in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals by doping with optimally oriented chromophores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the second harmonic generation performance of a ferroelectric nematic fluid consisting of the prototype ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal, RM734 mixed with the classical chromophore Dispersed-Orange 3 at 5 %wt. The mixture exhibits an interesting mesomorphic behavior with a wide temperature range of the ferroelectric mesophase, high nematic order parameter and ease of alignment in cells. In the study, two fundamental wavelengths (1064 nm and 1574 nm) have been used in order to account for the second harmonic generation performance in transparent and absorbing regimens. The results have been very outstanding and are among the highest for liquid crystals so far. Specifically, second order susceptibility tensor components of up to 25 pmV-1 and 8.5 pmV-1 have been obtained in the absorbing and transparent regimens, respectively. The mixing of chromophores with ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals is then stablished as a promising strategy in the search of high-performance nonlinear-optical mesogens.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) polariton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We confirm the existence of the spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) polariton and the value of its tOAM, verifying our theory of transverse orbital angular momentum in a simple dispersive medium [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)]. We also develop a physical picture of the polariton as a structure driven by torques induced by the ponderomotive force of the light in the presence of material dispersion. This is a new type of spatiotemporal torque unanticipated in our recent work [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. X 14, 011031 (2024)]. These results are accomplished by high resolution particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of STOV pulse reflection from and transmission through a fully ionized hydrogen plasma slab. The linear theory matches the PIC simulations up to near-critical plasma densities and near-relativistic field strengths. For higher intensities, optical tOAM becomes invested in collective modes of the plasma.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new concept to generate efficient one-third harmonic light from an unseeded third harmonic process in optical fibers. Our concept is based on the dynamic constant (Hamiltonian) of the nonlinear third harmonic generation in optical fibers and includes a periodic array of nonlinear fibers and phase compensation elements. We test our concept with a simulation of the nonlinear interaction between the fundamental and third harmonic modes of a realistic optical fiber, demonstrating high-efficiency one-third harmonic generation. Our work opens a new approach to achieving the so far elusive one-third harmonic generation in optical fibers.</description>

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave,&gt;30 GHz) radars are the key enabler in the coming 6G era for high-resolution sensing and detection of targets. Photonic radar provides an effective approach to overcome the limitations of electronic radars thanks to the high frequency, broad bandwidth, and excellent reconfigurability of photonic systems. However, conventional photonic radars are mostly realized in tabletop systems composed of bulky discrete components, whereas the more compact integrated photonic radars are difficult to reach the mmWave bands due to the unsatisfactory bandwidths and signal integrity of the underlining electro-optic modulators. Here, we overcome these challenges and demonstrate a centimeter-resolution integrated photonic radar operating in the mmWave V band (40-50 GHz) based on a 4-inch wafer-scale thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) technology. The fabricated TFLN mmWave photonic integrated circuit consists of a first electro-optic modulator capable of generating a broadband linear frequency modulated mmWave radar waveform through optical frequency multiplication of a low-frequency input signal, and a second electro-optic modulator responsible for frequency de-chirp of the received reflected echo wave, therefore greatly relieving the bandwidth requirements for the analog-to-digital converter in the receiver. Thanks to the absence of optical and electrical filters in the system, our integrated photonic mmWave radar features continuous on-demand tunability of the center frequency and bandwidth, currently only limited by the bandwidths of electrical amplifiers. We achieve multi-target ranging with a resolution of 1.50 cm and velocity measurement with a resolution of 0.067 m/s. Furthermore, we construct an inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) and successfully demonstrate the imaging of targets with various shapes and postures with a two-dimensional resolution of 1.50 cm * 1.06 cm.</description>

      <title>Ray Theory of Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of three-dimensional (3D) fields in wave interactions with large, complex-shaped objects is essential for applications in electromagnetic computation, computer graphics, optical metrology, and freeform optics. However, existing methods face significant challenges: numerical techniques are computationally intensive and impractical for large objects, while ray tracing neglects wave properties and remains inefficient, relying solely on ray bundles. In this Letter, we present the Ray Theory of Waves (RTW), which introduces wavefront curvature (WFC) as an intrinsic property of a ray to describe wave divergence and convergence. Using differential geometry, we derive the wavefront equation, rigorously relating WFC of incident, reflected, and refracted waves, enabling accurate calculation of field amplitude and phase along a ray. To address diffraction effects at singularities and compute the total field, we propose an anti-conventional strategy. The flexibility, precision and performance of RTW are demonstrated through the calculation of 3D scattering pattern of an ellipsoidal drop. Importantly, the method clarifies several longstanding queries about Airy theory since the 19th century. RTW constitutes a theoretical breakthrough, opening new avenues for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Topological edge states in all-dielectric square-lattice arrays of bianisotropic microwave resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a bianisotropic response associated with a broken mirror symmetry of a dielectric resonator allows opening a band gap in simple square lattice arrays of such resonators. Realizing the proposed system as an array of high-index ceramic resonators working at GHz frequencies, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the presence of topological edge states at the interface between two domains with opposite orientations of the bianisotropic resonators, as well as at the boundary between a single domain and free space. For both cases, we experimentally characterize the dispersion of edge states, and we examine their propagation along sharp bends, their resilience to various types of geometrical defects, and a spin-momentum-locked unidirectional propagation in the case of circularly polarized excitation. Also, we develop a theoretical model based on a Green's function approach that describes the square lattice of resonators and features quadratic degeneracies in the vicinity of $\Gamma$ and $M$ high-symmetry points that are removed upon the introduction of bianisotropy, and apply this model to evaluate Berry curvature. The considered design opens possibilities in the construction of optical and microwave structures simultaneously featuring topological edge states at the interfaces between distinct resonator domains or a resonator domain and free space.</description>

      <title>HoloTile RGB: Ultra-fast single-shot, discretized, full-color computer-generated phase-only holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the first use of the HoloTile Computer-Generated Holography (CGH) modality on multi-wavelength targets. Taking advantage of the sub-hologram tiling and Point Spread Function (PSF) shaping of HoloTile allows for reconstruction of high-fidelity, pseudo-digital multi-wavelength images, with well-defined discrete output pixels, without the need for temporal averaging. For each wavelength, the target channels are scaled appropriately, using the same output pixel size. We employ a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) hologram generation algorithm for each wavelength, and display them sequentially on a HoloEye GAEA 2.1 Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) in Color Field Sequential (CFS) phase modulation mode. As such, we get full 8-bit phase modulation at 60 Hz for each wavelength. The reconstructions are projected onto a camera sensor where each RGB image is captured in a single shot. While these show impressive color reconstructions, the method can be adapted to any wavelength combination for use in a plethora of multi-wavelength application.</description>

      <title>Optimizing attosecond pulse generation in solids by modulating electronic dynamics with monochromatic laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A practical approach is proposed for efficiently generating ultrashort attosecond pulses (APs) from realistic solid-state materials, aiming to optimize pulse width effectively. By adjusting the photon energy while maintaining a constant peak electric field, this strategy modulates the peak vector potential and laser field period, thereby controlling the high harmonic cutoff energy and the time-domain emission characteristics of the harmonics. The field-driven electronic dynamics lead to a non-monotonic variation in both the intensity and duration of the generated attosecond pulses. The light field frequency can be adjusted to yield the optimal pulse. Beyond the primary demonstration with hexagonal boron nitride as a prototypical material, significant pulse width optimization has been achieved across a range of different materials. This straightforward and versatile strategy shows promise for application in solid-state materials, offering new pathways to promote high harmonic performance.</description>

      <title>Rapid wavefront shaping using an optical gradient acquisition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping systems aim to image deep into scattering tissue by reshaping incoming and outgoing light to correct aberrations caused by tissue inhomogeneity However, the desired modulation depends on the unknown tissue structure and therefore its estimation is a challenging time-consuming task. Most strategies rely on coordinate descent optimization, which sequentially varies each modulation parameter and assesses its impact on the resulting image. We propose a rapid wavefront shaping scheme that transitions from coordinate descent to gradient descent optimization, using the same measurement to update all modulation parameters simultaneously. To achieve this, we have developed an analytical framework that expresses the gradient of the wavefront shaping score with respect to all modulation parameters. Although this gradient depends on the unknown tissue structure, we demonstrate how it can be inferred from the optical system's measurements. Our new framework enables rapid inference of wavefront shaping modulations. Additionally, since the complexity of our algorithm does not scale with the number of modulation parameters, we can achieve very high-resolution modulations, leading to better corrections in thicker tissue layers. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework in correcting aberrations in a coherent confocal microscope.</description>

      <title>Tri-layer SiN-on-Si 8x8 Optical Switches with Thermo-optic and Electro-optic Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two spatial-multiplexed switch-and-select (S&amp;S) 8x8 optical switches incorporating a tri-layer SiN-on-Si platform, one equipped with thermo-optic (T-O) and the other electro-optic (E-O) switching elements. To the best of our knowledge, the electro-optic switch fabric is the first-of-its-kind device assembled in such a multi-layer platform. The shuffle between the multiplexer and demultiplexer array is established via a tri-layer Si-SiN-SiN structure, creating a three-dimensional crossing-free photonic shuffle network. At the same time, the implementation of the S&amp;S topology can effectively suppress the first-order crosstalk. The measured on-chip losses for the T-O switch range from 2.1 to 11.5 dB, with a 5.2 dB average, while the E-O device exhibits losses between 8.7 to 19.6 dB, with a 15.1 dB average. Both switches demonstrate ultra-low crosstalk, with measured ranges of 38.9 to 50.8 dB and 42.8 to 51.9 dB, for the T-O and E-O devices respectively. The switching times are 17.6 us for the T-O switch and 5.9 ns with the E-O actuated one. These performance metrics highlight the potential of these switches for next-generation data center applications.</description>

      <title>Partial Topological Protection in C4 Lattices for Optical Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent studies, analogs of the electronic Quantum Spin-Hall Effect have been explored within photonic crystals that incorporate spatial symmetries, especially those with $ C_{6v} $ symmetry, where $ \mathbb{Z}_2 $ topological invariants are enforced by crystalline symmetry. These photonic crystals possess bulk states with well-defined pseudospins and exhibit helical edge states, closely resembling their electronic counterparts. However, achieving $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological protection in a square lattice photonic crystal remains great theoretical and experimental challange. In this work, we propose a single material photonic crystal structure based on a $ C_4 $ lattice that supports partially $ \mathbb{Z}_2 $-protected edge modes. We show that this structure can host photonic band-gap that hosts $ \mathbb{Z}_2 $-like modes, enabling perfect transmission in waveguide applications. Furthermore, we investigate the robustness of these modes against structural defects and directional turns, highlighting the distinctions between full $ \mathbb{Z}_2 $ topological protection and partial topological protection. Finally, we analyze the impact of the number of elementary cells surrounding the interface on the formation and stability of these protected modes.</description>

      <title>SMILE: an universal tool for modulated-enhanced localization microscopy to achieve minimal three-dimensional resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modulation-enhanced localization microscopy (MELM) has demonstrated significant improvements in both lateral and axial localization precision compared to conventional single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). However, lateral modulated illumination based MELM (MELMxy) remains fundamentally limited to two-dimensional imaging. Here we present three-dimensional Single-Molecule Modulated Illumination Localization Estimator (SMILE) that synergistically integrates lateral illumination modulation with point spread function engineering. By simultaneously exploiting lateral modulation patterns and an accurate point spread function (PSF) model for 3D localization, SMILE achieves near-theoretical-minimum localization uncertainty, demonstrating an average 4-fold enhancement in lateral precision compared to conventional 3D-SMLM. Crucially, SMILE exhibits exceptional compatibility with diverse PSFs and different illumination patterns with various structures including 4Pi configurations, making it a versatile tool that can be easily adapted for different experimental setups. When integrated with 4Pi microscopy, 4Pi-SMILE shows particular promise for achieving sub-10 nm axial resolution and approaching isotropic resolution. From the simulations and proof-of-concept experiments, we verified the superiority of SMILE over 3D-SMLM and ordinary MELM. We highlight SMILE as a novel methodology and robust framework that holds great potential to significantly promote the development of MELM.</description>

      <title>Engineering high Pockels coefficients in thin-film strontium titanate for cryogenic quantum electro-optic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials which exhibit the Pockels effect are notable for their strong electro-optic interaction and rapid response times and are therefore used extensively in classical electro-optic components for data and telecommunication applications. Yet many materials optimized for room-temperature operation see their Pockels coefficients at cryogenic temperatures significantly reduced - a major hurdle for emerging quantum technologies which have even more rigorous demands than their classical counterpart. A noted example is $\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$, which features the strongest effective Pockels coefficient at room temperature, only to see it reduced to a third (i.e. $\mathrm{r_{eff}} \approx$ 170 pm/V) at a few Kelvin. Here, we show that this behaviour is not inherent and can even be reversed: Strontium titanate ($\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$), a material normally not featuring a Pockels coefficient, can be engineered to exhibit an $\mathrm{r_{eff}}$ of 345 pm/V at cryogenic temperatures - a record value in any thin-film electro-optic material. By adjusting the stoichiometry, we can increase the Curie temperature and realise a ferroelectric phase that yields a high Pockels coefficient, yet with limited optical losses - on the order of decibels per centimetre. Our findings position $\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ as one of the most promising materials for cryogenic quantum photonics applications.</description>

Abstract: Mode-locking mechanisms are key resources in nonlinear optical phenomena, such as micro-ring solitonic states, and have transformed metrology, precision spectroscopy, and optical communication. However, despite significant efforts, mode-locking has not been demonstrated in the independently tunable multi-timescale regime. Here, we vastly expand the nonlinear mode-locking toolbox into multi-timescale synchronization on a chip. We use topological photonics to engineer a 2D lattice of hundreds of coupled silicon nitride ring resonators capable of hosting nested mode-locked states with a fast (near 1 THz) single-ring and a slow (near 3 GHz) topological super-ring timescales. We demonstrate signatures of multi-timescale mode-locking including quadratic distribution of the pump noise with the two-time azimuthal mode dimensions, as expected by mode-locking theory. Our observations are further corroborated by direct signatures of the near-transform-limit repetition beats and the formation of the temporal pattern on the slow timescale. Moreover, we show that these exotic properties of edge-confined mode-locked states are in sharp contrast to bulk and single-ring counterparts and establish a clear pathway for their identification. Our unprecedented demonstration of mode-locking in topological combs unlocks the implementation of lattice-scale synchronization and independently tunable multi-timescale mode-locking phenomena, also the exploration of the fundamental nonlinearity-topology interplay on a chip.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) has revolutionized the fabrication of devices with precisely controlled optical, fluidic, mechanical, and filtering properties, offering greater design freedom than conventional manufacturing methods. Tomographic volumetric additive manufacturing (TVAM) has many advantages compared to other AM methods including smooth layer-less surfaces, support-free and shear force-free printing, material versatility, and speed of production which are translatable to the microscale and evident in printed microfluidic devices and micro-optical components. However, as the patterning scale is reduced, the depth of field of the optical projection system shrinks much more rapidly and does so roughly with the square of the patterning scale. Consequently, the build volume is substantially reduced as the numerical aperture of the system is increased. Additionally, microscale tomographic VAM is currently limited to batch production, i.e., the photoresist container must be exchanged after the exposure phase is completed. In this work, we introduce roll-to-roll (R2R) TVAM in which these limitations are addressed by "unwrapping" the precursor material into a film enabling continuous production of microstructures with theoretically unlimited length. We elaborate the design of a focus-multiplexed projection optical system that can scan the projection focal plane axially in sync with the refresh cycle of a digital micromirror device. We describe the process of iteratively optimizing and segmenting sinograms to produce long aperiodic microstructures with the focus-tunable optical system. Furthermore, we formulate a thermally reversible organogel photoresist which is deposited onto the substrate in films several millimeters in thickness. Finally, we demonstrate printing of complex lattice structures with length more than 60 cm and minimum feature size of 200 um with the R2R TVAM system.</description>

Abstract: Nonlocal correlation represents the key feature of quantum mechanics, and is an exploitable resource in quantum information processing. However, the loophole issues and the associated applicability compromises hamper the practical applications. We report the first time-bin entangled detection-loophole-free steering nonlocality demonstration in a fully chip-fiber telecommunication system, with an ultra-fast measurement switching rate (1.25~GHz). In this endeavor, we propose the phase-encoding measurement scheme to adapt the system to time-bin degree of freedom, and design and fabricate a low-loss silicon chip for efficient entanglement generation. An asymmetric configuration is introduced to mimic the active measurement implementation at the steering party thus bypassing the phase modulation loss. Consequently, we build a fiber-optic setup that can overcome the detection efficiency required by conclusive quantum steering with multiple actively switched measurement settings. Our setup presents an immediate platform for exploring applications based on steering nonlocality, especially for quantum communication.</description>

Abstract: We analyze sharing Bell-type nonlocal correlation between two distant parties with optical hybrid states comprising a single photon polarization state and a multiphoton coherent state. By deploying entanglement swapping over the coherent state parts at the middle station, we show that the optical hybrid states can efficiently generate a polarization-entangled state that violates Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell-inequality well over a metropolitan distance. We further assess the quality of the shared entangled state in the information processing task of quantum teleportation of an unknown polarization qubit. Our results with realistic devices, embedding detection inefficiency and transmission losses, indicate the viability of faithful quantum teleportation over large distances, consistent with the quality of the shared correlation.</description>

      <title>Turning on the Light: Polymorphism-Induced Photoluminescence in Cysteine Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoluminescence of non-aromatic supramolecular chemical assemblies has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its potential for use in molecular sensing and imaging technologies. The underlying structural origins, the mechanisms of light emission in these systems, and the generality of this phenomenon remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that crystals of L-Cysteine (Cys) formed in heavy water ($\text{D}_2\text{O}$) exhibit distinct packing and hydrogen-bond networks, resulting in significantly enhanced photoluminescence compared to those prepared in $\text{H}_2\text{O}$. Using advanced excited-state simulations, we elucidate the nature of electronic transitions that activate vibrational modes of Cys in $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, particularly those involving thiol (S-H) and amine (C-N) groups, which lead to non-radiative decay. For the crystal formed in $\text{D}_2\text{O}$, these modes appear to be more constrained, and we also observe intersystem crossing from the singlet to the triplet state, indicating a potentially more complex light emission mechanism. Our findings provide new insights into this intriguing phenomenon and introduce innovative design principles for generating emergent fluorophores.</description>
