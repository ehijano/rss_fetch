      <title>Strong hub cover pebbling number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a graph $G$, we define a set of vertices to be a \emph{strong hub set} if for any two vertices in $G$, we can find a path between them whose internal vertices are all in this set. We define the \emph{strong hub cover pebbling number} of $G$, denoted by $h_s^*(G)$, to be the smallest $t$ such that for any initial configuration with $t$ pebbles on $G$, we can make some pebbling moves (a pebbling move consists of removing two pebbles from a vertex $v$ and adding one pebble to another vertex adjacent to $v$) so that there is a strong hub set with every vertex in it having a pebble. We determine the strong hub cover pebbling numbers of paths, stars, and books.</description>

      <title>Quantum walks on finite and bounded infinite graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A weighted graph $G$ with countable vertex set is bounded if there is an upper bound on the maximum of the sum of absolute values of all edge weights incident to a vertex in $G$. In this paper, we prove a fundamental result on equitable partitions of bounded weighted graphs with twin subgraphs and use this fact to construct finite and bounded infinite graphs with pair and plus state transfer with the adjacency matrix as a Hamiltonian. We show that for each $k \ge 3$, (i) there are infinitely many connected unweighted graphs with maximum degree $k$ admitting pair state transfer at $\tau\in\{\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{\pi}{2}\}$, and (ii) there are infinitely many signed graphs with exactly one negative edge weight and whose underlying unweighted graphs have maximum degree $k$ admitting plus state transfer at $\tau\in\{\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{\pi}{2}\}$. Parallel results are proven for perfect state transfer between a plus state and a pair state, and for the existence of sedentary pair and plus states. We further prove that almost all connected unweighted finite planar graphs admit pair state transfer at $\tau\in\{\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{\pi}{2}\}$, and almost all connected unweighted finite planar graphs can be assigned a single negative edge weight resulting in plus state transfer, or perfect state transfer between a plus state and a pair state, at $\tau\in\{\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{\pi}{2}\}$. Analogous results are shown to hold for unweighted finite trees. Using blow-up graphs, Cayley graphs and graphs with tails, we construct new infinite families of (finite and infinite) unweighted graphs and signed graphs admitting pair or plus state transfer.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Graphs as Algebraic Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs that are squares under the gluing algebra arise in the study of homomorphism density inequalities such as Sidorenko's conjecture. Recent work has focused on these homomorphism density applications. This paper takes a new perspective and focuses on the graph properties of arbitrary square graphs, not only those relevant to homomorphism conjectures and theorems.
  We develop a set of necessary and/or sufficient conditions for a graph to be square. We apply these conditions to categorize several classical families of graphs as square or not. In addition, we create infinite families of square graphs by proving that joins and Cartesian, direct, strong, and lexicographic products of square graphs with arbitrary graphs are square.</description>

      <title>Colourings of Uniform Group Divisible Designs and Maximum Packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A weak $c$-colouring of a design is an assignment of colours to its points from a set of $c$ available colours, such that there are no monochromatic blocks. A colouring of a design is block-equitable, if for each block, the number of points coloured with any available pair of colours differ by at most one. Weak and block-equitable colourings of balanced incomplete block designs have been previously considered. In this paper, we extend these concepts to group divisible designs (GDDs) and packing designs. We first determine when a $k$-GDD of type $g^u$ can have a block-equitable $c$-colouring. We then give a direct construction of maximum block-equitable $2$-colourable packings with block size $4$; a recursive construction has previously appeared in the literature. We also generalise a bound given in the literature for the maximum size of block-equitably $2$-colourable packings to $c&gt;2$. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic existence of uniform $k$-GDDs with arbitrarily many groups and arbitrary chromatic numbers (with the exception of $c=2$ and $k=3$). A structural analysis of $2$- and $3$-uniform $3$-GDDs obtained from 4-chromatic STS$(v)$ where $v\in\{21,25,27,33,37,39\}$ is given. We briefly discuss weak colourings of packings, and finish by considering some further constraints on weak colourings of GDDs, namely requiring all groups to be either monochromatic or equitably coloured.</description>

      <title>Closing paths to cycles in symmetric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was shown by Beisegel, Chudnovsky, Gurvich, Milani\v{c}, and Servatius in 2022 that every induced $2$-edge path in a vertex-transitive graph closes to an induced cycle. Similar results were obtained for 3-edge paths closing to cycles in edge-transitive graphs, where the cycle can be assumed to be induced if the path is induced. Motivated by these results, we consider the following problem: For a given class of graphs, determine all integers $\ell\geq 0$ such that for every graph in the class, every path of length at most $\ell$ closes to a cycle. We also consider the variant of the problem for induced paths closing to induced cycles. We completely solve these problems for the classes of (finite) vertex-transitive graphs, edge-transitive graphs, and edge-transitive graphs that are not stars. For all but one case of a negative answer, we provide infinite families of connected counterexamples.</description>

      <title>On Tur\'{a}n-type problems for Berge matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $F$, an $r$-uniform hypergraph ($r$-graph for short) $\mathcal{H}$ is a Berge-$F$ if there is a bijection $\phi:E(F)\rightarrow E(\mathcal{H})$ such that $e\subseteq \phi(e)$ for each $e\in E(F)$. Given a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $r$-graphs, an $r$-graph is $\mathcal{F}$-free if it does not contain any member in $\mathcal{F}$ as a subhypergraph. The Tur\'{a}n number of $\mathcal{F}$ is the maximum number of hyperedges in an $\mathcal{F}$-free $r$-graph on $n$ vertices.
  Kang, Ni, and Shan [\textit{Discrete Math. 345 (2022) 112901}] determined the exact value of the Tur\'{a}n number of Berge-$M_{s+1}$ for all $n$ when $r\leq s-1$ or $r\geq 2s+2$, where $M_{s+1}$ denotes a matching of size $s+1$.
  In this paper, we settle the remaining case $s\le r\le 2s+1$.
  Moreover, we establish several exact and general results on the Tur\'{a}n numbers of Berge matchings together with a single $r$-graph, as well as of Berge matchings together with Berge bipartite graphs.
  Finally, we generalize the results on Tur\'{a}n problems for Berge hypergraphs proposed by Gerbner, Methuku, and Palmer [\textit{Eur. J. Comb. 86 (2020) 103082}].</description>

      <title>Exceptional sets for restricted families of projections in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $d\ge3$ and $\mathbb{F}_q^{d}$ be the $d$-dimensional vector space over a finite field of order $q$, where $q$ is a prime power. Fix a slice $\pi=\{x_d=\lambda\}$ of the unit sphere $S^{d-1}=\{x\colon ||x||=1\}$ and let $X_\pi$ be the set of lines through the origin meeting $\pi\cap S^{d-1}$. For $E\subset\mathbb{F}_q^{d}$ and $N\ge1$, we study the exceptional sets \[ \mathcal{T}_1(X_\pi,E,N)=\bigl\{V\in X_\pi:\ |\pi_V(E)|\le N\bigr\},\qquad \mathcal{T}_2(X_\pi,E,N)=\bigl\{V\in X_\pi:\ |\pi_{V^\perp}(E)|\le N\bigr\}, \] on their respective natural ranges of $N$. Using discrete Fourier analysis together with restriction/extension estimates for cone and sphere type quadrics over finite fields, we obtain sharp bounds (up to constant factors) for $\lvert \mathcal{T}_1\rvert$ and $\lvert \mathcal{T}_2\rvert$, with separate treatment of the special slices $\lambda=\pm1$ and of the isotropic slice $\lambda=0$. The bounds exhibit arithmetic-geometric dichotomies absent in the full Grassmannian: the quadratic character of $\lambda^{2}-1$ and the parity of $d$ determine the size of the exceptional sets. As an application, when $|E|\ge q$, there exists a positive proportion of elements $\mathbf{y}\in X_\pi$ such that the pinned dot-product sets $\{\mathbf{y}\cdot \mathbf{x}\colon \mathbf{x}\in E\}$ are of cardinality $\Omega(q)$. We further treat analogous families arising from the spheres of radii $0$ and $-1$, and by combining these slices, recover the known estimates for projections over the full Grassmannian, complementing a result of Chen (2018).</description>

      <title>A recursive approach for the determination of the nice sections of width three having a 4-crown stack as retract</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of the finite minimal automorphic posets of width three is still an open problem. Niederle has shown that this task can be reduced to the characterization of the nice sections of width three having a non-trivial tower of nice sections as retract. In our article, we characterize those of them which have a 4-crown stack as retract and we develop a recursive approach for their determination. We apply the approach on a sub-class $\mathfrak{N}_2$ of nice sections of width three and determine all posets in $\mathfrak{N}_2$ with height up to six having a 4-crown stack as retract. For each integer $n \geq 2$, the class $\mathfrak{N}_2$ contains $2^{n-2}$ different isomorphism types of posets of height $n$.</description>

      <title>On the irreducibility and monodromy of Tutte polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study algebraic properties of the Tutte polynomial of a matroid and its generalizations to other combinatorially defined bivariate polynomial invariants. Merino, de Mier and Noy showed that the Tutte polynomial of a connected matroid is irreducible, and Bohn, Cameron and M{\"u}ller conjectured the stronger property that the Galois/monodromy group of the Tutte polynomial of a connected matroid of rank r is isomorphic to the full symmetric group on r letters. First, we generalize the result of Merino-de Mier-Noy to the context of general ranked sets by exploiting a recent translation of the Brylawski relations, satisfied by the coefficients of the Tutte polynomial, into a functional identity. Second, we give the first confirmation of the conjecture of Bohn-Cameron-M{\"u}ller for infinite families of connected matroids, including the cycle graphs and the uniform matroids. Moreover, we apply the large sieve to obtain a probabilistic statement showing that suitable linear combinations of coprime Tutte polynomials generically satisfy the conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a left-compressed family F(n, k, G) generated by a collection of generating sets G, and identify conditions on G under which F(n, k, G) is an intersecting family. From this, we obtain a convenient method to construct left-compressed intersecting families. After that, we provide some comparisons between the theorem of Bond and our result. Finally, we present some results on the generators of a maximal left-compressed intersecting family.</description>

      <title>Divisible subdivisions of graphs in subdivisions of complete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{Z}_q$ denote the cyclic group of order $q$. A $\mathbb{Z}_q$-edge-weighted $K_f$ is the complete graph $K_f$ equipped with a weight function $\omega : E(K_f) \to \mathbb{Z}_q$. A subdivision of a graph $H$ in a $\mathbb{Z}_q$-edge-weighted $K_f$ is called a $q$-divisible subdivision of $H$ if every subdivision path has weight congruent to zero modulo $q$. Let $q\ge 2$ be an integer and let $H$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Define $s_q(H)$ to be the smallest number $f$ such that every $\mathbb{Z}_q$-edge-weighted $K_{f}$ contains a $q$-divisible subdivision of $H$. Das, Dragani\'c, and Steiner raised the following question (Problem 4.1 in [Tight bounds for divisible subdivisions, J. Combin. Theory, Ser. B 165 (2024) 1-19]): Given $q\in\mathbb{N}$ and a subcubic graph $H$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, is it true $s_q(H)= m(q - 1) + n$? They also established the upper bound $s_q(H)\le 7mq+8n+14q$ for such a graph $H$. In this paper, we improve this bound by showing that $s_q(H)\le (2q - 1)m + 2n - 1 + 4q$, and establishing a sharper bound $s_p(H)\le \frac{3p - 1}{2}m - \frac{p - 1}{2}n + \frac{p + 1}{2}$ for prime $p$ and connected $H$. We resolve this problem in the case $q=2$ by proving that $s_2(H) = m + n$ for any 5-degenerate graph $H$, and in the case $q\ge 2$ and $T$ being a tree, by showing that $s_q(T) = nq - q + 1$. Let $s_q(H,t)$ be the minimum number $f$ such that every $\mathbb{Z}_q$-edge-weighted $K_f$ contains a $q$-divisible $t$-subdivision of $H$, where a $t$-subdivision of $H$ is a subdivision of $H$ such that each edge of $H$ is subdivided exactly $t$ times. We also prove that $s_2(H,1)= m + n$, where $H$ is a tree or a cycle on $n$ vertices with $m$ edges.</description>

      <title>Fractionally colouring $P_5$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain some $d\ge2$ such that every graph $G$ with no induced copy of the five-vertex path $P_5$ has at most $\alpha(G)\omega(G)^d$ vertices. This ``off-diagonal Ramsey'' statement implies that every such graph $G$ has fractional chromatic number at most $\omega(G)^d$, and is another step towards the polynomial Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture for $P_5$. The proof uses the recent Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal result for $P_5$ and adapts a decomposition argument for $P_5$-free graphs developed by the author in an earlier paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Tur\'an problems investigate the maximization of the number of certain structures (typically edges) under some constraints in a graph. We study a game version of these problems, the Constructor-Blocker game. We mainly focus on the case where Constructor tries to maximize the number of triangles in her graph, while forbidding her to claim short paths or cycles. We also study a variant of this game, where we impose some planarity constraints on Constructor instead of forbidding certain subgraphs. For all games studied, we obtain (precise) asymptotics or upper and lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Sharp thresholds for NAC-colourings and stable cuts in random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NAC-colourings of graphs correspond to flexible quasi-injective realisations in $\mathbb {R} ^2$. A special class of NAC-colourings are those that arise from stable cuts. We give sharp thresholds for the random graph to have no stable cut and to have no NAC-colouring via exact hitting-time results: with high probability, the random graph process gains both properties at the precise time that every vertex is in a triangle. Our thresholds complement recent results on the thresholds for the random graph to be generically or globally rigid in $\mathbb {R} ^d$, and for all injective realisations to be globally rigid in $\mathbb {R} $.</description>

Abstract: A graph is said to contain $K_k$ (a clique of size $k$) as a weak immersion if it has $k$ vertices, pairwise connected by edge-disjoint paths. In 1989, Lescure and Meyniel made the following conjecture related to Hadwiger's conjecture: Every graph of chromatic number $k$ contains $K_k$ as a weak immersion. We prove this conjecture for graphs with at most $(1.64-o(1))k$ vertices. As an application, we make some progress on Albertson's conjecture, according to which every graph $G$ with chromatic number $k$ satisfies $cr(G) \geq cr(K_k)$. In particular, we show that the conjecture is true for all graphs of chromatic number $k$, provided that they have at most $(1.64-o(1))k$ vertices.</description>

      <title>A Generalisation on Erd\H{o}s Distinct Subset Sums Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Erd\H{o}s distinct subset sums problem in $\mathbb{Z}^k$. Beyond the classical variance method, using alternative statistical quantities like $\mathbb{E}[\|X\|_1]$ and $\mathbb{E}[\|X\|_3^3]$ can yield better bounds in certain dimensions. This innovation improves previous low-dimensional results and provides a framework for choosing suitable methods depending on the dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given any poset $P$ and chain $\phi$ in $P$, we define the $(P,\phi)$-Tamari lattice. We study in depth these lattices and prove in particular that they are join-semidistributive, join-congruence uniform and left modular. We prove that the lattices of higher torsion classes of the higher Auslander and Nakayama algebras of type $\mathbb{A}$ are examples of $(P,\phi)$-Tamari lattices and thus they inherit their properties. We also give general results related to left modular, extremal and congruence normal lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish strong vanishing theorems for line bundles on wonderful varieties of hyperplane arrangements, and we show that the resulting positivity properties of Euler characteristics extend to all matroids. We achieve this by showing that every degeneration of a wonderful variety within the permutohedral toric variety is reduced and Cohen--Macaulay. The same holds for a larger class of subschemes in products of projective lines that we call "kindred," which are characterized by matroidal Hilbert polynomials. Our results give a new proof of the 20-year-old f-vector conjecture of Speyer and resolve the conjecture of Tohaneanu that higher order Orlik--Terao algebras are Cohen--Macaulay.</description>

      <title>Signed network models for portfolio optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider weighted signed network representations of financial markets derived from raw or denoised correlation matrices, and examine how negative edges can be exploited to reduce portfolio risk. We then propose a discrete optimization scheme that reduces the asset selection problem to a desired size by building a time series of signed networks based on asset returns. To benchmark our approach, we consider two standard allocation strategies: Markowitz's mean-variance optimization and the 1/N equally weighted portfolio. Both methods are applied on the reduced universe as well as on the full universe, using two datasets: (i) the Market Champions dataset, consisting of 21 major S&amp;P500 companies over the 2020-2024 period, and (ii) a dataset of 199 assets comprising all S&amp;P500 constituents with stock prices available and aligned with Google's data. Empirical results show that portfolios constructed via our signed network selection perform as good as those from classical Markowitz model and the equal-weight benchmark in most occasions.</description>

      <title>A Universal Moments-Only Bound for Cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a simple, universal inequality that bounds the $n$-th cumulant of a real-valued random variable using only its $n$-th (absolute or central) moment. Specifically, for any integer $n \ge 1$, the $n$-th cumulant $\kappa_n(X)$ satisfies \[ \lvert \kappa_n(X) \rvert \;\le\; C_n\, \mathbb{E}\lvert X-\mathbb{E}X\rvert^{\,n}, \] with an alternative bound in terms of $\mathbb{E}\lvert X\rvert^{\,n}$ in the uncentered form. The coefficient $C_n$ is derived from the combinatorial structure of the moment--cumulant formula and exhibits the asymptotic behavior $C_n \sim (n-1)!/\rho^{\,n}$, giving an exponential improvement over classical bounds that grow on the order of $n^n$.
  In full generality, the bound involves the ordered Bell numbers, corresponding to a rate parameter $\rho=\ln 2\approx 0.693$. For $n\ge 2$, shift-invariance of cumulants yields a universal centered refinement with parameter $\rho_0\approx 1.146$, determined by $e^{\rho_0}=2+\rho_0$. For symmetric random variables, the bound sharpens further to $\rho_{\mathrm{sym}}=\operatorname{arcosh}2\approx 1.317$. These results extend naturally to the multivariate setting, providing uniform control of joint cumulants under the same minimal moment assumptions.</description>

      <title>M\"obius transforms and Shapley values for vector-valued functions on weighted directed acyclic multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the concept of M\"obius inversion and Shapley values to directed acyclic multigraphs and weighted versions thereof. We further allow value functions (games) and thus their M\"obius transforms (synergy function) and Shapley values to have values in any abelian group that is a module over a ring that contains the graph weights, e.g. vector-valued functions. To achieve this and overcome the obstruction that the classical axioms (linearity, efficiency, null player, symmetry) are not strong enough to uniquely determine Shapley values in this more general setting, we analyze Shapley values from two novel points of view: 1) We introduce projection operators that allow us to interpret Shapley values as the recursive projection and re-attribution of higher-order synergies to lower-order ones; 2) we propose a strengthening of the null player axiom and a localized symmetry axiom, namely the weak elements and flat hierarchy axioms. The former allows us to remove coalitions with vanishing synergy while preserving the rest of the hierarchical structure. The latter treats player-coalition bonds uniformly in the corner case of hierarchically flat graphs. Together with linearity these axioms already imply a unique explicit formula for the Shapley values, as well as classical properties like efficiency, null player, symmetry, and novel ones like the projection property. This whole framework then specializes to finite inclusion algebras, lattices, partial orders and mereologies, and also recovers certain previously known cases as corner cases, and presents others from a new perspective. The admission of general weighted directed acyclic multigraph structured hierarchies and vector-valued functions and Shapley values opens up the possibility for new analytic tools and application areas, like machine learning, language processing, explainable artificial intelligence, and many more.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of Temporal Connected Components: Treewidth and k-Path Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the parameterized complexity of maximum temporal connected components (tccs) in temporal graphs, i.e., graphs that deterministically change over time. In a tcc, any pair of vertices must be able to reach each other via a time-respecting path. We consider both problems of maximum open tccs (openTCC), which allow temporal paths through vertices outside the component, and closed tccs (closedTCC) which require at least one temporal path entirely within the component for every pair. We focus on the structural parameter of treewidth, tw, and the recently introduced temporal parameter of temporal path number, tpn, which is the minimum number of paths needed to fully describe a temporal graph. We prove that these parameters on their own are not sufficient for fixed parameter tractability: both openTCC and closedTCC are NP-hard even when tw=9, and closedTCC is NP-hard when tpn=6. In contrast, we prove that openTCC is in XP when parameterized by tpn. On the positive side, we show that both problem become fixed parameter tractable under various combinations of structural and temporal parameters that include, tw plus tpn, tw plus the lifetime of the graph, and tw plus the maximum temporal degree.</description>

      <title>Learning stabilizer structure of quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the task of learning a structured stabilizer decomposition of an arbitrary $n$-qubit quantum state $|\psi\rangle$: for $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, output a state $|\phi\rangle$ with stabilizer-rank $\textsf{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ such that $|\psi\rangle=|\phi\rangle+|\phi'\rangle$ where $|\phi'\rangle$ has stabilizer fidelity $&lt; \varepsilon$. We firstly show the existence of such decompositions using the recently established inverse theorem for the Gowers-$3$ norm of states [AD,STOC'25].
  To learn this structure, we initiate the task of self-correction of a state $|\psi\rangle$ with respect to a class of states $\textsf{C}$: given copies of $|\psi\rangle$ which has fidelity $\geq \tau$ with a state in $\textsf{C}$, output $|\phi\rangle \in \textsf{C}$ with fidelity $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle|^2 \geq \tau^C$ for a constant $C&gt;1$. Assuming the algorithmic polynomial Frieman-Rusza (APFR) conjecture (whose combinatorial version was recently resolved [GGMT,Annals of Math.'25], we give a polynomial-time algorithm for self-correction of stabilizer states. Given access to the state preparation unitary $U_\psi$ for $|\psi\rangle$ and its controlled version $cU_\psi$, we give a polynomial-time protocol that learns a structured decomposition of $|\psi\rangle$. Without assuming APFR, we give a quasipolynomial-time protocol for the same task.
  As our main application, we give learning algorithms for states $|\psi\rangle$ promised to have stabilizer extent $\xi$, given access to $U_\psi$ and $cU_\psi$. We give a protocol that outputs $|\phi\rangle$ which is constant-close to $|\psi\rangle$ in time $\textsf{poly}(n,\xi^{\log \xi})$, which can be improved to polynomial-time assuming APFR. This gives an unconditional learning algorithm for stabilizer-rank $k$ states in time $\textsf{poly}(n,k^{k^2})$. As far as we know, learning arbitrary states with even stabilizer-rank $k \geq 2$ was unknown.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Guarantees to Explicit Constructions: Local Properties of Linear Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for derandomizing random linear codes with respect to a broad class of permutation-invariant properties, known as local properties, which encompass several standard notions such as distance, list-decoding, list-recovery, and perfect hashing. Our approach extends the classical Alon-Edmonds-Luby (AEL) construction through a modified formalism of local coordinate-wise linear (LCL) properties, introduced by Levi, Mosheiff, and Shagrithaya (2025). The main theorem demonstrates that if random linear codes satisfy the complement of an LCL property $\mathcal{P}$ with high probability, then one can construct explicit codes satisfying the complement of $\mathcal{P}$ as well, with an enlarged yet constant alphabet size. This gives the first explicit constructions for list recovery, as well as special cases (e.g., list recovery with erasures, zero-error list recovery, perfect hash matrices), with parameters matching those of random linear codes. More broadly, our constructions realize the full range of parameters associated with these properties at the same level of optimality as in the random setting, thereby offering a systematic pathway from probabilistic guarantees to explicit codes that attain them. Furthermore, our derandomization of random linear codes also admits efficient (list) decoding via recently developed expander-based decoders.</description>

Abstract: Let $\{p_1, \ldots , p_n \} \subset {\Bbb{R}}^2$ be a separated point set, i.e., any two points have a distance at least $1$. Let $k \ge 1$ be an integer, and $1 \le t_1 &lt; \ldots &lt; t_k$ be real numbers. Let $\delta &gt; 0$. Suppose for all $1 \le \ell (1) \le \ell (2) &lt; \ell (3) \le k$ that $|t_{\ell (3)} / (t_{\ell (1)} + t_{\ell (2)}) - 1| \ge \delta $. Then for $n \ge n_{k, \delta }$, the number of pairs $\{ p_i,p_j\} $, for which $d(p_i,p_j) \in [t_1, t_1 + 1] \cup \ldots \cup [t_k, t_k + 1] $, is at most $n^2/4 + C_{k,\delta }n$. This is sharp, up to the value of the constant $C_{k,\delta } &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraphs and tree decompositions XI. Local structure in even-hole-free graphs of large treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Sintiari and Trotignon that every even-hole-free graph of sufficiently large treewidth contains a four-vertex induced subgraph with at least five edges (that is, either the four-vertex complete graph or the unique four-vertex graph with five edges, also known as the diamond).
  In fact, we prove two stronger results: (a) For every $K_4$-free chordal graph $H$, every even-hole-free graph of sufficiently large treewidth contains either a four-vertex complete subgraph or an induced subgraph isomorphic to $H$ (when $H$ is the diamond, this yields their conjecture); and (b) For every $K_3$-free chordal graph $H$ (equivalently, for every forest $H$) and every $t \in \mathbb{N}$, every even-hole-free graph of sufficiently large treewidth contains either a $t$-vertex complete subgraph or an induced subgraph obtained from $H$ by adding a universal vertex (when $t=4$ and $H$ is the three-vertex path, this yields their conjecture).
  The choice of $H$ in both result is best possible: (a) fails for every graph $H$ that is not $K_4$-free and chordal, and (b) fails for every graph $H$ that is not a forest.</description>

      <title>Saturation results around the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider saturation problems related to the celebrated Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres convex polygon problem. For each $n \ge 7$, we construct a planar point set of size $(7/8) \cdot 2^{n-2}$ which is saturated for convex $n$-gons. That is, the set contains no $n$ points in convex position while the addition of any new point creates such a configuration. This demonstrates that the saturation number is smaller than the Ramsey number for the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres problem. The proof also shows that the original Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres construction is indeed saturated.
  Our construction is based on a similar improvement for the saturation version of the cups-versus-caps theorem. Moreover, we consider the generalization of the cups-versus-caps theorem to monotone paths in ordered hypergraphs. In contrast to the geometric setting, we show that this abstract saturation number is always equal to the corresponding Ramsey number.</description>

      <title>Saturation in Random Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K^r_n$ be the complete $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices, that is, the hypergraph whose vertex set is $[n]:=\{1,2,...,n\}$ and whose edge set is $\binom{[n]}{r}$. We form $G^r(n,p)$ by retaining each edge of $K^r_n$ independently with probability $p$.
  An $r$-uniform hypergraph $H\subseteq G$ is $F$-saturated if $H$ does not contain any copy of $F$, but any missing edge of $H$ in $G$ creates a copy of $F$. Furthermore, we say that $H$ is weakly $F$-saturated in $G$ if $H$ does not contain any copy of $F$, but the missing edges of $H$ in $G$ can be added back one-by-one, in some order, such that every edge creates a new copy of $F$. The smallest number of edges in an $F$-saturated hypergraph in $G$ is denoted by $sat(G,F)$, and in a weakly $F$-saturated hypergraph in $G$ by $wsat(G,F)$.
  In 2017, Kor\'andi and Sudakov initiated the study of saturation in random graphs, showing that for constant $p$, with high probability $sat(G(n,p),K_s)=(1+o(1))n\log_{\frac{1}{1-p}}n$, and $wsat(G(n,p),K_s)=wsat(K_n,K_s)$. Generalising their results, in this paper, we solve the suturation problem for random hypergraphs for every $2\le r &lt; s$ and constant $p$.</description>

Abstract: In 1995, Erd\H{o}s and Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s proved that in every $2$-edge-coloured complete graph on $n$ vertices, there exists a collection of $2\sqrt{n}$ monochromatic paths, all of the same colour, which cover the entire vertex set. They conjectured that it is possible to replace $2\sqrt{n}$ by $\sqrt{n}$. We prove this to be true for all sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <title>Some exact values of the inducibility and statistics constants for hypercubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two types of problems: maximising, over subsets $S\subseteq \{0,1\}^n$, the density of $d$-subcubes $C$ in the $n$-hypercube graph that span a subgraph such that $S\cap C$ is i) isomorphic to the given configuration $H\subseteq\{0,1\}^d$ (the inducibility problem), or ii) has the given size $s$ (the statistics problem). Using flag algebras, we determine the limit of this density as $n\to\infty$ for 5 new configurations $H\subseteq\{0,1\}^3$ and for 3 new pairs $(d,s)$, namely for $(3,2)$, $(4,2)$ and $(4,4)$. Interestingly, the lower bounds in the last three cases come from blowups of small Hamming codes.</description>

      <title>The Stamp Folding Problem From a Mountain-Valley Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23661v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A strip of square stamps can be folded in many ways such that all of the stamps are stacked in a single pile in the folded state. The stamp folding problem asks for the number of such foldings and has previously been studied extensively. We consider this problem with the additional restriction of fixing the mountain-valley assignment of each crease in the stamp pattern. We provide a closed form for counting the number of legal foldings on specific patterns of mountain-valley assignments, including a surprising appearance of the Catalan numbers. We describe results on upper and lower bounds for the number of ways to fold a given mountain-valley assignment on the strip of stamps, provide experimental evidence suggesting more general results, and include conjectures and open problems.</description>

      <title>Two stability theorems on plethysms of Schur functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The plethysm product of Schur functions corresponds to composing polynomial representations of infinite general linear groups. Finding the plethysm coefficients $\langle s_\nu \circ s_\mu, s_\lambda\rangle$ that express an arbitrary plethysm $s_\nu \circ s_\mu$ as a sum $\sum_\lambda \langle s_\nu \circ s_\mu, s_\lambda \rangle s_\lambda$ of Schur functions is a fundamental open problem in algebraic combinatorics. We prove two stability theorems for plethysm coefficients under the operations of adding and/or joining an arbitrary partition to either $\mu$ or $\nu$. In both theorems $\mu$ may be replaced with an arbitrary skew partition. As special cases we obtain all stability results on the plethysm product of two Schur functions in the literature to date. The proofs are entirely combinatorial using plethystic semistandard tableaux with positive and negative entries.</description>

Abstract: In this note we show that there is a cubic graph of girth $5$ that is not a subgraph of any minimal Cayley graph. On the other hand, we show that any Generalized Petersen Graph $G(n,k)$ with $\gcd(n,k)=1$ is an induced subgraph of a minimal Cayley graph. These results give insights into two comments of L\'aszl\'o Babai in [L. Babai, \emph{Automorphism groups, isomorphism, reconstruction}. Graham, R. L. (ed.) et al., Handbook of combinatorics.

      <title>The Local Structure Theorem for Graph Minors with Finite Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Local Structure Theorem (LST) for graph minors roughly states that every $H$-minor free graph $G$ that contains a sufficiently large wall $W$, there is a set of few vertices $A$ such that, upon removing $A$, the resulting graph $G':=G - A$ admits an "almost embedding" $\delta$ into a surface $\Sigma$ in which $H$ does not embed. By almost embedding, we mean that there exists a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ whose vertex set is a subset of the vertex set of $G$ and an embedding of $\mathcal{H}$ in $\Sigma$ such that 1) the drawing of each hyperedge of $\mathcal{H}$ corresponds to a cell of $\delta$, 2) the boundary of each cell intersects only the vertices of the corresponding hyperedge, and 3) all remaining vertices and edges of $G'$ are drawn in the interior of cells. The cells corresponding to hyperedges of arity at least $4$, called vortices, are few in number and have small "depth", while a "large" part of the wall $W$ is drawn outside the vortices and is "grounded" in the embedding $\delta$. Now suppose that the subgraphs drawn inside each of the non-vortex cells are equipped with some finite index, i.e., each such cell is assigned a color from a finite set. We prove a version of the LST in which the set $C$ of colors assigned to the non-vortex cells exhibits "large" bidimensionality: The graph $G'$ contains a minor model of a large grid $\Gamma$ where each bag corresponding to a vertex $v$ of $\Gamma$, contains the subgraph drawn within a cell carrying color $\alpha$, for every color $\alpha \in C$. Moreover, the grid $\Gamma$ can be chosen in a way that is "well-connected" to the original wall $W$.</description>

      <title>Triacontagonal proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coxeter pointed out that a number of polytopes can be projected orthogonally into two dimensions in such a way that their vertices lie on a number of concentric regular triacontagons (or 30-gons). Among them are the 600-cell and 120-cell in four dimensions and Gosset's polytope in eight dimensions. We show how these projections can be modified into Kochen-Secker diagrams from which parity proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem are easily extracted. Our construction trivially yields parity proofs of fifteen bases for all theree polytopes and also allows many other proofs of the same type to be constructed for two of them. The defining feature of these proofs is that they have a fifteen-fold symmetry about the center of the Kochen-Specker diagram and thus involve both rays and bases that are multiples of fifteen. Any proof of this type can be written as a word made up of an odd number of distinct letters, each representing an orbit of fifteen bases. Knowing a word makes it possible to write down all the features of the associated proof without first having to recover its bases. A comparison is made with earlier approaches that have been used to obtain parity proofs in these polytopes, and two questions related to possible applications of these polytopes are raised.</description>

      <title>Partitioning triangle-free planar graphs into a forest and a linear forest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Raspaud and Wang conjectured that every triangle-free planar graph can be vertex-partitioned into an independent set and a forest. Independently, Kawarabayashi and Thomassen also remarked that this might be true, after providing another proof of a result of Borodin and Glebov, showing this result for planar graphs of girth~5. Subsequently, Dross, Montassier, and Pinlou raised the same question and proved that every triangle-free planar graph can be partitioned into a forest and another forest of maximum degree~5. More recently, Feghali and \v{S}\'{a}mal improved this bound on the maximum degree to~3. In this note, we further improve the result by showing that every triangle-free planar graph can be partitioned into a forest and a linear forest, that is, a forest of maximum degree~2.</description>

      <title>Scattered polynomials: an overview on their properties, connections and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this survey is to outline the state of the art in research on a class of linearized polynomials with coefficients over finite fields, known as scattered polynomials. These have been studied in several contexts, such as in [A. Blokhuis, M. Lavrauw. Scattered spaces with respect to a spread in $\mathrm{PG}(n, q)$. Geometriae Dedicata 81(1) (2000), 231-243] and [G. Lunardon, O. Polverino. Blocking sets and derivable partial spreads. J. Algebraic Combin. 14 (2001), 49-56]. Recently, their connection to maximum rank-metric codes was brought to light in [J. Sheekey. MRD codes: Constructions and connections. In K.-U. Schmidt and A. Winterhof, editors, Combinatorics and Finite Fields, De Gruyter (2019), 255-286]. This link has significantly advanced their study and investigation, sparking considerable interest in recent years. Here, we will explore their relationship with certain subsets of the finite projective line $\mathrm{PG}(1, q^n)$ known as maximum scattered linear sets, as well as with codes made up of square matrices of order $n$ equipped with the rank metric. We will review the known examples of scattered polynomials up to date and discuss some of their key properties. We will also address the classification of maximum scattered linear sets of the finite projective line $\mathrm{PG}(1, q^n)$ for small values of $n$ and discuss characterization results for the examples known so far. Finally, we will retrace how each scattered polynomial gives rise to a translation plane, as discussed in [V. Casarino, G. Longobardi, C. Zanella. Scattered linear sets in a finite projective line and translation planes, Linear Algebra Appl. 650 (2022), 286-298] and in [G. Longobardi, C. Zanella, A standard form for scattered linearized polynomials and properties of the related translation planes, J. Algebr. Comb. 59(4) (2024), 917-937].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rank-metric codes have been a central topic in coding theory due to their theoretical and practical significance, with applications in network coding, distributed storage, crisscross error correction, and post-quantum cryptography. Recent research has focused on constructing new families of rank-metric codes with distinct algebraic structures, emphasizing the importance of invariants for distinguishing these codes from known families and from random ones. In this paper, we introduce a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product used in the Hamming metric. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the extended Hamming code associated with a linear code, we demonstrate its ability to differentiate Gabidulin codes from random ones. From a geometric perspective, this approach investigates the vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code.</description>

      <title>Orbits on a product of two flags and a line and the Bruhat Order, I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G=GL(n)$ be the $n\times n$ complex general linear group and let $\mathcal{B}_{n}$ be its flag variety. The standard Borel subgroup $B$ of upper triangular matrices acts on the product $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ with finitely many orbits. In this paper, we study the $B$-orbits on the subvarieties $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times \mathcal{O}_{i}$, where $\mathcal{O}_{i}$ is the $B$-orbit on $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ containing the line through the origin in the direction of the $i$-th standard basis vector of $\mathbb{C}^{n}$. For each $i=1,\dots, n$, we construct a bijection between $B$-orbits on $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathcal{O}_{i}$ and certain pairs of Schubert cells in $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathcal{B}_{n}$. We also show that this bijection can be used to understand the Richardson-Springer monoid action on such $B$-orbits in terms of the classical monoid action of the symmetric group on itself. We also develop combinatorial models of these orbits and use these models to compute exponential generating functions for the sequences $\{|B\backslash(\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathcal{O}_{i})|\}_{n\geq 1}$ and $\{|B\backslash (\mathcal{B}_{n}\times \mathbb{P}^{n-1})|\}_{n\geq 1}$. In the sequel to this paper, we use the results of this paper to construct a correspondence between $B$-orbits on $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ and a collection of $B$-orbits on the flag variety $\mathcal{B}_{n+1}$ of $GL(n+1)$ and show that this correspondence respects closures relations and preserves monoid actions. As a consequence both closure relations and monoid actions for all $B$-orbits on $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ can be understood via the Bruhat order by using our results in [CE].</description>

      <title>Ramanujan's partition generating functions modulo $\ell$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the partition function $p(n)$, Ramanujan proved the striking identities $$
  P_5(q):=\sum_{n\geq 0} p(5n+4)q^n =5\prod_{n\geq 1} \frac{\left(q^5;q^5\right)_{\infty}^5}{(q;q)_{\infty}^6}, $$ $$
  P_7(q):=\sum_{n\geq 0} p(7n+5)q^n =7\prod_{n\geq 1}\frac{\left(q^7;q^7\right)_{\infty}^3}{(q;q)_{\infty}^4}+49q
  \prod_{n\geq 1}\frac{\left(q^7;q^7\right)_{\infty}^7}{(q;q)_{\infty}^8}, $$ where $(q;q)_{\infty}:=\prod_{n\geq 1}(1-q^n).$ As these identities imply his celebrated congruences modulo 5 and 7, it is natural to seek, for primes $\ell \geq 5,$ closed form expressions of the power series
  $$
  P_{\ell}(q):=\sum_{n\geq 0} p(\ell n-\delta_{\ell})q^n\pmod{\ell},
  $$
  where $\delta_{\ell}:=\frac{\ell^2-1}{24}.$ In this paper, we prove that
  $$
  P_{\ell}(q)\equiv c_{\ell} \frac{T_{\ell}(q)}{ (q^\ell; q^\ell )_\infty} \pmod{\ell},
  $$
  where $c_{\ell}\in \mathbb{Z}$ is explicit and $T_{\ell}(q)$ is the generating function for the Hecke traces of $\ell$-ramified values of special Dirichlet series for weight $\ell-1$ cusp forms on $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$. This is a new proof of Ramanujan's congruences modulo 5, 7, and 11, as there are no nontrivial cusp forms of weight 4, 6, and 10.</description>

      <title>Quasimodular forms arising from Jacobi's theta function and special symmetric polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ramanujan derived a sequence of even weight $2n$ quasimodular forms $U_{2n}(q)$ from derivatives of Jacobi's weight $3/2$ theta function. Using the generating function for this sequence, one can construct sequences of quasimodular forms of all nonnegative integer weights with minimal input: a weight 1 modular form and a power series $F(X)$. Using the weight 1 form $\theta(q)^2$ and $F(X)=\exp(X/2)$, we obtain a sequence $\{Y_n(q)\}$ of weight $n$ quasimodular forms on $\Gamma_0(4)$ whose symmetric function avatars $\widetilde{Y}_n(\pmb{x}^k)$ are the symmetric polynomials $T_n(\pmb{x}^k)$ that arise naturally in the study of syzygies of numerical semigroups. With this information, we settle two conjectures about the $T_n(\pmb{x}^k).$ Finally, we note that these polynomials are systematically given in terms of the Borel-Hirzebruch $\widehat{A}$-genus for spin manifolds, where one identifies power sum symmetric functions $p_i$ with Pontryagin classes.</description>

      <title>KP solitons and the Schottky uniformization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real and regular soliton solutions of the KP hierarchy have been classified in terms of the totally nonnegative (TNN) Grassmannians. These solitons are referred to as KP solitons, and they are expressed as singular (tropical) limits of shifted Riemann theta functions. In this talk, for each element of the TNN Grassmannian, we construct a Schottky group, which uniformizes the Riemann surface associated with a real finite-gap solution. Then we show that the KP solitons are obtained by degenerating these finite-gap solutions.</description>

      <title>Counting $2 \times 2$ integer matrices with a given determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given positive integers $h, N$ satisfying $1 \leqslant h \leqslant 2N^2$, we define $T(h,N)$ to be the number of $2\times 2$ integer matrices with determinant equal to $h$ whose entries lie in $[-N,N]$. Our first result states that for any $\varepsilon &gt;0$, one has \[ T(h,N) = \frac{16}{\zeta(2)} N^2 \bigg( \sum_{d |h} \frac{1}{d} \bigg) + O_{\varepsilon}(N^{\varepsilon} (N+ h)).\] This quantitatively improves upon recent work of Afifurrahman and Ganguly--Guria. We further show that when $N^{1 + \delta} \leqslant h \leqslant 2N^2$ for any fixed $\delta&gt;0$, the error term above is of roughly the right order. Our second result delivers an asymptotic formula for $T(h,N)$ with square-root cancellation whenever $h = N^2 + O(N)$. This error term is much stronger than its corresponding analogue in the smoothened version of this problem. More generally, for any $\varepsilon &gt;0$ and any $N,h \in \mathbb{N}$ with $1\leq h \leq 2N^2$, we prove that \[ T(h,N) = \bigg( \frac{8}{\zeta(2)} - 4 \bigg)N^2 \bigg( \sum_{d |h} \frac{1}{d} \bigg) + O_{\varepsilon}(N^{\varepsilon}(N+ |h-N^2|)). \]</description>

      <title>Spectrality of Prime Size Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23752v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that if a tile in $\mathbb Z^d$ has prime size $p$, then it must be spectral. The proof is by contradiction, it is simply shown that the tiling complement of such a tile can not annihilate all $p$-subgroups. In addition, with a simple transformation we prove that any $p$ points in general linear positions in $\mathbb Z^d$ must be both tiling and spectral if $d\ge p-1$.</description>

      <title>A Tauberian approach to metric scaling limits of random discrete structures, with an application to random planar maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove sandwich theorems and a Tauberian theorem in the space of compact metric measure spaces, endowed with the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov (GHP) topology. These results hold with respect to a close relative of Gromov's Lipschitz order. As a proof-of-concept of a general method to prove metric scaling limits of random discrete structures, we give an application to the theory of random planar maps: the Brownian sphere is the scaling limit in the GHP topology of irreducible quandrangulations. Our main inputs are (i) the convergence of general quadrangulations to the Brownian sphere (Le Gall, 2013; Miermont, 2013); and (ii) couplings where irreducible quadrangulations of the hexagon are "grown" by face-openings (Addario-Berry, 2014).</description>
