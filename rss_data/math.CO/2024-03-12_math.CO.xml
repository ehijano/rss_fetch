      <title>Solving Functional Equations Dear to W.T. Tutte using the Naive (yet fullly rigorous!) Guess And Check Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his seminal paper ``A census of planar triangulations", published in 1962, the iconic graph theorist (and code-breaker), W.T. Tutte, spent a few pages to prove that a certain bi-variate generating function that enumerates triangulations, satisfies a certain functional equation. He then used his genius to actually solve it, giving closed-form solutions to the enumerating sequences. While the first part, of deriving the functional equation, still needs human ingenuity, the second part, of solving it, can nowadays be fully automated. Our Maple program, accompanying this paper, Tutte.txt, can not only solve Tutte's original equation in a few seconds, it can also solve many, far more complicated ones, way beyond the scope of even such a giant as W.T. Tutte. We use our favorite method of ``guess and check" and show how it can always be made fully rigorous (if desired).</description>

      <title>Homotopy type of shellable $q$-complexes and their homology groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of shellable simplicial complexes brings together combinatorics, algebra, and topology in a remarkable way. Initially introduced by Alder for $q$-simplicial complexes, recent work of Ghorpade, Pratihar, and Randrianarisoa extends the study of shellability to $q$-matroid complexes and determines singular homology groups for a subclass of these $q$-simplicial complexes. In this paper, we determine the homotopy type of shellable $q$-simplicial complexes. Moreover, we establish the shellability of order complexes from lexicographically shellable $q$-simplicial complexes, that include the $q$-matroid complexes. This results in a comprehensive determination of the homology groups for any lexicographically shellable $q$-complexes.</description>

      <title>Sets of Cross Numbers of Sequences over Finite Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite abelian group with $\exp(G)$ the exponent of $G$. Then $\mathsf W(G)$ denotes the set of cross numbers of minimal zero-sum sequences over $G$ and $\mathsf w(G)$ denotes the set of all cross numbers of non-trivial zero-sum free sequences over $G$. It is clear that $\mathsf W(G)$ and $\mathsf w(G)$ are bounded subsets of $\frac{1}{\exp(G)}\mathbb{N}$ with maximum $ \mathsf K(G)$ and $\mathsf k(G)$, respectively (here $\mathsf{K}(G)$ and $\mathsf{k}(G)$ denote the large and the small cross number of $G$, respectively). We give results on the structure of $\mathsf W(G)$ and $\mathsf w(G)$. We first show that both sets contain long arithmetic progressions and that only close to the maximum there might be some gaps. Then, we provide groups for which $\mathsf W(G)$ and $\mathsf w(G)$ actually are arithmetic progressions, and argue that this is rather a rare phenomenon. Finally, we provide some results in case there are gaps.</description>

      <title>Zig-zag Eulerian polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any finite partially ordered set $P$, the $P$-Eulerian polynomial is the generating function for the descent number over the set of linear extensions of $P$, and is closely related to the order polynomial of $P$ arising in the theory of $P$-partitions. Here we study the $P$-Eulerian polynomial where $P$ is a naturally labeled zig-zag poset; we call these $\textit{zig-zag Eulerian polynomials}$. A result of Br\"and\'en implies that these polynomials are gamma-nonnegative, and hence their coefficients are symmetric and unimodal. The zig-zag Eulerian polynomials and the associated order polynomials have appeared fleetingly in the literature in a wide variety of contexts$\unicode{x2014}$e.g., in the study of polytopes, magic labelings of graphs, and Kekul\'e structures$\unicode{x2014}$but they do not appear to have been studied systematically.
  In this paper, we use a "relaxed" version of $P$-partitions to both survey and unify results. Our technique shows that the zig-zag Eulerian polynomials also capture the distribution of "big returns" over the set of (up-down) alternating permutations, as first observed by Coons and Sullivant. We develop recurrences for refined versions of the relevant generating functions, which evoke similarities to recurrences for the classical Eulerian polynomials. We conclude with a literature survey and open questions.</description>

      <title>Crystal Chute Moves on Pipe Dreams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schubert polynomials represent a basis for the cohomology of the complete flag variety and thus play a central role in geometry and combinatorics. In this context, Schubert polynomials are generating functions over various combinatorial objects, such as rc-graphs or reduced pipe dreams. By restricting Bergeron and Billey's chute moves on rc-graphs, we define a Demazure crystal structure on the monomials of a Schubert polynomial. As a consequence, we provide a method for decomposing Schubert polynomials as sums of key polynomials, complementing related work of Assaf and Schilling via reduced factorizations with cutoff, as well as Lenart's coplactic operators on biwords.</description>

      <title>Simplicial complexes with many facets are vertex decomposable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Delta$ be a pure simplicial complex on $n$ vertices having dimension $d$ and codimension $c = n-d-1$ in the simplex. Terai and Yoshida proved that if the number of facets of $\Delta$ is at least $\binom{n}{c}-2c+1$, then $\Delta$ is Cohen-Macaulay. We improve this result by showing that these hypotheses imply the stronger condition that $\Delta$ is vertex decomposable. We give examples to show that this bound is optimal, and that the conclusion cannot be strengthened to the class of matroids or shifted complexes. We explore an application to Simon's Conjecture and discuss connections to other results from the literature.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of generalized parking-function polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\mathbf{b}=(b_1,\dots,b_n)\in \mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}^n$, a $\mathbf{b}$-parking function is defined to be a sequence $(\beta_1,\dots,\beta_n)$ of positive integers whose nondecreasing rearrangement $\beta'_1\leq \beta'_2\leq \cdots \leq \beta'_n$ satisfies $\beta'_i\leq b_1+\cdots + b_i$. The $\mathbf{b}$-parking-function polytope $\mathfrak{X}_n(\mathbf{b})$ is the convex hull of all $\mathbf{b}$-parking functions of length $n$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Geometric properties of $\mathfrak{X}_n(\mathbf{b})$ were previously explored in the specific case where $\mathbf{b}=(a,b,b,\dots,b)$ and were shown to generalize those of the classical parking-function polytope. In this work, we study $\mathfrak{X}_n(\mathbf{b})$ in full generality. We present a minimal inequality and vertex description for $\mathfrak{X}_n(\mathbf{b})$, prove it is a generalized permutahedron, and study its $h$-polynomial. Furthermore, we investigate $\mathfrak{X}_n(\mathbf{b})$ through the perspectives of building sets and polymatroids, allowing us to identify its combinatorial types and obtain bounds on its combinatorial and circuit diameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise the minimum weight codewords of the $p$-ary linear code of intersecting lines in ${\rm PG}(3,q)$, $q=p^h$, $q\geq19$, $p$ prime, $h\geq 1$. If $q$ is even, the minimum weight equals $q^3+q^2+q+1$. If $q$ is odd, the minimum weight equals $q^3+2q^2+q+1$. For $q$ even, we also characterise the codewords of second smallest weight.</description>

      <title>$M$-ary partition polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M=(m_{i})_{i=0}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of integers such that $m_{0}=1$ and $m_{i}\geq 2$ for $i\geq 1$. In this paper we study $M$-ary partition polynomials $(p_{M}(n,t))_{n=0}^{\infty}$ defined as the coefficient in the following power series expansion: \begin{align*} \prod_{i=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{1-tq^{M_{i}}} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} p_{M}(n,t)q^{n}, \end{align*} where $M_{i}=\prod_{j=0}^{i}m_{j}$. In particular, we provide a detailed description of their rational roots and show, that all their complex roots have absolute values not greater than $2$. We also study arithmetic properties of $M$-ary partition polynomials. One of our main results says that if $n=a_{0}+a_{1}M_{1}+\cdots +a_{k}M_{k}$ is a (unique) representation such that $a_{j}\in\{0,\ldots ,m_{j+1}-1\}$ for every $j$, then \begin{align*} p_{M}(n,t)\equiv t^{a_{0}}\prod t^{a_{j}}f(a_{j}+1,t^{m_{j}-1}) \pmod{g_{k}(t)}, \end{align*} where $f(a,t):=\frac{t^{a}-1}{t-1}$ and $g_{k}(t):=\gcd \big(t^{m_{1}+m_{2}-1}f(m_{2},t^{m_{1}-1}),\ldots ,t^{m_{k}+m_{k+1}-1}f(m_{k+1},t^{m_{k}-1})\big)$. This is a polynomial generalisation of the well-known characterisation modulo $m$ of the sequence of $m$-ary partition.</description>

      <title>On rainbow domination of cubic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of minimal weight rainbow domination functions of cubic graphs are studied. Based on general observations for cubic graphs, generalized Petersen graphs $P(ck,k)$ are characterized whose 4- and 5-rainbow domination numbers equal the general lower bounds. As $t$-rainbow domination of cubic graphs for $t \ge 6$ is trivial, characterizations of such generalized Petersen graphs $P(ck,k)$ are known for all $t$-rainbow domination numbers.In addition, new upper bounds for 4- and 5-rainbow domination numbers that are valid for all $P(ck,k)$ are provided.</description>

      <title>Generalized paths and cycles in semicomplete multipartite digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known and easy to show that even the following version of the directed travelling salesman problem is NP-complete: Given a strongly connected complete digraph $D=(V,A)$, a cost function $w: A\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ and a natural number $K$; decide whether $D$ has a directed Hamiltonian cycle of cost at most $K$. We study the following variant of this problem for $\{0,1\}$-weighted semicomplete digraphs where the set of arcs which have cost 1 form a collection of vertex-disjoint complete digraphs. A digraph is \textbf{semicomplete multipartite} if it can be obtained from a semicomplete digraph $D$ by choosing a collection of vertex-disjoint subsets $X_1,\ldots{},X_c$ of $V(D)$ and then deleting all arcs both of whose end-vertices lie inside some $X_i$. Let $D$ be a semicomplete digraph with a cost function $w$ as above, where $w(a)=1$ precisely when $a$ is an arc inside one of the subsets $X_1,\ldots{},X_c$ and let $D^*$ be the corresponding \smd{} that we obtain by deleting all arcs inside the $X_i$'s. Then every cycle $C$ of $D$ corresponds to a {\bf generalized cycle} $C^g$ of $D^*$ which is either the cycle $C$ itself if $w(C)=0$ or a collection of two or more paths that we obtain by deleting all arcs of cost 1 on $C$. Similarly we can define a {\bf generalized path} $P^g$ in a semicomplete multipartite digraph. The purpose of this paper is to study structural and algorithmic properties of generalized paths and cycles in semicomplete multipartite digraphs. This allows us to identify classes of directed $\{0,1\}$-weighted TSP instances that can be solved in polynomial time as well as others for which we can get very close to the optimum in polynomial time. Along with these results we also show that two natural questions about properties of cycles meeting all partite sets in semicomplete multipartite digraphs are NP-complete.</description>

      <title>On the number of 8-cycles for two particular regular tournaments of order N with diametrically opposite local properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a regular tournament $T$ of order $n,$ denote by $c_{8}(T)$ the number of cycles of length $8$ in $T.$ Let $DR_{n}$ be a doubly-regular tournament of order $n\equiv 3\mod4$ (so, the out-sets and in-sets of its vertices are also regular and hence, contain the maximum possible number of cyclic triples) and $RLT_{n}$ be the unique regular locally transitive tournament of (odd) order $n$ (so, the out-sets and in-sets of its vertices are transitive and hence, contain no cyclic triples, at all). Some arguments based on the spectral properties of tournaments allow us to suggest that $c_{8}(T) \le c_{8}(RLT_{n}),$ where $n$ is sufficiently large. This restriction on $n$ is essential because our computer processing of B. McKay's file of tournaments implies that for $n=9,11,13,$ the maximum of $c_{8}(T)$ is attained at tournaments with regular structure of the out and in-sets of their vertices. In the present paper, we show that $c_{8}(DR_{n})$ does not depend on a particular choice of $DR_{n}$ and determine expressions for $c_{8}(DR_{n})$ and $c_{8}(RLT_{n}).$ They are both polynomials of degree $8$ in $n.$ Comparing $c_{8}(DR_{n})$ with $c_{8}(RLT_{n})$ yields the inequality $c_{8}(DR_{n})&gt;c_{8}(RLT_{n})$ for $11\le n\le 35,$ while $c_{8}(RLT_{n}) &gt; c_{8}(DR_{n})$ for $n\ge 39.$ This allows us to treat the value $n=39$ as the point of phase transition in the local properties of maximizers and minimizers of $c_{8}(T)$ in the class of regular tournaments of order $n.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G$, the $2$-distance graph, $D_2(G)$, is a graph with the vertex set $V(G)$ and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their distance is $2$ in the graph $G$. In this paper, for graphs $G$ with diameter 2, we show that $diam(D_2(G))$ can be any integer $t\geqslant2$. For graphs $G$ with $diam(G)\geqslant3$, we prove that $\frac{1}{2}diam(G)\leqslant diam(D_2(G))$ and this inequality is sharp. Also, for $diam(G)=3$, we prove that $diam(D_2(G))\leqslant5$ and this inequality is sharp.</description>

      <title>Tilings of Benzels via Generalized Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defant, Li, Propp, and Young recently resolved two enumerative conjectures of Propp concerning the tilings of regions in the hexagonal grid called benzels using two types of prototiles called stones and bones (with varying constraints on allowed orientations of the tiles). Their primary tool, a bijection called compression that converts certain $k$-ribbon tilings to $(k-1)$-ribbon tilings, allowed them to reduce their problems to the enumeration of dimers (i.e., perfect matchings) of certain graphs. We present a generalized version of compression that no longer relies on the perspective of partitions and skew shapes. Using this strengthened tool, we resolve three more of Propp's conjectures and recast several others as problems about perfect matchings.</description>

      <title>Quotients of M-convex sets and M-convex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unify the study of quotients of matroids, polymatroids, valuated matroids and strong maps of submodular functions in the framework of Murota's discrete convex analysis. As a main result, we compile a list of ten equivalent characterizations of quotients for M-convex sets, generalizing existing formulations for (poly)matroids and submodular functions. We also initiate the study of quotients of M-convex functions, constructing a hierarchy of four separate characterizations. Our investigations yield new insights into the fundamental operation of induction, as well as the structure of linking sets and linking functions, which are generalizations of linking systems and bimatroids.</description>

      <title>Towards a Stallings-type theorem for finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent development in graph theory is to study local separators, vertex sets that need not separate graphs globally but just locally. We use this idea to conjecture an extension of Stallings' theorem to finite nilpotent groups. We provide an example demonstrating that the assumption of nilpotency is necessary, and prove a stronger form of this conjecture for low connectivities, as follows.
  A finite nilpotent group that has a Cayley graph with a local separator of size at most two is cyclic, dihedral or a direct product of a cyclic group with the group of order two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the limit shape problem for the Plancherel measure and its generalizations found in supersymmetric gauge theory instanton count. We focus on the measure, interpolating between the Plancherel measure and uniform measure, a U(1) case of N=2* gauge theory. We give the formula for its limit shape in terms of elliptic functions, generalizing the trigonometric ``arcsin'' law of Vershik-Kerov and Logan-Schepp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that infinite cancellative finitely generated hyperbolic monoids never contain $\mathbb N\times\mathbb N$ as a submonoid but that they contain an element of infinite order and, if they are elementary, then they also contain a free monoid of rank at least 2. As a corollary we obtain that the latter have exponential growth. We prove these results by analysing the monoid of self-embeddings of hyperbolic digraphs and proving fixed-point theorems for them.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we give a characterization for homogeneous quandles with commutative inner automorphism groups. In particular, it is shown that such a quandle is expressed as an abelian extension of a trivial quandle.

      <description>arXiv:2403.07418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random matrices whose shape is the dilation $N\lambda$ of a self-conjugate Young diagram $\lambda$. In the large-$N$ limit, the empirical distribution of the squared singular values converges almost surely to a probability distribution $F^{\lambda}$. The moments of $F^{\lambda}$ enumerate two combinatorial objects: $\lambda$-plane trees and $\lambda$-Dyck paths, which we introduce and show to be in bijection. We also prove that the distribution $F^{\lambda}$ is algebraic, in the sense of Rao and Edelman. In the case of fat hook shapes we provide explicit formulae for $F^{\lambda}$ and we express it as a free convolution of two measures involving a Marchenko-Pastur and a Bernoulli distribution.</description>

      <title>Energy bounds for weighted spherical codes and designs via linear programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal bounds for the potential energy of weighted spherical codes are obtained by linear programming. The universality is in the sense of Cohn-Kumar -- every attaining code is optimal with respect to a large class of potential functions (absolutely monotone), in the sense of Levenshtein -- there is a bound for every weighted code, and in the sense of parameters (nodes and weights) -- they are independent of the potential function. We derive a necessary condition for optimality (in the linear programming framework) of our lower bounds which is also shown to be sufficient when the potential is strictly absolutely monotone. Bounds are also obtained for the weighted energy of weighted spherical designs. We explore our bounds for several previously studied weighted spherical codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signed graphs are an emergent way of representing data in a variety of contexts were conflicting interactions exist. These include data from biological, ecological, and social systems. Here we propose the concept of communicability geometry for signed graphs, proving that metrics in this space, such as the communicability distance and angles, are Euclidean and spherical. We then apply these metrics to solve several problems in data analysis of signed graphs in a unified way. They include the partitioning of signed graphs, dimensionality reduction, finding hierarchies of alliances in signed networks as well as the quantification of the degree of polarization between the existing factions in systems represented by this type of graphs.</description>

      <title>On Graph Grammars and Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph grammars form an interesting area of research because of their versatility in modelling diverse situations with graphs as the structures which are to be manipulated. A new class of graph grammars, nc-eNCE Graph Grammars has been introduced recently with an aim of restricting the order of application of graph production rules, thereby generating different graph classes using the same set of rules. On the other hand 2D game design using an algorithmic approach known as procedural content generation has been of interest recently. In this paper we modify the structure of nc-eNCE graph grammars with the aim of generating directed graphs. We show that employing these graph grammars simplifies the design of 2D games. We have also developed an algorithm which makes use of these graph grammars for generating random game level layouts ensuring that the players will get a different gaming experience each time they play.</description>

Abstract: We begin a systematic study of the region of possible values of the volumes of Minkowski subset sums of a collection of $M$ compact sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$, which we call the Lyusternik region, and make some first steps towards describing it. Our main result is that a fractional generalization of the Brunn-Minkowski-Lyusternik inequality conjectured by Bobkov et al. (2011) holds in dimension 1. Even though Fradelizi et al. (2016) showed that it fails in general dimension, we show that a variant does hold in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Steiner Cut Dominants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a subset T of nodes of an undirected graph G, a T-Steiner cut is a cut \delta(S) where S intersects both T and the complement of T. The T-Steiner cut dominant} of G is the dominant CUT_+(G,T) of the convex hull of the incidence vectors of the T-Steiner cuts of G. For T={s,t}, this is the well-understood s-t-cut dominant. Choosing T as the set of all nodes of G, we obtain the \emph{cut dominant}, for which an outer description in the space of the original variables is still not known. We prove that, for each integer \tau, there is a finite set of inequalities such that for every pair (G,T) with |T|\ &lt;= \tau the non-trivial facet-defining inequalities of CUT_+(G,T) are the inequalities that can be obtained via iterated applications of two simple operations, starting from that set. In particular, the absolute values of the coefficients and of the right-hand-sides in a description of CUT_+(G,T) by integral inequalities can be bounded from above by a function of |T|. For all |T| &lt;= 5 we provide descriptions of CUT_+(G,T) by facet defining inequalities, extending the known descriptions of s-t-cut dominants.</description>

      <title>An Alon-Tarsi Style Theorem for Additive Colorings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first give an alternative proof of the Alon-Tarsi list coloring theorem. We use the ideas from this proof to obtain the following result, which is an additive coloring analog of the Alon-Tarsi Theorem: Let $G$ be a graph and let $D$ be an orientation of $G$. We introduce a new digraph $\mathcal{W}(D)$, such that if the out-degree in $D$ of each vertex $v$ is $d_v$, and if the number of Eulerian subdigraphs of $\mathcal{W}(D)$ with an even number of edges differs from the number of Eulerian subdigraphs of $\mathcal{W}(D)$ with an odd number of edges, then for any assignment of lists $L(v)$ of $d_v+1$ positive integers to the vertices of $G$, there is an additive coloring of $G$ assigning to each vertex $v$ an element from $L(v)$. As an application, we prove an additive list coloring result for tripartite graphs $G$ such that one of the color classes of $G$ contains only vertices whose neighborhoods are complete.</description>

      <title>A spectral extremal problem on non-bipartite triangle-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theorem of Nosal and Nikiforov states that if $G$ is a triangle-free graph with $m$ edges, then $\lambda (G)\le \sqrt{m}$, where the equality holds if and only if $G$ is a complete bipartite graph. A well-known spectral conjecture of Bollob\'{a}s and Nikiforov [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 97 (2007)] asserts that if $G$ is a $K_{r+1}$-free graph with $m$ edges, then $\lambda_1^2(G) + \lambda_2^2(G) \le (1-\frac{1}{r})2m$. Recently, Lin, Ning and Wu [Combin. Probab. Comput. 30 (2021)] confirmed the conjecture in the case $r=2$. Using this base case, they proved further that $\lambda (G)\le \sqrt{m-1}$ for every non-bipartite triangle-free graph $G$, with equality if and only if $m=5$ and $G=C_5$. Moreover, Zhai and Shu [Discrete Math. 345 (2022)] presented an improvement by showing $\lambda (G) \le \beta (m)$, where $\beta(m)$ is the largest root of $Z(x):=x^3-x^2-(m-2)x+m-3$. The equality in Zhai--Shu's result holds only if $m$ is odd and $G$ is obtained from the complete bipartite graph $K_{2,\frac{m-1}{2}}$ by subdividing exactly one edge. Motivated by this observation, Zhai and Shu proposed a question to find a sharp bound when $m$ is even. We shall solve this question by using a different method and characterize three kinds of spectral extremal graphs over all triangle-free non-bipartite graphs with even size. Our proof technique is mainly based on applying Cauchy interlacing theorem of eigenvalues of a graph, and with the aid of a triangle counting lemma in terms of both eigenvalues and the size of a graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $i$-packing in a graph $G$ is a set of vertices that are pairwise distance more than $i$ apart. A \emph{packing colouring} of $G$ is a partition $X=\{X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{k}\}$ of $V(G)$ such that each colour class $X_{i}$ is an $i$-packing. The minimum order $k$ of a packing colouring is called the packing chromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\chi_{\rho}(G)$. In this paper we investigate the existence of trees $T$ for which there is only one packing colouring using $\chi_\rho(T)$ colours. For the case $\chi_\rho(T)=3$, we completely characterise all such trees. As a by-product we obtain sets of uniquely $3$-$\chi_\rho$-packable trees with monotone $\chi_{\rho}$-coloring and non-monotone $\chi_{\rho}$-coloring respectively.</description>

Abstract: The $r$-color size-Ramsey number of a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$, denoted by $\hat{R}_r(H)$, is the minimum number of edges in a $k$-uniform hypergraph $G$ such that for every $r$-coloring of the edges of $G$ there exists a monochromatic copy of $H$. In the case of $2$-uniform paths $P_n$, it is known that $\Omega(r^2n)=\hat{R}_r(P_n)=O((r^2\log r)n)$ with the best bounds essentially due to Krivelevich. In a recent breakthrough result, Letzter, Pokrovskiy, and Yepremyan gave a linear upper bound on the $r$-color size-Ramsey number of the $k$-uniform tight path $P_{n}^{(k)}$; i.e. $\hat{R}_r(P_{n}^{(k)})=O_{r,k}(n)$. Winter gave the first non-trivial lower bounds on the 2-color size-Ramsey number of $P_{n}^{(k)}$ for $k\geq 3$; i.e. $\hat{R}_2(P_{n}^{(3)})\geq \frac{8}{3}n-O(1)$ and $\hat{R}_2(P_{n}^{(k)})\geq \lceil\log_2(k+1)\rceil n-O_k(1)$ for $k\geq 4$.
  We consider the problem of giving a lower bound on the $r$-color size-Ramsey number of $P_{n}^{(k)}$ (for fixed $k$ and growing $r$). Our main result is that $\hat{R}_r(P_n^{(k)})=\Omega_k(r^kn)$ which generalizes the best known lower bound for graphs mentioned above. One of the key elements of our proof is a determination of the correct order of magnitude of the $r$-color size-Ramsey number of every sufficiently short tight path; i.e. $\hat{R}_r(P_{k+m}^{(k)})=\Theta_k(r^m)$ for all $1\leq m\leq k$.
  All of our results generalize to $\ell$-overlapping $k$-uniform paths $P_{n}^{(k, \ell)}$. In particular we note that when $1\leq \ell\leq \frac{k}{2}$, we have $\Omega_k(r^{2}n)=\hat{R}_r(P_{n}^{(k, \ell)})=O((r^2\log r)n)$ which essentially matches the best known bounds for graphs mentioned above. Additionally, in the case $k=3$, $\ell=2$, and $r=2$, we give a more precise estimate which implies $\hat{R}_2(P^{(3)}_{n})\geq \frac{28}{9}n-O(1)$, improving on the above-mentioned lower bound of Winter in the case $k=3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building sets were introduced in the study of wonderful compactifications of hyperplane arrangement complements and were later generalized to finite meet-semilattices. Convex geometries, the duals of antimatroids, offer a robust combinatorial abstraction of convexity. Supersolvable convex geometries and antimatroids appear in the study of poset closure operators, Coxeter groups, and matroid activities. We prove that the building sets on a finite meet-semilattice form a supersolvable convex geometry.</description>

      <title>Existence of a percolation threshold on finite transitive graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(G_n)$ be a sequence of finite connected vertex-transitive graphs with volume tending to infinity. We say that a sequence of parameters $(p_n)$ is a percolation threshold if for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the proportion $\left\lVert K_1 \right\rVert$ of vertices contained in the largest cluster under bond percolation $\mathbb{P}_p^G$ satisfies both \[ \begin{split}
  \lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{P}_{(1+\varepsilon)p_n}^{G_n} \left( \left\lVert K_1 \right\rVert \geq \alpha \right) &amp;= 1 \quad \text{for some $\alpha &gt; 0$, and}
  \lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{P}_{(1-\varepsilon)p_n}^{G_n} \left( \left\lVert K_1 \right\rVert \geq \alpha \right) &amp;= 0 \quad \text{for all $\alpha &gt; 0$}. \end{split}\] We prove that $(G_n)$ has a percolation threshold if and only if $(G_n)$ does not contain a particular infinite collection of pathological subsequences of dense graphs. Our argument uses an adaptation of Vanneuville's new proof of the sharpness of the phase transition for infinite graphs via couplings [Van22] together with our recent work with Hutchcroft on the uniqueness of the giant cluster [EH21].</description>

      <title>Tipsy cop and tipsy robber: collisions of biased random walks on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introduced by Harris, Insko, Prieto Langarica, Stoisavljevic, and Sullivan, the \emph{tipsy cop and drunken robber} is a variant of the cop and robber game on graphs in which the robber simply moves randomly along the graph, while the cop moves directed towards the robber some fixed proportion of the time and randomly the remainder. In this article, we adopt a slightly different interpretation of tipsiness of the cop and robber where we assume that in any round of the game there are four possible outcomes: a sober cop move, a sober robber move, a tipsy (uniformly random) move by the cop, and a tipsy (uniformly random) move by the robber. We study this tipsy cop and tipsy robber game on the infinite grid graph and on certain families of infinite trees including $\delta$-regular trees %infinite binary trees with an infinite path rooted at every vertex, and $\delta$-regular trees rooted to a $\Delta$-regular tree, where $\Delta \geq \delta$. Our main results analyze strategies for the cop and robber on these graphs. We conclude with some directions for further study.</description>

      <title>From approximate to exact integer programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximate integer programming is the following: For a convex body $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, either determine whether $K \cap \mathbb{Z}^n$ is empty, or find an integer point in the convex body scaled by $2$ from its center of gravity $c$. Approximate integer programming can be solved in time $2^{O(n)}$ while the fastest known methods for exact integer programming run in time $2^{O(n)} \cdot n^n$. So far, there are no efficient methods for integer programming known that are based on approximate integer programming. Our main contribution are two such methods, each yielding novel complexity results.
  First, we show that an integer point $x^* \in (K \cap \mathbb{Z}^n)$ can be found in time $2^{O(n)}$, provided that the remainders of each component $x_i^* \mod{\ell}$ for some arbitrarily fixed $\ell \geq 5(n+1)$ of $x^*$ are given. The algorithm is based on a cutting-plane technique, iteratively halving the volume of the feasible set. The cutting planes are determined via approximate integer programming. Enumeration of the possible remainders gives a $2^{O(n)}n^n$ algorithm for general integer programming. This matches the current best bound of an algorithm by Dadush (2012) that is considerably more involved. Our algorithm also relies on a new asymmetric approximate Carath\'eodory theorem that might be of interest on its own.
  Our second method concerns integer programming problems in equation-standard form $Ax = b, 0 \leq x \leq u, \, x \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ . Such a problem can be reduced to the solution of $\prod_i O(\log u_i +1)$ approximate integer programming problems. This implies, for example that knapsack or subset-sum problems with polynomial variable range $0 \leq x_i \leq p(n)$ can be solved in time $(\log n)^{O(n)}$. For these problems, the best running time so far was $n^n \cdot 2^{O(n)}$.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial generation via permutation languages. VI. Binary trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a notion of pattern avoidance in binary trees that generalizes the avoidance of contiguous tree patterns studied by Rowland and non-contiguous tree patterns studied by Dairyko, Pudwell, Tyner, and Wynn. Specifically, we propose algorithms for generating different classes of binary trees that are characterized by avoiding one or more of these generalized patterns. This is achieved by applying the recent Hartung-Hoang-M\"utze-Williams generation framework, by encoding binary trees via permutations. In particular, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between tree patterns and certain mesh permutation patterns. We also conduct a systematic investigation of all tree patterns on at most 5 vertices, and we establish bijections between pattern-avoiding binary trees and other combinatorial objects, in particular pattern-avoiding lattice paths and set partitions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectral properties of Andr\'asfai graphs, focusing on key parameters: the second-largest and smallest eigenvalues, the number of distinct eigenvalues, and the multiplicities of the eigenvalues 1 and -1. The results obtained reveal insights into the connectivity, the structural properties, and the spectral distinctiveness.</description>

      <title>Minimal doubling for small subsets in compact Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a sharp bound for the minimal doubling of a small measurable subset of a compact connected Lie group. Namely, let $G$ be a compact connected Lie group of dimension $d_G$, we show that for for all measurable subsets $A$, we have
$$\mu_G(A^2) \geq \left(2^{d_G-d_H} - C\mu_G(A)^{\frac{2}{d_G-d_H}}\right)\mu_G(A)$$
where $d_H$ is the maximal dimension of a proper closed subgroup $H$ and $C &gt; 0$ is a dimensional constant. This settles a conjecture of Breuillard and Green, and recovers and improves - with completely different methods - a recent result of Jing--Tran--Zhang corresponding to the case $G=SO_3(\mathbb{R})$. As is often the case, the above doubling inequality stems from a special case of general product-set estimates. We prove that for all $\epsilon &gt;0$ and for any pair of sufficiently small measurable subsets $A,B$ a Brunn--Minkowski-type inequality holds:
  $$ \mu_G(AB)^{\frac{1}{d_G-d_H}} \geq (1-\epsilon)\left( \mu_G(A)^{\frac{1}{d_G-d_H}} + \mu_G(B)^{\frac{1}{d_G-d_H}}\right).$$
  Going beyond the scope of the Breuillard--Green conjecture, we prove a stability result asserting that the only subsets with close to minimal doubling are essentially neighbourhoods of proper subgroups i.e. of the form
$$H_{\delta}:=\{g \in G: d(g,H)&lt;\delta\}$$
where $H$ denotes a proper closed subgroup of maximal dimension, $d$ denotes a bi-invariant distance on $G$ and $\delta &gt;0$.
  Our approach relies on a combination of two toolsets: optimal transports and its recent applications to the Brunn--Minkowski inequality, and the structure theory of compact approximate subgroups.</description>

      <title>On the topology of the moduli of tropical unramified $p$-covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of the moduli space of tropical unramified $\mathbb{Z}/p$-covers of tropical curves of genus $g \geq 2$ where $p$ is a prime number. We use recent techniques by Chan--Galatius--Payne to identify a contractible subcomplex of the moduli space. We then use this contractibility result to show that this moduli space is simply connected for all $g$ and $p$. In the case of genus $2$ we fully determine the homotopy type of this moduli space for all primes $p$. This work is motivated by prospective applications to the top-weight cohomology of the space of prime cyclic \'etale covers of smooth algebraic curves.</description>
