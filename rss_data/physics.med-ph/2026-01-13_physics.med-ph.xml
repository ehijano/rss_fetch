      <title>Critical Shortfall in NIH Support for Medical Physics Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report summarizes changes in federal research funding to the medical physics community between FY24 and FY25. By linking the AAPM membership database with NIH RePORTER records, we quantified the distribution of NIH funding for projects led by AAPM researchers. Although total NIH funding to AAPM members remained relatively stable across the two years, the composition of that funding shifted substantially. Competing (new and renewal) awards declined 50%, driven largely by an 80% collapse in new R01 grants from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). In contrast, noncompeting continuation awards increased by 10%, following a shift in how NIH funds multi-year projects. These changes occurred in the context of widespread disruptions to NIH review and grantmaking, including delayed study sections and more stringent administrative requirements. Federal funding is essential to sustaining innovation, supporting early-stage investigators, and ensuring that patients receive the best possible care. The trends identified here raise concerns about the long-term vitality and stability of the medical physics research pipeline.</description>

      <title>On optimization of Paganin's method for propagation-based X-ray phase-contrast imaging and tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paganin's method for image reconstruction in propagation-based phase-contrast X-ray imaging and tomography has enjoyed broad acceptance in recent years, with over one thousand publications citing its use. The present paper discusses approaches to optimization of the method with respect to simple image quality metrics, such as signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution, as well as a reference-based metric corresponding to the relative mean squared difference between the reconstructed image and the "ground truth" image that would be obtained in a setup with perfect spatial resolution and no noise. The problem of optimization of the intrinsic regularization parameter of Paganin's method with respect to spatial resolution in the reconstructed image is studied in detail. It is also demonstrated that a combination of Paganin's method with a Tikhonov-regularized deconvolution of the point-spread function of the imaging system can provide significantly higher image quality compared to the standard version of the method. Analytical expressions for some relevant image quality metrics are obtained and compared with results of numerical simulations. Advantages and shortcomings of optimization approaches using a number of different image quality metrics are discussed. The results of this study are expected to be useful in practical X-ray imaging and training of deep machine learning models for image denoising and segmentation.</description>

      <title>A Pilot Kinematic Study on the Forehand Reverse Flick: Feasibility of a Novel Short Return Technique in Table Tennis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background Following changes in table tennis ball materials, offensive returns have become more important for initiating sustained topspin offense. However, using the backhand flick (BF) to return forehand short balls often increases the difficulty of recovery and continuity, revealing a technical gap. This study preliminarily verified a novel forehand short return technique, the forehand reverse flick (FRF), and analyzed its similarities and differences with the BF. Methods Four elite athletes completed seven consecutive days of FRF specific training. Infrared motion capture and ultra-high-speed cameras were used to collect data on racket kinematics, movement duration, and ball performance. Results The success rate of the FRF increased steadily, reaching 86%. Racket trajectories of the two techniques were highly similar along the X (r = 1) and Y (r = 0.99) axes but differed along the Z (r = -0.04) axis. Racket and ball velocities were comparable between techniques, whereas the FRF showed lower resultant acceleration (approximately 265.57 m/s) and required about 0.03 s more for movement duration. Ball velocity was comparable between techniques, for the ball spin, the FRF generated lower spin (approximately 76.61 r/s) about 64% of the BF value (approximately 120.13 r/s). The highest participant mean spin rate reached 93 r/s, about 77% of the BF mean. Conclusion Overall, the FRF was found to have favorable learnability and training value, with potential for further optimization and competitive application.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the limitations of NMR Field Probes: A Novel Integrated Sensor Utilizing Pre-Polarization for (Ultra) Low Field MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains severely limited in low- and middle-income countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, despite rising rates of non-communicable diseases. Low-field MRI presents an affordable, locally developable diagnostic solution, but its performance is constrained by magnetic field instability. We present a novel NMR field probe designed to overcome these challenges using a rapid non-adiabatic switch-off of a pre-polarization field resulting in precessing spin magnetization. Achieved by first use of high-voltage silicon carbide transistors operating in controlled avalanche breakdown, it measures the Larmor frequency without prior field knowledge, unlike conventional probes. This capability is crucial during magnet development with often unknown fields, allowing early detection of magnet issues, and offering an urgently needed tool for magnet design and image-quality improvement. Validated from 1 mT to 45 mT (up to 1,000 times stronger than similar systems) its low-cost, modular design supports replication, upgrades, and enhanced field control, helping expand global MRI access.</description>

      <title>Standardized Images and Evaluation Metrics for Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in instrumentation and computation have enabled increasingly sophisticated tomographic reconstruction methods. However, existing evaluation practices -- often based on simple phantoms and global image metrics -- are limited in their ability to differentiate among modern high-fidelity reconstructions. A standardized, quantitative framework capable of revealing subtle yet meaningful differences is therefore required.
  We introduce such a framework, built upon two core components. The first is a set of four standardized reference images -- Source, Detector, Ideal, and Realistic -- each derived from physical modeling and representing a distinct stage in the imaging and reconstruction chain. The second is a suite of diagnostic and quantitative tools that remain sensitive in regimes where conventional metrics (e.g., SSIM, PSNR, NMSE, CC) tend to saturate. These include pixel-wise $\chi^2$ and difference maps, their quantitative characterization, spectral decomposition of intensity distributions, and Region-of-Interest (RoI)-based metrics.
  Application of this framework to MLEM and RISE-1 reconstructions using software phantoms demonstrates its ability to expose discrepancies that might elude detection by conventional global metrics. While developed in the context of SPECT, the methodology generalizes to other tomographic modalities, providing a reproducible, interpretable, and physically grounded basis for evaluating reconstruction fidelity in the high-performance regime.</description>

      <title>Fluoride doping into SiO2-MgO-CaO bioactive glass nanoparticles: bioactivity, biodegradation and biocompatibility assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, for the first time, the structure, bioactivity, biodegradation and biocompatibility of SiO2-MgO-CaO glasses doped with different levels of fluoride were studied. The glassy powder samples were synthesized by a coprecipitation method followed by calcination at 500 C, where amorphicity and fluoride incorporation were verified by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. The in vitro biomineralization and biodegradation of the samples were also investigated by electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. These assessments revealed that there is an optimum level of fluoride doping to meet the highest bioactivity. Remarkably, the same level of incorporation presented the foremost biocompatibility with respect to osteoblast-like MG-63 human cells, as realized by the MTT assay and cell attachment studies.</description>

      <title>Co-doping of silicate bioceramics as a potential strategy to further enhance mono-doping consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicate bioceramics have attracted significant attention in medical applications, particularly in hard tissue regeneration, because of their controllable chemical, physical, and biological functionalities, while ensuring biocompatibility. The coordination of silicate bioceramics with mono-dopants has been extensively studied to enhance their osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and antibacterial activity. However, the concept of employing dual or multiple co-doping to further enhance these biomaterials still demands more attention. This review paper originally focuses on the effect of chemical interactions among co-dopants and the principal constituents of the silicates, on the bio-behavior of these bioceramics. Additionally, future prospects of co-doped silicate bioceramics are outlined, including in vivo studies, clinical trials, and potential commercialization.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Design of a Simple Three-Sphere Magnetic Microswimmer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When swimming at low Reynolds numbers, inertial effects are negligible and reciprocal movements cannot induce net motion. Instead, symmetry breaking is necessary to achieve net propulsion. Directed swimming can be supported by magnetic fields, which simultaneously provide a versatile means of remote actuation. Thus, we analyze the motion of a straight microswimmer composed of three magnetizable beads connected by two elastic links. The swimming mechanism is based on oriented external magnetic fields that oscillate in magnitude. Through induced reversible hysteretic collapse of the two segments of the swimmer, the two pairs of beads jump into contact and separate nonreciprocally. Due to higher-order hydrodynamic interactions, net displacement results after each cycle. Different microswimmers can be tuned to different driving amplitudes and frequencies, allowing for simultaneous independent control by just one external magnetic field. The swimmer geometry and magnetic field shape are optimized for maximum swimming speed using an evolutionary optimization strategy. Thanks to the simple working principle, an experimental realization of such a microrobot seems feasible and may open new approaches for microinvasive medical interventions such as targeted drug delivery.</description>

      <title>A density functional theory study of amino acids on Mg and Mg-based alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnesium (Mg) has mechanical properties similar to bone tissue, and Mg ions take part in the metabolism. This makes Mg of interest for biocompatible degradable body implants, provided that its high corrosion rate can be inhibited. Slightly alloying Mg and adding surface coatings can slow down the corrosion processes without significantly changing the mechanical properties. Use of coating molecules that are native to the body increase the likelihood of making the surface biocompatible, for example by use of amino acids. We here present a density functional theory (DFT) study of the adsorption on Mg(0001) of the amino acids glycine, L-proline, and L-hydroxyproline (Hyp), the main amino acid content of collagen. We investigate how binding of the functional groups of Hyp are affected when Mg(0001) is slightly alloyed with zinc, lithium or aluminium, and we also model the immersion of the systems in a water environment to see how this affects the binding.</description>

      <title>Volumetric ultrasound imaging with a sparse matrix array and integrated fiber-optic sensing for robust needle tracking in interventional procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate visualization of interventional devices, such as medical needles, is essential for the safe and effective guidance of minimally invasive procedures. Ultrasound (US) imaging is widely used for needle guidance, but the two-dimensional nature of most clinical probes limits accurate three-dimensional (3D) localization, particularly of the needle tip. We present a novel system that integrates volumetric US imaging with 3D needle tracking by combining a fiber-optic hydrophone embedded in the needle and a sparse spiral US array. Real-time volumetric imaging was achieved using plane-wave techniques, while precise needle tip tracking was enabled through communication between the probe and hydrophone. The feasibility of the approach was demonstrated using a nerve block training phantom. This proof-of-concept system enables simultaneous volumetric anatomical imaging and 3D needle tip tracking, with strong potential to enhance the efficacy and safety of image-guided interventional procedures.</description>

      <title>A primer on treatment planning aspects for temporally modulated pulsed radiation therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporally modulated pulsed radiotherapy (TMPRT) delivers conventional fraction doses of radiation using temporally separated pulses of low doses (&lt;30 cGy) yielding fraction-effective dose rates of around 6.7 cGy/min with the goal to exploit tumor radiation hypersensitivity, which was observed in both, preclinical models and in human clinical trials. To facilitate TMPRT, volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and 3D-CRT planning techniques were developed following the guidelines of the proposed NRG CC-017 trial. Plans were evaluated with respect to homogeneity, conformality, and adherence to dose constraints. Deliverability of plans was assessed using in-phantom measurements for absorbed dose accuracy at low dose rates and using EPID for isodose verification. For VMAT only single arc plans were found to be acceptable due to otherwise unacceptably heterogeneous field doses, while for dynamic conformal arcs machine limtations on the number of monitor units per degree require the use of partial arcs for each pulse. Delivery of plans at low dose rates (&lt; 100 MU/min) was accurate with high Gamma pass rates on modern LINACs and moderate pass rates on legacy LINACs, in line with their general performance. Generally, VMAT is preferred to achieve optimal homogeneity, conformality, and organ-at-risk sparing, while the use of 3D-CRT can increase the availability of TMPRT for more patients and clinics.</description>
