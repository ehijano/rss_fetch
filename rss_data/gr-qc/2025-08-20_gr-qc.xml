      <title>Phase Transitions of Electromagnetically Charged Black Holes in Lovelock Gravity with Nonconstant Curvature Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the most general class of charged black hole solutions in third-order Lovelock gravity within even-dimensional spacetimes in the presence of an electromagnetic field. These solutions feature nonconstant-curvature horizons that affect geometry when n&gt;=8. The near-origin behavior of the metric reveals a timelike singularity for electrically charged cases, in contrast to the spacelike singularity found in the uncharged case. We investigate thermodynamic stability in both the grand canonical and canonical ensembles. In the grand canonical ensemble, stability is determined by the positivity of both the Hessian determinant and the temperature. In the canonical ensemble, the sign of the heat capacity governs stability. We identify both first- and second-order phase transitions, including a van der Waals-like behavior characterized by instability at intermediate black hole sizes. Our results reveal a rich phase structure influenced by Lovelock corrections and electromagnetic fields, and demonstrate how conserved charges affect black hole evaporation and stabilization.</description>

      <title>Testing the Generalized Second Law in $(2+1)$-Dimensional Cosmology: Holographic Entropy Bounds and Observational Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the validity of the Generalized Second Law (GSL) of thermodynamics in a $(2+1)$-dimensional holographic cosmological model with a negative cosmological constant. Adopting a horizon thermodynamics framework, we examine two prominent entropy bounds, the Fischler--Susskind (FS) bound and the Hubble Entropy (HE) bound, in both expanding and contracting universes, including the effects of quantum entropy corrections. Our theoretical analysis shows that the FS bound is intrinsically incompatible with the GSL in contracting $(2+1)$-dimensional universes, regardless of spatial curvature or exotic matter content, and that this incompatibility persists even when quantum corrections are considered. In contrast, the HE bound is consistent with the GSL in expanding universes under classical conditions and can also be reconciled in certain contracting scenarios when quantum effects are included. To complement the theoretical study, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Cosmic Chronometer (CC), and Hubble parameter datasets to constrain the model parameters. The best-fit results reveal good cross-dataset consistency, with the cosmological constant parameter $\psi$ remaining stable across all probes. These findings identify the HE bound as a more robust candidate for holographic constraints in lower-dimensional cosmology, while demonstrating the limitations of the FS bound. Our results not only clarify the status of the GSL in $(2+1)$-dimensional settings but also provide a framework for testing entropy bounds with future high-precision cosmological data.</description>

      <title>A proof of the reverse isoperimetric inequality using a geometric-analytic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first proof of the reverse isoperimetric inequality for black holes in arbitrary dimension using a two-pronged geometric-analytic approach. The proof holds for compact Riemannian hypersurfaces in AdS space and seems to be a generic property of black holes in the extended phase space formalism. Using Euclidean gravitational action, we show that, among all hypersurfaces of given volume, the round sphere in the $D$-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space maximizes the area (and hence the entropy). This analytic result is supported by a geometric argument in a $1+1+2$ decomposition of spacetime: gravitational focusing enforces a strictly negative conformal deformation, and the Sherif-Dunsby rigidity theorem then forces the deformed 3-sphere to be isometric to the round 3-sphere, establishing the round sphere as the extremal surface, in fact, a maximally entropic surface. Our work establishes that the reversal of the usual isoperimetric inequality occurs due to the structure of the curved background governed by Einstein's equation, underscoring the role of gravity in the reverse isoperimetric inequality for black hole horizons in AdS space.</description>

      <title>Modified cosmology through generalized mass-to-horizon entropy: observational constraints from DESI DR2 BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized mass-to-horizon entropy has recently been proposed as an extension of the Bekenstein-Hawking area law, derived from a modified mass-horizon relation constructed to ensure consistency with the Clausius equation. Within the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture, this entropy formulation yields modified Friedmann equations, which recover the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology in the appropriate limit of the model's two free parameters. In the present study, we constrain this framework using observations from TypeIa supernovae (SNIa), cosmic chronometers (CC) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO, including DESI~DR2), together with the SH0ES distance-ladder prior on $H_0$, across four combinations of data sets. Although the extended entropic scenario yields a slightly better, or statistically comparable, fit to the data, model selection via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) mildly favors the cosmological constant as the dark energy candidate. Moreover, the $\Lambda$CDM limit lies within $\sim 1\sigma$ of our constraints, indicating no significant deviation from standard cosmology with current data.</description>

      <title>Listening to black mirrors with gravitational radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of curvature singularities and the information and firewall paradoxes are significant problems for the conventional black hole model. The black mirror hypothesis provides a CPT-symmetric alternative to the classical description of black hole, offering a novel solution to these long-standing issues. We show that classical black holes can, in principle, be distinguished from black mirrors observationally, by using gravitational waves. The principal challenge is to identify a unique, testable signature of the black mirror's reflective horizon that can be detected by current or future observatories. The horizon singularity of the black mirror model necessitates that no energy flux is propagated beyond the horizon, which can be described effectively by imposing specific boundary conditions at the event horizon. Our analysis demonstrates that the quasi-normal mode spectrum of the black mirror is fundamentally different from that of classical black holes, as purely ingoing modes are forbidden. Moreover, we show that the reflectivity of the black mirror does not depend on any free parameter; it is given precisely by the Boltzmann factor, which is independent of the dissipation parameter, indicating a universal behaviour regardless of the specific underlying quantum dynamics at the horizon. A definitive detection of the predicted gravitational wave echoes would provide compelling evidence distinguishing the reflective boundary of a black mirror from the perfectly absorbing horizon of a classical black hole. Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are ideal probes for this test, as their long-duration signals allow for the secular accumulation of these faint echoes, offering a concrete pathway to challenge the classical paradigm and revolutionise our understanding of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Compact stars in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity: regular and divergent scalar field configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate static, spherically symmetric solutions in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity non-minimally coupled to a massless real scalar field, both in vacuum and in the presence of fermionic matter. Focusing on a specific quadratic scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling, we identify two distinct classes of compact objects: one with a regular scalar field at the origin -- connected to general relativity in an appropriate limit -- and another {one} with a divergent scalar field at the origin but a regular geometry. We analyze both purely scalar and matter-supported (hybrid) configurations, showing that the former can describe a broad class of compact objects, while the latter can reproduce neutron star-like masses even when modeled with a simple polytropic equation of state. Furthermore, we highlight distinctive phenomenological signatures, including the ability of these stars to exceed known compactness limits and their potential to act as gravitational wave super-emitters. We also examined the motion of test particles non-minimally coupled to the scalar field and showed the existence of stable circular orbits within the Schwarzschild's ISCO and static configurations at finite radii for particles with zero angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Emergent Turbulence in Nonlinear Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravity in nonlinear and dynamical regimes underpins spectacular astrophysical phenomena and observable consequences, from the early universe to black hole collisions. In these extreme environments, inverse energy cascades - mediated by nonlinear interactions - may help explain the near scale-invariance of cosmic structure and the simplicity of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Yet the presence, characteristics, and generality of such interactions in full General Relativity remain largely unexplored. Here we show that two types of nonlinear interactions - a four-mode and a three-mode interaction - emerge in the fully nonlinear regime, and can indeed channel inverse energy cascades by inducing resonant and anti-damping instabilities. This establishes what was previously only hinted at in highly specialized perturbative contexts. We further demonstrate a ``laminar'' to ``turbulent'' transition for the largest-possible angular structure in General Relativity, whereas finer structures remain persistently turbulent. Our results reveal the impact and generality of these nonlinear interactions (instabilities), which can be key to understanding observations ranging from cosmological to kilometer scales. We anticipate that our work will shed new light on nonlinear gravitational phenomena and their consequences, such as constructing gravitational wave templates and testing General Relativity in the most extreme regime. Moreover, our work is a starting point for addressing nonlinear gravitational interactions using ideas and methods inspired by fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Shadow of a nonlinear electromagnetic generalized Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the shadow properties of the Kerr-Newman-Anti-de Sitter black hole coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics. We construct the shadow by employing the celestial coordinate approach for observers located at finite distances, accounting for the non-asymptotically flat nature of the spacetime. The size, distortion, area, and oblateness of the shadow are analyzed in terms of the black hole parameters, including the spin, effective charge, and nonlinearity parameter. We further explore observational constraints using the Event Horizon Telescope results for M87* and Sgr~A*. The angular diameters inferred from the observed images allow us to bound the parameter space of the model, showing that both spin and nonlinearity play key roles in shaping the shadow and in restricting the effective charge. Additionally, we examine the energy emission rate derived from the shadow radius and Hawking temperature, highlighting the influence of rotation and nonlinear electrodynamics on black hole evaporation. Our results demonstrate that the black hole model provides a physically consistent and observationally viable extension of the standard Kerr paradigm, with potential implications for near-horizon quantum processes and tests of gravity beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Long-lived quasinormal modes in the Euler-Heisenberg electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the precise Leaver method and time-domain integration, we analyze the quasinormal modes and late-time behavior of massive neutral and charged scalar fields in the background of a charged, asymptotically flat black hole in the presence of Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electrodynamics. We show that as the field mass increases, the damping rate decreases significantly, approaching arbitrarily long-lived states known as quasi-resonances. However, these modes cannot be identified in time-domain profiles due to the dominance of asymptotic tails in this regime, which decay slowly and exhibit oscillations with a power-law envelope. We observe that a larger field charge leads to a significantly higher quality factor, as it increases the oscillation frequency while reducing the damping rate.</description>

      <title>MaxWave: Rapid Maximum Likelihood Wavelet Reconstruction of Non-Gaussian features in Gravitational Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in the sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors have increased the detection rate of transient astrophysical signals. We improve the existing BayesWave initialization algorithm and present a rapid, low-latency approximate maximum likelihood solution for reconstructing non-Gaussian features. We include three enhancements: (1) using a modified wavelet basis to eliminate redundant inner product calculations; (2) shifting from traditional time-frequency-quality factor (TFQ) wavelet transforms to time-frequency-time extent (TF$\tau$) transforms to optimize wavelet subtractions; and (3) implementing a downsampled heterodyned wavelet transform to accelerate initial calculations. Our model can be used to de-noise long-duration signals, which include the stochastic gravitational-wave background from numerous unresolved sources and continuous wave signals from isolated sources such as rotating neutron stars. Through our model, we can also aid machine learning applications that aim to classify and understand glitches by providing non-whitened, time and frequency domain, Gaussian-noise-free reconstructions of any glitch.</description>

      <title>Prospects for the formation of GW231123 from the AGN channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent binary black hole (BBH) merger GW231123 consisted of the merger of two intermediate mass black holes (IMBH) which appear to have large spin magnitudes. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are very promising environments for IMBH mergers and growth due to high escape velocities. Here we demonstrate how GW231123 can be produced in the AGN channel. Using the McFACTS code, we explore the impact of various choices of the black hole (BH) initial mass function (IMF) on predicted mass and spin magnitudes of BBH mergers from the AGN dynamical formation channel. By integrating the likelihood function for GW231123 with the detectable BBH population predicted from AGN using McFACTS, we demonstrate that GW231123 is consistent with a dynamical BBH merger from the AGN channel. We also postulate that the masses and spin magnitudes of GW231123 are most consistent with a merger of fourth and third generation BHs, for most choices of a segregated BH IMF and AGN lifetime.</description>

      <title>The trace of field equations for higher-derivative gravity and an equality associating the Lagrangian density with a divergence term</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We figure out the explicit expression for the trace of the field equations associated to higher derivative theories of gravity endowed with Lagrangians depending upon the metric and its Riemann tensor, together with arbitrary order covariant derivatives of the Riemann tensor. Then an equality linking the Lagrangian density with the divergence of a vector field is proposed under a constraint on the Lagrangian density. As a significant application, we further obtain an equality to establish the relationship between the divergence of a vector field and the Lagrangian density consisting of the contraction of the product for metric tensors with the product of the Riemann tensors and the arbitrary order covariant derivatives of the Riemann tensor.</description>

      <title>Effects of non-minimal scalar field couplings with curvature tensors on perturbations in non-commutative Schwarzschild spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comparative analysis of the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of scalar field perturbations in the non-commutative Schwarzschild black hole spacetime, focusing on two different non-minimal curvature couplings: in the first case the scalar field is coupled to the Ricciscalar while in the second the field's derivatives are coupled to the Einstein tensor. These couplings are important in the cosmological modified gravity models and low energy effects of perturbative quantum gravity. It is shown that though the QNM spectra in two models are approximately the same at low overtone numbers, particularly at fundamental modes, they behave characteristically at higher overtones. Time-domain profiles confirm that while the decay rates are predominantly controlled by the near-horizon physics, the oscillation frequencies distinctly reflect the nature of the curvature couplings. In brief, the kind of scalar-interaction affects the spectral and dynamical characteristics of perturbations especially in the high-frequency regime.</description>

      <title>Discriminating scalar ultralight dark matter from quasi-monochromatic gravitational waves in LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scalar ultralight dark matter (ULDM) candidate would induce oscillatory motion of freely falling test masses via its coupling to Standard Model fields. Such oscillations would create an observable Doppler shift of light exchanged between the test masses, and in particular would be visible in space-based gravitational waves (GW) detectors, such as LISA. While this kind of detection has been proposed multiple times in the recent years, we numerically investigate if it is possible to extract a scalar ULDM signal in a space-based GW detector, and in particular how to differentiate such a signal from a GW signal. Using one year of realistic orbits for the LISA spacecrafts and Bayesian methods, we find that LISA will indeed be able to discriminate between the two signals.</description>

      <title>Pseudospectrum and time-domain analysis of the EFT corrected black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the linear perturbations of a spherically symmetric black hole corrected by dimension-6 terms in EFT of gravity. The solution is asymptotically flat and characterized by two parameters -- a mass parameter $M$ and a dimensionless parameter $\varepsilon$ related to the EFT length scale $l$, and the perturbation equation incorporates a velocity factor which is not constant. The quasinormal modes (QNMs) and time-domain waveforms are studied within the hyperboloidal framework. This approach reproduces the breakdown of the isospectrality and reveals that higher overtones are more sensitive to $\varepsilon$. As for the time domain, the mismatch function is introduced and found to scale as $\varepsilon^2$, which demonstrates that the waveform is stable as $\varepsilon$ varies. Finally, a velocity-dependent energy norm is employed to compute the pseudospectrum and characterize the migration of the QNM spectrum. We further define a quantity $\epsilon_c$ that describes the magnitude of the instability of a QNM spectrum. Our analysis reveals that the dependence of $\epsilon_c$ on $\varepsilon$ is complicated -- it may increase, decrease or even be non-monotonic.</description>

      <title>Role of Non-conserved Gravity Theory and Electric Charge in Constructing Complexity-free Stellar Models: A Novel Approach under Non-minimal Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the application of complexity factor within the context of Rastall gravity, exploring its implications on a static spacetime admitting spherical symmetry associated with anisotropic fluids under an electromagnetic field. The field equations are derived for a static charged sphere that provides a foundational framework for analyzing gravitational effects in this non-conserved theory. The mass function is formulated by incorporating both fluid and geometric parameters, offering insights into how mass distribution affects spacetime curvature. Through orthogonal decomposition of the Riemann tensor, a set of scalar quantities is obtained, referred to the structure scalars, which serve as indicators of celestial complexity. One specific scalar is then specified as the complexity factor, i.e., $\mathbb{Y}_{TF}$, facilitating further analysis on its role in characterizing complex systems. The presence of unknowns in gravitational equations necessitates the imposition of constraints to facilitate their solution. To address this, $\mathbb{Y}_{TF}=0$ alongside three distinct conditions are employed which yield diverse stellar models. A comprehensive graphical analysis is conducted using multiple values of the Rastall and charge parameters. Notably, the findings of this study align with those predicted by Einstein's theory. More appealingly, the Rastall theory demonstrates its superiority in the presence of charge under model 2 when it is compared with the general theory of relativity.</description>

      <title>Hunting for new glitches in LIGO data using community science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data from ground-based gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO contain many types of noise. Glitches are short bursts of non-Gaussian noise that may hinder our ability to identify or analyse gravitational-wave signals. They may have instrumental or environmental origins, and new types of glitches may appear following detector changes. The Gravity Spy project studies glitches and their origins, combining insights from volunteers on the community-science Zooniverse platform with machine learning. Here, we study volunteer proposals for new glitch classes, discussing links between these glitches and the state of the detectors, and examining how new glitch classes pose a challenge for machine-learning classification. Our results demonstrate how Zooniverse empowers non-experts to make discoveries, and the importance of monitoring changes in data quality in the LIGO detectors.</description>

      <title>Searching for continuous gravitational waves in the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from an all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive binary black holes using the third data release (DR3) of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA). Even though we recover a common-spectrum stochastic process, potentially induced by a nanohertz gravitational wave background, we find no evidence of continuous waves. Therefore, we place upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude: in the most sensitive frequency range around 10 nHz, we obtain a sky-averaged 95\% credibility upper limit of $\approx 7 \times 10^{-15}$. Our search is sensitive to supermassive binary black holes with a chirp mass of $\geq 10^9M_{\odot}$ up to a luminosity distance of 50 Mpc for our least sensitive sky direction and 200 Mpc for the most sensitive direction. This work provides at least 4 times better sensitivity in the 1-200 nHz frequency band than our last search based on the PPTA's first data release. We expect that PPTA will continue to play a key role in detecting continuous gravitational waves in the exciting era of nanohertz gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Parameter constraints on Horndeski rotating black hole through quasiperiodic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform small perturbations around the circular timelike orbit in the equatorial plane of the Horndeski rotating black hole, and analyze the effects of Horndeski hair on the three fundamental frequencies of the epicyclic oscillations. Since this operation can model the quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) phenomena of the surrounding accretion disc, we then employ the MCMC simulation to fit the theoretical results with three QPO events, including GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859+226 and H1743-322, and constrain the characteristic radius $r$, black hole mass $M$ and spinning parameter $a$, and the Horndeski hair parameter $h$. Our constraint on the Horndeski hair parameter is much tighter than QPOs simulation from the existed accretion models, suggesting slight deviation from classical Kerr black hole.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytic studies of accretion disk and magnetic field geometry in M87*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Magnetic fields play a pivotal role in dynamics of black hole accretion flows and formation of relativistic jets. Observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provided unprecedented insights into accretion structures near black holes. Interpreting these observations requires a theoretical framework linking polarized emission to underlying system properties and magnetic field geometries. Aims: We investigate how system properties, particularly magnetic field geometry in the event horizon scale region, influence the structure of the observable synchrotron emission in M87*. Specifically, we aim to quantify the sensitivity of observables used by the EHT to black hole spin, plasma dynamics, accretion disk thickness, and magnetic field geometry. Methods: We adopt a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient accretion flow model in Kerr spacetime. We vary magnetic field geometry, black hole spin, accretion disk dynamics, and geometric thickness of the disk. We perform general relativistic ray tracing with a full polarized radiative transfer to obtain synthetic images of M87*. We extract EHT observables, such as disk diameter, asymmetry, and polarimetric metrics from synthetic models. We also consider a number of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations and compare them with the semi-analytical models. Results: We see limited impact of the disk thickness on observables. On the other hand, toroidal field dominated and poloidal field dominated magnetic configurations can be distinguished reliably. The flow dynamics, in particular presence of radial inflow, also significantly impacts the EHT observables. Conclusions: The M87* system is most consistent with a poloidal magnetic field dominated flow with partially radial inflow. While the spin remain elusive, moderate or large positive values are preferred.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new way of generating the quantum geometric phase by making the initial base state index dependent on space-time curvature. We prove that the resulting Schr\"odinger equation is identical to the trace form of the Einstein gravitational field equations when we are in the adiabatic approximation. This particular initial condition was proposed in a previous work by the author.</description>

      <title>From Wide Triples to UCXBs: Multimessenger Detection of Dynamically-formed Black Hole-White Dwarf Systems with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) are a subclass of low-mass X-ray binaries characterized by tight orbits and degenerate donors, which pose significant challenges to our understanding of their formation. Recent discoveries of black hole (BH) candidates with main-sequence (MS) or red giant (RG) companions suggest that BH-white dwarf (BH-WD) binaries are common in the Galactic field. Motivated by these observations and the fact that most massive stars are born in triples, we show that wide BH-WD systems can naturally form UCXBs through the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. Notably, EKL-driven eccentricity excitations combined with gravitational wave (GW) emission and WD dynamical tides can effectively shrink and circularize the orbit, leading to mass-transferring BH-WD binaries. These systems represent promising multimessenger sources in both X-ray and GW observations. Specifically, we predict that the wide triple channel can produce $\sim5-45$ ($\sim1-8$) detectable UCXBs in the Milky Way (Andromeda galaxy), including $\sim1$ system observable by the mHz GW detection of LISA. If the final WD mass can reach sufficiently small values, this channel could contribute up to $\sim 10^3$ UCXBs in the Galaxy. Furthermore, the identification of tertiary companions in observed UCXBs would provide direct evidence for this formation pathway and yield unique insights into their dynamical origins.</description>

      <title>Triples as Links between Binary Black Hole Mergers, their Electromagnetic Counterparts, and Galactic Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a formation pathway linking black holes (BHs) observed in gravitational-wave (GW) mergers, wide BH-stellar systems uncovered by Gaia, and accreting low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). In this scenario, a stellar-mass BH binary undergoes isolated binary evolution and merges while hosting a distant, dynamically unimportant tertiary stellar companion. The tertiary becomes relevant only after the merger, when the remnant BH receives a GW recoil kick. Depending on the kick velocity and system configuration, the outcome can be: (i) a bright electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to the GW merger; (ii) an LMXB; (iii) a wide BH-stellar companion resembling the Gaia BH population; or (iv) an unbound, isolated BH. Modeling the three-body dynamics, we find that $\sim 0.02\%$ of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) mergers may be followed by an EM counterpart within $\sim$10 days, produced by tidal disruption of the star by the BH. The flare is likely brightest in the optical-UV and lasts days to weeks; in some cases, partial disruption causes recurring flares with a period of $\sim$2 months. We further estimate that this channel can produce $\sim 1-10\%$ of Gaia BH systems in the Milky Way. This scenario provides the first physically motivated link between GW sources, Gaia BHs, and some X-ray binaries, and predicts a rare but robust pathway for EM counterparts to binary BH mergers, potentially detectable in LVK's O5 run.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new large $N$ limit which at the extreme limit is dual in the bulk to a back-reacted traversable wormhole, by making use if a novel definition of algebra at infinity, an algebra familiar in the literature from the study of quasi-local algebras. We also compute, from a purely algebraic perspective, the effects registered by a left universe observer due to a unitary fluctuation on the right universe of the traversable wormhole, and reproduce a result from an earlier computation by Maldacena, Stanford and Yang \cite{Maldacena:2017axo}.</description>

      <title>HBAR entropy in causal diamond geometry: A near-horizon perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we extend the Horizon Brightened Acceleration Radiation (HBAR) framework to the causal diamond (CD) spacetime. We study a cloud of two-level atoms, injected at random times in the asymptotic past of the CD, freely falling toward its causal horizon and emitting scalar radiation via a weak dipole coupling to a quantum field. In the near-horizon region, an emergent conformal symmetry-captured by conformal quantum mechanics (CQM)-governs the field dynamics and allows analytic control of the emission process. We find that the radiation spectrum is thermal, with temperature $T_D = 1/(\pi\alpha)$, and that the associated von Neumann entropy flux reproduces the entropy production of the radiation field. These results demonstrate that the causal horizons of the CD spacetime effectively act as a topological thermal reservoir, with thermal properties arising entirely from the global causal structure rather than from underlying microscopic degrees of freedom, highlighting that the validity of the HBAR framework is fundamentally tied to the existence of causal horizons, independent of the presence of a black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in previously unexplored regimes. It also opens the possibility of probing the interface between QM and GR, such as testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several approaches are being explored, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds with embedded spins as test particles which, in combination with Stern-Gerlach forces, enable the realization of a closed-loop matter-wave interferometer in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. Here we discuss the design considerations for a high-precision enhanced-coherence nanodiamond source, review the fabrication processes used to produce nanodiamond pillars measuring 40 x 65 x 80 nm, summarize the characterization work completed to date, and conclude with an outlook on the remaining steps needed to finalize the source fabrication. We would be happy to make available more details upon request.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in completely new regimes, as well as the interface between QM and GR, e.g., testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several paths are being pursued, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds (NDs) as our particle, and a spin embedded in the ND together with Stern-Gerlach forces, to achieve a closed loop in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes) to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. Here, we present a theoretical study concerning the impact of rotations of the ND on the interferometric contrast. We have previously shown that for a first-generation Stern-Gerlach interferometer with an ND composed of 10^7 atoms, it is sufficient to cool the center of mass to milli-Kelvin temperatures. In this work, we similarly show that rotation does not have to be cooled to the ground state, and cooling to hundreds of rotational phonons is good enough. We describe and simulate parametric feedback cooling of librational modes of a charged ND levitated in a Paul trap. The cooling is performed by modulating the electric field of the trap. We examine the dependence of the efficiency of cooling on the electric potential and the shape of the object. We show that the required libration temperatures should be within reach in the very near future. We would be happy to make more details available upon request.</description>

      <title>Lense-Thirring precession of accretion flows: relativistic versus classical precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vertical (Lense-Thirring) precession of the innermost accretion flows has been discussed as a sensitive indicator of the rotational properties of neutron stars (NSs) and their equation of state because it vanishes for a non-rotating star. In this work, we apply the Hartle-Thorne spacetimes to study the frequencies of the precession for both geodesic and non-geodesic (fluid) flows. We build on previous findings on the effect of the NS quadrupole moment, which revealed the importance of the interplay between the relativistic and classical precession. Because of this interplay, the widely used Lense-Thirring metric, linear in the NS angular momentum, is insufficient to calculate the behaviour of the precession frequency across an astrophysically relevant range of NS angular momentum values. We find that even for a moderately oblate NSs, the dependencies of the precession frequency on the NS angular momentum at radii within the innermost accretion region have maxima that occur at relatively low values of the NS angular momentum. We conclude that very different groups of accreting NSs, slow and fast rotators, can display the same precession frequencies. This may explain the lack of evidence for a correlation between the frequencies of the observed low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations and the NS spin. In our work, we provide a full, general description of precession behaviour, and also examples that assume specific NS and quark star (MIT bag) equation of state. Our calculations are reproducible using the associated Wolfram Mathematica notebook.</description>

      <title>Foliations by critical surfaces of the Hawking energy in asymptotically flat initial data sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Area-constrained critical surfaces for the Hawking quasi-local energy ("Hawking surfaces") provide a natural setting for that energy: they enjoy positivity and rigidity properties. We construct large-scale foliations at infinity by Hawking surfaces in asymptotically Schwarzschild initial data sets. Using a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction within a Willmore-foliation framework, we prove existence and uniqueness of the foliation and study its coordinate center. Under the dominant energy condition, we show that along the leaves of the foliation, the Hawking energy is positive and converges to the ADM energy in the large-sphere limit; moreover, subject to an explicit integral constraint, it is monotone along the foliation. Under weaker assumptions we construct an on-center family of Hawking surfaces that, while not necessarily a foliation, still enjoys positivity and the large-sphere limit. Finally, we obtain a rigidity statement and verify that our hypotheses hold in a broad class of data, initial data sets with harmonic or York asymptotics, thereby demonstrating the robustness of Hawking surfaces as a quasi-local energy tool in dynamical spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we discuss the issue of localization of $N=2$ spinning particles. More specifically, we show that we can not confine the spinning particle within the Randall-Sundrum scenario. We argue that this result directly affects studies related to localization of $p$-form fields. We show that, due to the non confinement of the superparticle, we can not localize $p$-forms on the membrane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a three-dimensional bi-vector-tensor theory of the generalized Proca class by regularizing the Gauss-Bonnet invariant within the Weyl geometry. We show that the theory admits a regular AdS$_3$ black hole solution with primary hairs. Introducing a deformation in the theory, a different regular AdS$_3$ black hole solution is obtained. Charged generalizations of these solutions are given by coupling to Born-Infeld electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Causality of brane universe via the general bulk-based formalisms with the non-zero Schwarzschild mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In brane-world scenarios, electromagnetic waves (EMWs) are confined to the brane, while gravitational waves (GWs) can propagate through the bulk spacetime. This fundamental difference has been exploited in multiple cosmological studies to address some issues, such as the well-known horizon problem. This paper reinvestigates the problem using general bulk-based formalisms, with specific focus on how the non-zero Schwarzschild mass modifies geodesic motion. Our results demonstrate that the Schwarzschild mass significantly modifies the gravitational-to-photon horizon ratio. In the low-energy regime, our analysis constrains the anti-de Sitter curvature radius, i.e. $l H_0 \lesssim 10^{-29}$. Our finding agrees quantitatively with prior work. In the high-energy regime, the gravitational-to-photon horizon ratio $r_g/r_\gamma$ increases by thirty orders of magnitude, reaching $10^{33}$. Subject to the nucleosynthesis constraint $\sigma^{1/4} &lt; 1 MeV$, the ratio becomes $10^{40}$. In this region, we observe the phenomenon of graviton bouncing by the brane, a behavior that has also been documented in prior literatures. Based on the observation of approximately $5\%$ dark radiation during the nucleosynthesis epoch, we further derive constraints on the relevant model parameters. Our results demonstrate that the non-zero Schwarzschild mass profoundly affects brane-world gravity. Crucially, some resulting effects may provide mechanisms to address persistent challenges in standard cosmology.</description>

      <title>Kerr black hole in a uniform magnetic field: An exact solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new class of exact spacetimes in Einstein's gravity, which are Kerr black holes immersed in an external magnetic (or electric) field that is asymptotically uniform and oriented along the rotational axis, is presented. These are axisymmetric stationary solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations such that (unlike in the Plebanski-Demianski spacetime) the null directions of the Faraday tensor are not aligned with neither of the two principal null directions of the Weyl tensor of algebraic type D (unlike the Kerr-Melvin spacetime). Three physical parameters are the black hole mass $m$, its rotation $a$, and the external field value $B$. For vanishing $B$ the metric directly reduces to standard Boyer-Lindquist form of the Kerr black hole, while for zero $m$ we recover conformally flat Bertotti-Robinson universe with a uniform Maxwell field. For zero $a$ the spacetime is contained in the Van den Bergh-Carminati solutions which can be understood as the Schwarzschild black hole in a magnetic field. Our family of black holes with non-aligned Maxwell hair - that can be called the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) black holes - may find application in various studies ranging from mathematical relativity to relativistic astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Energy Extraction From the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Black Hole via Magnetic Reconnection under Circular Plasma and Plunging Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a class of exact solutions describing rotating black holes immersed in a uniform magnetic field has been proposed, and various properties of such black holes remain unclear. This paper aims to explore how to extract energy based on the magnetic reconnection mechanism in both the circular orbit region and the plunging region. After introducing the properties of this spacetime, we analyze physical quantities such as the size of the ergoregion, the event horizon, and the boundaries of the ergosphere. We then analyze the magnetic reconnection process within circular orbits. We plot energy extraction parameter diagrams, and analyze the power and efficiency of energy extraction. The results show that the magnetic field impedes energy extraction. Comparing with Kerr black holes and Kerr-Melvin black holes, we find that this black hole's energy extraction capability is stronger than that of the Kerr-Melvin black hole but weaker than that of the Kerr black hole. Furthermore, we study magnetic reconnection and energy extraction in the plunging region of this black hole. The results indicate that the magnetic field still impedes energy extraction. The black hole's energy extraction capability in this region also remains weaker than that of a Kerr black hole but stronger than that of a Kerr-Melvin black hole. Comparing the plunging region with the circular orbit region, we find that the energy extraction power in the plunging region is consistently stronger than in the circular orbit region.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction from the accelerating Kerr black hole via magnetic reconnection in the plunging region and circular orbit region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the magnetic reconnection mechanism, this study investigates how to extract energy effectively from an accelerating Kerr black hole in the plunging region and circular orbit region. After introducing the properties of accelerating black holes, including the event horizon, ergosphere, circular orbits, and innermost stable circular orbit, we investigate the magnetic reconnection process in the plunging region. Specifically, we analyze variations of the azimuthal angle with respect to the acceleration, examine changes in energy per enthalpy of decelerated plasma, and plot energy extraction efficiency along with permissible energy extraction regions. Results show that in the plunging region, at larger radii of reconnection locations, the accelerating black hole exhibits higher energy extraction efficiency than a Kerr black hole. Away from extremality, the acceleration parameter impedes energy extraction, while near extremality, it enhances extraction. We also study energy extraction in circular orbit region by plotting energy extraction efficiency within permissible regions. We find that the permissible energy extraction area is reduced and the efficiency exceeds that of Kerr black holes due to the existence of acceleration parameter. Larger acceleration parameters yield more effective energy extraction regardless of extremality, which is different from that in the plunging region. Additionally, energy extraction efficiency in the plunging region surpasses that in the circular orbit region, aligning with prior conclusions.</description>

      <title>GWSkyNet-Multi II: an updated machine learning model for rapid classification of gravitational-wave events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-messenger observations of gravitational waves and electromagnetic emission from compact object mergers offer unique insights into the structure of neutron stars, the formation of heavy elements, and the expansion rate of the Universe. With the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave detectors currently in their fourth observing run (O4), it is an exciting time for detecting these mergers. However, assessing whether to follow up a candidate gravitational-wave event given limited telescope time and resources is challenging; the candidate can be a false alert due to detector glitches, or may not have any detectable electromagnetic counterpart even if it is real. GWSkyNet-Multi is a machine learning model developed to facilitate follow-up decisions by providing real-time classification of candidate events, using localization information released in LVK rapid public alerts. Here we introduce GWSkyNet-Multi II, an updated model targeted towards providing more robust and informative predictions during O4 and beyond. Specifically, the model now provides normalized probability scores and associated uncertainties for each of the four corresponding source categories released by the LVK: glitch, binary black hole, neutron star-black hole, and binary neutron star. Informed by explainability studies of the original model, the updated model architecture is also significantly simplified, including replacing input images with intuitive summary values that are more interpretable. For significant event alerts issued during O4a and O4b, GWSkyNet-Multi II produces a prediction that is consistent with the updated LVK classification for 93% of events. The updated model can be used by the community to help make time-critical follow-up decisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach to Carrollian geometry using principal $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles ($\mathbb{R}^\times := \matthbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$) equipped with a degenerate metric whose kernel is the module of vertical vector fields. The constructions allow for non-trivial bundles, and a large class of Carrollian manifolds can be analysed in this formalism. A key result in this is that once a principal connection has been selected, there is a canonical non-degenerate metric that can be leveraged to circumvent the difficulties associated with a degenerate metric. Within this framework, we examine the Levi-Civita connection and null geodesics.</description>

      <title>Testing Planck 2020 and DESI data on wCDM Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work delves into the dynamical dark energy models of the wCDM parameterisation that are defined by their equation of state by comparing different, well-known parameterisation models, in an attempt to lessen the tensions of {H_0} and {\sigma_8} by using the latest observational data. This research also tested the newer Planck likelihood and compared it to the previously released dataset of Planck 2018 and the newer BAO data of DESI. The data that was used were: the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data of Planck 2018 and Planck 2020 data; Cosmic Chronometers (CC), a sample of Supernovae Type Ia; and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). A Bayesian analysis was performed to produce the results needed for the analysis. From the analyses, the best-fit values of the parameters show that almost all models are in favour of a phantom Universe when early-time data was used and favours a quintessence Universe when combinations of early-time and late-time data was considered. This study also showed that the new tested data constrained the models better than the previous ones, while also showing that the observation data supports the {\Lambda}CDM model over the dynamical dark energy models</description>

      <title>Information Transport in Classical-Quantum Hybrid System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many important quantities in quantum information science, such as entropy and entanglement, are non-linear functions of the density matrix and cannot be expressed as operator observables. Standard open-system approaches evolve only a single copy of the density matrix, making it impossible to track the dynamics of such quantities. A formalism proposed by some of the present authors addressed this challenge by evolving multiple virtual replicas, but was limited to the weak-coupling regime. Here, we extend this approach to strong coupling between a quantum system and classical environments. The resulting multi-replica master equation enables direct evaluation of entropy flow and related metrics in strongly hybridized quantum-classical systems. Our results show that quantum coherence and hybridization jointly suppress net entropy transfer, creating a thermodynamic bottleneck. This framework provides a general tool for studying entropy dynamics and guiding the design of more robust, resource-efficient quantum hardware.</description>
