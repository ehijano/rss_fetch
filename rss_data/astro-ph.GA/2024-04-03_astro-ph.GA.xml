      <title>Galaxy shapes in Magneticum. I. Connecting stellar and dark matter shapes to dynamical and morphological galaxy properties and the large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being a fundamental property of galaxies that dictates the form of the potential, the 3D shape is intrinsically difficult to determine from observations. The improving quality of triaxial modeling methods in recent years has made it possible to measure these shapes more accurately. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the stellar and dark matter (DM) shapes of galaxies and the connections between them as well as with other galaxy properties. Using the hydrodynamical cosmological simulation Magneticum Box4, we computed the stellar and DM shapes of galaxies at different radii. We determined their morphologies, their projected morphological and kinematic parameters, and their fractions of in-situ formed stars. The DM follows the stellar component in shape and orientation at $3R_{1/2}$, indicating that DM is heavily influenced by the baryonic potential in the inner parts of the halo. The outer DM halo is independent of the inner properties such as morphology, however, and is more closely related to the large-scale anisotropy of the gas inflow. The stellar shapes of galaxies are correlated with morphology: ellipticals feature more spherical and prolate shapes than disk galaxies. Galaxies with more rotational support are flatter, and the stellar shapes are connected to the mass distribution. In particular, more extended elliptical galaxies have larger triaxialities. Finally, the shapes can be used to constrain the in-situ fraction of stars when combined with the stellar mass. The found relations show that shapes depend on the details of the accretion history. The similarities between the inner DM and stellar shapes signal the importance of baryonic matter for DM in galaxies and will help improve dynamical models in the future. At large radii the DM shape is completely decoupled from the central galaxy and is coupled more to the large-scale inflow.</description>

      <title>Zooming in on the Circumgalactic Medium with GIBLE: the Topology and Draping of Magnetic Fields around Cold Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy to study and quantify the topology of magnetic field lines around cold gas clouds in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). This simulation is a new addition to Project GIBLE, a suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation with preferential super-Lagrangian refinement in the CGM, reaching an unprecedented (CGM) gas mass resolution of $\sim$ $225$ M$_\odot$. To maximize statistics and resolution, we focus on a sample of $\sim$ $200$ clouds with masses of $\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\odot$. The topology of magnetic field lines around clouds is diverse, from threading to draping, and there is large variation in the magnetic curvature ($\kappa$) within cloud-background interfaces. We typically find little variation of $\kappa$ between upstream and downstream cloud faces, implying that strongly draped configurations are rare. In addition, $\kappa$ correlates strongly with multiple properties of the interface and the ambient background, including cloud overdensity and relative velocity, suggesting that cloud properties impact the topology of interface magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Galaxy Cluster HI Mass Recovery with CHIME at Redshifts z = 1 and 2 via the IllustrisTNG Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is a drift-scan interferometer designed to map the entire northern sky every 24 hours. The all-sky coverage and sensitivity to neutral hydrogen flux at intermediate redshifts makes the instrument a resource for other exciting science in addition to cosmology for which it was originally designed. Characterizing the contents of CHIME's beam-smoothed maps will aid in planning novel use-cases for the instrument, particularly those pertaining to galaxy evolution studies. Here, we demonstrate its utility for the study of the \ion{H}{i} content of stacked galaxy populations across environments. Focusing first on galaxy clusters, we use simulated data from the IllustrisTNG project to understand the relative contribution of objects that fall into CHIME's synthesized beam to the observed \ion{H}{i} flux using stacking analyses at a couple of representative redshifts. We find that there is an appreciable difference in the estimated stacked flux when galaxy clusters or cluster member galaxies are used as tracers compared to stacking on a general galaxy catalog. Stacking on galaxy clusters, we report that it is possible to recover an average $M_\mathrm{HI}$ for clusters as a function of redshift and selection criteria.</description>

      <title>Stellar Variability and Distance Indicators in the Near-infrared in Nearby Galaxies. I. RR Lyrae and Anomalous Cepheids in Draco dwarf spheroidal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Draco dwarf Spheroidal galaxy (dSph) is one of the nearest and the most dark matter dominated satellites of the Milky Way. We obtained multi-epoch near-infrared (NIR, $JHK_s$) observations of the central region of Draco dSph covering a sky area of $\sim 21'\times21'$ using the WIRCam instrument at the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Homogeneous $JHK_s$ time-series photometry for 212 RR Lyrae (173 fundamental-mode, 24 first-overtone, and 15 mixed-mode variables) and 5 Anomalous Cepheids in Draco dSph is presented and used to derive their period-luminosity relations at NIR wavelengths for the first-time. The small scatter of $\sim 0.05$~mag in these empirical relations for RR Lyrae stars is consistent with those in globular clusters and suggests a very small metallicity spread, up to $\sim0.2$~dex, among these centrally located variables. Based on empirically calibrated NIR period-luminosity-metallicity relations for RR Lyrae in globular clusters, we determined a distance modulus to Draco dSph of $\mu_\textrm{RRL} = 19.557 \pm 0.026$ mag. The calibrated $K_s$-band period-luminosity relations for Anomalous Cepheids in the Draco dSph and the Large Magellanic Cloud exhibit statistically consistent slopes but systematically different zero-points, hinting at possible metallicity dependence of $\sim-0.3$ mag~dex$^{-1}$. Finally, the apparent magnitudes of the tip of the red giant branch in $I$ and $J$ bands also agree well with their absolute calibrations with the adopted RR Lyrae distance to Draco. Our recommended $\sim1.5\%$ precise RR Lyrae distance, $D_\textrm{Draco} = 81.55 \pm 0.98 \textrm{(statistical)} \pm 1.17 \textrm{(systematic)}$~kpc, is the most accurate and precise distance to Draco dSph galaxy.</description>

      <title>Quantitative analysis of the molecular gas morphology in nearby disk galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantitative and statistical analysis of the molecular gas morphology in 73 nearby galaxies using high spatial resolution CO (J=2-1) data obtained from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) by the PHANGS large program. We applied three model-independent parameters: Concentration (C), Asymmetry (A), and Clumpiness (S) which are commonly used to parameterize the optical and infrared morphology of galaxies. We find a significant correlation between A and S, with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.62 with a p-value of $4 \times 10^{-9}$. This suggests a higher abundance of molecular clumps (i.e. giant molecular cloud associations) in galaxies that display stronger distortion or biased large-scale molecular gas distribution. In addition, the analysis of the C parameter suggests high central molecular concentration in most barred spiral galaxies investigated in this study. Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between the length of the bar structure ($R_\mathrm{bar}/R_{25}$) and the C parameter, with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.63 with a p-value of $3.8 \times 10^{-5}$ suggesting that larger bar structure can facilitate overall molecular gas transport and yield higher central concentration than galaxies with shorter bars. Finally, we offer a possible classification scheme of nearby disk galaxies which is based on the CAS parameters of molecular gas.</description>

      <title>Haro 11: The Spatially Resolved Lyman Continuum Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the nearest confirmed Lyman continuum (LyC) emitter, Haro 11 is an exceptional laboratory for studying LyC escape processes crucial to cosmic reionization. Our new HST/COS G130M/1055 observations of its three star-forming knots now reveal that the observed LyC originates in Knots B and C, with $903 - 912~\r{A}$ luminosities of $1.9\pm1.5 \times 10^{40}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$ and $0.9\pm0.7 \times 10^{40}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, respectively. We derive local escape fractions $f_{\rm{esc, 912}} = 3.4\pm2.9\%$ and $5.1\pm4.3\%$ for Knots B and C, respectively. Our Starburst99 modeling shows dominant populations on the order of $\sim1-4$ Myr and $1-2\times10^7 \rm~M_\odot$ in each knot, with the youngest population in Knot B. Thus, the knot with the strongest LyC detection has the highest LyC production. However, LyC escape is likely less efficient in Knot B than in Knot C due to higher neutral gas covering. Our results therefore stress the importance of the intrinsic ionizing luminosity, and not just the escape fraction, for LyC detection. Similarly, the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction does not consistently correlate with LyC flux, nor do narrow Ly$\alpha$ red peaks. High observed Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and low Ly$\alpha$ peak velocity separation, however, do correlate with higher LyC escape. Another insight comes from the undetected Knot A, which drives the Green Pea properties of Haro 11. Its density-bounded conditions suggest highly anisotropic LyC escape. Finally, both of the LyC-leaking Knots, B and C, host ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). While stars strongly dominate over the ULXs in LyC emission, this intriguing coincidence underscores the importance of unveiling the role of accretors in LyC escape and reionization.</description>

      <title>The effects of environment on galaxies' dynamical structures: From simulations to observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the effects of cluster environments on galactic structures by using the TNG50 cosmological simulation and observed galaxies in the Fornax cluster. We focused on galaxies with stellar masses of $10^{8-12}M_{\odot}$ at z=0 that reside in Fornax-like clusters with total masses of $M_{200c} = 10^{13.4-14.3}M_{\odot}$. We characterized the stellar structures by decomposing each galaxy into a dynamically cold disk and a hot non-disk component, and studied the evolution of both the stellar and gaseous constituents. In TNG50, we find that the cold gas is quickly removed when a galaxy falls into a Fornax-mass cluster. About 87\% of the galaxies have lost $80\%$ of their star-forming gas at 4 billion years after infall, with the remaining gas concentrating in the inner regions of the galaxy. The radius of the star-forming gaseous disk decreases to half its original size at 4 billion years after infall for 66\% of the galaxies. As a result, star formation in the extended dynamically cold disk sharply decreases, even though a low level of SF persists at the center for a few additional gigayears. This leads to a tight correlation between the average stellar age in the dynamically cold disk and the infall time of galaxies. Furthermore, the luminosity fraction of the dynamically cold disk in ancient infallers is only about 1/3 of that in recent infallers, controlling for galaxy stellar mass. This quantitatively agrees with what is observed in early-type galaxies in the Fornax cluster. Gas removal stops the possible growth of the disk, with gas removed earlier in galaxies that fell in earlier, and hence the cold-disk fraction is correlated with the infall time. The stellar disk can be significantly disrupted by tidal forces after infall, through a long-term process that enhances the difference among cluster galaxies with different infall times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, we delve into the formation and primary characteristics of two significant components within galaxy clusters: the brightest cluster galaxies and the intracluster light. Drawing upon recent and pertinent studies in the field, we explore the mechanisms driving their growth from high redshift to the present day. We also examine how these formation mechanisms are intertwined with the dynamical state of their host clusters, suggesting their potential utility as luminous tracers of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Carbon isotope chemistry in protoplanetary disks: Effects of C/O ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon isotope fractionation of CO has been reported in the disk around TW Hya,where elemental carbon is more abundant than elemental oxygen ([C/O]$_{\rm elem}$&gt; 1). We investigated the effects of the [C/O]$_{\rm elem}$ ratio on carbon fractionation using astrochemical models that incorporate isotope-selective photodissociation and isotope-exchange reactions. The $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio could be lower than the elemental carbon isotope ratio due to isotope exchange reactions when the [C/O]$_{\rm elem}$ ratio exceeds unity. The observed $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO and H$^{12}$CN/H$^{13}$CN ratios around TW Hya could be reproduced when the [C/O]$_{\rm elem}$ ratio is 2~5. In the vicinity of the lower boundary of the warm molecular layer, the formation of ices leads to the gas phase [C/O]$_{\rm elem}$ ratio approaching unity, irrespective of the total (gas + ice) [C/O]$_{\rm elem}$ ratio. This phenomenon reduces the variation in the $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio across different [C/O]$_{\rm elem}$ ratios.</description>

      <title>MHONGOOSE - A MeerKAT Nearby Galaxy HI Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MHONGOOSE (MeerKAT HI Observations of Nearby Galactic Objects: Observing Southern Emitters) survey maps the distribution and kinematics of the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) gas in and around 30 nearby star-forming spiral and dwarf galaxies to extremely low HI column densities. The HI column density sensitivity (3 sigma over 16 km/s) ranges from ~ 5 x 10^{17} cm^{-2} at 90'' resolution to ~4 x 10^{19} cm^{-2} at the highest resolution of 7''. The HI mass sensitivity (3 sigma over 50 km/s) is ~5.5 X 10^5 M_sun at a distance of 10 Mpc (the median distance of the sample galaxies). The velocity resolution of the data is 1.4 km/s. One of the main science goals of the survey is the detection of cold, accreting gas in the outskirts of the sample galaxies. The sample was selected to cover a range in HI masses, from 10^7 M_sun to almost 10^{11} M_sun, to optimally sample possible accretion scenarios and environments. The distance to the sample galaxies ranges from 3 to 23 Mpc. In this paper, we present the sample selection, survey design, and observation and reduction procedures. We compare the integrated HI fluxes based on the MeerKAT data with those derived from single-dish measurement and find good agreement, indicating that our MeerKAT observations are recovering all flux. We present HI moment maps of the entire sample based on the first ten percent of the survey data, and find that a comparison of the zeroth- and second-moment values shows a clear separation between the physical properties of the HI in areas with star formation and areas without, related to the formation of a cold neutral medium. Finally, we give an overview of the HI-detected companion and satellite galaxies in the 30 fields, five of which have not previously been catalogued. We find a clear relation between the number of companion galaxies and the mass of the main target galaxy.</description>

      <title>The onset of bar formation in a massive galaxy at $z \sim 3.8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the morphological and kinematical properties of SPT-2147, a strongly lensed, massive, dusty, star-forming galaxy at $z = 3.762$. Combining data from JWST, HST, and ALMA, we study the galaxy's stellar emission, dust continuum and gas properties. The imaging reveals a central bar structure in the stars and gas embedded within an extended disc with a spiral arm-like feature. The kinematics confirm the presence of the bar and of the regularly rotating disc. Dynamical modeling yields a dynamical mass, ${M}_{\rm dyn} = (9.7 \pm 2.0) \times 10^{10}$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$, and a maximum rotational velocity to velocity dispersion ratio, $V / \sigma = 9.8 \pm 1.2$. From multi-band imaging we infer, via SED fitting, a stellar mass, ${M}_{\star} = (6.3 \pm 0.9) \times 10^{10}$ $\rm{M}_{\odot}$, and a star formation rate, ${\rm SFR} = 781 \pm 99$ ${\rm M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}$, after correcting for magnification. Combining these measurements with the molecular gas mass, we derive a baryonic-to-total mass ratio of ${M}_{\rm bar} / {M}_{\rm dyn} = 0.9 \pm 0.2$ within 4.0 kpc. This finding suggests that the formation of bars in galaxies begins earlier in the history of the Universe than previously thought and can also occur in galaxies with elevated gas fractions.</description>

      <title>Ram pressure stripping in clusters: Gravity can bind the ISM but not the CGM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the survival of a galaxy's circumgalactic medium (CGM) as it experiences ram pressure stripping (RPS) moving through the intracluster medium (ICM). For a satellite galaxy, the CGM is often assumed to be entirely stripped/evaporated, an assumption that may not always be justified. We carry out 3D-hydrodynamics simulations of RPS of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the CGM of a galaxy with mass and size comparable to the jellyfish galaxy JO201. We find that the CGM can survive long at cluster outskirts ($\gtrsim 2$ Gyr). However, at smaller cluster-centric distances, 90\% of the CGM mass is lost within $\sim 500$ Myr. Our simulations suggest that the gravitational restoring force on the CGM is mostly negligible and the CGM-ICM interaction is analogous to 'cloud-wind interaction'. The CGM stripping timescale depends not on the ram pressure but on $\chi$, the ratio of CGM to ICM density. Two distinct regimes emerge for CGM stripping: the $\chi &gt;1$ regime, which is the well-known 'cloud-crushing' problem, and the $\chi &lt; 1$ regime, which we refer to as the (relatively unexplored) 'bubble-drag' problem. The cloud-crushing regime ($\chi &gt;1$) suggests a CGM stripping timescale proportional to the drag time $t_{\rm drag} \sim \chi R/v_{\rm rel}$ ($R$ is the CGM size, $v_{\rm rel}$ is the relative velocity). The bubble-drag regime ($\chi &lt; 1$) is qualitatively different and gives a shorter stripping timescale comparable to the crossing time -- $t_{\rm drag} \sim R/v_{\rm rel}$, independent of $\chi$. The ISM stripping criterion unlike the CGM, still depends on the ram pressure $\rho_{\rm ICM} v_{\rm rel}^2$ (the classic Gunn and Gott 1972 condition). The stripped tails of satellites contain contributions from both the disk and its trailing CGM. Overall, we identify novel physical mechanisms and previously unexplored stripping regimes.</description>

Abstract: The magnetic fields in our Milky Way can be revealed by the distribution of Faraday rotation measures (RMs) of radio sources behind the Galaxy and of radio pulsars inside the Galaxy. Based on the antisymmetry of the Faraday sky in the inner Galaxy to the Galactic coordinates, the magnetic field toroids above and below the Galactic plane with reversed field directions exist in the Galactic halo and have been included in almost all models for the global magnetic structure in the Milky Way. However, the quantitative parameters, such as the field strength, the scale height, and the scale radius of the toroids are hard to determine from observational data. It has long been argued that the RM antisymmetry could be dominated by the local contributions of the interstellar medium. Here we discount the local RM contributions measured by pulsars mostly located within 5 kpc and get the first quantitative estimate of the size of magnetic toroids in the Galactic halo. They are huge, starting from a Galactocentric radius of less than 2 kpc to at least 15 kpc without field direction reversals. Such magnetic toroids in the Galactic halo should naturally constrain the physical processes in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Kinematics of Post-starburst Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star-forming galaxies can reach quiescence via rapid transition through merger-triggered starbursts that consequently affect both their kinematics and star formation rates. In this work, we analyze the spatially-resolved kinematics of 92 post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) with data from the MaNGA survey and place them in context with early-type galaxies (ETGs) to study the impact of merger history on galaxy kinematics. We measure the specific angular momentum to characterize them as slow or fast rotators. We find that the MaNGA PSB sample has $5\%$ slow rotators, which is less than the $14\%$ slow rotators in the ATLAS$^{3D}$ ETG sample and $22\%$ slow rotators in the MaNGA ETGs. The PSBs have lower specific angular momentum than the star-forming galaxies (SFs) and a greater fraction of slow rotators. This implies that for the PSBs to evolve into the ETGs, they must still lose some angular momentum. While ETGs with higher stellar mass tend to be slow rotators, PSBs do not follow this trend. We find significant correlations between specific angular momentum and mass-weighted age for the SF and ETG samples, but do not see any significant trends within the short PSB phase. These results indicate that significant evolution in angular momentum must continue to take place as the galaxy ages after the PSB phase. For PSBs to evolve directly into ETGs, they must undergo dry mergers to shed excess angular momentum without causing further epochs of star formation.</description>

      <title>Gas kinematics and dynamics of Carina Pillars: A case study of G287.76-0.87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the kinematics of a pillar, namely G287.76-0.87, using three rotational lines of $^{12}$CO(5-4), $^{12}$CO(8-7), $^{12}$CO(11-10), and a fine structure line of [OI] $63\,\mu$m Southern Carina observed by SOFIA/GREAT. This pillar is irradiated by the associated massive star cluster Trumpler 16, which includes $\eta$~Carina. Our analysis shows that the relative velocity of the pillar with respect to this ionization source is small, $\sim 1\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$, and the gas motion in the tail is more turbulent than in the head. We also performed analytical calculations to estimate the gas column density in local thermal equilibrium (LTE) conditions, which yields $N_{\rm CO}$ as $(\sim 0.2 -5)\times 10^{17}\,\rm cm^{-2}$. We further constrain the gas's physical properties in non-LTE conditions using RADEX. The non-LTE estimations result in $n_{\rm H_{2}} \simeq 10^{5}\,\rm cm^{-3}$ and $N_{\rm CO} \simeq 10^{16}\,\rm cm^{-2}$. We found that the thermal pressure within the G287.76-0.87 pillar is sufficiently high to make it stable for the surrounding hot gas and radiation feedback if the winds are not active. While they are active, stellar winds from the clustered stars sculpt the surrounding molecular cloud into pillars within the giant bubble around $\eta$~Carina.</description>

      <title>Probing the Physics of Star-Formation (ProPStar): II. The first systematic search for streamers toward protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of narrow channels of accretion toward protostellar disks, known as streamers, have increased in number in the last few years. However, it is unclear if streamers are a common feature around protostars that were previously missed, or if they are a rare phenomenon. Our goals are to obtain the incidence of streamers toward a region of clustered star formation and to trace the origins of their gas, to determine if they originate within the filamentary structure of molecular clouds or from beyond. We used combined observations of the nearby NGC 1333 star-forming region, carried out with the NOEMA interferometer and the IRAM 30m single dish. Our observations cover the area between the IRAS 4 and SVS 13 systems. We traced the chemically fresh gas within NGC 1333 with HC3N molecular gas emission and the structure of the fibers in this region with N2H+ emission. We fit multiple velocity components in both maps and used clustering algorithms to recover velocity-coherent structures. We find streamer candidates toward 7 out of 16 young stellar objects within our field of view. This represents an incidence of approximately 40\% of young stellar objects with streamer candidates when looking at a clustered star forming region. The incidence increases to about 60\% when we considered only embedded protostars. All streamers are found in HC3N emission. Given the different velocities between HC3N and N2H+ emission, and the fact that, by construction, N2H+ traces the fiber structure, we suggest that the gas that forms the streamers comes from outside the fibers. This implies that streamers can connect cloud material that falls to the filaments with protostellar disk scales.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Dark Matter from Dynamical Heating of Stars in Ultrafaint Dwarfs. Part 2: Substructure and the Primordial Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a large and growing interest in observations of small-scale structure in dark matter. We propose a new way to probe dark matter structures in the $\sim 10 - 10^8 \, M_\odot$ range. This allows us to constrain the primordial power spectrum over shorter distances scales than possible with direct observations from the CMB. For $k$ in the range $\sim 10 - 1000 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ our constraints on the power spectrum are orders of magnitude stronger than previous bounds.
  We also set some of the strongest constraints on dark matter isocurvature perturbations. Our method relies on the heating effect such dark matter substructures would have on the distribution of stars in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. Many models of inflation produce enhanced power at these short distance scales and can thus be constrained by our observation. Further, many dark matter models such as axion dark matter, self-interacting dark matter and dissipative dark matter, produce dense structures which could be constrained this way.</description>

      <title>Dianoga SIDM: galaxy cluster self-interacting dark matter simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims at assessing the impact of DM self-interactions on the properties of galaxy clusters. In particular, the goal is to study the angular dependence of the cross section by testing rare (large angle scattering) and frequent (small angle scattering) SIDM models with velocity-dependent cross sections. We re-simulate six galaxy cluster zoom-in initial conditions with a dark matter only run and with a full-physics setup simulations that includes a self-consistent treatment of baryon physics. We test the dark matter only setup and the full physics setup with either collisionless cold dark matter, rare self-interacting dark matter, and frequent self-interacting dark matter models. We then study their matter density profiles as well as their subhalo population. Our dark matter only SIDM simlations agree with theoretical models, and when baryons are included in simulations, our SIDM models substantially increase the central density of galaxy cluster cores compared to full-physics simulations using collisionless dark matter. SIDM subhalo suppression in full-physics simulations is milder compared to the one found in dark matter only simulations, because of the cuspier baryionic potential that prevent subhalo disruption. Moreover SIDM with small-angle scattering significantly suppress a larger number of subhaloes compared to large angle scattering SIDM models. Additionally, SIDM models generate a broader range of subhalo concentration values, including a tail of more diffuse subhaloes in the outskirts of galaxy clusters and a population of more compact subhaloes in the cluster cores.</description>

      <title>Soft no more: gas shielding protects soft binaries from disruption in gas-rich environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binaries in dense environments are traditionally classified as soft or hard based on their binding energy relative to the kinetic energy of surrounding stars. Heggie's law suggests that stellar encounters tend to soften soft binaries and harden hard binaries, altering their separations. However, interactions with gas in such environments can significantly modify this behavior. This study investigates the impact of gas on binary softening and its consequences. We find that gas interactions can actually harden binaries, extending the soft-hard boundary to larger separations. This introduces a "shielding radius" within which binaries are likely to harden due to gas interactions, surpassing the traditional soft-hard limit. Consequently, a notable portion of binaries initially classified as "soft" may become "hard" when both gas and stars are considered. We propose a two-stage formation process for hard binaries: initial soft binary formation, either dynamically or through gas-assisted capture, followed by gas-induced hardening before eventual disruption. In environments with low gas density but high gas content, the shielding radius could exceed the typical hard-soft limit by an order of magnitude, leading to a significant fraction of originally soft binaries effectively becoming hard. Conversely, in high gas-density environments, gas-induced hardening may dominate, potentially rendering the entire binary population hard. Gas hardening emerges as a crucial factor in shaping binary populations in gas-rich settings, such as clusters, star-forming regions, and possibly AGN disks. This highlights the complex interplay between gas dynamics and stellar interactions in binary evolution within dense environments.</description>

      <title>Variations in Line Profiles of Atomic Transitions in RR Lyrae Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the absorption shapes of atomic lines and H{\alpha} in RR Lyrae stars. We used the database of high resolution spectra gathered with the Las Campanas Observatory du Pont Telescope, analyzing a set of about 2700 short exposure spectra of 17 RRab and 5 RRc variables. To increase the signal-to-noise of the spectra for each star, we first co-added spectra in small photometric phase bins, and then co-added metallic line profiles in velocity space. The resulting line absorption shapes vary with photometric phase in a consistent manner for all RRab stars, while exhibiting no obvious phase-related variations for the RRc stars. We interpret these line profile variations in terms of velocity gradients in the photospheric layers that produce absorption line profiles. The H{\alpha} profiles are much broader, indicative of shock temperatures of order 100,000 K.</description>

      <title>Molecular line polarisation from the circumstellar envelopes of Asymptotic Giant Branch stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarisation observations of masers in the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) around Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars have revealed strong magnetic fields. However, masers probe only specific lines-of-sight through the CSE. Non-masing molecular line polarisation observation can more directly reveal the large scale magnetic field morphology and hence probe the effect of the magnetic field on AGB mass-loss and the shaping of the AGB wind. Observations and models of CSE molecular line polarisation can now be used to describe the magnetic field morphology and estimate its strength throughout the entire CSE. We use observations taken with ALMA of molecular line polarisation in the envelope of two AGB stars (CW~Leo and R~Leo). We model the observations using the multi-dimensional polarised radiative transfer tool PORTAL. We find linearly polarised emission, with maximum fractional polarisation on the order of a few percent, in several molecular lines towards both stars.
  We can explain the observed differences in polarisation structure between the different molecular lines by alignment of the molecules by a combination of the Goldreich-Kylafis effect and radiative alignment effects. We specifically show that the polarisation of CO traces the morphology of the magnetic field. Competition between the alignment mechanisms allows us to describe the behaviour of the magnetic field strength with radius throughout the circumstellar envelope of CW~Leo. The magnetic field strength derived using this method is inconsistent with the magnetic field strength derived using a structure function analysis of the CO polarisation and the strength previously derived using CN Zeeman observations. In contrast with CW~Leo, the magnetic field in the outer envelope of R~Leo appears to be advected outwards by the stellar wind. {abridged abstract}</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Formation in Open Star Clusters II: Difficulty of Gaia NS formation in low-mass star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia mission offers opportunities to search for compact binaries not involved in binary interactions (hereafter inert compact binaries), and results in the discoveries of binaries containing one black hole (BH) or one neutron star (NS), called ``Gaia BHs'' and ``Gaia NSs'', respectively. We have assessed if Gaia BHs and NSs can be formed in open clusters through dynamical interactions. In order to obtain a large number of inert compact binaries similar to Gaia BHs and NSs, we have performed gravitational $N$-body simulations for a large number of open clusters whose total mass is $1.2 \times 10^8 M_\odot$. These clusters have various masses, metallicities, densities, and binary fractions. We have found that open clusters form Gaia BHs ($10^{-6}$-$10^{-5} M_\odot^{-1}$) much more efficiently than Gaia NSs ($\lesssim 10^{-7} M_\odot^{-1}$) for any cluster parameters. This is quite inconsistent with observational results, because the reported numbers of Gaia BHs and NSs are $2$ and $\sim 20$, respectively. Additionally, we have switched off NS natal kicks for $10^4$ open clusters each weighing $10^3 M_\odot$ in order to retain a large number of NSs in open clusters. Then, open clusters form inert NS binaries originating from primordial binaries rather than formed through dynamical interactions. This means that Gaia NSs are formed dominantly on isolated fields, not in open clusters, if there is no NS natal kick. We have concluded that Gaia BHs can be dominantly formed in open clusters, however Gaia NSs cannot.</description>

      <title>CSST Strong Lensing Preparation: a Framework for Detecting Strong Lenses in the Multi-color Imaging Survey by the China Survey Space Telescope (CSST)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for investigating dark matter and dark energy properties. With the advent of large-scale sky surveys, we can discover strong lensing systems on an unprecedented scale, which requires efficient tools to extract them from billions of astronomical objects. The existing mainstream lens-finding tools are based on machine learning algorithms and applied to cut-out-centered galaxies. However, according to the design and survey strategy of optical surveys by CSST, preparing cutouts with multiple bands requires considerable efforts. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a framework based on a hierarchical visual Transformer with a sliding window technique to search for strong lensing systems within entire images. Moreover, given that multi-color images of strong lensing systems can provide insights into their physical characteristics, our framework is specifically crafted to identify strong lensing systems in images with any number of channels. As evaluated using CSST mock data based on an Semi-Analytic Model named CosmoDC2, our framework achieves precision and recall rates of 0.98 and 0.90, respectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method in real observations, we have applied it to a subset of images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and media images from Euclid Early Release Observations. 61 new strong lensing system candidates are discovered by our method. However, we also identified false positives arising primarily from the simplified galaxy morphology assumptions within the simulation. This underscores the practical limitations of our approach while simultaneously highlighting potential avenues for future improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys released data and available spectroscopic redshifts, we identify 1.58 million clusters of galaxies by searching for the overdensity of stellar mass distribution of galaxies within redshift slices around pre-selected massive galaxies, among which 877,806 clusters are found for the first time. The identified clusters have an equivalent mass of M_{500}&gt; 0.47*10^{14}~Msolar with an uncertainty of 0.2 dex. The redshift distribution of clusters extends to z~1.5, and 338,841 clusters have spectroscopic redshifts. Our cluster sample includes most of the rich optical clusters in previous catalogs, more than 95% massive Sunyaev-Zeldovich clusters and 90% ROSAT and eROSITA X-ray clusters. From the light distributions of member galaxies, we derive the dynamical state parameters for 28,038 rich clusters and find no significant evolution of the dynamical state with redshift. We find that the stellar mass of the brightest cluster galaxies grows by a factor of 2 since z=1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report here on the timing of 597 pulsars over the last four years with the MeerKAT telescope. We provide Times-of-Arrival, pulsar ephemeris files and per-epoch measurements of the flux density, dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM) for each pulsar. In addition we use a Gaussian process to model the timing residuals to measure the spin frequency derivative at each epoch. We also report the detection of 11 glitches in 9 individual pulsars. We find significant DM and RM variations in 87 and 76 pulsars respectively. We find that the DM variations scale approximately linearly with DM, which is broadly in agreement with models of the ionised interstellar medium. The observed RM variations seem largely independent of DM, which may suggest that the RM variations are dominated by variations in the interstellar magnetic field on the line of sight, rather than varying electron density. We also find that normal pulsars have around 5 times greater amplitude of DM variability compared to millisecond pulsars, and surmise that this is due to the known difference in their velocity distributions.</description>

      <title>A Close Look at Ly$\alpha$ Emitters with JWST/NIRCam at $z\approx3.1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study 10 spectroscopically confirmed Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z\approx3.1$ in the UDS field, covered by JWST/NIRCam in the PRIMER program. All LAEs are detected in all NIRCam bands from F090W to F444W, corresponding to restframe 2200\AA--1.2$\mathrm{\mu m}$. Based on morphological analysis of the F200W images, three out of the 10 targets are resolved into pair-like systems with separations of $&lt;0.9''$, and another three show asymmetric structures. We then construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these LAEs. All sources, including the pairs, show similar SED shapes, with a prominent flux excess in the F200W band, corresponding to extremely strong [O III]+H$\beta$ emission lines (${\rm EW_{rest}}=740$--$6500\,$\AA). The median effective radii, stellar mass, and UV slope of our sample are 0.36$\,$kpc, $3.8\times10^7\,M_\odot$, and --2.48, respectively. The average burst age, estimated by stellar mass over star formation rate, is $&lt;40\,$Myr. These measurements reveal an intriguing starbursting dwarf galaxy population lying off the extrapolations of the $z \sim 3$ scaling relations to the low-mass end: $\sim 0.7$ dex above the star-forming main sequence, $\sim 0.35$ dex below the mass--size relation, and bluer in the UV slope than typical high-z galaxies at similar UV luminosities. We speculate that these numbers may require a larger main sequence scatter or tail in the dwarf galaxy regime towards the starburst outliers.</description>

      <title>MaNGA DynPop -- VI. Matter density slopes from dynamical models of 6000 galaxies versus cosmological simulations: the interplay between baryonic and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We try to understand the trends in the mass density slopes as a function of galaxy properties. We use the results from the best Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) of the integral-field stellar kinematics for near 6000 galaxies from the MaNGA DynPop project, with stellar masses of $10^{9-12}\ {\rm M_{\odot}}$, including both early-type and late-type galaxies. We use the mass-weighted density slopes for the stellar $\overline{\gamma}_*$, dark $\overline{\gamma}_{\rm DM}$, and total $\overline{\gamma}_{\rm T}$ mass from the MaNGA DynPop project. The $\overline{\gamma}_{\rm T}$ approaches a constant value of 2.2 for high $\sigma_{\rm e}$ galaxies, and flattens for lg$(\sigma_{\rm e}/{\rm km\ s^{-1}})\lesssim2.3$, reaching 1.5 for lg$(\sigma_{\rm e}/{\rm km\ s^{-1}})\approx1.8$. The total and stellar slopes track each other tightly, with $\overline{\gamma}_{\rm T}\approx\overline{\gamma}_*-0.174$ over the full $\sigma_{\rm e}$ range. This confirms the dominance of stellar matter within $R_{\rm e}$. We also show that there is no perfect conspiracy between baryonic and dark matter, as $\overline{\gamma}_*$ and $\overline{\gamma}_{\rm DM}$ do not vary inversely within the $\sigma_{\rm e}$ range. We find that the central galaxies from TNG50 and TNG100 simulations do not reproduce the observed galaxy mass distribution, which we attribute to the overestimated dark matter fraction, possibly due to a constant IMF and excessive adiabatic contraction effects in the simulations. Finally, we present the stacked dark matter density profiles and show that they are slightly steeper than the pure dark matter simulation prediction of $\overline{\gamma}_{\rm DM}\approx1$, suggesting moderate adiabatic contraction in the central region of galaxies. Our work demonstrate the power of stellar dynamics modelling for probing the interaction between stellar and dark matter and testing galaxy formation theories.</description>

      <title>Stellar populations and origin of thick disks in AURIGA simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of thick disks and their evolutionary connection with thin disks are still a matter of debate. We provide new insights into this topic by connecting the stellar populations of thick disks at redshift $z=0$ with their past formation and growth, in 24 Milky Way-mass galaxies from the AURIGA zoom-in cosmological simulations. We projected each galaxy edge on, and decomposed it morphologically into two disk components, in order to define geometrically the thin and the thick disks as usually done in observations. We produced age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] edge-on maps. We quantified the impact of satellite mergers by mapping the distribution of ex-situ stars. Thick disks are on average $\sim 3$~Gyr older, $\sim 0.25$~dex more metal poor and $\sim 0.06$~dex more [Mg/Fe]-enhanced than thin disks. Their average ages range from $\sim 6$ to $\sim 9$~Gyr, metallicities from $\sim -0.15$ to $\sim 0.1$~dex, and [Mg/Fe] from $\sim 0.12$ to $\sim 0.16$~dex. These properties are the result of an early initial in-situ formation, followed by a later growth driven by the combination of direct accretion of stars, some in-situ star formation fueled by mergers, and dynamical heating of stars. The balance between these processes varies from galaxy to galaxy. Mergers play a key role in the mass assembly of thick disks, contributing an average accreted mass fraction of $\sim 22$\% in the analyzed thick-disk dominated regions. In two galaxies, about half of the geometric thick-disk mass was directly accreted. While primordial thick disks form at high redshift in all galaxies, young metal-rich thin disks, with much lower [Mg/Fe] abundances, start to form later but at different times (higher or lower redshift) depending on the galaxy. We conclude that thick disks result from the interplay of external processes with the internal evolution of the galaxy.</description>

      <title>The cold molecular gas in z$\gtrsim$6 quasar host galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probing the molecular gas reservoirs of z&gt;~6 quasar (QSO) host galaxies is fundamental to understanding the coevolution of star formation and black hole growth in these extreme systems. Yet, there is still an inhomogeneous coverage of molecular gas tracers. To measure the average excitation and mass of the molecular gas reservoirs in the brightest z&gt;6.5 QSO hosts, we combined new observations of CO(2-1) emission with existing observations of CO(6-5), CO(7-6), [C I], [C II], and dust-continuum emission. We reduced and analysed the VLA observations of CO(2-1) in three z=6.5-6.9 QSO hosts -- the highest redshift observations of CO(2-1) to date. By combining these with the nine z=5.7-6.4 QSO hosts for which CO(2-1) has already been observed, we studied the spread in molecular gas masses and CO excitation. Two of our three QSOs, were undetected in CO(2-1), implying more highly excited CO than in the z=6.4 QSO J1148+5251. We detected CO(2-1) at $5.1\sigma$ for our highest-redshift target, J2348-3054, yielding a molecular gas mass of $(1.2\pm0.2)\times 10^{10}\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$. This molecular gas mass is equivalent to the lower limit on the dynamical mass measured from resolved [C II] observations, implying little mass in stars or neutral gas within the [C II]-emitting region. On average, these QSO hosts have far higher CO(6-5)-, CO(7-6)-, and [C II] vs CO(2-1) line ratios than local AGN hosts; with a mean CO(6-5)-to-CO(1-0) line luminosity ratio of $r_{6,1}=0.9\pm0.2$. Our new CO(2-1) observations show that even at 780 Myr after the Big Bang, QSO host galaxies can already have molecular gas masses of $10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, consistent with a picture in which these z&gt;6 QSOs reside in massive starbursts that are coevolving with the supermassive black holes. Our results imply the presence of extremely dense and warm molecular gas reservoirs illuminated by strong interstellar radiation fields.</description>

      <title>CON-quest II. Spatially and spectrally resolved HCN/HCO+ line ratios in local luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear regions of ultraluminous and luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs) are powered by starbursts and/or active galactic nuclei (AGNs). These regions are often obscured by extremely high columns of gas and dust. Molecular lines in the submillimeter windows have the potential to determine the physical conditions of these compact obscured nuclei (CONs). We aim to reveal the distributions of HCN and HCO$^+$ emission in local U/LIRGs and investigate whether and how they are related to galaxy properties. Using ALMA, we have conducted sensitive observations of the HCN J=3--2 and HCO$^+$ J=3--2 lines toward 23 U/LIRGs in the local Universe (z &lt; 0.07) with a spatial resolution of ~0.3" (~50--400 pc). We detected both HCN and HCO$^+$ in 21 galaxies, only HCN in one galaxy, and neither in one galaxy. The global HCN/HCO$^+$ line ratios, averaged over scales of ~0.5--4 kpc, range from 0.4 to 2.3, with an unweighted mean of 1.1. These line ratios appear to have no systematic trend with bolometric AGN luminosity or star formation rate. The line ratio varies with position and velocity within each galaxy, with an average interquartile range of 0.38 on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis. In eight out of ten galaxies known to have outflows and/or inflows, we found spatially and kinematically symmetric structures of high line ratios. These structures appear as a collimated bicone in two galaxies and as a thin spherical shell in six galaxies. Non-LTE analysis suggests that the high HCN/HCO$^+$ line ratio in outflows is predominantly influenced by the abundance ratio. Chemical model calculations indicate that the enhancement of HCN abundance in outflows is likely due to high-temperature chemistry triggered by shock heating. These results imply that the HCN/HCO$^+$ line ratio can aid in identifying the outflow geometry when the shock velocity of the outflows is sufficiently high to heat the gas.</description>

Abstract: van Dokkum et al. (arXiv:2309.07969) reported the discovery of JWST-ER1, a strong lensing object at redshift $z\approx2$, using data from the James Webb Space Telescope. The lens mass within the Einstein ring is $5.9$ times higher than the expected stellar mass from a Chabrier initial mass function, indicating a high dark matter density. In this work, we show that a cold dark matter halo, influenced by gas-driven adiabatic contraction, can account for the observed lens mass. We interpret the measurement of JWST-ER1 in the self-interacting dark matter scenario and show that the cross section per particle mass $\sigma/m\approx0.1~{\rm cm^2/g}$ is generally favored. Intriguingly, $\sigma/m\approx0.1~{\rm cm^2/g}$ can also be consistent with the strong lensing observations of early-type galaxies at redshift $z\approx0.2$, where adiabatic contraction is not observed overall.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the chemical diversity observed around low-mass protostars probably resides in the earliest history of these systems. We aim to investigate the impact of protostellar feedback on the chemistry and grain growth in the circumstellar medium of multiple stellar systems. In the context of the ALMA Large Program FAUST, we present high-resolution (50 au) observations of CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO, and SiO and continuum emission at 1.3 mm and 3 mm towards the Corona Australis star cluster. Methanol emission reveals an arc-like structure at $\sim$1800 au from the protostellar system IRS7B along the direction perpendicular to the major axis of the disc. The arc is located at the edge of two elongated continuum structures that define a cone emerging from IRS7B. The region inside the cone is probed by H$_2$CO, while the eastern wall of the arc shows bright emission in SiO, a typical shock tracer. Taking into account the association with a previously detected radio jet imaged with JVLA at 6 cm, the molecular arc reveals for the first time a bow shock driven by IRS7B and a two-sided dust cavity opened by the mass-loss process. For each cavity wall, we derive an average H$_2$ column density of $\sim$7$\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, a mass of $\sim$9$\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_\odot$, and a lower limit on the dust spectral index of $1.4$. These observations provide the first evidence of a shock and a conical dust cavity opened by the jet driven by IRS7B, with important implications for the chemical enrichment and grain growth in the envelope of Solar System analogues.</description>

      <title>Stability of C$_{59}$ Knockout Fragments from Femtoseconds to Infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10063v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the stability of C$_{59}$ anions as a function of time, from their formation on femtosecond timescales to their stabilization on second timescales and beyond, using a combination of theory and experiments. The C$_{59}^-$ fragments were produced in collisions between C$_{60}$ fullerene anions and neutral helium gas at a velocity of 90 km/s (corresponding to a collision energy of 166 eV in the center-of-mass frame). The fragments were then stored in a cryogenic ion-beam storage ring at the DESIREE facility where they were followed for up to one minute. Classical molecular dynamics simulations were used to determine the reaction cross section and the excitation energy distributions of the products formed in these collisions. We found that about 15 percent of the C$_{59}^-$ ions initially stored in the ring are intact after about 100 ms, and that this population then remains intact indefinitely. This means that C$_{60}$ fullerenes exposed to energetic atoms and ions, such as stellar winds and shock waves, will produce stable, highly reactive products, like C$_{59}$, that are fed into interstellar chemical reaction networks.</description>

      <title>Constraining $z\lesssim 2$ ultraviolet emission with the upcoming ULTRASAT satellite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) carries a huge astrophysical and cosmological content: its frequency spectrum and redshift evolution are determined by the integrated emission of unresolved sources, these being galaxies, active galactic nuclei, or more exotic components. The near-UV region of the EBL spectrum is currently not well constrained, yet a significant improvement can be expected thanks to the soon-to-be launched Ultraviolet Transient Astronomy Satellite (ULTRASAT). Intended to study transient events in the $2300-2900\,{\rm \r{A}}$ observed band, this detector will provide wide field maps, tracing the UV intensity fluctuations on the largest scales. In this paper, we suggest how to exploit ULTRASAT to reconstruct the redshift evolution of the UV-EBL volume emissivity. We build upon the work of Chiang et al. (2019), where the Clustering-Based Redshift (CBR) technique was used to study diffuse light maps from GALEX. Their results showed the capability of the cross correlation between GALEX and SDSS spectroscopic catalogs in constraining the UV emissivity, highlighting how CBR is sensitive only to the extragalactic emissions, avoiding foregrounds and Galactic contributions. In our analysis, we introduce a framework to forecast the CBR constraining power when applied to ULTRASAT and GALEX in cross correlation with the 5-year DESI spectroscopic survey. We show that these will yield a strong improvement in the measurement of the UV-EBL volume emissivity. For $\lambda = 1500\,{\rm \r{A}}$,non-ionizing continuum below $z \sim 2$, we forecast a $1\sigma$ uncertainty $\lesssim 26\%\,(9\%)$ with conservative (optimistic) bias priors using ULTRASAT full-sky map; similar constraints can be obtained from its low-cadence survey, which will provide a smaller but deeper map. We finally discuss how these results will foster our understanding of UV-EBL models.</description>

      <title>An efficient prescription to search for linear gravitational wave memory in pulsar timing array data and its application to the NANOGrav 12.5-year dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Burst with memory events are potential transient gravitational wave sources for the maturing pulsar timing array (PTA) efforts. We provide a computationally efficient prescription to model pulsar timing residuals induced by supermassive black hole pairs in general relativistic hyperbolic trajectories employing a Keplerian-type parametric solution. Injection studies have been pursued on the resulting bursts with linear GW memory (LGWM) events with simulated datasets to test the performance of our pipeline, followed by its application to the publicly available NANOGrav 12.5-year (NG12.5) dataset. Given the absence of any evidence of LGWM events within the real NG12.5 dataset, we impose 95\% upper limits on the PTA signal amplitude as a function of the sky location of the source and certain characteristic frequency ($n$) of the signal. The upper limits are computed using a signal model that takes into account the presence of intrinsic timing noise specific to each pulsar, as well as a common, spatially uncorrelated red noise, alongside the LGWM signal. Our investigations reveal that the $95\%$ upper limits on LGWM amplitude, marginalized over all other parameters, is 3.48 $\pm 0.51 \ \mu$s for $n&gt;3.16$ nHz. This effort should be relevant for constraining both burst and memory events in the upcoming International Pulsar Timing Array data releases.</description>

      <title>Populating The Milky Way: Characterising Planet Demographics by Combining Galaxy Formation Simulations and Planet Population Synthesis Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar populations and their distribution differ widely across the Galaxy, which is likely to affect planet demographics. Our local neighbourhood is dominated by young, metal-rich stars in the galactic thin disc, while the stellar halo and galactic bulge host a large fraction of older, metal-poor stars. We study the impact of these variations on planet populations in different regions of the Galaxy by combining a high-resolution galaxy formation simulation with state-of-the-art planet population synthesis models.
  We construct a population model to estimate occurrence rates of different planet types, based on the New Generation Planet Population Synthesis by Emsenhuber et al., 2021. We apply this to a simulated Milky Way--Analogue in the HESTIA galaxy formation simulation. We study the planet occurrence rate in the metal-rich regions of the inner Galaxy, i.e. in the galactic bulge and thin disc, and contrast them to the frequencies in the more distant, metal-poor region like the thick disc and stellar halo.
  We find that the planet demographics in the metal-poor regions of the Milky Way-Analogue, differ strongly from the planet populations in the more distant, metal-poor regions. The occurrence rate of giant planets ($&gt;300 M_\bigoplus$) is 10 to 20 times larger in the thin disc compared to the thick disc, driven by the low amounts of solid material available for planet formation around metal-poor stars. Similarly, low-mass Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars are most abundant in the thick disc, being 1.5 times more frequent than in the thin disc. Moreover, low-mass planets are expected to be abundant throughout the galaxy, from the central regions to the outer halo, due to their formation processes being less dependent on stellar metallicity. The planet populations differ more strongly around Sun-like stars compared to dwarfs with masses 0.3 - 0.5 $M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mass-richness relation of clusters from THE THREE HUNDRED hydrodynamic simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main systematics in cluster cosmology is the uncertainty in the mass-observable relation. In this paper, we focus on the most direct cluster observable in optical surveys, i.e. richness, and constrain the intrinsic mass-richness (MR) relation of clusters in THE THREE HUNDRED hydrodynamic simulations with two runs: GIZMO-SIMBA and GADGET-X. We find that modeling the richness at fixed halo mass with a skewed Gaussian distribution yields a simpler and smaller scatter compared to the commonly used log-normal distribution. Additionally, we observe that baryon models have a significant impact on the scatter, while exhibiting no influence on the mass dependence and a slight effect on the amplitude in the MR relation. We select member galaxies based on both stellar mass $M_\star$ and absolute magnitude $\mathscr{M}$. We demonstrate that the MR relation obtained from these two selections can be converted to each other by using the $M_\star-\mathscr{M}$ relation. Finally, we provide a 7-parameter fitting result comprehensively capturing the dependence of the MR relation on both stellar mass cutoff and redshift.</description>
