      <title>Robust anomaly triggers with \textsc{DecADe}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, the rate of proton-proton collisions far exceeds the rate at which data can be recorded. A real-time event selection process, or "trigger", is needed to ensure that the data recorded contains the highest possible discovery potential. In the absence of hoped-for anomalies that would lead to the discovery of new physics, there is increasing motivation to develop dedicated, model-agnostic, anomaly detection triggers. A common approach is to use unsupervised machine learning (ML) to predict an event-by-event anomaly score, based on the momenta and multiplicity of reconstructed objects. Such anomaly scores often exhibit high correlation with existing trigger observables, duplicating the efficiency of current triggers rather than accessing underexplored regions of phase space. In this article, we introduce DECorrelated Anomaly DEtection (\textsc{DecADe}), in which quantile regression is applied to the output of a pre-trained anomaly detection algorithm, guaranteeing the independence of the threshold on the anomaly score with respect to primary trigger observables. Thus, \textsc{DecADe} provides efficiency in regions of phase space not captured by existing triggers, boosting the trigger efficiency for low-mass phenomena. Quantile regression is implemented using decision tree ensembles, making \textsc{DecADe} highly computationally efficient and therefore optimal for use both in software-based trigger systems and in FPGA-based hardware triggers. In both cases, we demonstrate that \textsc{DecADe} would add an insignificant additional latency and resource cost to the hardware anomaly detection triggers currently in operation at ATLAS and CMS, as well as to those proposed for the High-Luminosity era of the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <title>Jet Image Tagging Using Deep Learning: An Ensemble Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet classification in high-energy particle physics is important for understanding fundamental interactions and probing phenomena beyond the Standard Model. Jets originate from the fragmentation and hadronization of quarks and gluons, and pose a challenge for identification due to their complex, multidimensional structure. Traditional classification methods often fall short in capturing these intricacies, necessitating advanced machine learning approaches. In this paper, we employ two neural networks simultaneously as an ensemble to tag various jet types. We convert the jet data to two-dimensional histograms instead of representing them as points in a higher-dimensional space. Specifically, this ensemble approach, hereafter referred to as Ensemble Model, is used to tag jets into classes from the JetNet dataset, corresponding to: Top Quarks, Light Quarks (up or down), and W and Z bosons. For the jet classes mentioned above, we show that the Ensemble Model can be used for both binary and multi-categorical classification. This ensemble approach learns jet features by leveraging the strengths of each constituent network achieving superior performance compared to either individual network.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory Factorization for Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a factorization formula for coherent and incoherent $ep$ diffraction using the soft collinear effective theory, utilizing multiple power expansion parameters to handle different kinematic regions. This goes beyond the known hard-collinear diffractive factorization to address the small-$x$ Regge dynamics and Pomeron exchange from first principles. The effective field theory analysis also uncovers and factorizes an important irreducible incoherent background generated by color-nonsinglet exchange, dubbed "quasi-diffraction", for which we calculate the associated Sudakov suppression. For unpolarized scattering we show that there are four diffractive structure functions at leading power, and point out the importance of studying $F_{3,4}^D$ through asymmetries, in addition to $F_{2,L}^D$. For the quasi-diffractive background, we make model independent predictions for ratios of the corresponding structure functions in a perturbative kinematic region. Our analysis also makes predictions for six leading-power spin-dependent structure functions. Finally, we provide connections to diffractive parton distributions, and assess the Ingelman-Schlein model. Our work lays a path for further QCD-based studies of diffraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are new detector proposals and R&amp;D that utilize quantum enhancements not previously adopted. Examples include superconducting quantum sensors, atom interferometry, and quantum spin sensors. They are mainly motivated by industrial applications toward quantum computing, secure quantum communication systems, and high-sensitivity sensors. Given the excellent potential of the new quantum measurement systems, there are also new proposals to apply them in particle physics and cosmology. In this review, I survey currently available and emerging quantum technologies and their applications. I then discuss future directions and new proposals for particle physics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy spin-$\frac {3}{2} $ baryons spectrum in the ground and excited states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study employs QCD sum rules to predict the masses and residues of spin-$\frac {3}{2} $ doubly heavy baryons including two heavy quarks (c and/or b) and one light quark, specifically focusing on $ \Xi_{cc}^*$, $ \Xi_{bc}^*$, $ \Xi_{bb}^*$, $ \Omega_{cc}^*$, $ \Omega_{bc}^*$ and $ \Omega_{bb}^*$. Our study provides results for the ground state ($1S$), first orbital excitation ($1P$), and the first radial excitation ($2S$), within a consistent theoretical framework. In addition to mass spectra, we provide residue calculations as well. The calculated residues are essential for estimating the decay widths and branching ratios of these baryons at different decay channels. Our analysis incorporates nonperturbative QCD effects through operators up to dimension ten, leading to improved precision in the mass and residue calculations. These predictions offer crucial guidance for ongoing and future experimental searches, particularly in light of the current lack of empirical data for the ground and excited states, and provide a basis for comparison with future experimental data.</description>

      <title>Development of superfluid helium-3 bolometry using nanowire resonators with SQUID readout for the QUEST-DMC experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superfluid helium-3 bolometers can be utilised for dark matter direct detection searches. The extremely low heat capacity of the B phase of the superfluid helium-3 at ultra-low temperatures offers the potential to reach world leading sensitivity to spin dependent interactions of dark matter in the sub-GeV/c$^2$ mass range. Here, we describe the development of bolometry using both micron scale and sub-micron diameter vibrating wire resonators, with a SQUID amplifier-based readout scheme. Characterisation of the resonators and bolometer measurements are shown, including the use of non-linear operation and the corresponding corrections. The bolometer contains two vibrating wire resonators, enabling heat injection calibration and simultaneous bolometer tracking measurements. Coincident events measured on both vibrating wire resonators verify their response. We also demonstrate proof of concept frequency multiplexed readout. Development of these measurement techniques lays the foundations for the use of superfluid helium-3 bolometers, instrumented with vibrating nano-mechanical resonators, for future low threshold dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>Right handed neutrino production from $Z^\prime$ interactions in forward search experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two general $U(1)$ extensions of the Standard Model (SM) those generate tiny neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism after general $U(1)$ breaking. These models predict a new neutral gauge boson ($Z'$) and right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), the latter introduced for anomaly cancellation and neutrino mass generation. In both scenarios, left- and right-handed fermions couple differently to the $Z'$, and RHNs mix with light neutrinos, enabling variety of decay modes. Focusing on the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) and the future FASER2 experiment, we explore RHN pair production from $Z'$ decays in two cases: (i) long-lived $Z'$ decays to visible modes and long-lived RHNs, and (ii) short-lived $Z'$ decays to long-lived RHNs, which further decay visibly inside FASER2. We estimate projected limits on the general $U(1)$ gauge coupling, $Z'$ mass, RHN mass, and light-heavy neutrino mixing for various $U(1)$ charge assignments, and compare them with current experimental bounds.</description>

      <title>Search for a neutral gauge boson with nonuniversal fermion couplings in vector boson fusion processes in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first search for a heavy neutral spin-1 gauge boson (Z') with nonuniversal fermion couplings produced via vector boson fusion processes and decaying to tau leptons or W bosons is presented. The analysis is performed using LHC data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, collected from 2016 to 2018 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The data are consistent with the standard model predictions. Upper limits are set on the product of the cross section for production of the Z' boson and its branching fraction to $\tau\tau$ or WW. The presence of a Z' boson decaying to $\tau^+\tau^-$ (W$^+$W$^-$) is excluded for masses up to 2.45 (1.60) TeV, depending on the Z' boson coupling to SM weak bosons, and assuming a Z' $\to$ $\tau^+\tau^-$ (W$^+$W$^-$) branching fraction of 50%.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the production cross-sections of a Higgs boson in association with a vector boson and decaying into $WW^\ast$ with the ATLAS detector at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>

Abstract: Measurements of the total and differential Higgs boson production cross-sections, via $WH$ and $ZH$ associated production using $H\rightarrow WW^\ast\rightarrow\ell\nu\ell\nu$ and $H\rightarrow WW^\ast\rightarrow\ell\nu jj$ decays, are presented. The analysis uses proton-proton events delivered by the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector between 2015 and 2018. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$. The sum of the $WH$ and $ZH$ cross-sections times the $H\rightarrow WW^\ast$ branching fraction is measured to be $0.44^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ (stat.) $^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ (syst.) pb, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction. Higgs boson production is further characterised through measurements of the differential cross-section as a function of the transverse momentum of the vector boson and in the framework of Simplified Template Cross-Sections.</description>

      <title>Multijet topology in high-energy nuclear collisions: jet broadening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first theoretical investigation of the medium modification of jet broadening as an event-shape observable in multijet final states due to jet quenching in high-energy nuclear collisions. The partonic spectrum of $pp$ collisions with next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV is provided by the POWHEG$+$PYTHIA8 event generator, while the linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model is utilized to investigate the energy loss of fast partons as they traverse through the hot and dense QCD medium. We present the jet broadening distributions in multijet final states for both $pp$ and PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV, then observe an enhancement at the small jet broadening region and suppression at the large jet broadening region in PbPb collisions relative to that in $pp$. This suggests that medium modification with parton energy loss in the QGP leads to a more concentrated energy flow in all observed multijet events in PbPb reactions. We also demonstrate that the intertwining of two effects, the jet number reduction and the restructured contribution, results in the novel behavior of nuclear modification of the jet broadening observable in PbPb collisions.</description>

      <title>Evidence for similar collectivity of high transverse momentum particles in pPb and PbPb collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charged hadron elliptic anisotropies ($v_2$) are presented over a wide transverse momentum ($p_\text{T}$) range for proton-lead (pPb) and lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energies of 8.16 and 5.02 TeV, respectively. The data were recorded by the CMS experiment and correspond to integrated luminosities of 186 nb$^{-1}$ and 0.607 nb$^{-1}$ for the pPb and PbPb systems, respectively. A four-particle cumulant analysis is performed using subevents separated in pseudorapidity to effectively suppress non-collective effects. At high $p_\text{T}$ ($p_\text{T}$ $\gt$ 8 GeV), significant positive $v_2$ values are observed that are similar between pPb and PbPb collisions at comparable charged particle multiplicities. This observation suggests a common origin for the multi-particle collectivity for high-$p_\text{T}$ particles in the two systems.</description>
