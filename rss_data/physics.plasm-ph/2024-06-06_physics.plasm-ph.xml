      <title>Physical Origin of H-Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high confinement mode (H-mode), the most important operation mode for the nuclear fusion reactor, has been studied for 42 years, but the transition mechanism has not been unanimously agreed so far. Four decades of H-mode experiments revealed many features of heating power threshold (Pth) for the low to high confinement (L-H) transition, where Pth is proportional to the toroidal magnetic field (B), inversely proportional to the ion mass (mi), and Pth has U-shaped dependence on the plasma density. It is found for the first time that this U-shaped rollover dependence came from Pth is inversely proportional to the multiplication of plasma density (ni) and the squire of neutral density (nn). The reason for the neutral density involved in the L-H transition is that the turbulence suppression takes place by the viscous force of the ion-neutral friction. When the plasma is in the equilibrium by the compensation of turbulence-induced return current to the gyro-center shift current generated by the ion-neutral charge exchanges, the Reynolds number (Re), the ratio of inertial force to the viscous force, can predict the onset of laminar to turbulent flow. Re for the plasma-neutral interaction is proportional to B / (mi nin^2n) which is well agreed with the experimental results of Pth. Re is also proportional to the second gradient of the radial electric field which is agreed with experiments. 15 characteristics of L-H transition are explained by Re including the feature of Pth having favorable dependence on the ion grad B drift toward the x-point.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Ion-Acoustic Waves with Landau Damping in Non-Maxwellian Space Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of nonlinear ion-acoustic solitary waves in the presence of kinetic (Landau type) damping have been investigated in a collisionless, non-magnetized electron-ion plasma. A cold ion fluid model, coupled to a Vlasov-type kinetic equation for the electron dynamics, has been adopted as a starting point. The electron population was assumed to be in a kappa-distributed state, in account of the non-Maxwellian behavior of energetic (suprathermal) electrons often observed in Space. A multiscale perturbation technique has led to an evolution equation for the electrostatic potential, in the form of a modified Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, incorporating a non-local term accounting for Landau damping (associated with the electron statistics). Exact analytical solutions have been obtained, representing solitary waves undergoing amplitude decay over time. The combined effect of Landau damping and non-Maxwellian electron statistics (via the kappa parameter) on the characteristics of IASWs has been examined. Numerical integration of the evolution equation has been undertaken, to elucidate the importance of kinetic Landau damping on a shock-shaped initial condition. The results of this investigation aim to improve our understanding of the dynamics of nonlinear electrostatic waves under the influence of Landau damping in various space plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Turbulent relaxation patterns in SOL plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relaxations of localized over-density in a plane transverse to the magnetic field are numericallyinvestigated under the effect of drift-wave and interchange drives in SOL conditions. Such a controlleddeparture from thermodynamic equilibrium allows the investigation of fundamental processesat play in cross-field transport. Interchange instabilities generate ballistic outward radial flux withlow amplitude zonal flow patterns, whereas drift-wave instabilities result in symmetric radial fluxwith large amplitude zonal flow patterns. When both instabilities are considered, the combinedeffects tend to favor drift-waves, leading to a weaker outward flux with larger zonal flow patterns.</description>

      <title>Effects of Mosaic Crystal Instrument Functions on X-ray Thomson Scattering Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mosaic crystals, with their high integrated reflectivities, are widely-employed in spectrometers used to diagnose high energy density systems. X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) has emerged as a powerful diagnostic tool of these systems, providing in principle direct access to important properties such as the temperature via detailed balance. However, the measured XRTS spectrum is broadened by the spectrometer instrument function (IF), and without careful consideration of the IF one risks misdiagnosing system conditions. Here, we consider in detail the IF of mosaic crystals and how the broadening varies across the spectrometer. Notably, we find a strong asymmetry in the shape of the IF towards higher energies. As an example, we consider the effect on the inferred temperature, and find that it can be overestimated if an approximate symmetric IF is used. We therefore expect a detailed consideration of the full IF will have an important impact on system properties inferred via XRTS in both forward modelling and model-free approaches.</description>

      <title>Characterization of foam-filled hohlraums for inertial fusion experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the path towards high-gain inertial confinement fusion ignition, foams are being considered to tamp the hohlraum wall-motion, and mitigate laser backscattering from Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) and Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS). Here we present the results from an experimental campaign on foam-filled hohlraums conducted at the OMEGA laser facility. SiO2 foam-fills, with densities as low as 1 mg/cm3, successfully reduce the gold wall expansion, with laser backscattering comparable to gas-fill.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the blowout plasma wakefields produced by drive beams with elliptical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the underdense (blowout) regime of plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA), the particle beam is denser than the plasma. Under these conditions, the plasma electrons are nearly completely rarefacted from the beam channel, resulting in a nominally uniform ion column. Extensive investigations of this interaction assuming axisymmetry have been undertaken. However, the plasma blowout produced by a transversely asymmetric driver possesses quite different characteristics. They create an asymmetric plasma rarefaction region (bubble) which leads to asymmetric focusing in the two transverse planes. This is also accompanied by an undesired non-uniform accelerating gradient. The asymmetric blowout cross-section is found through simulation to be elliptical, and treating it as such permits a simple extension of the symmetric theory. In particular, focusing fields linear in both transverse directions exist in the bubble. The form of the wake potential and the concomitant matching conditions in this elliptical cavity are discussed in this paper. We also discuss bubble boundary estimation in the long driver limit and applications of the asymmetric features of the wakefield.</description>

      <title>General-Relativistic Gauge-Invariant Magnetic Helicity Transport: Basic Formulation and Application to Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamo processes are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems. In relativistic astrophysical systems, such as accretion disks around black holes or neutron stars, they may critically affect the launching of winds and jets that can power electromagnetic emission. Dynamo processes are governed by several microscopic parameters, one of them being magnetic helicity. As a conserved quantity in nonresistive plasmas, magnetic helicity is transported across the system. One important implication of helicity conservation is, that in the absence of helicity fluxes some mean-field dynamos can be quenched, potentially affecting the large-scale evolution of the magnetic field. One of the major challenges in computing magnetic helicity is the need to fix a meaningful electromagnetic gauge. We here present a fully covariant formulation of magnetic helicity transport in general-relativistic plasmas based on the concept of relative helicity by Berger &amp; Field and Finn &amp; Antonsen. This formulation is separately invariant under gauge-transformation of the Maxwell and Einstein equations. As an application of this new formalism we present the first analysis of magnetic helicity transport in the merger of two neutron stars. We demonstrate the presence of global helicity fluxes into the outer layers of the stellar merger remnant, which may impact subsequent large-scale dynamo amplification in these regions.</description>

      <title>Whistler waves in the quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular magnetosheath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Earth's magnetosheath (MSH), several processes contribute to energy dissipation and plasma heating, one of which is wave-particle interactions between whistler waves and electrons. However, the overall impact of whistlers on electron dynamics in the MSH remains to be quantified. We analyze 18 hours of burst-mode measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, including data from the unbiased magnetosheath campaign during February-March 2023. We present a statistical study of 34,409 whistler waves found using automatic detection. We compare wave occurrence in the different MSH geometries and find three times higher occurrence in the quasi-perpendicular MSH compared to the quasi-parallel case. We also study the wave properties and find that the waves propagate quasi-parallel to the background magnetic field, have a median frequency of 0.2 times the electron cyclotron frequency, median amplitude of 0.03-0.06 nT (30-60 pT), and median duration of a few tens of wave periods. The whistler waves are preferentially observed in local magnetic dips and density peaks and are not associated with an increased temperature anisotropy. Also, almost no whistlers are observed in regions with parallel electron plasma beta lower than 0.1. Importantly, when estimating pitch-angle diffusion times we find that the whistler waves cause significant pitch-angle scattering of electrons in the MSH.</description>

      <title>Effect of mismatch on Doppler backscattering in MAST and MAST-U plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.17141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Doppler backscattering (DBS) diagnostic, also referred to as Doppler reflectometry, measures turbulent density fluctuations of intermediate length scales. However, when the beam's wavevector is not properly aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field, the backscattered power is attenuated. In previous work, we used beam tracing and reciprocity to derive this mismatch attenuation quantitatively. In this paper, we applied our model, in the small but finite mismatch limit, to a several new cases. We compared our predictions with multiple O-mode channels for the first time. We then identified a $\sim 3^{\circ}$ error in the MAST Q-band's quasioptics, showing that our model is useful for commissioning DBS diagnostics. For both O- and X-mode, we compared experimental data with our model's predictions at multiple times during the shots, unlike our previous work, where only a single time was analysed. Finally, we analysed other contributions to the backscattered signal, evaluating how much they affect our measurements of mismatch attenuation, giving comparisons with data from both MAST and MAST-U. This paper's detailed study systematically validates and demonstrates the usefulness of our model for quantitatively interpreting DBS data from spherical tokamaks.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric hybrid Vlasov equilibria with applications to tokamak plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive axisymmetric equilibrium equations in the context of the hybrid Vlasov model with kinetic ions and massless fluid electrons, assuming isothermal electrons and deformed Maxwellian distribution functions for the kinetic ions. The equilibrium system comprises a Grad-Shafranov partial differential equation and an integral equation. These equations can be utilized to calculate the equilibrium magnetic field and ion distribution function, respectively, for given particle density or given ion and electron toroidal current density profiles. The resulting solutions describe states characterized by toroidal plasma rotation and toroidal electric current density. Additionally, due to the presence of fluid electrons, these equilibria also exhibit a poloidal current density component. This is in contrast to the fully kinetic Vlasov model, where axisymmetric Jeans equilibria can only accommodate toroidal currents and flows, given the absence of a third integral of the microscopic motion.</description>

      <title>Elastic properties of three-dimensional Yukawa or dust-crystals from molecular dynamic simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I calculate elastic properties of three-dimensional Yukawa or dust-crystals using molecular dynamic simulations. The elastic properties are computed by deforming (compressing/expanding) a cubic dust crystal along different directions. The bulk modulus, shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio are determined as a function of shielding parameter $\kappa$ and strong coupling parameter $\Gamma$. Furthermore, I calculate sound wave velocity and shear wave velocity using bulk and shear modulus values and compare them with the velocities obtained from the slope of longitudinal and transverse wave dispersion relations. It is found that the sound and shear velocities obtained using bulk and shear modulus agree with the experimental values.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Risk of Proliferation via Fissile Material Breeding in ARC-class Fusion Power Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Construction of a nuclear weapon requires access to kilogram-scale quantities of fissile material, which can be bred from fertile material like U-238 and Th-232 via neutron capture. Future fusion power plants, with total neutron source rates in excess of $10^{20}$ n/s, could breed weapons-relevant quantities of fissile material on short timescales, posing a breakout proliferation risk. The ARC-class fusion reactor design is characterized by demountable high temperature superconducting magnets, a FLiBe liquid immersion blanket, and a relatively small size ($\sim$ 4 m major radius, $\sim$ 1 m minor radius). We use the open-source Monte Carlo neutronics code OpenMC to perform self-consistent time-dependent simulations of a representative ARC-class blanket to assess the feasibility of a fissile breeding breakout scenario. We find that a significant quantity of fissile material can be bred in less than six months of full power operation for initial fertile inventories ranging from 5 to 50 metric tons, representing a non-negligible proliferation risk. We further study the feasibility of this scenario by examining other consequences of fissile breeding such as reduced tritium breeding ratio, extra heat from fission and decay heat, isotopic purity of bred material, and self-protection time of irradiated blanket material. We also examine the impact of Li-6 enrichment on fissile breeding and find that it substantially reduces breeding rate, motivating its use as a proliferation resistance tool.</description>
