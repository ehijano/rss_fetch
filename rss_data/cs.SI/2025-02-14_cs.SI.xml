      <title>AgentSociety: Large-Scale Simulation of LLM-Driven Generative Agents Advances Understanding of Human Behaviors and Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding human behavior and society is a central focus in social sciences, with the rise of generative social science marking a significant paradigmatic shift. By leveraging bottom-up simulations, it replaces costly and logistically challenging traditional experiments with scalable, replicable, and systematic computational approaches for studying complex social dynamics. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have further transformed this research paradigm, enabling the creation of human-like generative social agents and realistic simulacra of society. In this paper, we propose AgentSociety, a large-scale social simulator that integrates LLM-driven agents, a realistic societal environment, and a powerful large-scale simulation engine. Based on the proposed simulator, we generate social lives for over 10k agents, simulating their 5 million interactions both among agents and between agents and their environment. Furthermore, we explore the potential of AgentSociety as a testbed for computational social experiments, focusing on four key social issues: polarization, the spread of inflammatory messages, the effects of universal basic income policies, and the impact of external shocks such as hurricanes. These four issues serve as valuable cases for assessing AgentSociety's support for typical research methods -- such as surveys, interviews, and interventions -- as well as for investigating the patterns, causes, and underlying mechanisms of social issues. The alignment between AgentSociety's outcomes and real-world experimental results not only demonstrates its ability to capture human behaviors and their underlying mechanisms, but also underscores its potential as an important platform for social scientists and policymakers.</description>

      <title>Delayed takedown of illegal content on social media makes moderation ineffective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms face legal and regulatory demands to swiftly remove illegal content, sometimes under strict takedown deadlines. However, the effects of moderation speed and the impact of takedown deadlines remain underexplored. This study models the relationship between the timeliness of illegal content removal and its prevalence, reach, and exposure on social media. By simulating illegal content diffusion using empirical data from the DSA Transparency Database, we demonstrate that rapid takedown (within hours) significantly reduces illegal content prevalence and exposure, while longer delays decrease the effectiveness of moderation efforts. While these findings support tight takedown deadlines for content removal, such deadlines cannot address the delay in identifying the illegal content and can adversely affect the quality of content moderation.</description>

      <title>Criteria-Aware Graph Filtering: Extremely Fast Yet Accurate Multi-Criteria Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-criteria (MC) recommender systems, which utilize MC rating information for recommendation, are increasingly widespread in various e-commerce domains. However, the MC recommendation using training-based collaborative filtering, requiring consideration of multiple ratings compared to single-criterion counterparts, often poses practical challenges in achieving state-of-the-art performance along with scalable model training. To solve this problem, we propose CA-GF, a training-free MC recommendation method, which is built upon criteria-aware graph filtering for efficient yet accurate MC recommendations. Specifically, first, we construct an item-item similarity graph using an MC user-expansion graph. Next, we design CA-GF composed of the following key components, including 1) criterion-specific graph filtering where the optimal filter for each criterion is found using various types of polynomial low-pass filters and 2) criteria preference-infused aggregation where the smoothed signals from each criterion are aggregated. We demonstrate that CA-GF is (a) efficient: providing the computational efficiency, offering the extremely fast runtime of less than 0.2 seconds even on the largest benchmark dataset, (b) accurate: outperforming benchmark MC recommendation methods, achieving substantial accuracy gains up to 24% compared to the best competitor, and (c) interpretable: providing interpretations for the contribution of each criterion to the model prediction based on visualizations.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Member-Group Relations via Multi-View Graph Filtering for Effective Group Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group recommendation aims at providing optimized recommendations tailored to diverse groups, enabling groups to enjoy appropriate items. On the other hand, most existing group recommendation methods are built upon deep neural network (DNN) architectures designed to capture the intricate relationships between member-level and group-level interactions. While these DNN-based approaches have proven their effectiveness, they require complex and expensive training procedures to incorporate group-level interactions in addition to member-level interactions. To overcome such limitations, we introduce Group-GF, a new approach for extremely fast recommendations of items to each group via multi-view graph filtering (GF) that offers a holistic view of complex member-group dynamics, without the need for costly model training. Specifically, in Group-GF, we first construct three item similarity graphs manifesting different viewpoints for GF. Then, we discover a distinct polynomial graph filter for each similarity graph and judiciously aggregate the three graph filters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Group-GF in terms of significantly reducing runtime and achieving state-of-the-art recommendation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Anchor Sponsor Firms in Open Source Software Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Firms are intensifying their involvement with open source software (OSS), going beyond contributing to individual projects and releasing their own core technologies as OSS. These technologies, from web frameworks to programming languages, are the foundations of large and growing ecosystems. Yet we know little about how these anchor sponsors shape the behavior of OSS contributors. We examine Mozilla Corporation's role as incubator and anchor sponsor in the Rust programming language ecosystem, leveraging data on nearly 30,000 developers and 40,000 OSS projects from 2015 to 2022. When Mozilla abruptly exited Rust in August 2020, event-study models estimate a negative impact on ecosystem activity: a 9\% immediate drop in weekly commits and a 0.6 percentage point decline in trend. We observe an asymmetry in the shock's effects: former Mozilla developers and close collaborators continued contributing relatively quickly, whereas more distant developers showed reduced or ceased activity even six months later. An agent-based model of an OSS ecosystem with an anchor sponsor replicates these patterns. We also find a marked slowdown in new developers and projects entering Rust post-shock. Our results suggest that Mozilla served as a critical signal of Rust's quality and stability. Once withdrawn, newcomers and less-embedded developers were the most discouraged, raising concerns about long-term ecosystem sustainability.</description>

      <title>Drivers of cooperation in social dilemmas on higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding cooperation in social dilemmas requires models that capture the complexity of real-world interactions. While network frameworks have provided valuable insights to model the evolution of cooperation, they are unable to encode group interactions properly. Here, we introduce a general higher-order network framework for multi-player games on structured populations. Our model considers multi-dimensional strategies, based on the observation that social behaviours are affected by the size of the group interaction. We investigate dynamical and structural coupling between different orders of interactions, revealing the crucial role of nested multilevel interactions, and showing how such features can enhance cooperation beyond the limit of traditional models with uni-dimensional strategies. Our work identifies the key drivers promoting cooperative behaviour commonly observed in real-world group social dilemmas.</description>

      <title>Representing the Disciplinary Structure of Physics: A Comparative Evaluation of Graph and Text Embedding Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning offer new ways to represent and study scholarly works and the space of knowledge. Graph and text embeddings provide a convenient vector representation of scholarly works based on citations and text. Yet, it is unclear whether their representations are consistent or provide different views of the structure of science. Here, we compare graph and text embedding by testing their ability to capture the hierarchical structure of the Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme (PACS) of papers published by the American Physical Society (APS). We also provide a qualitative comparison of the overall structure of the graph and text embeddings for reference. We find that neural network-based methods outperform traditional methods and graph embedding methods such as node2vec are better than other methods at capturing the PACS structure. Our results call for further investigations into how different contexts of scientific papers are captured by different methods, and how we can combine and leverage such information in an interpretable manner.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Reliability Criteria for News Publishers with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the use of a large language model to assist in the evaluation of the reliability of the vast number of existing online news publishers, addressing the impracticality of relying solely on human expert annotators for this task. In the context of the Italian news media market, we first task the model with evaluating expert-designed reliability criteria using a representative sample of news articles. We then compare the model's answers with those of human experts. The dataset consists of 340 news articles, each annotated by two human experts and the LLM. Six criteria are taken into account, for a total of 6,120 annotations. We observe good agreement between LLM and human annotators in three of the six evaluated criteria, including the critical ability to detect instances where a text negatively targets an entity or individual. For two additional criteria, such as the detection of sensational language and the recognition of bias in news content, LLMs generate fair annotations, albeit with certain trade-offs. Furthermore, we show that the LLM is able to help resolve disagreements among human experts, especially in tasks such as identifying cases of negative targeting.</description>

Abstract: Existing methods for assessing the trustworthiness of news publishers face high costs and scalability issues. The tool presented in this paper supports the efforts of specialized organizations by providing a solution that, starting from an online discussion, provides (i) trustworthiness ratings for previously unclassified news publishers and (ii) an interactive platform to guide annotation efforts and improve the robustness of the ratings. The system implements a novel framework for assessing the trustworthiness of online news publishers based on user interactions on social media platforms.</description>

      <title>On Distance Preserving and Sequentially Distance Preserving Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:1701.06404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph $H$ is an \emph{isometric} subgraph of $G$ if $d_H(u,v)= d_G(u,v)$, for every pair~$u,v\in V(H)$. A graph is \emph{distance preserving} if it has an isometric subgraph of every possible order. A graph is \emph{sequentially distance preserving} if its vertices can be ordered such that deleting the first $i$ vertices results in an isometric subgraph, for all $i\ge1$. We give an equivalent condition to sequentially distance preserving based upon simplicial orderings. Using this condition, we prove that if a graph does not contain any induced cycles of length~$5$ or greater, then it is sequentially distance preserving and thus distance preserving. Next we consider the distance preserving property on graphs with a cut vertex. Finally, we define a family of non-distance preserving graphs constructed from cycles.</description>

      <title>The Dual Imperative: Innovation and Regulation in the AI Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article addresses the societal costs associated with the lack of regulation in Artificial Intelligence and proposes a framework combining innovation and regulation. Over fifty years of AI research, catalyzed by declining computing costs and the proliferation of data, have propelled AI into the mainstream, promising significant economic benefits. Yet, this rapid adoption underscores risks, from bias amplification and labor disruptions to existential threats posed by autonomous systems. The discourse is polarized between accelerationists, advocating for unfettered technological advancement, and doomers, calling for a slowdown to prevent dystopian outcomes. This piece advocates for a middle path that leverages technical innovation and smart regulation to maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing its risks, offering a pragmatic approach to the responsible progress of AI technology. Technical invention beyond the most capable foundation models is needed to contain catastrophic risks. Regulation is required to create incentives for this research while addressing current issues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous research pays attention to how users strategically understand and consciously interact with algorithms but mainly focuses on an individual level, making it difficult to explore how users within communities could develop a collective understanding of algorithms and organize collective algorithmic actions. Through a two-year ethnography of online fan activities, this study investigates 43 core fans who always organize large-scale fans collective actions and their corresponding general fan groups. This study aims to reveal how these core fans mobilize millions of general fans through collective algorithmic actions. These core fans reported the rhetorical strategies used to persuade general fans, the steps taken to build a collective understanding of algorithms, and the collaborative processes that adapt collective actions across platforms and cultures. Our findings highlight the key factors that enable computer-supported collective algorithmic actions and extend collective action research into the large-scale domain targeting algorithms.</description>

      <title>"It Might be Technically Impressive, But It's Practically Useless to us": Motivations, Practices, Challenges, and Opportunities for Cross-Functional Collaboration around AI within the News Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, an increasing number of news organizations have integrated artificial intelligence (AI) into their workflows, leading to a further influx of AI technologists and data workers into the news industry. This has initiated cross-functional collaborations between these professionals and journalists. Although prior research has explored the impact of AI-related roles entering the news industry, there is a lack of studies on how internal cross-functional collaboration around AI unfolds between AI professionals and journalists within the news industry. Through interviews with 17 journalists, six AI technologists, and three AI workers with cross-functional experience from leading Chinese news organizations, we investigate the practices, challenges, and opportunities for internal cross-functional collaboration around AI in news industry. We first study how these journalists and AI professionals perceive existing internal cross-collaboration strategies. We explore the challenges of cross-functional collaboration and provide recommendations for enhancing future cross-functional collaboration around AI in the news industry.</description>

      <title>Is Science Inevitable?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using large-scale citation data and a breakthrough metric, the study systematically evaluates the inevitability of scientific breakthroughs. We find that scientific breakthroughs emerge as multiple discoveries rather than singular events. Through analysis of over 40 million journal articles, we identify multiple discoveries as papers that independently displace the same reference using the Disruption Index (D-index), suggesting functional equivalence. Our findings support Merton's core argument that scientific discoveries arise from historical context rather than individual genius. The results reveal a long-tail distribution pattern of multiple discoveries across various datasets, challenging Merton's Poisson model while reinforcing the structural inevitability of scientific progress.</description>
