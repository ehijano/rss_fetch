      <title>MA-DPR: Manifold-aware Distance Metrics for Dense Passage Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) typically relies on Euclidean or cosine distance to measure query-passage relevance in embedding space, which is effective when embeddings lie on a linear manifold. However, our experiments across DPR benchmarks suggest that embeddings often lie on lower-dimensional, non-linear manifolds, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, where cosine and Euclidean distance fail to capture semantic similarity. To address this limitation, we propose a manifold-aware distance metric for DPR (MA-DPR) that models the intrinsic manifold structure of passages using a nearest neighbor graph and measures query-passage distance based on their shortest path in this graph. We show that MA-DPR outperforms Euclidean and cosine distances by up to 26% on OOD passage retrieval with comparable in-distribution performance across various embedding models while incurring a minimal increase in query inference time. Empirical evidence suggests that manifold-aware distance allows DPR to leverage context from related neighboring passages, making it effective even in the absence of direct semantic overlap. MADPR can be applied to a wide range of dense embedding and retrieval tasks, offering potential benefits across a wide spectrum of domains.</description>

      <title>Modernizing Facebook Scoped Search: Keyword and Embedding Hybrid Retrieval with LLM Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond general web-scale search, social network search uniquely enables users to retrieve information and discover potential connections within their social context. We introduce a framework of modernized Facebook Group Scoped Search by blending traditional keyword-based retrieval with embedding-based retrieval (EBR) to improve the search relevance and diversity of search results. Our system integrates semantic retrieval into the existing keyword search pipeline, enabling users to discover more contextually relevant group posts. To rigorously assess the impact of this blended approach, we introduce a novel evaluation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to perform offline relevance assessments, providing scalable and consistent quality benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that the blended retrieval system significantly enhances user engagement and search quality, as validated by both online metrics and LLM-based evaluation. This work offers practical insights for deploying and evaluating advanced retrieval systems in large-scale, real-world social platforms.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: Aligning Knowledge Bases with User Needs to Enhance Mental Health Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to reliable mental health information is vital for early help-seeking, yet expanding knowledge bases is resource-intensive and often misaligned with user needs. This results in poor performance of retrieval systems when presented concerns are not covered or expressed in informal or contextualized language. We present an AI-based gap-informed framework for corpus augmentation that authentically identifies underrepresented topics (gaps) by overlaying naturalistic user data such as forum posts in order to prioritize expansions based on coverage and usefulness. In a case study, we compare Directed (gap-informed augmentations) with Non-Directed augmentation (random additions), evaluating the relevance and usefulness of retrieved information across four retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. Directed augmentation achieved near-optimal performance with modest expansions--requiring only a 42% increase for Query Transformation, 74% for Reranking and Hierarchical, and 318% for Baseline--to reach ~95% of the performance of an exhaustive reference corpus. In contrast, Non-Directed augmentation required substantially larger and thus practically infeasible expansions to achieve comparable performance (232%, 318%, 403%, and 763%, respectively). These results show that strategically targeted corpus growth can reduce content creation demands while sustaining high retrieval and provision quality, offering a scalable approach for building trusted health information repositories and supporting generative AI applications in high-stakes domains.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Time Awareness in Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm that formulates the recommendations into a text-to-text generation task, harnessing the vast knowledge of large language models. However, existing studies focus on considering the sequential order of items and neglect to handle the temporal dynamics across items, which can imply evolving user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose a novel model, Generative Recommender Using Time awareness (GRUT), effectively capturing hidden user preferences via various temporal signals. We first introduce Time-aware Prompting, consisting of two key contexts. The user-level temporal context models personalized temporal patterns across timestamps and time intervals, while the item-level transition context provides transition patterns across users. We also devise Trend-aware Inference, a training-free method that enhances rankings by incorporating trend information about items with generation likelihood. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRUT outperforms state-of-the-art models, with gains of up to 15.4% and 14.3% in Recall@5 and NDCG@5 across four benchmark datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/skleee/GRUT.</description>

      <title>GEM-Bench: A Benchmark for Ad-Injected Response Generation within Generative Engine Marketing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Engine Marketing (GEM) is an emerging ecosystem for monetizing generative engines, such as LLM-based chatbots, by seamlessly integrating relevant advertisements into their responses. At the core of GEM lies the generation and evaluation of ad-injected responses. However, existing benchmarks are not specifically designed for this purpose, which limits future research. To address this gap, we propose GEM-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for ad-injected response generation in GEM. GEM-Bench includes three curated datasets covering both chatbot and search scenarios, a metric ontology that captures multiple dimensions of user satisfaction and engagement, and several baseline solutions implemented within an extensible multi-agent framework. Our preliminary results indicate that, while simple prompt-based methods achieve reasonable engagement such as click-through rate, they often reduce user satisfaction. In contrast, approaches that insert ads based on pre-generated ad-free responses help mitigate this issue but introduce additional overhead. These findings highlight the need for future research on designing more effective and efficient solutions for generating ad-injected responses in GEM.</description>

      <title>Annotating Satellite Images of Forests with Keywords from a Specialized Corpus in the Context of Change Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Amazon rain forest is a vital ecosystem that plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate and providing habitat for countless species. Deforestation in the Amazon is a major concern as it has a significant impact on global carbon emissions and biodiversity. In this paper, we present a method for detecting deforestation in the Amazon using image pairs from Earth observation satellites. Our method leverages deep learning techniques to compare the images of the same area at different dates and identify changes in the forest cover. We also propose a visual semantic model that automatically annotates the detected changes with relevant keywords. The candidate annotation for images are extracted from scientific documents related to the Amazon region. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of Amazon image pairs and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting deforestation and generating relevant annotations. Our method provides a useful tool for monitoring and studying the impact of deforestation in the Amazon. While we focus on environment applications of our work by using images of deforestation in the Amazon rain forest to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, it is generic enough to be applied to other domains.</description>

      <title>Sequential Data Augmentation for Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative recommendation plays a crucial role in personalized systems, predicting users' future interactions from their historical behavior sequences. A critical yet underexplored factor in training these models is data augmentation, the process of constructing training data from user interaction histories. By shaping the training distribution, data augmentation directly and often substantially affects model generalization and performance. Nevertheless, in much of the existing work, this process is simplified, applied inconsistently, or treated as a minor design choice, without a systematic and principled understanding of its effects.
  Motivated by our empirical finding that different augmentation strategies can yield large performance disparities, we conduct an in-depth analysis of how they reshape training distributions and influence alignment with future targets and generalization to unseen inputs. To systematize this design space, we propose GenPAS, a generalized and principled framework that models augmentation as a stochastic sampling process over input-target pairs with three bias-controlled steps: sequence sampling, target sampling, and input sampling. This formulation unifies widely used strategies as special cases and enables flexible control of the resulting training distribution. Our extensive experiments on benchmark and industrial datasets demonstrate that GenPAS yields superior accuracy, data efficiency, and parameter efficiency compared to existing strategies, providing practical guidance for principled training data construction in generative recommendation.</description>

      <title>Who Taught the Lie? Responsibility Attribution for Poisoned Knowledge in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge into large language models to improve response quality. However, recent work has shown that RAG systems are highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where malicious texts are inserted into the knowledge database to influence model outputs. While several defenses have been proposed, they are often circumvented by more adaptive or sophisticated attacks.
  This paper presents RAGOrigin, a black-box responsibility attribution framework designed to identify which texts in the knowledge database are responsible for misleading or incorrect generations. Our method constructs a focused attribution scope tailored to each misgeneration event and assigns a responsibility score to each candidate text by evaluating its retrieval ranking, semantic relevance, and influence on the generated response. The system then isolates poisoned texts using an unsupervised clustering method. We evaluate RAGOrigin across seven datasets and fifteen poisoning attacks, including newly developed adaptive poisoning strategies and multi-attacker scenarios. Our approach outperforms existing baselines in identifying poisoned content and remains robust under dynamic and noisy conditions. These results suggest that RAGOrigin provides a practical and effective solution for tracing the origins of corrupted knowledge in RAG systems.</description>

      <title>MIRA: Empowering One-Touch AI Services on Smartphones with MLLM-based Instruction Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI technologies is driving the integration of diverse AI-powered services into smartphones, transforming how users interact with their devices. To simplify access to predefined AI services, this paper introduces MIRA, a pioneering framework for task instruction recommendation that enables intuitive one-touch AI tasking on smartphones. With MIRA, users can long-press on images or text objects to receive contextually relevant instruction recommendations for executing AI tasks. Our work introduces three key innovations: 1) A multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based recommendation pipeline with structured reasoning to extract key entities, infer user intent, and generate precise instructions; 2) A template-augmented reasoning mechanism that integrates high-level reasoning templates, enhancing task inference accuracy; 3) A prefix-tree-based constrained decoding strategy that restricts outputs to predefined instruction candidates, ensuring coherent and intent-aligned suggestions. Through evaluation using a real-world annotated datasets and a user study, MIRA has demonstrated substantial improvements in the accuracy of instruction recommendation. The encouraging results highlight MIRA's potential to revolutionize the way users engage with AI services on their smartphones, offering a more seamless and efficient experience.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Misinformation in healthcare, from vaccine hesitancy to unproven treatments, poses risks to public health and trust in medical systems. While machine learning and natural language processing have advanced automated fact-checking, validating biomedical claims remains uniquely challenging due to complex terminology, the need for domain expertise, and the critical importance of grounding in scientific evidence. We introduce CER (Combining Evidence and Reasoning), a novel framework for biomedical fact-checking that integrates scientific evidence retrieval, reasoning via large language models, and supervised veracity prediction. By integrating the text-generation capabilities of large language models with advanced retrieval techniques for high-quality biomedical scientific evidence, CER effectively mitigates the risk of hallucinations, ensuring that generated outputs are grounded in verifiable, evidence-based sources. Evaluations on expert-annotated datasets (HealthFC, BioASQ-7b, SciFact) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and promising cross-dataset generalization.

      <title>Towards Unified and Adaptive Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering via Graph Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a foundational approach in recommender systems, but it struggles with challenges such as data sparsity and the cold-start problem. Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has emerged as a promising solution by leveraging dense domains to improve recommendations in sparse target domains. However, existing CDR methods face significant limitations, including their reliance on overlapping users as a bridge between domains and their inability to address domain sensitivity, i.e., differences in user behaviors and characteristics across domains, effectively. To overcome these limitations, we propose CGSP, a unified and adaptive CDR framework based on graph signal processing (GSP). CGSP supports both intra-domain and inter-domain recommendations while adaptively controlling the influence of the source domain through a simple hyperparameter. The framework constructs a cross-domain similarity graph by integrating target-only and source-bridged similarity graphs to capture both intra-domain and inter-domain relationships. This graph is then processed through graph filtering techniques to propagate and enhance local signals. Finally, personalized graph signals are constructed, tailored separately for users in the source and target domains, enabling CGSP to function as a unified framework for CDR scenarios. Extensive evaluation shows that CGSP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse cross-domain settings, with notable gains in low-overlap scenarios, underscoring its practicality for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>DiffHash: Text-Guided Targeted Attack via Diffusion Models against Deep Hashing Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep hashing models have been widely adopted to tackle the challenges of large-scale image retrieval. However, these approaches face serious security risks due to their vulnerability to adversarial examples. Despite the increasing exploration of targeted attacks on deep hashing models, existing approaches still suffer from a lack of multimodal guidance, reliance on labeling information and dependence on pixel-level operations for attacks. To address these limitations, we proposed DiffHash, a novel diffusion-based targeted attack for deep hashing. Unlike traditional pixel-based attacks that directly modify specific pixels and lack multimodal guidance, our approach focuses on optimizing the latent representations of images, guided by text information generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) for the target image. Furthermore, we designed a multi-space hash alignment network to align the high-dimension image space and text space to the low-dimension binary hash space. During reconstruction, we also incorporated text-guided attention mechanisms to refine adversarial examples, ensuring them aligned with the target semantics while maintaining visual plausibility. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) targeted attack methods, achieving better black-box transferability and offering more excellent stability across datasets.</description>

Abstract: As a primary means of information acquisition, information retrieval (IR) systems, such as search engines, have integrated themselves into our daily lives. These systems also serve as components of dialogue, question-answering, and recommender systems. The trajectory of IR has evolved dynamically from its origins in term-based methods to its integration with advanced neural models. While the neural models excel at capturing complex contextual signals and semantic nuances, thereby reshaping the IR landscape, they still face challenges such as data scarcity, interpretability, and the generation of contextually plausible yet potentially inaccurate responses. This evolution requires a combination of both traditional methods (such as term-based sparse retrieval methods with rapid response) and modern neural architectures (such as language models with powerful language understanding capacity). Meanwhile, the emergence of large language models (LLMs), typified by ChatGPT and GPT-4, has revolutionized natural language processing due to their remarkable language understanding, generation, generalization, and reasoning abilities. Consequently, recent research has sought to leverage LLMs to improve IR systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research trajectory, it is necessary to consolidate existing methodologies and provide nuanced insights through a comprehensive overview. In this survey, we delve into the confluence of LLMs and IR systems, including crucial aspects such as query rewriters, retrievers, rerankers, and readers. Additionally, we explore promising directions, such as search agents, within this expanding field.</description>

      <title>Database-Augmented Query Representation for Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information retrieval models that aim to search for documents relevant to a query have shown multiple successes, which have been applied to diverse tasks. Yet, the query from the user is oftentimes short, which challenges the retrievers to correctly fetch relevant documents. To tackle this, previous studies have proposed expanding the query with a couple of additional (user-related) features related to it. However, they may be suboptimal to effectively augment the query, and there is plenty of other information available to augment it in a relational database. Motivated by this fact, we present a novel retrieval framework called Database-Augmented Query representation (DAQu), which augments the original query with various (query-related) metadata across multiple tables. In addition, as the number of features in the metadata can be very large and there is no order among them, we encode them with the graph-based set-encoding strategy, which considers hierarchies of features in the database without order. We validate our DAQu in diverse retrieval scenarios, demonstrating that it significantly enhances overall retrieval performance over relevant baselines. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/starsuzi/DAQu}{this https URL}.</description>

      <title>CoPL: Collaborative Preference Learning for Personalizing LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) is important for aligning outputs with diverse user preferences, yet existing methods struggle with flexibility and generalization. We propose CoPL (Collaborative Preference Learning), a graph-based collaborative filtering framework that models user-response relationships to enhance preference estimation, particularly in sparse annotation settings. By integrating a mixture of LoRA experts, CoPL efficiently fine-tunes LLMs while dynamically balancing shared and user-specific preferences. Additionally, an optimization-free adaptation strategy enables generalization to unseen users without fine-tuning. Experiments on UltraFeedback-P demonstrate that CoPL outperforms existing personalized reward models, effectively capturing both common and controversial preferences, making it a scalable solution for personalized LLM alignment. The code is available at https://github.com/ml-postech/CoPL.</description>

      <title>Legal Knowledge Graph Foundations, Part I: URI-Addressable Abstract Works (LRMoo F1 to schema.org)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon a formal, event-centric model for the diachronic evolution of legal norms grounded in the IFLA Library Reference Model (LRMoo), this paper addresses the essential first step of publishing this model's foundational entity-the abstract legal Work (F1)-on the Semantic Web. We propose a detailed, property-by-property mapping of the LRMoo F1 Work to the widely adopted schema.org/Legislation vocabulary. Using Brazilian federal legislation from the Normas.leg.br portal as a practical case study, we demonstrate how to create interoperable, machine-readable descriptions via JSON-LD, focusing on stable URN identifiers, core metadata, and norm relationships. This structured mapping establishes a stable, URI-addressable anchor for each legal norm, creating a verifiable "ground truth". It provides the essential, interoperable foundation upon which subsequent layers of the model, such as temporal versions (Expressions) and internal components, can be built. By bridging formal ontology with web-native standards, this work paves the way for building deterministic and reliable Legal Knowledge Graphs (LKGs), overcoming the limitations of purely probabilistic models.</description>
