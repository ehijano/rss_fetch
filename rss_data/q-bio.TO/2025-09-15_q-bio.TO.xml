      <title>Glorbit: A Modular, Web-Based Platform for AI Based Periorbital Measurement in Low-Resource Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periorbital measurements such as margin reflex distances (MRD1/2), palpebral fissure height, and scleral show are essential in diagnosing and managing conditions like ptosis and eyelid disorders. We developed Glorbit, a lightweight, browser-based application for automated periorbital distance measurement using artificial intelligence, designed for use in low-resource clinical settings. The app integrates a DeepLabV3 segmentation model into a modular pipeline with secure, site-specific Google Cloud storage. Glorbit supports offline mode, local preprocessing, and cloud upload via Firebase-authenticated logins. We evaluated usability, cross-platform compatibility, and deployment readiness through a simulated enrollment study of 15 volunteers. The app completed the full workflow -- metadata entry, image capture, segmentation, and upload -- on all tested sessions without error. Glorbit successfully ran on laptops, tablets, and mobile phones across major browsers. The segmentation model succeeded on all images. Average session time was 101.7 seconds (standard deviation: 17.5). Usability survey scores (1-5 scale) were uniformly high: intuitiveness and efficiency (5.0), workflow clarity (4.8), output confidence (4.9), and clinical utility (4.9). Glorbit provides a functional, scalable solution for standardized periorbital measurement in diverse environments. It supports secure data collection and may enable future development of real-time triage tools and multimodal AI-driven oculoplastics. Tool available at: https://glorbit.app</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Pipeline for Aortic Segmentation and Shape Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aortic shape analysis plays a key role in cardiovascular diagnostics, treatment planning, and understanding disease progression. We present a robust, fully automated pipeline for aortic shape analysis from cardiac MRI, combining deep learning and statistical techniques across segmentation, 3D surface reconstruction, and mesh registration. We benchmark leading segmentation models including nnUNet, TotalSegmentator, and MedSAM2 highlighting the effectiveness of domain specific training and transfer learning on a curated dataset. Following segmentation, we reconstruct high quality 3D meshes and introduce a DL based mesh registration method that directly optimises vertex displacements. This approach significantly outperforms classical rigid and nonrigid methods in geometric accuracy and anatomical consistency. Using the registered meshes, we perform statistical shape analysis on a cohort of 599 healthy subjects. Principal Component Analysis reveals dominant modes of aortic shape variation, capturing both global morphology and local structural differences under rigid and similarity transformations. Our findings demonstrate the advantages of integrating traditional geometry processing with learning based models for anatomically precise and scalable aortic analysis. This work lays the groundwork for future studies into pathological shape deviations and supports the development of personalised diagnostics in cardiovascular medicine.</description>

      <title>Data distribution impacts the performance and generalisability of contrastive learning-based foundation models of electrocardiograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning is a widely adopted self-supervised pretraining strategy, yet its dependence on cohort composition remains underexplored. We present Contrasting by Patient Augmented Electrocardiograms (CAPE) foundation model and pretrain on four cohorts (n = 5,203,352), from diverse populations across three continents (North America, South America, Asia). We systematically assess how cohort demographics, health status, and population diversity influence the downstream performance for prediction tasks also including two additional cohorts from another continent (Europe). We find that downstream performance depends on the distributional properties of the pretraining cohort, including demographics and health status. Moreover, while pretraining with a multi-centre, demographically diverse cohort improves in-distribution accuracy, it reduces out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation of our contrastive approach by encoding cohort-specific artifacts. To address this, we propose the In-Distribution Batch (IDB) strategy, which preserves intra-cohort consistency during pretraining and enhances OOD robustness. This work provides important insights for developing clinically fair and generalisable foundation models.</description>
