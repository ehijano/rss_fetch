      <title>Exponential decay estimates for the resolvent kernel on a Riemannian manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a complete, connected, non-compact Riemannian manifold, with Ricci curvature bounded from below, we establish exponential decay estimates at infinity for the spherical sums of the resolvent kernel, i.e., the integral kernel of the resolvent $(-\Delta+\lambda)^{-1}$ of the Laplace-Beltrami operator for $\lambda&gt;0$. The exponential decay rate in these estimates is optimal, in the sense that it cannot be improved based solely on a uniform bound on the Ricci curvature.
  The paper offers two conceptual takeaways. Firstly, in pursuit of decay estimates, it may be worth shifting the emphasis from the resolvent kernel to its density - a geometrically more natural object. Secondly, contrary to expectations, the exponential decay of the resolvent kernel is driven mainly by the area/volume growth, and the bottom of the spectrum of $\Delta$ is not a decisive factor. This is in contrast with the heat kernel decay, and shows that optimal resolvent kernel estimates cannot be implied from heat kernel estimates.</description>

      <title>Regularity estimates to quasi-linear parabolic equations in non-divergence form with non-homogeneous signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we establish the existence and sharp geometric regularity estimates for bounded solutions of a class of quasilinear parabolic equations in non-divergence form with non-homogeneous degeneracy. The model equation in this class is given by \[ \partial_{t} u = \left(|\nabla u|^{\mathfrak{p}} + \mathfrak{a}(x, t)|\nabla u|^{\mathfrak{q}}\right)\Delta_{p}^{\mathrm{N}} u + f(x, t) \quad \text{in} \quad Q_1 = B_1 \times (-1, 0], \] where $p \in (1, \infty)$, $\mathfrak{p}, \mathfrak{q} \in [0, \infty)$, and $\mathfrak{a}, f: Q_1 \to \mathbb{R}$ are suitably defined functions. Our approach is based on geometric tangential methods, incorporating a refined oscillation mechanism, compactness arguments, ``alternative methods,'' and scaling techniques. Furthermore, we derive pointwise estimates in settings exhibiting singular-degenerate or doubly singular signatures. To some extent, our regularity estimates refine and extend previous results from \cite{FZ23} through distinct methodological advancements. Finally, we explore connections between our findings and fundamental nonlinear models in the theory of quasilinear PDEs, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Uniform Boundedness of Homogeneous Incompressible Flows in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the extendability of local solutions for incompressible 3D Navier-Stokes and 3D Euler problems, with initial data $\mathbf{u}_0$ in the Sobolev space $H^s (\mathbb{R}^3)$, where $s$ ensures the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions. A geometric decomposition of the configuration space, identified by the orthogonality between the solution $\mathbf{u}$ and the pressure forces $\nabla p$, splits the problem into two simpler subproblems, which enable the uniform boundedness of the solution in each component of the partition, thereby ensuring the extendability of the solution.</description>

      <title>The steady state of the inclined problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inclined problem is a problem that describes an open fluid flowing over an angled wall. It has broad applications in science and engineering. In this paper, we study the steady state of the inclined problem in two dimensions. The steady-state solution is depicted by the Euler-Lagrange equation of a given energy functional with a fixed contact angle as the boundary condition. By choosing a suitable maximal point to parameterize the surface of the fluid, we can construct a solution to this Euler-Lagrange equation via a shooting method in terms of the volume of the fluid. The construction works for any contact angle and any arbitrary inclined angle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We state and prove here semiclassical results about the construction of asymptotic solutions by the WKB method for pseudo-differential equations of real principal type. It is a Gevrey version; the smooth $C^\infty$ and the analytic ones may be found in H\"ormander (Hormander1985) and Sj\"ostrand (Sj\"ostrand1982). We present here three versions depending on the degree of entrance in the complex domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in this article a variation of the Whitham equation which was introduced as an alternative to the KdV equation. We first prove the global existence of weak solutions, then we establish a regularity criterion from which we deduce the uniqueness of weak solutions. Local in time criterions for regularity and uniqueness are also given.</description>

      <title>Convergence of non-reversible Markov processes via lifting and flow Poincar{\'e} inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general approach for quantitative convergence analysis of non-reversible Markov processes, based on the concept of second-order lifts and a variational approach to hypocoercivity. To this end, we introduce the flow Poincar{\'e} inequality, a space-time Poincar{\'e} inequality along trajectories of the semigroup, and a general divergence lemma based only on the Dirichlet form of an underlying reversible diffusion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by applying it to a pair of run-and-tumble particles with jamming, a model from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and several piecewise deterministic Markov processes used in sampling applications, in particular including general stochastic jump kernels.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics with Continuous Age Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a classical model of continuous opinion formation to explicitly include an age-structured population. We begin by considering a stochastic differential equation model which incorporates ageing dynamics and birth/death processes, in a bounded confidence type opinion formation model. We then derive and analyse the corresponding mean field partial differential equation and compare the complex dynamics on the microscopic and macroscopic levels using numerical simulations. We rigorously prove the existence of stationary states in the mean field model, but also demonstrate that these stationary states are not necessarily unique. Finally we establish connections between this and other existing models in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>On sign-changing solutions for mixed local and nonlocal $p$-Laplace operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the method of invariant sets of descending flows to demonstrate the existence of multiple sign-changing solutions for a class of elliptic problems with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. By combining Nehari manifold techniques with a constrained variational approach and Brouwer degree theory, we establish the existence of a least-energy sign-changing solution. Furthermore, we prove that the energy of the least energy sign-changing solution is strictly greater than twice the ground state energy and the least energy sign-changing solution has exactly two nodal domains, when $p=2$. This work extends the celebrated results of Bartsch \textit{et al.} [Proc. Lond. Math. Soc., (3), 91(1), 129--152, 2005] and Chang \textit{et al.} [Adv. Nonlinear Stud., 19(1), 29--53, 2019] to the mixed local and nonlocal $p$-Laplace operator, providing a novel contribution even in the case when $p=2$.</description>

      <title>Time derivative estimates for parabolic $p$-Laplace equations and applications to optimal regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the boundedness of time derivatives of solutions to parabolic $p$-Laplace equations. Our approach relies on the Bernstein technique combined with a suitable approximation method. As a consequence, we obtain an optimal regularity result with a connection to the well-known $C^{p'}$-conjecture in the elliptic setting. Finally, we extend our method to treat global regularity results for both fully nonlinear and general quasilinear degenerate parabolic problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider wave maps from $(1+d)$-dimensional Minkowski space, $d\geq3$, into rotationally symmetric manifolds which arise from small perturbations of the sphere $\mathbb S^d$. We prove the existence of co-rotational self-similar finite time blowup solutions with smooth blowup profiles. Furthermore, we show the nonlinear asymptotic stability of these solutions under suitably small co-rotational perturbations on the full space.</description>

      <title>A Short Survey of the Well-posedness of the Two-dimensional Burgers' Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the two-dimensional Burgers equation using the framework of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems. The two-dimensional Burgers equation, which models the interplay between nonlinear advection and viscous dissipation, is given by: $$ u_{t} + u \cdot \nabla u = \nu \Delta u + f, $$ where $ u = (u_1, u_2) $ is the velocity field, $ \nu &gt; 0 $ is the viscosity coefficient, and $ f $ represents an external force. We primarily employed Galerkin method to transform the partial differential equation into an ordinary differential equation. In addition, by employing Sobolev spaces, energy estimates, and compactness arguments, we rigorously prove the existence of global solutions and their uniqueness under appropriate initial and boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: This paper constructs metalenses that separate homogeneous media with different refractive indices, refracting one domain into another while conserving a prescribed energy distribution. Using optimal transport theory, we design singlet and doublet metalenses for energy-conserving by refraction and employ multi-marginal optimal transport to create a refracting-reflecting metalens that preserves given energy distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the vanishing viscosity limit for $2\times2$ triangular system of hyperbolic conservation laws when the viscosity coefficients are non linear. In this article, we assume that the viscosity matrix $B(u)$ is commutating with the convective part $A(u)$. We show the existence of global smooth solution to the parabolic equation satisfying uniform total variation bound in $\varepsilon$ provided that the initial data is small in $BV$. This extends the previous result of Bianchini and Bressan [Commun. Pure Appl. Anal. (2002)] which was considering the case $B(u)=I$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove sharp multipolar Hardy-type inequalities in the Riemannian $L^p-$setting for $p\geq 2$ using the method of super-solutions and fundamental results from comparison theory on manifolds, thus generalizing previous results for $p=2$. We emphasize that when we restrict to Cartan-Hadamard manifolds, the inequalities improve in the case $2&lt;p&lt;N$ compared to the case $p=2$ since we obtain positive remainder terms which are controlled by curvature estimates. In the end, we treat the cases of positive and negative constant sectional curvature.</description>

      <title>Averaged Controllability of the Random Schr\"odinger Equation with Diffusivity Following Absolutely Continuous Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the averaged controllability of the random Schr\"odinger equation, with diffusivity as a random variable drawn from a general probability distribution. First, we show that the solutions to these random Schr\"odinger equations are null averaged controllable with an open-loop control independent of randomness from any arbitrary open set of the domain and in any time. This is done for an interesting class of random variables, including certain stable distributions, specifically recovering the known result when the random diffusivity follows a normal or Cauchy distribution. Second, by the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, we prove for any time the lack of averaged exact controllability in a $L^2$ setting for all absolutely continuous random variables. Notably, this implies that this property is not inherited from the exact controllability of the Schr\"odinger equation. Third, we show that simultaneous null controllability is not possible except for a finite number of scenarios. Finally, we perform numerical simulations that robustly validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Computer-Assisted Proofs of Solitons in Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously prove the existence of gap solitons in the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation with a periodic potential. These nonlinear localized solutions emerge in spectral gaps and play a crucial role in understanding Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). To prove them, we reformulate the problem as the search for homoclinic orbits in a higher-dimensional dynamical system. We then use computer-assisted proof techniques, combined with a functional analytic framework, to rigorously validate numerically approximated homoclinic orbits. This work bridges computational evidence and formal mathematical proofs, providing a solid foundation for the study of solitons in the GP equation.</description>

      <title>Heat equations associated to harmonic oscillator with exponential nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Cauchy problem for a heat equation involving a fractional harmonic oscillator and an exponential nonlinearity. We establish local well-posedness within the appropriate Orlicz spaces. Through the examination of small initial data in suitable Orlicz spaces, we obtain the existence of global weak-mild solutions. Additionally, precise decay estimates are presented for large time, indicating that the decay rate is influenced by the nonlinearity's behavior near the origin. Moreover, we highlight that the existence of local nonnegative classical solutions is no longer guaranteed when certain nonnegative initial data is considered within the appropriate Orlicz space.</description>

      <title>A note on the Long-Time behaviour of Stochastic McKean-Vlasov Equations with common noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the long-term behavior of solutions to nonlinear stochastic Fokker-Planck equations driven by common noise, where the drift term has a linear dependence on the measure. These equations, which describe the evolution of probability distributions, naturally arise in the mean-field limit of interacting particle systems driven by both idiosyncratic and common noises. After proving the existence of an invariant measure under some mild conditions, we first consider the case where the confinement potential is uniformly convex. In this setting, we establish a result of uniform-in-time conditional propagation of chaos for the associated particle system. This result directly implies the uniqueness of the long-term behavior for solutions of the nonlinear stochastic Fokker-Planck equation. Then, we highlight a more surprising phenomenon of uniqueness recovery induced by the addition of common noise in the non-convex case, albeit under more restrictive structural assumptions. Specifically, we show that the presence of common noise leads to uniqueness and exponential convergence towards equilibrium in the absence of idiosyncratic noise. This result emphasizes the stabilizing role of common noise in systems where non-convex potentials would typically allow for multiple invariant measures.</description>

      <title>Interior Harnack inequality and H\"older estimates for linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equations in divergence form with drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study interior estimates for solutions to linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equations in divergence form with drift terms and the right-hand side containing the divergence of a bounded vector field. Equations of this type appear in the study of semigeostrophic equations in meteorology and the solvability of singular Abreu equations in the calculus of variations with a convexity constraint. We prove an interior Harnack inequality and H\"older estimates for solutions to equations of this type in two dimensions, and under an integrability assumption on the Hessian matrix of the Monge-Amp\`ere potential in higher dimensions. Our results extend those of Le (Analysis of Monge-Amp\`ere equations, Graduate Studies in Mathematics, vol.240, American Mathematical Society, 2024) to equations with drift terms.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on the dimension of the global attractor of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations on the $\beta-$plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article establishes estimates on the dimension of the global attractor of the two-dimensional rotating Navier-Stokes equation for viscous, incompressible fluids on the $\beta$-plane. Previous results in this setting by M.A.H. Al-Jaboori and D. Wirosoetisno (2011) had proved that the global attractor collapses to a single point that depends only the longitudinal coordinate, i.e., zonal flow, when the rotation is sufficiently fast. However, an explicit quantification of the complexity of the global attractor in terms of $\beta$ had remained open. In this paper, such estimates are established which are valid across a wide regime of rotation rates and are consistent with the dynamically degenerate regime previously identified. Additionally, a decomposition of solutions is established detailing the asymptotic behavior of the solutions in the limit of large rotation.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the compressible Euler equations from the dynamics of interacting Bose gas in the hard-core limit regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of short-range interacting Bose gases with varying degrees of diluteness and interaction strength. By applying a combined mean-field and semiclassical space-time rescaling to the dynamics in both the Gross--Pitaevskii and hard-core limit regimes, we prove that the local one-particle mass, momentum, and energy densities of the many-body system can be quantitatively approximated by solutions to the compressible Euler system in the strong sense, up to the first blow-up time of the fluid description, as the number of particles tends to infinity. In the hard-core limit regime, two novel results are presented. First, we rigorously prove, for the first time, that the internal energy of the fluid takes the form $4\pi \mathfrak{c}_{0}\rho^{2}$ (equivalently, pressure $P=2\pi \mathfrak{c}_{0}\rho^{2}$), arising solely from the kinetic energy density of the many-body system, rather than the interaction energy density, marking a fundamental difference from the Gross--Pitaevskii and other mean-field regimes. Second, the newly discovered coupling constant $\mathfrak{c}_{0}$ is the electrostatic capacity of the interaction potential, corresponding to the scattering length of the hard-core potential. Furthermore, in other limiting regimes, including those beyond the Gross--Pitaevskii regime, we find that the limiting equation is described by an eikonal system, offering a rigorous first-principle justification for using the ``geometric optics approximation'' to describe the dynamics of ultracold Bose gases.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion model for a population structured in phenotype and space I -- Criterion for persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a reaction-diffusion model for a population structured in phenotype. We assume that the population lives in a heterogeneous periodic environment, so that a given phenotypic trait may be more or less fit according to the spatial location. The model features spatial mobility of individuals as well as mutation.
  We first prove the well-posedness of the model. Next, we derive a criterion for the persistence of the population which involves the generalised principal eigenvalue associated with the linearised elliptic operator. This notion allows us to handle the possible lack of coercivity of the operator. We then obtain a monotonicity result for the generalised principal eigenvalue, in terms of the frequency of spatial fluctuations of the environment and in terms of the spatial diffusivity. We deduce that the more heterogeneous is the environment, or the higher is the mobility of individuals, the harder is the persistence for the species.
  This work lays the mathematical foundation to investigate some other optimisation problems for the environment to make persistence as hard or as easy as possible, which will be addressed in the forthcoming companion paper.</description>

Abstract: Here we give a survey of consequences from the theory of the Beltrami equations in the complex plane $\mathbb C$ to generalized Cauchy-Riemann equations $\nabla v = B \nabla u$ in the real plane $\mathbb R^2$ and clarify the relationships of the latter to the $A-$harmonic equation ${\rm div} A\,{\rm grad}\, u = 0$ with matrix valued coefficients $A$ that is one of the main equations of the potential theory, namely, of the hydro\-mechanics (fluid mechanics) in anisotropic and inhomogeneous media. The survey includes various types of results as theorems on existence, representation and regularity of their solutions, in particular, for the main boundary value problems of Hilbert, Dirichlet, Neumann, Poincare and Riemann.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the existence of standing wave solutions for quasilinear Schrodinger systems. To address the challenges posed by non differentiability, we adopt the dual approach introduced by Colin and Jeanjean. The existence of solutions is established using Del Pino and Felmer's penalization technique, with refinements inspired by Alves' arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $\Omega$ a perturbation of the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we establish the existence of a sequence of local minimizers for the vector Allen-Cahn energy. The sequence converges in $L^1$ to a partition of $\Omega$ whose skeleton is given by a tetrahedral cone and thus contains a quadruple point. This is accomplished by proving that the partition is an isolated local minimizer of a weighted perimeter problem arising as the associated $\Gamma$-limit of the sequence of Allen-Cahn functionals.</description>

      <title>Singularities of Ricci flow and diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.06240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comparing and recognizing metrics can be extraordinarily difficult because of the group of diffeomorphisms. Two metrics, that could even be the same, could look completely different in different coordinates. This is the gauge problem. The general gauge problem is extremely subtle for non-compact spaces. Often it can be avoided if one uses some additional structure of the particular situation. However, in many problems there is no additional structure. Instead we solve the gauge problem directly in great generality.
  The techniques and ideas apply to many problems. We use them to solve a well-known open problem in Ricci flow: Strong rigidity of cylinders. Strong rigidity is an illustration of a {\it shrinker principle} that uniqueness radiates out from a compact set. It implies that if one tangent flow at a future singular point is a cylinder, then all tangent flows are.
  We solve the gauge problem by solving a nonlinear system of PDEs. The PDE produces a diffeomorphism that fixes an appropriate gauge in the spirit of the slice theorem for group actions. We then show optimal bounds for the displacement function of the diffeomorphism. Strong rigidity relies on gauge fixing and several other new ideas. One of these is "propagation of almost splitting", another is quadratic rigidity in the right gauge, and a third is an optimal polynomial growth bound for PDEs that holds in great generality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for certain one-parameter families of initial conditions in $\mathbb R^3$, when we run mean curvature flow, a genus one singularity must appear in one of the flows. Moreover, such a singularity is robust under perturbation of the family of initial conditions. This contrasts sharply with the case of just a single flow. As an application, we construct an embedded, genus one self-shrinker with entropy lower than a shrinking doughnut.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider non-local energy forms of fractional Laplace type on quasicircles and prove that they can be approximated by similar energy forms on polygonal curves. The approximation is in terms of generalized Mosco convergence along a sequence of varying Hilbert spaces. The domains of the energy forms are the natural trace spaces, and we focus on the case of quasicircles of Hausdorff dimension greater than one. The jump in Hausdorff dimension results in a mismatch of fractional orders, which we compensate by a suitable choice of kernels. We provide approximations of quasidiscs by polygonal $(\varepsilon,\infty)$-domains with common parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and show convergence results for superpositions of Dirichlet integrals and non-local boundary energy forms.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Scheduling of a Multiclass Queue in the Halfin-Whitt Regime: A Computational Approach for High-Dimensional Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a multi-class queueing model of a telephone call center, in which a system manager dynamically allocates available servers to customer calls. Calls can terminate through either service completion or customer abandonment, and the manager strives to minimize the expected total of holding costs plus abandonment costs over a finite horizon. Focusing on the Halfin-Whitt heavy traffic regime, we derive an approximating diffusion control problem, and building on earlier work by Beck et al. (2021), develop a simulation-based computational method for solution of such problems, one that relies heavily on deep neural network technology. Using this computational method, we propose a policy for the original (pre-limit) call center scheduling problem. Finally, the performance of this policy is assessed using test problems based on publicly available call center data. For the test problems considered so far, our policy does as well as or better than the best benchmark we could find. Moreover, our method is computationally feasible at least up to dimension 500, that is, for call centers with 500 or more distinct customer classes.</description>

Abstract: We give improved estimates for the size of the singular set of minimizing capillary hypersurfaces: the singular set is always of codimension at least $4$, and this estimate improves if the capillary angle is close to $0$, $\frac{\pi}{2}$, or $\pi$. For capillary angles that are close to $0$ or $\pi$, our analysis is based on a rigorous connection between the capillary problem and the one-phase Bernoulli problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stability of abstract differential equations coupled by means of a general algebraic condition. Our approach is based on techniques from operator theory and systems theory, and it allows us to study coupled systems by exploiting properties of the components, which are typically much simpler to analyse. As our main results we establish resolvent estimates and decay rates for abstract boundary-coupled systems. We illustrate the power of the general results by using them to obtain rates of energy decay in coupled systems of one-dimensional wave and heat equations, and in a wave equation with an acoustic boundary condition.</description>
