      <title>A Category of the Political \Large{Part I - Hom\'onoia}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research aims at providing a mathematical model of the organization of the polity and its transformation. For that purpose we construct two categories named respectively Political Configuration and Political Foundation. Our construction depends on a couple of variables called the foundational pair. One variable, called the Base, consists of a finite number of members (agents), while the other, called the Ground, consists of a set of states that reflect all relevant interests/values/aspirations of the base members. An object of the Configuration, called p-formation, extends the notion of simplicial complex, and a morphism, which expresses the recomposition of the base, extends the notion of simplicial map. An object of the Foundation, called p-site, describes the profile of the polity, that is, how the states of the ground are intertwined between the agents. A morphism between political sites consists of a pair of maps, namely a Base map and a Ground map, satisfying appropriate conditions. Two functors relate the Foundation and the Configuration: the Knit which attributes to each p-site a p-formation and the Nerve which attributes to each p-site a simplicial complex. In the opposite direction a functor, called Canon, which attributes to any p-formation its canonical p-site, turns out to be in an appropriate sense the inverse of the Knit and the Nerve.</description>

      <title>A new characterization of Kac-type discrete quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain two related characterizations of discrete quantum groups and discrete quantum groups of Kac type as allegorical group objects in the symmetric monoidal dagger category of quantum sets and relations, of interest to quantum predicate logic and quantum information theory. Specifically, we characterize discrete quantum groups by the existence of an inversion relation and discrete quantum groups of Kac type by the existence of an inversion function. This confirms a conjectured description of discrete quantum groups of Kac type and brings them within the purview of category-internal universal algebra.</description>

      <title>El mar que envuelve a las piedras: espacios de Stone, profinitos y su papel en la aritm\'etica contempor\'anea</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stone duality establishes a contravariant equivalence between the category of Boolean algebras and the category of compact, Hausdorff, totally disconnected topological spaces (Stone spaces). These spaces are precisely the profinite spaces and form the natural environment for arithmetic objects such as the $p$-adic integers, absolute Galois groups, and profinite completions. In this article we give a rigorous and self-contained development of the construction of the Stone space associated to a Boolean algebra, prove Stone's representation theorem, and describe profinite spaces as inverse limits of finite systems. From there we introduce the Stone--\v{C}ech compactification via its universal property and discuss central arithmetic examples (such as $\beta\mathbb{N}$ and profinite completions), emphasizing their structural role in arithmetic geometry and in the framework of Condensed Mathematics of Clausen--Scholze. The text is aimed at advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students, as well as readers interested in the interface between topology, number theory, and new categorical formulations of topology.</description>

      <title>Deriving the Generalised Born Rule from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A basic postulate of modern compositional approaches to generalised physical theories is the generalised Born rule, in which probabilities are postulated to be computable from the composition of states and effects. In this paper we consider whether this postulate, and the strength of the identification between scalars and probabilities, can be argued from basic principles. To this end, we first consider the most naive possible process-theoretic interpretation of textbook quantum theory, in which physical processes (unitaries) along with states and effects (kets and bras) and a probability function from states and effects satisfying just some basic compatibility axioms are identified. We then show that any process theory equipped with such structure is equivalent to an alternative process theory in which the generalised Born rule holds. We proceed to consider introduction of noise into any such theory, and observe that the result of doing so is a strengthening of the identification between scalars and probabilities; from bare monoid homomorphisms to semiring isomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Triangulated categories arising from n-fold matrix factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an additive category and let $T\colon \mathcal{A}\rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ be an additive functor equipped with a natural transformation $\omega\colon \mathrm{Id}_{\mathcal{A}}\rightarrow T$. We prove that the homotopy category of $n$-fold matrix factorizations of $\omega$, denoted ${\rm HFact}_{n}(\mathcal{A},T,\omega)$, admits a natural structure of a right triangulated category. In particular, when $T$ is an automorphism, the homotopy category ${\rm HFact}_{n}(\mathcal{A},T,\omega)$ becomes triangulated. Furthermore, if $\mathcal{A}$ is a Frobenius exact category and $T$ is an autoequivalence, we obtain that the category ${\rm Fact}_{n}(\mathcal{A},T,\omega)$ of $n$-fold $(\mathcal{A},T)$-factorizations of $\omega$ is a Frobenius exact category. Consequently, the stable category of the Frobenius exact category ${\rm Fact}_{n}(\mathcal{A},T,\omega)$ is a triangulated category.</description>

      <title>Extended Contact Algebras: Algebraic analysis and duality theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ternary extended contact relation was introduced in (Ivanova, 2020) as a more expressive counterpart of the standard binary contact relation. The class of Boolean algebras expanded with the relation was named Extended Contact Algebras (ECAs). In this work, we take an algebraic perspective on ECAs, interpreting the ternary relation as a form of entailment. We introduce Pseudo-Inference Algebras, purely algebraic tructures where the ternary relation is replaced by a monotone ternary operator, capturing the logical character of extended contact. We show that the subclass of relational Pseudo-Inference Algebras corresponds precisely to ECAs and generates a subvariety of strict PSI-Algebras, which forms a discriminator variety. Furthermore, we extend Stone duality to this ternary context, introducing descriptive PSI-frames and establishing three interrelated dualities that differ in their morphisms while sharing the same class of topological objects. The framework developed in the paper provides a nified relational semantics for Boolean algebras equipped with monotone ternary operators, connecting spatial and logical notions within a categorical and topological setting.</description>

      <title>From coextensive varieties to the Gaeta topos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.00135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that in every coextensive variety V, the assignment that maps each algebra to its set of central elements is both functorial and representable. Furthermore, we prove that the full subcategory of finitely presented algebras in V is coextensive. Finally, we establish that if V is additionally (0, 1)-dense, the Gaeta topos classifies central-free V-models.</description>

      <title>Frobenius algebra objects in Temperley-Lieb categories at roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new definition of a Frobenius structure on an algebra object in a monoidal category, generalising Frobenius algebras in the category of vector spaces. Our definition allows Frobenius forms valued in objects other than the unit object, and can be seen as a categorical version of Frobenius extensions of the second kind. When the monoidal category is pivotal we define a Nakayama morphism for the Frobenius structure and explain what it means for this morphism to have finite order.
  Our main example is a well-studied algebra object in the (additive and idempotent completion of the) Temperley-Lieb category at a root of unity. We show that this algebra has a Frobenius structure and that its Nakayama morphism has order 2. As a consequence, we obtain information about Nakayama morphisms of preprojective algebras of Dynkin type, considered as algebras over the semisimple algebras on their vertices.</description>

      <title>Ramsey degrees: big v. small</title>

      <description>arXiv:2003.03786v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate algebraic properties of big Ramsey degrees in categories satisfying some mild conditions. As the first nontrivial consequence of the generalization we advocate in this paper we prove that small Ramsey degrees are the minima of the corresponding big ones. We also prove that big Ramsey degrees are subadditive and show that equality is enforced by an abstract property of objects we refer to as self-similarity. Finally, we apply the abstract machinery developed in the paper to show that if a countable relational structure has finite big Ramsey degrees, then so do its quantifier-free reducts. In particular, it follows that the reducts of (Q, &lt;), the random graph, the random tournament and (Q, &lt;, 0) all have finite big Ramsey degrees.</description>

      <title>Affineness and reconstruction in complex-periodic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Working in a generic derived algebro-geometric context, we lay the foundations for the general study of affineness and local descendability. When applied to $\mathbf{E}_\infty$ rings equipped with the fpqc topology, these foundations give an $\infty$-category of spectral stacks, a viable functor-of-points alternative to Lurie's approach to nonconnective spectral algebraic geometry. Specializing further to spectral stacks over the moduli stack of oriented formal groups, we use chromatic homotopy theory to obtain a large class of $0$-affine stacks, generalizing Mathew--Meier's famous $0$-affineness result. We introduce a spectral refinement of Hopkins' stack construction of an $\mathbf{E}_\infty$ ring, and study when it provides an inverse to the global sections of a spectral stack. We use this to show that a large class of stacks, which we call reconstructible, are naturally determined by their global sections, including moduli stacks of oriented formal groups of bounded height and the moduli stack of oriented elliptic curves.</description>
