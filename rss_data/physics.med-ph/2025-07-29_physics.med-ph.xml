      <title>Quantifying lower-limb muscle coordination during cycling using electromyography-informed muscle synergies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessment of muscle coordination during cycling may provide insight into motor control strategies and movement efficiency. This study evaluated muscle synergies and coactivation patterns as indicators of neuromuscular coordination in lower-limb across three power levels of cycling. Twenty recreational cyclists performed a graded cycling test on a stationary bicycle ergometer. Electromyography was recorded bilaterally from seven lower-limb muscles and muscle synergies were extracted using non-negative matrix factorization. The Coactivation Index (CI), Synergy Index (SI), and Synergy Coordination Index (SCI) were calculated to assess muscle coordination patterns. Four muscle synergies were identified consistently across power levels, with changes in synergy composition and activation timing correlated with increased muscular demands. As power level increased, the CI showed reduced muscle coactivation at the knee and greater muscle coactivation at the ankle. The SI revealed a greater contribution of the synergy weights of the extensor muscles than those of the flexor muscles at the knee. In contrast, the relative EMG contribution of hip extensor and flexor muscles remained consistent with increasing power levels. The SCI increased significantly with increasing power level, suggesting a reduction in the size of the synergy space and improved neuromuscular coordination. These findings provide insight into how the central nervous system modulates its response to increasing mechanical demands. Combining synergy and coactivation indices offers a promising approach to assess motor control, inform rehabilitation, and optimize performance in cycling tasks.</description>

      <title>Solving the MIT Inverse Problem by Considering Skin and Proximity Effects in Coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an improved technique for solving the inverse problem in magnetic induction tomography (MIT) by considering skin and proximity effects in coils. MIT is a non-contact, noninvasive, and low-cost imaging modality for obtaining the distribution of conductivity inside an object. Reconstruction of low conductivity distribution by MIT requires more accurate techniques since measured signals are inherently weak and the reconstruction problem is highly nonlinear and ill-posed. Previous MIT inverse problem studies have ignored skin and proximity effects inside coils in the forward method. In this article, the improved technique incorporates these effects in the forward method. Furthermore, it employs the regularized Gauss-Newton algorithm to reconstruct the conductivity distribution. The regularization parameter is obtained by an adaptive method using the two input parameters: a coefficient and an initial conductivity distribution. The new Jacobian matrix is computed based on a standard technique. To compare the early and improved forward methods in possible medical and industrial applications with low conductivity regions, a 2D 8-coil MIT system is modeled, and image reconstruction is performed for synthetic phantoms. Results show that it is crucial to use the improved forward method for the reconstruction of the absolute conductivity values.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Noise Characterization and Suppression in Low-Field MRI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Low-field MRI systems operate at single MHz-range frequencies, where signal losses are primarily dominated by thermal noise from the radio-frequency (RF) receive coils. Achieving operation close to this limit is essential for maximizing imaging performance and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, electromagnetic interference (EMI) from cabling, electronics, and patient loading often degrades system performance. Our goal is to develop and validate a practical protocol that guides users in identifying and suppressing electromagnetic noise in low-field MRI systems, enabling operation near the thermal noise limit.
  Methods: We present a systematic, stepwise methodology that includes diagnostic measurements, hardware isolation strategies, and good practices for cabling and shielding. Each step is validated with corresponding noise measurements under increasingly complex system configurations, both unloaded and with a human subject present.
  Results: Noise levels were monitored through the incremental assembly of a low-field MRI system, revealing key sources of EMI and quantifying their impact. Final configurations achieved noise within 1.5x the theoretical thermal bound with a subject in the scanner. Image reconstructions illustrate the direct relationship between system noise and image quality.
  Conclusion: The proposed protocol enables low-field MRI systems to operate close to fundamental noise limits in realistic conditions. The framework also provides actionable guidance for the integration of additional system components, such as gradient drivers and automatic tuning networks, without compromising SNR.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution Radiography by Mechanical Supersampling and Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction using High-Z Photon-Counting Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a practical and dose-efficient strategy for resolution enhancement in planar radiography, based on mechanically supersampled acquisition with high-Z photon-counting detectors (PCDs). Unlike prior event-based or cluster methods, our approach operates in true photon-counting mode and supports clinical flux rates. Using detector trajectories spanning multiple pixels and image registration-based shift estimation, we achieve sub-pixel sampling without requiring mechanical precision, while also compensating for motion and geometric instabilities. An iterative reconstruction framework based on Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) with a distance-driven ray model further enhances resolution and noise robustness. Long-range supersampling additionally mitigates pixel defects and spectral inhomogeneities inherent to high-Z detectors. Phantom studies demonstrate substantial resolution improvement and image uniformity. In comparison with a clinical mammography system, the method reveals sharper detail and more homogeneous contrast at comparable or reduced dose. The resolution gain also reduces the need for geometric magnification, enabling smaller and more cost-effective PCDs. These results establish mechanically supersampled radiography as a clinically viable approach for micron-scale imaging, with strong potential for digital mammography and other high-resolution applications and with scan times compatible with clinical workflow.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Magnetic Field Characteristics among 3 Tesla MRI Scanners: An Experimental Measurement Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners have advanced significantly, with a growing use of highfield 3 T systems. This evolution gives rise to safety concerns for healthcare personnel working in proximity to MRI equipment. While manufacturers provide theoretical Gauss line projections, these are typically derived under ideal open-environment conditions and may not reflect real-world installations. For this reason, identical MRI models can produce markedly different fringe field distributions depending on shielding and room configurations. The present study proposes an experimental methodology for the mapping of the fringe magnetic field in the vicinity of three 3 T MRI scanners. Field measurements were interpolated to generate threedimensional magnetic field maps. A comparative analysis was conducted, which revealed notable differences among the scanners. These differences serve to highlight the influence of site-specific factors on magnetic field propagation.</description>

      <title>Multisession Longitudinal Dynamic MRI Incorporating Patient-Specific Prior Image Information Across Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Serial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exams are often performed in clinical practice, offering shared anatomical and motion information across imaging sessions. However, existing reconstruction methods process each session independently without leveraging this valuable longitudinal information. In this work, we propose a novel concept of longitudinal dynamic MRI, which incorporates patient-specific prior images to exploit temporal correlations across sessions. This framework enables progressive acceleration of data acquisition and reduction of scan time as more imaging sessions become available. The concept is demonstrated using the 4D Golden-angle RAdial Sparse Parallel (GRASP) MRI, a state-of-the-art dynamic imaging technique. Longitudinal reconstruction is performed by concatenating multi-session time-resolved 4D GRASP datasets into an extended dynamic series, followed by a low-rank subspace-based reconstruction algorithm. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed method. Results show that longitudinal 4D GRASP reconstruction consistently outperforms standard single-session reconstruction in image quality, while preserving inter-session variations. The approach demonstrated robustness to changes in anatomy, imaging intervals, and body contour, highlighting its potential for improving imaging efficiency and consistency in longitudinal MRI applications. More generally, this work suggests a new context-aware imaging paradigm in which the more we see a patient, the faster we can image.</description>

      <title>MR sequence design to account for non-ideal gradient performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MRI systems are traditionally engineered to produce close to idealized performance, enabling a simplified pulse sequence design philosophy. An example of this is control of eddy currents produced by gradient fields; usually these are compensated by pre-emphasizing demanded waveforms. This process typically happens invisibly to the pulse sequence designer, allowing them to assume the achieved gradient waveform will be as desired. Whilst convenient, this requires system specifications exposed to the end-user to be substantially down-rated, since pre-emphasis adds an extra overhead to the waveforms. This strategy is particularly undesirable for lower performance or resource-limited hardware. Instead, we propose an optimization-based method to design pre-compensated gradient waveforms that: (i) explicitly respect hardware constraints and (ii) improve imaging performance by correcting k-space samples directly.
  Gradient waveforms are numerically optimized by including a model for system imperfections. This is first investigated in simulation using an exponential eddy current model, then experimentally using an empirical gradient system transfer function.
  Our proposed method discovers solutions that simultaneously produce negligible reconstruction errors and satisfy gradient system limits, even when classic pre-emphasis produces infeasible results. Experimentally, artefacts in both phantom and in vivo echo planar images on a 7T MR scanner are substantially reduced.
  This work demonstrates that numerical optimization of gradient waveforms can yield substantially improved image quality, when given a model for system imperfections. While the method as implemented has limited flexibility, it could enable more efficient hardware usage, and this may prove particularly important for maximizing performance of lower-cost systems.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Reproducible Whole-Brain Multi-Pool CEST Imaging at 3T Using a Single-Shot True FISP Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and validate a comprehensive, rapid, and reproducible solution for whole-brain, multi-pool CEST imaging at 3T, overcoming key barriers to clinical translation such as long acquisition times and inaccuracies from field inhomogeneities. Methods: This study integrated a single-shot 3D True FISP readout sequence for efficient whole-brain CEST data acquisition. A streamlined workflow was developed to acquire B0, B1, and T1 maps for correction. To overcome the time-consuming nature of traditional B1 correction, we implemented a machine learning-based method to perform rapid B1 correction using data from a single B1 power acquisition. Data were analyzed using a four-pool Lorentzian model to derive quantitative metrics, including MTRLD and the AREX. The method's accuracy was validated in phantoms and its test-retest reproducibility was assessed in healthy volunteers across 96 brain regions. Results: The True FISP sequence acquired high-quality, whole-brain images free of major artifacts. The neural network accurately replicated the gold-standard three-point B1 correction, achieving excellent intraclass correlation (ICC &gt; 0.97) in human subjects. The AREX metric successfully corrected for T1 and MT confounders, reducing the CV from 33.6% to 6.9% in phantoms. The complete pipeline, including Z-spectrum and correction maps, took approximately 9 minutes. The method demonstrated high region-level reproducibility, with the average CV for APT_AREX under 10% for most brain regions across test-retest scans. Conclusion: This study presents a validated, end-to-end solution for whole-brain, multi-pool CEST imaging. By combining an efficient sequence with a rapid, AI-driven correction pipeline and robust quantitative analysis, our method delivers high-fidelity, reproducible, and quantitative multi-parameter maps of brain metabolism in a clinically acceptable timeframe.</description>

      <title>Handcrafted vs. Deep Radiomics vs. Fusion vs. Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Review of Machine Learning -Based Cancer Outcome Prediction in PET and SPECT Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML), including deep learning (DL) and radiomics-based methods, is increasingly used for cancer outcome prediction with PET and SPECT imaging. However, the comparative performance of handcrafted radiomics features (HRF), deep radiomics features (DRF), DL models, and hybrid fusion approaches remains inconsistent across clinical applications. This systematic review analyzed 226 studies published from 2020 to 2025 that applied ML to PET or SPECT imaging for outcome prediction. Each study was evaluated using a 59-item framework covering dataset construction, feature extraction, validation methods, interpretability, and risk of bias. We extracted key details including model type, cancer site, imaging modality, and performance metrics such as accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). PET-based studies (95%) generally outperformed those using SPECT, likely due to higher spatial resolution and sensitivity. DRF models achieved the highest mean accuracy (0.862), while fusion models yielded the highest AUC (0.861). ANOVA confirmed significant differences in performance (accuracy: p=0.0006, AUC: p=0.0027). Common limitations included inadequate handling of class imbalance (59%), missing data (29%), and low population diversity (19%). Only 48% of studies adhered to IBSI standards. These findings highlight the need for standardized pipelines, improved data quality, and explainable AI to support clinical integration.</description>
