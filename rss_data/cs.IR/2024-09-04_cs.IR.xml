      <title>Deep Adaptive Interest Network: Personalized Recommendation with Context-Aware Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In personalized recommendation systems, accurately capturing users' evolving interests and combining them with contextual information is a critical research area. This paper proposes a novel model called the Deep Adaptive Interest Network (DAIN), which dynamically models users' interests while incorporating context-aware learning mechanisms to achieve precise and adaptive personalized recommendations. DAIN leverages deep learning techniques to build an adaptive interest network structure that can capture users' interest changes in real-time while further optimizing recommendation results by integrating contextual information. Experiments conducted on several public datasets demonstrate that DAIN excels in both recommendation performance and computational efficiency. This research not only provides a new solution for personalized recommendation systems but also offers fresh insights into the application of context-aware learning in recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>AlignGroup: Learning and Aligning Group Consensus with Member Preferences for Group Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group activities are important behaviors in human society, providing personalized recommendations for groups is referred to as the group recommendation task. Existing methods can usually be categorized into two strategies to infer group preferences: 1) determining group preferences by aggregating members' personalized preferences, and 2) inferring group consensus by capturing group members' coherent decisions after common compromises. However, the former would suffer from the lack of group-level considerations, and the latter overlooks the fine-grained preferences of individual users. To this end, we propose a novel group recommendation method AlignGroup, which focuses on both group consensus and individual preferences of group members to infer the group decision-making. Specifically, AlignGroup explores group consensus through a well-designed hypergraph neural network that efficiently learns intra- and inter-group relationships. Moreover, AlignGroup innovatively utilizes a self-supervised alignment task to capture fine-grained group decision-making by aligning the group consensus with members' common preferences. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets validate that our AlignGroup outperforms the state-of-the-art on both the group recommendation task and the user recommendation task, as well as outperforms the efficiency of most baselines.</description>

      <title>A Fashion Item Recommendation Model in Hyperbolic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a fashion item recommendation model that incorporates hyperbolic geometry into user and item representations. Using hyperbolic space, our model aims to capture implicit hierarchies among items based on their visual data and users' purchase history. During training, we apply a multi-task learning framework that considers both hyperbolic and Euclidean distances in the loss function. Our experiments on three data sets show that our model performs better than previous models trained in Euclidean space only, confirming the effectiveness of our model. Our ablation studies show that multi-task learning plays a key role, and removing the Euclidean loss substantially deteriorates the model performance.</description>

      <title>RouterRetriever: Exploring the Benefits of Routing over Multiple Expert Embedding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information retrieval methods often rely on a single embedding model trained on large, general-domain datasets like MSMARCO. While this approach can produce a retriever with reasonable overall performance, models trained on domain-specific data often yield better results within their respective domains. While prior work in information retrieval has tackled this through multi-task training, the topic of combining multiple domain-specific expert retrievers remains unexplored, despite its popularity in language model generation. In this work, we introduce RouterRetriever, a retrieval model that leverages multiple domain-specific experts along with a routing mechanism to select the most appropriate expert for each query. It is lightweight and allows easy addition or removal of experts without additional training. Evaluation on the BEIR benchmark demonstrates that RouterRetriever outperforms both MSMARCO-trained (+2.1 absolute nDCG@10) and multi-task trained (+3.2) models. This is achieved by employing our routing mechanism, which surpasses other routing techniques (+1.8 on average) commonly used in language modeling. Furthermore, the benefit generalizes well to other datasets, even in the absence of a specific expert on the dataset. To our knowledge, RouterRetriever is the first work to demonstrate the advantages of using multiple domain-specific expert embedding models with effective routing over a single, general-purpose embedding model in retrieval tasks.</description>

      <title>Building a Scalable, Effective, and Steerable Search and Ranking Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern e-commerce platforms offer vast product selections, making it difficult for customers to find items that they like and that are relevant to their current session intent. This is why it is key for e-commerce platforms to have near real-time scalable and adaptable personalized ranking and search systems. While numerous methods exist in the scientific literature for building such systems, many are unsuitable for large-scale industrial use due to complexity and performance limitations. Consequently, industrial ranking systems often resort to computationally efficient yet simplistic retrieval or candidate generation approaches, which overlook near real-time and heterogeneous customer signals, which results in a less personalized and relevant experience. Moreover, related customer experiences are served by completely different systems, which increases complexity, maintenance, and inconsistent experiences.
  In this paper, we present a personalized, adaptable near real-time ranking platform that is reusable across various use cases, such as browsing and search, and that is able to cater to millions of items and customers under heavy load (thousands of requests per second). We employ transformer-based models through different ranking layers which can learn complex behavior patterns directly from customer action sequences while being able to incorporate temporal (e.g. in-session) and contextual information. We validate our system through a series of comprehensive offline and online real-world experiments at a large online e-commerce platform, and we demonstrate its superiority when compared to existing systems, both in terms of customer experience as well as in net revenue. Finally, we share the lessons learned from building a comprehensive, modern ranking platform for use in a large-scale e-commerce environment.</description>

      <title>NUDGE: Lightweight Non-Parametric Fine-Tuning of Embeddings for Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $k$-Nearest Neighbor search on dense vector embeddings ($k$-NN retrieval) from pre-trained embedding models is the predominant retrieval method for text and images, as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. In practice, application developers often fine-tune the embeddings to improve their accuracy on the dataset and query workload in hand. Existing approaches either fine-tune the pre-trained model itself or, more efficiently, but at the cost of accuracy, train adaptor models to transform the output of the pre-trained model. We present NUDGE, a family of novel non-parametric embedding fine-tuning approaches that are significantly more accurate and efficient than both sets of existing approaches. NUDGE directly modifies the embeddings of data records to maximize the accuracy of $k$-NN retrieval. We present a thorough theoretical and experimental study of NUDGE's non-parametric approach. We show that even though the underlying problem is NP-Hard, constrained variations can be solved efficiently. These constraints additionally ensure that the changes to the embeddings are modest, avoiding large distortions to the semantics learned during pre-training. In experiments across five pre-trained models and nine standard text and image retrieval datasets, NUDGE runs in minutes and often improves NDCG@10 by more than 10% over existing fine-tuning methods. On average, NUDGE provides 3.3x and 4.3x higher increase in accuracy and runs 200x and 3x faster, respectively, over fine-tuning the pre-trained model and training adaptors.</description>

      <title>An Effective Tag Assignment Approach for Billboard Advertisement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Billboard Advertisement has gained popularity due to its significant outrage in return on investment. To make this advertisement approach more effective, the relevant information about the product needs to be reached to the relevant set of people. This can be achieved if the relevant set of tags can be mapped to the correct slots. Formally, we call this problem the Tag Assignment Problem in Billboard Advertisement. Given trajectory, billboard database, and a set of selected billboard slots and tags, this problem asks to output a mapping of selected tags to the selected slots so that the influence is maximized. We model this as a variant of traditional bipartite matching called One-To-Many Bipartite Matching (OMBM). Unlike traditional bipartite matching, a tag can be assigned to only one slot; in the OMBM, a tag can be assigned to multiple slots while the vice versa can not happen. We propose an iterative solution approach that incrementally allocates the tags to the slots. The proposed methodology has been explained with an illustrated example. A complexity analysis of the proposed solution approach has also been conducted. The experimental results on real-world trajectory and billboard datasets prove our claim on the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution.</description>

      <title>iRangeGraph: Improvising Range-dedicated Graphs for Range-filtering Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Range-filtering approximate nearest neighbor (RFANN) search is attracting increasing attention in academia and industry. Given a set of data objects, each being a pair of a high-dimensional vector and a numeric value, an RFANN query with a vector and a numeric range as parameters returns the data object whose numeric value is in the query range and whose vector is nearest to the query vector. To process this query, a recent study proposes to build $O(n^2)$ dedicated graph-based indexes for all possible query ranges to enable efficient processing on a database of $n$ objects. As storing all these indexes is prohibitively expensive, the study constructs compressed indexes instead, which reduces the memory consumption considerably. However, this incurs suboptimal performance because the compression is lossy. In this study, instead of materializing a compressed index for every possible query range in preparation for querying, we materialize graph-based indexes, called elemental graphs, for a moderate number of ranges. We then provide an effective and efficient algorithm that during querying can construct an index for any query range using the elemental graphs. We prove that the time needed to construct such an index is low. We also cover an experimental study on real-world datasets that provides evidence that the materialized elemental graphs only consume moderate space and that the proposed method is capable of superior and stable query performance across different query workloads.</description>

      <title>Pooling And Attention: What Are Effective Designs For LLm-Based Embedding Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The significant advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks have led to a growing body of work exploring LLM-based embedding models. While these models, employing different pooling and attention strategies, have achieved state-of-the-art performance on public embedding benchmarks, questions still arise about what constitutes an effective design for LLM-based embedding models. However, these models are often trained on different datasets, using different LLM base models or training settings. Moreover, evaluations on public embedding benchmarks often fail to report statistical significance, making it difficult to determine which designs truly contribute to final performance. This complicates the process for practitioners seeking optimal training recipes for LLM-based embedding models. In this study, we conduct a large-scale experiment by training a series of LLM-based embedding models using the same training data and base model but differing in their pooling and attention strategies. The results show that there is no one-size-fits-all solution: while bidirectional attention and an additional trainable pooling layer outperform in text similarity and information retrieval tasks, they do not significantly surpass simpler designs like EOS-last token pooling and default causal attention in clustering and classification tasks. Furthermore, we propose a new pooling strategy, Multi-Layers Trainable Pooling, which transforms the outputs of all hidden layers, rather than just the last layer, using a cross-attention network. This method proves to be statistically superior in text similarity and retrieval tasks compared to existing pooling methods. Overall, this paper sheds light on effective training strategies for LLM-based embedding models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a prototype for a Bioinformatics Retrieval Augmentation Data (BRAD) digital assistant. BRAD integrates a suite of tools to handle a wide range of bioinformatics tasks, from code execution to online search. We demonstrate BRAD's capabilities through (1) improved question-and-answering with retrieval augmented generation (RAG), (2) BRAD's ability to run and write complex software pipelines, and (3) BRAD's ability to organize and distribute tasks across individual and teams of agents. We use BRAD for automation of bioinformatics workflows, performing tasks ranging from gene enrichment and searching the archive to automatic code generation and running biomarker identification pipelines. BRAD is a step toward the ultimate goal to develop a digital twin of laboratories driven by self-contained loops for hypothesis generation and testing of digital biology experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recommender system (RS) has been an integral toolkit of online services. They are equipped with various deep learning techniques to model user preference based on identifier and attribute information. With the emergence of multimedia services, such as short videos, news and etc., understanding these contents while recommending becomes critical. Besides, multimodal features are also helpful in alleviating the problem of data sparsity in RS. Thus, Multimodal Recommender System (MRS) has attracted much attention from both academia and industry recently. In this paper, we will give a comprehensive survey of the MRS models, mainly from technical views. First, we conclude the general procedures and major challenges for MRS. Then, we introduce the existing MRS models according to four categories, i.e., Modality Encoder, Feature Interaction, Feature Enhancement and Model Optimization. Besides, to make it convenient for those who want to research this field, we also summarize the dataset and code resources. Finally, we discuss some promising future directions of MRS and conclude this paper. To access more details of the surveyed papers, such as implementation code, we open source a repository.</description>

      <title>CaDRec: Contextualized and Debiased Recommender Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender models aimed at mining users' behavioral patterns have raised great attention as one of the essential applications in daily life. Recent work on graph neural networks (GNNs) or debiasing methods has attained remarkable gains. However, they still suffer from (1) over-smoothing node embeddings caused by recursive convolutions with GNNs, and (2) the skewed distribution of interactions due to popularity and user-individual biases. This paper proposes a contextualized and debiased recommender model (CaDRec). To overcome the over-smoothing issue, we explore a novel hypergraph convolution operator that can select effective neighbors during convolution by introducing both structural context and sequential context. To tackle the skewed distribution, we propose two strategies for disentangling interactions: (1) modeling individual biases to learn unbiased item embeddings, and (2) incorporating item popularity with positional encoding. Moreover, we mathematically show that the imbalance of the gradients to update item embeddings exacerbates the popularity bias, thus adopting regularization and weighting schemes as solutions. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of the CaDRec against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our source code and data are released at https://github.com/WangXFng/CaDRec.</description>

      <title>NFARec: A Negative Feedback-Aware Recommender Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN)-based models have been extensively studied for recommendations, as they can extract high-order collaborative signals accurately which is required for high-quality recommender systems. However, they neglect the valuable information gained through negative feedback in two aspects: (1) different users might hold opposite feedback on the same item, which hampers optimal information propagation in GNNs, and (2) even when an item vastly deviates from users' preferences, they might still choose it and provide a negative rating. In this paper, we propose a negative feedback-aware recommender model (NFARec) that maximizes the leverage of negative feedback. To transfer information to multi-hop neighbors along an optimal path effectively, NFARec adopts a feedback-aware correlation that guides hypergraph convolutions (HGCs) to learn users' structural representations. Moreover, NFARec incorporates an auxiliary task - predicting the feedback sentiment polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of the next interaction - based on the Transformer Hawkes Process. The task is beneficial for understanding users by learning the sentiment expressed in their previous sequential feedback patterns and predicting future interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFARec outperforms competitive baselines. Our source code and data are released at https://github.com/WangXFng/NFARec.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Named Entity Recognition Using Few-Shot Prompting with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper evaluates Few-Shot Prompting with Large Language Models for Named Entity Recognition (NER). Traditional NER systems rely on extensive labeled datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. Few-Shot Prompting or in-context learning enables models to recognize entities with minimal examples. We assess state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 in NER tasks, comparing their few-shot performance to fully supervised benchmarks. Results show that while there is a performance gap, large models excel in adapting to new entity types and domains with very limited data.

      <title>Jina-ColBERT-v2: A General-Purpose Multilingual Late Interaction Retriever</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-vector dense models, such as ColBERT, have proven highly effective in information retrieval. ColBERT's late interaction scoring approximates the joint query-document attention seen in cross-encoders while maintaining inference efficiency closer to traditional dense retrieval models, thanks to its bi-encoder architecture and recent optimizations in indexing and search. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture and a training framework to support long context window and multilingual retrieval. Our new model, Jina-ColBERT-v2, demonstrates strong performance across a range of English and multilingual retrieval tasks,</description>

      <title>MARS: Matching Attribute-aware Representations for Text-based Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation aims to predict the next item a user is likely to prefer based on their sequential interaction history. Recently, text-based sequential recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm that uses pre-trained language models to exploit textual item features to enhance performance and facilitate knowledge transfer to unseen datasets. However, existing text-based recommender models still struggle with two key challenges: (i) representing users and items with multiple attributes, and (ii) matching items with complex user interests. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model, Matching Attribute-aware Representations for Text-based Sequential Recommendation (MARS). MARS extracts detailed user and item representations through attribute-aware text encoding, capturing diverse user intents with multiple attribute-aware representations. It then computes user-item scores via attribute-wise interaction matching, effectively capturing attribute-level user preferences. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MARS significantly outperforms existing sequential models, achieving improvements of up to 24.43% and 29.26% in Recall@10 and NDCG@10 across five benchmark datasets.

      <title>Smart E-commerce Recommendations with Semantic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In e-commerce, web mining for page recommendations is widely used but often fails to meet user needs. To address this, we propose a novel solution combining semantic web mining with BP neural networks. We process user search logs to extract five key features: content priority, time spent, user feedback, recommendation semantics, and input deviation. These features are then fed into a BP neural network to classify and prioritize web pages. The prioritized pages are recommended to users. Using book sales pages for testing, our results demonstrate that this solution can quickly and accurately identify the pages users need. Our approach ensures that recommendations are more relevant and tailored to individual preferences, enhancing the online shopping experience. By leveraging advanced semantic analysis and neural network techniques, we bridge the gap between user expectations and actual recommendations. This innovative method not only improves accuracy but also speeds up the recommendation process, making it a valuable tool for e-commerce platforms aiming to boost user satisfaction and engagement. Additionally, our system ability to handle large datasets and provide real-time recommendations makes it a scalable and efficient solution for modern e-commerce challenges.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Information Retrieval: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07107v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a primary means of information acquisition, information retrieval (IR) systems, such as search engines, have integrated themselves into our daily lives. These systems also serve as components of dialogue, question-answering, and recommender systems. The trajectory of IR has evolved dynamically from its origins in term-based methods to its integration with advanced neural models. While the neural models excel at capturing complex contextual signals and semantic nuances, thereby reshaping the IR landscape, they still face challenges such as data scarcity, interpretability, and the generation of contextually plausible yet potentially inaccurate responses. This evolution requires a combination of both traditional methods (such as term-based sparse retrieval methods with rapid response) and modern neural architectures (such as language models with powerful language understanding capacity). Meanwhile, the emergence of large language models (LLMs), typified by ChatGPT and GPT-4, has revolutionized natural language processing due to their remarkable language understanding, generation, generalization, and reasoning abilities. Consequently, recent research has sought to leverage LLMs to improve IR systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research trajectory, it is necessary to consolidate existing methodologies and provide nuanced insights through a comprehensive overview. In this survey, we delve into the confluence of LLMs and IR systems, including crucial aspects such as query rewriters, retrievers, rerankers, and readers. Additionally, we explore promising directions, such as search agents, within this expanding field.</description>

      <title>HIRO: Hierarchical Information Retrieval Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has revolutionized natural language processing by dynamically integrating external knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing their limitation of static training datasets. Recent implementations of RAG leverage hierarchical data structures, which organize documents at various levels of summarization and information density. This complexity, however, can cause LLMs to "choke" on information overload, necessitating more sophisticated querying mechanisms. In this context, we introduce Hierarchical Information Retrieval Optimization (HIRO), a novel querying approach that employs a Depth-First Search (DFS)-based recursive similarity score calculation and branch pruning. This method uniquely minimizes the context delivered to the LLM without informational loss, effectively managing the challenge of excessive data. HIRO's refined approach is validated by a 10.85% improvement in performance on the NarrativeQA dataset.</description>

      <title>The Design of an LLM-powered Unstructured Analytics System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs demonstrate an uncanny ability to process unstructured data, and as such, have the potential to go beyond search and run complex, semantic analyses at scale. We describe the design of an unstructured analytics system, Aryn, and the tenets and use cases that motivate its design. With Aryn, users can specify queries in natural language and the system automatically determines a semantic plan and executes it to compute an answer from a large collection of unstructured documents using LLMs. At the core of Aryn is Sycamore, a declarative document processing engine, built using Ray, that provides a reliable distributed abstraction called DocSets. Sycamore allows users to analyze, enrich, and transform complex documents at scale. Aryn also comprises Luna, a query planner that translates natural language queries to Sycamore scripts, and the Aryn Partitioner, which takes raw PDFs and document images, and converts them to DocSets for downstream processing. Using Aryn, we demonstrate a real world use case for analyzing accident reports from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and discuss some of the major challenges we encountered in deploying Aryn in the wild.</description>
