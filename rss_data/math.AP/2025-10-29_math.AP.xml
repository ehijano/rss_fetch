      <title>Keller-Osserman and Harnack type results for nonlinear elliptic PDE with unbounded ingredients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the classical Keller-Osserman theorem on the solvability of the equation $\mathcal{L}[u] = f(u)$ is valid when $\mathcal{L}$ is a general operator in divergence form with unbounded coefficients in the natural regime of local integrability. This has been open up to now, earlier results concerned operators with locally bounded ingredients. We also settle an open question from \cite{SS21} about the validity of the strong maximum principle for supersolutions of $\mathcal{L}[u] = f(u)$ under the optimal integral condition of V\'azquez. More generally, we obtain a Harnack inequality for positive solutions of this equation, which extends a result by V. Julin.</description>

      <title>A Coupled Generalized Korteweg-de Vries System Driven by White Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a system of coupled, stochastic generalized Korteweg-de Vries equations with nonlinear coupling and additive space-time white noise. The system models interacting wave fields with different dispersion relations subject to random environmental fluctuations, and it appears in various physical contexts such as fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and nonlinear optics. For this system, we determine sufficient conditions that ensure the problem is locally well-posed for $(\phi_0,\varphi_0)\in H^{s} \times H^{s},$ where $ s&gt;\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Scalings with Non-standard Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate quantitative regularity estimates for degenerate parabolic partial differential equations, with a focus on Orlicz-type diffusive structures. Using a geometric tangential analysis tailored to these structures and a general notion of intrinsic scalings, we derive precise interior H\"older regularity estimates for bounded weak solutions. These results offer new insights, even in the time-stationary case.</description>

      <title>A class of forward-backward regularizations of the Perona-Malik equation with variable exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel class of regularizations of the Perona-Malik equation with variable exponents, of forward-backward parabolic type, which possess a variational structure and have potential applications in image processing. The existence of Young measure solutions to the Neumann initial-boundary value problem for the proposed equation is established via Sobolev approximation and the vanishing viscosity limit. The proofs rely on Rothe's method, variational principles, and Young measure theory. The theoretical results confirm numerical observations concerning the generic behavior of solutions with suitably chosen variable exponents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on some new vector inequalities established by Figalli and Zhang [\emph{Duke Math. J.} \textbf{171} (2022), 2407--2459], we study the stability of the scale invariant and the scale non-invariant $L^p$-Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities, which fills the recent work of Do \emph{et al.} [$L^p$-Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities and their stabilities, arXiv: 2310.07083] for $1&lt;p&lt;2$, and also extends some results of Cazacu \emph{et al.} [\emph{J. Math. Pures Appl. (9)} \textbf{182} (2024), 253--284] to a general case for $L^p$-Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities with $1&lt;p&lt;N$.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Enhanced Calibration of the Heston Model: A Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Heston stochastic volatility model is a widely used tool in financial mathematics for pricing European options. However, its calibration remains computationally intensive and sensitive to local minima due to the model's nonlinear structure and high-dimensional parameter space. This paper introduces a hybrid deep learning-based framework that enhances both the computational efficiency and the accuracy of the calibration procedure. The proposed approach integrates two supervised feedforward neural networks: the Price Approximator Network (PAN), which approximates the option price surface based on strike and moneyness inputs, and the Calibration Correction Network (CCN), which refines the Heston model's output by correcting systematic pricing errors. Experimental results on real S\&amp;P 500 option data demonstrate that the deep learning approach outperforms traditional calibration techniques across multiple error metrics, achieving faster convergence and superior generalization in both in-sample and out-of-sample settings. This framework offers a practical and robust solution for real-time financial model calibration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study large deviations from the invariant measure for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with colored noises on determining modes. The proof is based on a new abstract criterion, inspired by [V. Jak\v{s}i\'{c} et al., Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 68 (2015), 2108-2143]. To address the difficulty caused by fixed squeezing rate, we introduce a bootstrap argument to derive Lipschitz estimates for Feynman-Kac semigroups. This criterion is also applicable to wave equations and Navier-Stokes system.</description>

      <title>Global stability and asymptotic behavior for the incompressible MHD equations without viscosity or magnetic diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical experiments and numerical simulations have revealed a remarkable stabilizing phenomenon: a background magnetic field stabilizes and dampens electrically conducting fluids. This paper provides a rigorous mathematical justification of this effect for the $n$-dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations with partial diffusion on periodic domains. We establish the global stability and derive explicit decay rates for perturbations around an equilibrium magnetic field satisfying the Diophantine condition. Our results yield the \textit{effective decay rates in all intermediate Sobolev norms} and \textit{significantly relax the regularity requirements} on the initial data compared with previous works (\textit{Sci. China Math.} 41:1--10, 2022; \textit{J. Differ. Equ.} 374:267--278, 2023; \textit{Calc. Var. Partial Differ. Equ.} 63:191, 2024). Furthermore, the analytical framework developed here is dimension-independent and can be flexibly adapted to other fluid models with partial dissipation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a unit ball in one and two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a unit ball in one and two dimensions with Dirichlet boundary conditions, which have stabilizing effect on solutions behavior. In particular, we confirm that the ground state solutions are stable in subcritical and critical cases, and in the supercritical case the ground state solutions split into a stable and an unstable branch. Perturbations of a ground state on the stable branch keep solutions near a corresponding ground state with very small oscillation around it, while perturbations of the unstable branch make solutions either blow up in finite time, if perturbations have an amplitude large than the height of the ground state, or oscillate between two states, if perturbations have an amplitude smaller than the original ground state. We also observe that this equation does not have any scattering or radiation, and thus, the soliton resolution holds for all data, splitting solutions into coherent structures such as ground state solutions even for very small initial data.</description>

      <title>A note on relations between convexity and concavity of thermodynamic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with proving the equivalence of convexity or concavity properties of thermodynamic functions, such as energy and entropy, depending on different sets of variables. These variables are the basic thermodynamic state variables, specific state variables or the densities of state variables that are used in continuum mechanics. We prove results for transformations of variables and functions in conjunction with convexity properties. We are concerned with convexity, strict convexity, positive definite Hessian matrices and the analogous forms of concavity. The main results are equivalence relations for these properties between functions. These equivalences are independent of the equations of state since they only use general properties of them. The results can be used for instance to easily prove that the entropy density function for the Euler equations in conservative variables in three space dimensions is strictly concave or even has a negative definite Hessian matrix. Further, we show how various equations of state imply these properties and how these properties are relevant to mathematical analysis.</description>

      <title>Stochastic perturbation and zero noise limit for scalar conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24475v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar conservation laws sit at the intersection between being simple enough to study analytically, while being complex enough to exhibit a wide range of nonlinear phenomena. We introduce a novel stochastic perturbation of scalar conservation laws, inspired by mean field games. We prove well-posedness of the stochastically perturbed equation; prove that it converges as the noise parameter is sent to $0$; and that the limit is the unique entropy solution of the conservation law. Thus, the noise acts as a selection criterion for (deterministic) conservation laws. This is the first such result for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that on a compact Riemannian manifold, resolvent bounds for the Laplace--Beltrami operator imply observability, and thus controllability, for the Schr\"odinger propagator from time sets of positive Lebesgue measure. Applications include almost all cases where observability and controllability hold from time intervals, particularly when the geometric control condition is satisfied or when the manifold is a compact surface of negative curvature.</description>

      <title>Non-polyconvex $Q$-integrands with lower semicontinuous energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a positive measure on the space of positively oriented $2$-vectors in $\mathbb{R}^4$, whose barycenter is a simple $2$-vector, yet which cannot be approximated by weighted Gaussian images of Lipschitz $Q$-graphs for any fixed $Q \in \mathbb{N}$. The construction extends to positively oriented $m$-vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ whenever $n-2 \ge m\geq 2$. This geometric obstruction implies that the approximation result established in [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 2025] is sharp: all $Q \in \mathbb{N}$ are indeed necessary to ensure the density of weighted Gaussian images of Lipschitz multigraphs in the space of positive measures with simple barycenter. As an application, we prove that for every $Q\geq 1$ and $p\ge 2$ there exists a non-polyconvex $Q$-integrand whose associated energy is weakly lower semicontinuous in $W^{1,p}$. This also provides new insight into the question posed in [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 2025, Remark 1.14].</description>

      <title>A Physics-informed Multi-resolution Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The predictive accuracy of operator learning frameworks depends on the quality and quantity of available training data (input-output function pairs), often requiring substantial amounts of high-fidelity data, which can be challenging to obtain in some real-world engineering applications. These datasets may be unevenly discretized from one realization to another, with the grid resolution varying across samples. In this study, we introduce a physics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution Independent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup, addressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but sufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained basis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal coordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are enforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation and performance of the proposed method are benchmarked on several numerical examples with multi-resolution data, where input functions are sampled at varying resolutions, including both coarse and fine discretizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect describes how photons are gravitationally redshifted, producing anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background. We study the inverse problem and show that primordial gravitational perturbations, in particular their polarizations in the transversally traceless (TT) gauge can be identified from the local observation of the ISW effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distribution theory is a cornerstone of the theory of partial differential equations. We report on the progress of formalizing the theory of tempered distributions in the interactive proof assistant Lean, which is the first formalization in any proof assistant. We give an overview of the mathematical theory and highlight key aspects of the formalization that differ from the classical presentation. As an application, we prove that the Fourier transform extends to a linear isometry on $L^2$ and we define Sobolev spaces via the Fourier transform on tempered distributions.</description>

  \partial_t u -\Delta u = |u|^{p-1}u, \quad p&gt;1, \end{equation} in dimensions $d \geq 3$ has non-unique local solutions in $L^q(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for $q &lt; d(p-1)/2$ provided that $p &lt; p_{JL}$, where $p_{JL}$ denotes the Joseph-Lundgren exponent. In this paper we investigate the effect of different randomizations on the well-posedness of the equation. First we show that adding a forcing term white in time and colored in space in \eqref{Eq:Heat_abstract} is not sufficient to improve the solution theory: namely, we prove non-uniqueness for local-in-time mild solutions of \eqref{Eq:Heat_abstract} with additive noise. Second, we discuss how randomizing the initial conditions of \eqref{Eq:Heat_abstract} affects its well-posedness.</description>

      <title>Resonant vector bundles, conjugate points, and the stability of pulse solutions to the {S}wift-{H}ohenberg equation using validated numerics: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop new theory connected with resonant vector bundles that will allow for the use of validated numerics to rigorously determine the stability of pulse solutions in the context of the Swift-Hohenberg equation. For many PDEs, the stability of stationary solutions is determined by the absence of point spectra in the open right half of the complex plane. Recently, theoretical developments have allowed one to use objects called conjugate points to detect such unstable eigenvalues for certain linearized operators. Moreover, in certain cases these conjugate points can themselves be detected using validated numerics. The aim of this work is to extend this framework to contexts where the vector bundles, which control the existence of conjugate points, have certain resonances. Such resonances can prevent the use of standard (though involved) techniques in computer assisted proofs, and in this paper we provide a method to overcome this obstacle. Due to its length, the analysis has been divided into two parts: Part I in the present work, and Part II in [BJPS25].</description>

      <title>On a robust inf-sup condition for the Stokes problem in slender domains -- with application to preconditioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a norm on the pressure variable in the Stokes equation that allows us to prove a continuous inf-sup condition with a constant independent of the domain's aspect ratio. This is in contrast to the standard inf-sup constant, which breaks down as the aspect ratio increases. We further apply our result to construct robust operator preconditioners for the Stokes problem in slender domains. Several numerical examples illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>Fast algorithms enabling optimization and deep learning for photoacoustic tomography in a circular detection geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inverse source problem arising in photoacoustic tomography and in several other coupled-physics modalities is frequently solved by iterative algorithms. Such algorithms are based on the minimization of a certain cost functional. In addition, novel deep learning techniques are currently being investigated to further improve such optimization approaches. All such methods require multiple applications of the operator defining the forward problem, and of its adjoint. In this paper, we present new asymptotically fast algorithms for numerical evaluation of the forward and adjoint operators, applicable in the circular acquisition geometry. For an $(n \times n)$ image, our algorithms compute these operators in $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log n)$ floating point operations. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithms in numerical simulations, where they are used as an integral part of several iterative image reconstruction techniques: classic variational methods, such as non-negative least squares and total variation regularized least squares, as well as deep learning methods, such as learned primal dual. A Python implementation of our algorithms and computational examples is available to the general public.</description>

      <title>Reduced dynamics for models of pattern formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to analyze the long-term behavior of reaction-diffusion systems arising in two-species chemical models and to identify the minimal set of modes that determine their dynamics. The models considered include, as particular cases, the Brusselator, the Gray--Scott, and the Glycolysis models. These systems are described by coupled reaction-diffusion equations and admit a finite-dimensional representation based on a limited number of spatial Fourier modes that capture their essential reduced dynamics. The concept of determining modes, introduced in this context, is closely related to other approaches that seek finite-dimensional representations of infinite-dimensional dynamics, such as the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and the construction of Approximate Inertial Manifolds. We prove that the dynamics of the system can be completely characterized by a finite number of low modes, since all higher modes are asymptotically determined by them, thus providing an analytical foundation for reduced dynamics in models of pattern formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays a vast literature is available on the Hele-Shaw or incompressible limit for nonlinear degenerate diffusion equations. This problem has attracted a lot of attention due to its applications to tissue growth and crowd motion modelling as it constitutes a way to link soft congestion (or compressible) models to hard congestion (or incompressible) descriptions. In this paper, we address the question of estimating the rate of this asymptotics in the presence of external drifts. In particular, we provide improved results in the 2-Wasserstein distance which are global in time thanks to the contractivity property that holds for strictly convex potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bottleneck in the theory of large-amplitude and multi-d viscous and relaxation shock stability is the development of nonlinear damping estimates controlling higher by lower derivatives. These have traditionally proceeded from time-evolution bounds based on Friedrichs symmetric and Kawashima or Goodman type energy estimates. Here, we propose an alternative program based on frequency-dependent pseudodifferential time-space damping estimates in the spirit of Kreiss. These are seen to be equivalent in the linear case to high-frequency spectral stability, and, just as for the constant-coefficient analysis of Kreiss, sharp in a pointwise, fixed-frequency, sense. This point of view leads to a number of simplifications and extensions using already-existing analysis. We point to the new issue of turning points, analogous to glancing points in the constant-coefficient case as an important direction for further development.</description>

      <title>Sharp commutator estimates of all order for Coulomb and Riesz modulated energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove functional inequalities in any dimension controlling the iterated derivatives along a transport of the Coulomb or super-Coulomb Riesz modulated energy in terms of the modulated energy itself. This modulated energy was introduced by the second author and collaborators in the study of mean-field limits and statistical mechanics of Coulomb/Riesz gases, where control of such derivatives by the energy itself is an essential ingredient. In this paper, we extend and improve such functional inequalities, proving estimates which are now sharp in their additive error term, in their density dependence, valid at arbitrary order of differentiation, and localizable to the support of the transport. Our method relies on the observation that these iterated derivatives are the quadratic form of a commutator. Taking advantage of the Riesz nature of the interaction, we identify these commutators as solutions to a degenerate elliptic equation with a right-hand side exhibiting a recursive structure in terms of lower-order commutators and develop a local regularity theory for the commutators, which may be of independent interest.
  These estimates have applications to obtaining sharp rates of convergence for mean-field limits, quasi-neutral limits, and in proving central limit theorems for the fluctuations of Coulomb/Riesz gases. In particular, we show here the expected $N^{\frac{\mathsf{s}}{\mathsf{d}}-1}$-rate in the modulated energy distance for the mean-field convergence of first-order Hamiltonian and gradient flows.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Stokes eigenvalue problem in open balls and open annuli in R3 with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Using the frame of toroidal and poloidal fields we construct the othogonal decomposition of the Stokes eigenvalue problem in problems for toroidal and poloidal eigenfunctions. This provides the proof of the completeness of a system of explicitly calculated Stokes eigenfunctions given by one of the authors in 1999, [14].</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on remainder estimates of the magnetic $L^p$-Hardy inequalities for $1&lt;p&lt;2$. \emph{Firstly}, we establish a family of remainder terms involving magnetic gradients of the magnetic $L^p$-Hardy inequalities, which are also new even for the classical $L^p$-Hardy inequalities. \emph{Secondly}, we study another family of remainder terms involving logarithmic terms of the magnetic $L^p$-Hardy inequalities. \emph{Lastly}, as a byproduct, we further obtain remainder terms of some other $L^p$-Hardy-type inequalities by using similar proof of our main results.
  Furthermore, this paper answers the open question proposed by Cazacu \emph{et al.} in [\emph{Nonlinearity} \textbf{37} (2024), Paper No. 035004] and can be viewed as a supplementary work of it.</description>

      <title>Time-Periodic Solutions for Hyperbolic-Parabolic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-periodic weak solutions for a coupled hyperbolic-parabolic system are obtained. A linear heat and wave equation are considered on two respective $d$-dimensional spatial domains that share a common $(d-1)$-dimensional interface $\Gamma$. The system is only partially damped, leading to an indeterminate case for existing theory (Galdi et al., 2014). We construct periodic solutions by obtaining novel a priori estimates for the coupled system, reconstructing the total energy via the interface $\Gamma$. As a byproduct, geometric constraints manifest on the wave domain which are reminiscent of classical boundary control conditions for wave stabilizability. We note a ``loss" of regularity between the forcing and solution which is greater than that associated with the heat-wave Cauchy problem. However, we consider a broader class of spatial domains and mitigate this regularity loss by trading time and space differentiations, a feature unique to the periodic setting. This seems to be the first constructive result addressing existence and uniqueness of periodic solutions in the heat-wave context, where no dissipation is present in the wave interior. Our results speak to the open problem of the (non-)emergence of resonance in complex systems, and are readily generalizable to related systems and certain nonlinear cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalized divergence theorem is established allowing for domains with inner boundaries. The normal trace of a rough integrand is not a Radon measure; rather, the boundary integral is expressed via a surface functional continuous with respect to the uniform convergence of integrands. We provide necessary and sufficient analytic and geometric conditions on the domain for the validity of the theorem. Central to this characterization is the introduction of the space of functions having bounded fluctuation, whose norm is precisely defined so that the divergence theorem holds if and only if the characteristic function $\chi_U$ of the integration domain $U \subset \R^m$ has finite norm.</description>

Abstract: We find a large solution to a semilinear Dirichlet problem in a bounded $C^{1,1}$ domain for a non-local operator $\phi(-\Delta\vert_{D})$, an extension of the infinitesimal generator of a subordinate killed Brownian motion. The setting covers and extends the case of the spectral fractional Laplacian. The upper bound for the explosion rate of the large solution is obtained, and is given in terms of the renewal function, distance to the boundary, and the Keller-Osserman-type transformation of the nonlinearity. Additionally, we prove interior higher regularity results for this operator.</description>

      <title>Telegrapher's Generative Model via Kac Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20641v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We break the mold in flow-based generative modeling by proposing a new model based on the damped wave equation, also known as telegrapher's equation. Similar to the diffusion equation and Brownian motion, there is a Feynman-Kac type relation between the telegrapher's equation and the stochastic Kac process in 1D. The Kac flow evolves stepwise linearly in time, so that the probability flow is Lipschitz continuous in the Wasserstein distance and, in contrast to diffusion flows, the norm of the velocity is globally bounded. Furthermore, the Kac model has the diffusion model as its asymptotic limit. We extend these considerations to a multi-dimensional stochastic process which consists of independent 1D Kac processes in each spatial component. We show that this process gives rise to an absolutely continuous curve in the Wasserstein space and compute the conditional velocity field starting in a Dirac point analytically. Using the framework of flow matching, we train a neural network that approximates the velocity field and use it for sample generation. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the scalability of our approach, and show its advantages over diffusion models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish new orthonormal Strichartz estimates for the fractional Schr\"odinger equations on torus $\mathbb T$ and waveguide manifold $\mathbb R^n\times \mathbb T^m$. We generalizes the result of Nakamura [42] on torus; while this is the first result on the waveguide manifold. The main novelty in this paper is the derivation of various kernel estimates associated to the fractional Schr\"odinger equations. Our kernel estimate generalizes the classical dispersive estimate on torus due to Kenig-Ponce-Vega [35]. On the other hand, we obtain new $\ell^2$ decoupling inequality for degeneracy type surfaces to treat the case of waveguide manifold; which maybe of independent interest and complements several known results. As an application, we establish local and small data global well-posednes for the Hartree equation with infinitely many particles with non-trace class initial data.</description>

      <title>Mountain Pass Critical Points of the Volume Constrained Area Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct mountain pass critical points of the perimeter functional on sets of fixed volume. For a generic metric, this gives rise to a smooth almost embedded hypersurface with non-zero constant mean curvature. Our work utilizes recent techniques of Mazurwoski--Zhou \cite{mazurowski2024infinitely}, and a new result on the connectedness of Cacciopoli sets: any two smooth Cacciopoli sets can be connected by an $\mathbf{F}$-continuous map.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of quasi-convex functionals with variable exponent growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a relaxation result for a quasi-convex bulk integral functional with variable exponent growth in a suitable space of bounded variation type. A key tool is a decomposition under mild assumptions of the energy into absolutely continuous and singular parts weighted via a recession function.</description>

      <title>Exponential and algebraic decay in Euler--alignment system with nonlocal interaction forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the large-time behavior of the pressureless Euler system with nonlocal velocity alignment and interaction forces, with the aim of characterizing the asymptotic convergence of classical solutions under general interaction potentials $W$ and communication weights. We establish quantitative convergence in three settings. In one dimension with $(\lambda,\Lambda)$-convex potentials, i.e., potentials satisfying uniform lower and upper quadratic bounds, bounded communication weights yield exponential decay, while weakly singular ones lead to sharp algebraic rates. For the Coulomb--quadratic potential $W(x)=-|x|+\frac12 |x|^2$, we prove exponential convergence for bounded communication weights and algebraic upper bounds for singular communication weights. In a multi-dimensional setting with uniformly $(\lambda,\Lambda)$-convex potentials, we show exponential decay for bounded weights and improved algebraic decay for singular ones. In all cases, the density converges (up to translation) to the minimizer of the interaction energy, while the velocity aligns to a uniform constant. A unifying feature is that the convergence rate depends only on the local behavior of communication weights: bounded kernels yield exponential convergence, while weakly singular ones produce algebraic rates. Our results thus provide a comprehensive description of the asymptotic behavior of Euler--alignment dynamics with general interaction potentials.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet eigenvalue problems for some concave elliptic Hessian operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate a priori estimates for the solution to the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem for a broad class of concave elliptic Hessian operators of the form \[ F(D^2u)=-\Lambda u \quad \textrm{in} \, \Omega, \qquad u=0 \quad \textrm{on} \, \partial \Omega. \] These operators encompass the Monge-Amp\`ere operator, the $k$-Hessian operators, and the $p$-Monge-Amp\`ere operators. We impose a fairly mild constraint on the operator $F$, allowing us to demonstrate the existence of the first nonzero eigenvalue and its corresponding $\Gamma$-admissible eigenfunction on the smooth, strictly $\Gamma$-convex domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$. Furthermore, we prove that the eigenfunction $u_{1}$ belongs to $C^{\infty}(\Omega) \cap C^{1,1}(\overline{\Omega})$. As an application, we prove that every invariant G\r{a}rding-Dirichlet operator admits a unique first nonzero eigenvalue. Finally, a bifurcation-type theory for these operators is also established.</description>

      <title>A hyperboloidal method for numerical simulations of multidimensional nonlinear wave equations: nonlinear tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the scalar wave equation with power nonlinearity in n+1 dimensions. Unlike most previous numerical studies, we go beyond the radial case and do not assume any symmetries for n=3, and we only impose an SO(n-1) symmetry in higher dimensions. Our method is based on a hyperboloidal foliation of Minkowski spacetime and conformal compactification. We focus on the late-time power-law decay (tails) of the solutions and compute decay exponents for different spherical harmonic modes, for subcritical, critical and supercritical, focusing and defocusing nonlinear wave equations.</description>
