      <title>On a non-commutative sixth $q$-Painlev\'e system: from discrete system to surface theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the non-commutative formal geometry underlying a certain class of discrete integrable systems. Our main example is a non-commutative analog, labeled \ref{eq:qPA3}, of the sixth $q$-Painleve equation. The system \ref{eq:qPA3} is constructed by postulating an extended birational representation of the extended affine Weyl group $\widetilde{W}$ of type $D_5^{(1)}$ and by selecting the same translation element in $\widetilde{W}$ as in the commutative case. Starting from this non-commutative discrete system, we develop a non-commutative version of Sakai's surface theory, which allows us to derive the same birational representation that we initially postulated. Moreover, we recover the well-known cascade of multiplicative discrete Painleve equations rooted in \ref{eq:qPA4} and establish a connection between \ref{eq:qPA3} and the non-commutative $d$-Painleve systems introduced in \cite{bobrova2024affine}.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal conservation laws for the two-dimensional Euler equation in vorticity form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the construction of the canonical conservation law and the nonlocal cosymmetry to derive a collection of nonlocal conservation laws for the two-dimensional Euler equation in vorticity form. For computational convenience and simplicity of presentation of the results we perform a complex rotation of the independent variables.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Properties of a Special Solution to the (3,4) String Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the asymptotic properties a special solution of the $(3,4)$ string equation, which appears in the study of the multicritical quartic $2$-matrix model. In particular, we show that in a certain parameter regime, the corresponding $\tau$-function has an asymptotic expansion which is `topological' in nature. Consequently, we show that this solution to the string equation with a specific set of Stokes data exists, at least asymptotically. We also demonstrate that, along specific curves in the parameter space, this $\tau$-function degenerates to the $\tau$-function for a tritronqu\'{e}e solution of Painlev\'{e} I (which appears in the critical quartic $1$-matrix model), indicating that there is a `renormalization group flow' between these critical points. This confirms a conjecture from [1].

      <title>Reality conditions to the sine-Gordon equation and quasi-periodic solutions in finite phase spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07862v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic solutions to the sine-Gordon equation are expressed in terms of $\wp_{1,2g-1}$-function, and reality conditions are completely specified. This new result
  leads to computation and graphical representation of non-linear wave solutions. A way of obtaining the finite-gap solutions by means of algebro-geometric integration is exposed in detail, as well as the construction of the sine-Gordon hierarchy on coadjoint orbits in the loop algebra of $\mathfrak{su}(2)$.</description>

      <title>Poisson structure and Integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the inhomogeneous six-vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15181v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle variables for a Hamiltonian flow of the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, from a formulation introduced in a 2022 work due to Keating, Reshetikhin, and Sridhar, hence confirming a conjecture of the authors as to whether the Hamiltonian flow is integrable. To demonstrate that such an integrability property of the Hamiltonian holds from the action-angle variables, we make use of previous methods for studying Hamiltonian systems, implemented by Faddeev and Takhtajan, in which it was shown that integrability of a Hamiltonian system holds for the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation by computing action-angle variables from the Poisson bracket, which is connected to the analysis of entries of the monodromy and transfer matrices. For the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, an approach for computing the action-angle variables is possible through formulating several relations between entries of the quantum monodromy, and transfer, matrices, which can be not only be further examined from the structure of $L$ operators, but also from computing several Poisson brackets parameterized from entries of the monodromy matrix.</description>

      <title>Exact solvability of an Ising-type model, and exact solvability of the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle coordinates for an Ising type model whose L-operator has been previously studied in the literature by Bazhanov and Sergeev. In comparison to computations with such operators that have been examined previously by the author for the 4-vertex, 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, computations for asymptotically approximating a collection of sixteen identities with the Poisson bracket, which together constitute the Poisson structure of the Ising type model, exhibit dependencies upon nearest neighbor interactions. Inspite of the fact that L-operators for the 20-vertex model are defined in terms of combinatorial, and algebraic, constituents unlike such operators for the 6-vertex model which are defined in terms of projectors and Pauli basis elements, L-operators for the Ising-type model can be used for concluding that a model which interpolates between the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models is exactly solvable.</description>
