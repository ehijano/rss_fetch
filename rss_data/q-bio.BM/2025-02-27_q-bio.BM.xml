      <title>SE(3)-Equivariant Ternary Complex Prediction Towards Target Protein Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Targeted protein degradation (TPD) induced by small molecules has emerged as a rapidly evolving modality in drug discovery, targeting proteins traditionally considered "undruggable". Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and molecular glue degraders (MGDs) are the primary small molecules that induce TPD. Both types of molecules form a ternary complex linking an E3 ligase with a target protein, a crucial step for drug discovery. While significant advances have been made in binary structure prediction for proteins and small molecules, ternary structure prediction remains challenging due to obscure interaction mechanisms and insufficient training data. Traditional methods relying on manually assigned rules perform poorly and are computationally demanding due to extensive random sampling. In this work, we introduce DeepTernary, a novel deep learning-based approach that directly predicts ternary structures in an end-to-end manner using an encoder-decoder architecture. DeepTernary leverages an SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network (GNN) with both intra-graph and ternary inter-graph attention mechanisms to capture intricate ternary interactions from our collected high-quality training dataset, TernaryDB. The proposed query-based Pocket Points Decoder extracts the 3D structure of the final binding ternary complex from learned ternary embeddings, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy and speed in existing PROTAC benchmarks without prior knowledge from known PROTACs. It also achieves notable accuracy on the more challenging MGD benchmark under the blind docking protocol. Remarkably, our experiments reveal that the buried surface area calculated from predicted structures correlates with experimentally obtained degradation potency-related metrics. Consequently, DeepTernary shows potential in effectively assisting and accelerating the development of TPDs for previously undruggable targets.</description>

      <title>Towards More Accurate Full-Atom Antibody Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antibody co-design represents a critical frontier in drug development, where accurate prediction of both 1D sequence and 3D structure of complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) is essential for targeting specific epitopes. Despite recent advances in equivariant graph neural networks for antibody design, current approaches often fall short in capturing the intricate interactions that govern antibody-antigen recognition and binding specificity. In this work, we present Igformer, a novel end-to-end framework that addresses these limitations through innovative modeling of antibody-antigen binding interfaces. Our approach refines the inter-graph representation by integrating personalized propagation with global attention mechanisms, enabling comprehensive capture of the intricate interplay between local chemical interactions and global conformational dependencies that characterize effective antibody-antigen binding. Through extensive validation on epitope-binding CDR design and structure prediction tasks, Igformer demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods, suggesting that explicit modeling of multi-scale residue interactions can substantially advance computational antibody design for therapeutic applications.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Antibody Sequence Design via Structure Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in protein design have leveraged diffusion models to generate structural scaffolds, followed by a process known as protein inverse folding, which involves sequence inference on these scaffolds. However, these methodologies face significant challenges when applied to hyper-variable structures such as antibody Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs), where sequence inference frequently results in non-functional sequences due to hallucinations. Distinguished from prevailing protein inverse folding approaches, this paper introduces Igseek, a novel structure-retrieval framework that infers CDR sequences by retrieving similar structures from a natural antibody database. Specifically, Igseek employs a simple yet effective multi-channel equivariant graph neural network to generate high-quality geometric representations of CDR backbone structures. Subsequently, it aligns sequences of structurally similar CDRs and utilizes structurally conserved sequence motifs to enhance inference accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that Igseek not only proves to be highly efficient in structural retrieval but also outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in sequence recovery for both antibodies and T-Cell Receptors, offering a new retrieval-based perspective for therapeutic protein design.</description>

      <title>A Model-Centric Review of Deep Learning for Protein Design</title>

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed protein design, enabling accurate structure prediction, sequence optimization, and de novo protein generation. Advances in single-chain protein structure prediction via AlphaFold2, RoseTTAFold, ESMFold, and others have achieved near-experimental accuracy, inspiring successive work extended to biomolecular complexes via AlphaFold Multimer, RoseTTAFold All-Atom, AlphaFold 3, Chai-1, Boltz-1 and others. Generative models such as ProtGPT2, ProteinMPNN, and RFdiffusion have enabled sequence and backbone design beyond natural evolution-based limitations. More recently, joint sequence-structure co-design models, including ESM3, have integrated both modalities into a unified framework, resulting in improved designability. Despite these advances, challenges still exist pertaining to modeling sequence-structure-function relationships and ensuring robust generalization beyond the regions of protein space spanned by the training data. Future advances will likely focus on joint sequence-structure-function co-design frameworks that are able to model the fitness landscape more effectively than models that treat these modalities independently. Current capabilities, coupled with the dizzying rate of progress, suggest that the field will soon enable rapid, rational design of proteins with tailored structures and functions that transcend the limitations imposed by natural evolution. In this review, we discuss the current capabilities of deep learning methods for protein design, focusing on some of the most revolutionary and capable models with respect to their functionality and the applications that they enable, leading up to the current challenges of the field and the optimal path forward.</description>

      <title>Machine learning methods to study sequence-ensemble-function relationships in disordered proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen tremendous developments in the use of machine learning models to link amino acid sequence, structure and function of folded proteins. These methods are, however, rarely applicable to the wide range of proteins and sequences that comprise intrinsically disordered regions. We here review developments in the study of sequence-ensemble-function relationships of disordered proteins that exploit or are used to train machine learning models. These include methods for generating conformational ensembles and designing new sequences, and for linking sequences to biophysical properties and biological functions. We highlight how these developments are built on a tight integration between experiment, theory and simulations, and account for evolutionary constraints, which operate on sequences of disordered regions differently than on those of folded domains.</description>

      <title>Hotspot-Driven Peptide Design via Multi-Fragment Autoregressive Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peptides, short chains of amino acids, interact with target proteins, making them a unique class of protein-based therapeutics for treating human diseases. Recently, deep generative models have shown great promise in peptide generation. However, several challenges remain in designing effective peptide binders. First, not all residues contribute equally to peptide-target interactions. Second, the generated peptides must adopt valid geometries due to the constraints of peptide bonds. Third, realistic tasks for peptide drug development are still lacking. To address these challenges, we introduce PepHAR, a hot-spot-driven autoregressive generative model for designing peptides targeting specific proteins. Building on the observation that certain hot spot residues have higher interaction potentials, we first use an energy-based density model to fit and sample these key residues. Next, to ensure proper peptide geometry, we autoregressively extend peptide fragments by estimating dihedral angles between residue frames. Finally, we apply an optimization process to iteratively refine fragment assembly, ensuring correct peptide structures. By combining hot spot sampling with fragment-based extension, our approach enables de novo peptide design tailored to a target protein and allows the incorporation of key hot spot residues into peptide scaffolds. Extensive experiments, including peptide design and peptide scaffold generation, demonstrate the strong potential of PepHAR in computational peptide binder design.
