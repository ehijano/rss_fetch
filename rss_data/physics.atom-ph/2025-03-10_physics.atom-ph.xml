      <title>Laser fluence-dependent production of molecular thorium ions in different charge states for trapped-ion experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thorium ions and molecules, recognized for their distinctive nuclear and atomic attributes, are central to numerous trapped-ion experiments globally. Our study introduces an effective, compact source of thorium ions produced via laser ablation of microgram-scale, salt-based samples. We thoroughly analyze the variety of ion species and charge states generated at varying laser fluences. Utilizing 10$\mu$g of thorium fluoride crystals and laser fluences between $100 - 700$ J$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$ we produce thorium molecular ions $^{232}$ThF$_x$$^{n+}$ (with $x= 0 - 3$ and charge states up to $n = 3+$), including ThF$^{2+}$ and ThF$^{3+}$. These species are particularly relevant for spectroscopy; ThF$^{3+}$ is valuable for its stable closed-shell configuration, while ThF$^{2+}$, which is isoelectronic to RaF, offers a unique probe for studying nuclear structure and fundamental symmetries due to its simple electronic structure with a single unpaired electron. Density functional theory calculations of the distribution of positive charge in the produced molecular cations and the simplicity of this setup indicate that this method is easily transferable to other actinide systems.</description>

      <title>Searching for Exotic Interactions between Antimatter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that atomic antimatter spectroscopy can be used to search for new bosons that carry spin-dependent exotic forces between antifermions. A comparison of a recent precise measurement of the hyperfine splitting of the $1$S and $2$S electronic levels of antihydrogen and bound-state quantum electrodynamics theory yields the first tests of positron-antiproton exotic interactions, constraining the dimensionless coupling strengths $g_pg_p$, $g_Vg_V$ and $g_Ag_A$, corresponding to the exchange of a pseudoscalar (axionlike), vector, or axial-vector boson, respectively. We also discuss new tests of CPT invariance with exotic spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions involving antimatter.</description>

      <title>Time delay of mean field interaction in thermal Rydberg atomic gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean field theory is commonly employed to study nonequilibrium dynamics in hot Rydberg atomic ensembles, but the fundamental mechanism behind the generation of the mean-field interactions remains poorly understood. In this work, we experimentally observe a time-delay effect in the buildup of mean-field interaction, which reveals the key role of collision ionization. We analyze the relevant collision channels and propose a microscopic mechanism that quantitatively explains the hysteresis window observed in optical bistability. Then, using square-wave modulation spectroscopy (SMS) to monitor the growth of the mean-field interaction, we experimentally demonstrate a delay in its dynamical buildup following the initial Rydberg excitation. Finally, we demonstrate how this delay effect may help understand the recently observed self-sustained oscillations in thermal Rydberg gases. Our findings provide compelling evidence for the contribution of ionization processes in the nonequilibrium dynamics of thermal Rydberg gas, a system of growing interest for quantum sensing and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculations of diatomic constants and ro-vibrational parameters for the ground state of singly charged aluminium monohalides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report electronic, vibrational, and rotational spectroscopic parameters for the ground state, X$^2\Sigma^{+}$, of singly charged aluminium monohalides, employing single-reference coupled-cluster theory with single and double excitations (CCSD) together with the relativistic basis sets. Higher order correlation effects coming from triple excitations are treated using perturbative CCSD(T) approach. Most of the molecular ions in the AlX$^+$ series, particularly barring the first two, have been studied here for the first time for their ground state electronic and vibrational structure. The vibrational parameters have been calculated by solving the vibrational Schr\"odinger equation utilizing potential energy curves and permanent dipole moment curves. Further, spontaneous and black-body radiation induced lifetimes have also been computed using relative energy separation and the transition dipole moments between the vibrational levels. The lifetimes of the lowest ro-vibrational states are found to be 10.63 s, 40.39 s, 23.13 s, 31.26 s, 13.43 s, and 8.08 s for the AlF$^+$, AlCl$^+$, AlBr$^+$, AlI$^+$, AlAt$^+$, and AlTs$^+$ ions, respectively. Furthermore, the rotational parameters such as Einstein coefficients and Franck-Condon factors for the lowest six vibrational states are also computed and reported in this work.</description>

      <title>Quartet correlations near the surface of $ N = Z $ nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate Cooper quartet correlations in $ N = Z $ doubly-magic nuclei ($ {}^{40} \mathrm{Ca} $, $ {}^{100} \mathrm{Sn} $, and $ {}^{164} \mathrm{Pb} $). We first examine the quartet condensation fraction in infinite symmetric nuclear matter by using the quartet Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. Together with the total nucleon density profiles of doubly-magic nuclei obtained from the Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculation, we discuss the spatial distribution of quartet correlations in finite nuclei within the local density approximation. Large quartet condensate fractions are found at the surface region of an atomic nucleus due to the strong neutron-proton attractive interactions responsible for the deuteron formation in vacuum. Moreover, we discuss a possible microscopic origin of the Wigner term in the context of nucleon-quartet scattering in dilute symmetric nuclear matter. The nucleon-quartet scattering effect on the Wigner term is numerically estimated as about one order of magnitude of the total empirical strength, indicating the importance of multi-nucleon clusters in the symmetry energy and mass formula in addition to the neutron-proton pairing.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Efimov Features and Universality in $^{87}$Rb-$^{40}$K Mixtures with finite-range interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of Efimov features and their relationships in $^{40}$K-$^{87}$Rb Mixtures has generated extensive discussion, yet the discrepancy between Efimov universality predictions based on the zero-range approximation and experimental observations remains unresolved. In this study, we investigate the three-body collision properties with $J=0$ symmetry for a $^{87}$Rb-$^{87}$Rb-$^{40}$K system on both sides of Rb-K scattering length to understand the mechanisms underlying this discrepancy. Our approach employs the R-matrix propagation method within a hyperspherical coordinate frame, utilizing the Lennard-Jones model potential to describe atom interactions. We predicts the existence of three-body shape resonances at large negative Rb-K scattering lengths, which leads to the enhancement of three-body recombination rates. On the positive Rb-K scattering length side, we find an Efimov recombination minimum beyond the range of previous measurements. These Efimov features, combined with experimental observations of the atom-dimer Efimov resonance, offer an opportunity to test the universality of Efimov features. Our study demonstrates the influence of finite-range effects and non-resonant intraspecies scattering length in $^{40}$K-$^{87}$Rb mixtures, providing valuable insights into the universal relations between Efimov features in heteronuclear systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of synchronisation in a driven-dissipative hot Rydberg vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observe synchronisation in a thermal (35-60 {\deg}C) atomic (Rb) ensemble driven to a highly-excited Rydberg state (principle quantum number n ranging from 43 to 79). Synchronisation in this system is unexpected due to the atomic motion, however, we show theoretically that sufficiently strong interactions via a global Rydberg density mean field causes frequency and phase entrainment. The emergent oscillations in the vapor's bulk quantities are detected in the transmission of the probe laser for a two-photon excitation scheme.</description>

      <title>Effects of $p$-wave Interactions on Borromean Efimov Trimers in Heavy-Light Fermi Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of $p$-wave interactions on Efimov trimers in systems comprising two identical heavy fermions and a light particle, with mass ratios larger than $13.6$. Our focus lies on the borromean regime where the ground-state trimer exists in the absence of dimers. Using pair-wise Lennard-Jones potentials and concentrating on the $L^{\pi} = 1^{-}$ symmetry, we explore the critical value of the interspecies $s$-wave scattering length $a_{c}$ at which the borromean state appears in several two-component particle systems. Our exploration encompasses the universal properties of $a_{c}$ and the influence of $p$-wave fermion-fermion interactions on its value. We find that, in the absence of $p$-wave fermion-fermion interactions, $a_{c}$ is determined universally by the van der Waals radius and mass ratio. However, the introduction of $p$-wave fermion-fermion interactions unveiled a departure from this universality. Our calculations show that the critical interspecies scattering length $a_{c}$ now depends on the details of the fermion-fermion $p$-wave interaction. And, the presence of $p$-wave fermion-fermion interactions favors the formation of the borromean state. Additionally, our investigation reveals that Efimov effect in the $1^{-}$ symmetry persist even when the fermion-fermion interaction reaches the $p$-wave unitary limit.</description>

      <title>Exploring atom-ion Feshbach resonances below the s-wave limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Revealing the quantum properties of matter requires a high degree of experimental control accompanied by a profound theoretical understanding. At ultracold temperatures, quantities that appear continuous in everyday life, such as the motional angular momentum of two colliding particles, become quantized, leaving a measurable imprint on experimental results. Embedding a single particle within a larger quantum bath at lowest temperatures can result in resonant partial-wave dependent interaction, whose strength near zero energy is dictated by universal threshold scaling laws. Hybrid atom-ion systems have emerged as a novel platform in which a single charged atom in an ultracold bath serves as a well-controlled impurity of variable energy. However, entering the low-energy s-wave regime and exploring the role of higher-partial-wave scattering within has remained an open challenge. Here, we immerse a Barium ion in a cloud of ultracold spin-polarized Lithium atoms, realize tunable collision energies below the s-wave limit and explore resonant higher-partial-wave scattering by studying the energy dependence of Feshbach resonances. Utilizing precise electric field control, we tune the collision energy over four orders of magnitude, reaching from the many-parital-wave to the s-wave regime. At the lowest energies, we probe the energy dependence of an isolated s-wave Feshbach resonance and introduce a theoretical model that allows to distinguish it from higher-partial-wave resonances. Additionally, at energies around the p-wave barrier, we find and identify an open-channel f-wave resonance, consistent with threshold laws. Our findings highlight and benchmark the importance of higher-partial-wave scattering well within the s-wave regime and offer control over chemical reactions and complex many-body dynamics in atom-ion ensembles - on the level of individual angular momentum quanta.</description>

      <title>Signature of localization-delocalization in collisional inhomogeneous spin-orbit coupled condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the localization transition in spin-orbit (SO) coupled binary Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with collisional inhomogeneous interaction trapped in a one-dimensional quasiperiodic potential. Our numerical analysis shows that the competition between the quasiperiodic disorder and inhomogeneous interaction leads to a localization-delocalization transition as the interaction strength is tuned from attractive to repulsive in nature. Furthermore, we analyse the combined effect of the SO and Rabi coupling strengths on the localization transition for different interaction strengths and obtain signatures of similar localization-delocalization transition as a function of SO coupling in the regime of weak interactions. We complement our numerical observation with the analytical model using the Gaussian variational approach. In the end, we show how the localization-delocalization is manifested in the quench dynamics of the condensate. Our study provides an indirect approach to achieve localization transition without tuning the quasiperiodic potential strength, but rather by tuning the inhomogeneity in the interaction.</description>

      <title>Formation of Complex Discrete Time Crystals with Ultracold Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study discrete time crystal formation in a system driven periodically by an oscillating atomic mirror, consisting of two distinct ultracold atomic clouds in the presence of a gravitational field. The intra-species interactions are weak and attractive, while the inter-species interactions are infinitely strong and repulsive. The clouds are arranged in a one-dimensional stack, where the bottom cloud bounces on an oscillating atomic mirror, which effectively acts as a driving force for the upper cloud due to the infinite inter-species repulsion. Using a Jastrow-like variational ansatz for the many-body wavefunction, we show that sufficiently strong attractive intra-species interactions drive each subsystem to spontaneously break discrete time translation symmetry, resulting in the formation of a complex discrete time crystal evolving with a period different than the driving period. Since the bottom cloud serves as the effective periodic driving for the upper cloud, this leads to a cascade of spontaneous symmetry breaking. With increasing intra-species interactions, we first observe a pronounced effect of spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking in the upper cloud, followed by a similar effect in the lower atomic cloud.</description>
