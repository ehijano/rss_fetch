      <title>Tumorigenesis as a trauma response: the fragmentation of morphogenetic memory drives neoplastic dissociation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mitigation of stress is a key challenge for all biological systems. Conditions of unresolvable stress have been associated with a diverse array of pathologies, from cancer to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, I unify insights from evolutionary and developmental biology with trauma psychology to present a novel framework for tumorigenesis which synthesizes stress-perception, tissue dysfunction, and the hallmarks of neoplastic growth. This view carries therapeutic implications, suggesting a reintegrative approach that seeks to return cancer cells to the homeostatic control of the surrounding tissue.</description>

      <title>Modelling bulk mechanical effects in a planar cellular monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a three-dimensional formulation of the cell vertex model to describe the mechanical properties of a confluent planar monolayer of prismatic cells. Treating cell height as a degree of freedom, we reduce the model to a two-dimensional form. We show how bulk effects, associated with cell volume and total surface area, lead to coupling between energy variations arising from changes in cell apical area and apical perimeter, a feature missing from standard implementations of the two-dimensional vertex model. The model identifies five independent mechanisms by which cells can lose in-plane rigidity, relating to variations in total cell surface area, the strength of lateral adhesion, and constrictive forces at the apical cortex. The model distinguishes bulk from in-plane stresses, and identifies two primary measures of cell shear stress. In the rigid regime, the model shows how lateral crowding in a disordered isolated monolayer can lead to cell elongation towards the monolayer centre. We examine loss of in-plane rigidity in a disordered monolayer and connect isolated patches of stiffness that persist during the rigidity transition to the spectrum of a Laplacian matrix. This approach enables bulk mechanical effects in an epithelium to be captured within a two-dimensional framework.</description>
