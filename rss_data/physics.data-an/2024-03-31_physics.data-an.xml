      <title>Revisiting Taylor and the Trinity Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The atomic bomb uses fission of heavy elements to produce a large amount of energy. It was designed and deployed during World War II by the United States military. The first test of an atomic bomb occurred in July of 1945 in New Mexico and was given the name Trinity; this test was not declassified until 1949. In that year Geoffrey Ingram Taylor released two papers, detailing his process in calculating the energy yield of the atomic bomb from pictures of the Trinity explosion alone. Many scientists made similar calculations concurrently, though Taylor is often accredited with them. Since then many scientists have also attempted a to calculate a yield through various methods. This paper walks through these methods with a focus on Taylor's method -- based on first principles -- as well as redoing the calculations that he performed with modern tools. In this paper we make use of the state-of-the-art computer vision tools to find a more precise measurement of the blast radius, as well as using curve fitting and numerical integration methods. With more precise measurements we are able to follow in Taylor's footstep towards a more accurate approximation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Local Structures In Critical Supercooled Water Through Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of a second critical point in water has been a topic of intense investigation for the last few decades. The molecular origins underlying this phenomenon are typically rationalized in terms of the competition between local high-density (HD) and low-density (LD) structures. Their identification often require designing parameters that are subject to human intervention. Herein, we use unsupervised learning to discover structures in atomistic simulations of water close to the Liquid-Liquid Critical point (LLCP). Encoding the information of the environment using local descriptors, we do not find evidence for two distinct thermodynamic structures. In contrast, when we deploy non-local descriptors that probe instead heterogeneities on the nanometer length scale, this leads to the emergence of LD and HD domains rationalizing the microscopic origins of the density fluctuations close to criticality.</description>
