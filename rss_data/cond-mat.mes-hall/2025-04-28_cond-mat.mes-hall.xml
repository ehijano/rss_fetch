      <title>Anisotropic spin-blockade leakage current in a Ge hole double quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group IV quantum dot hole spin systems, exhibiting strong spin-orbit coupling, provide platforms for various qubit architectures. The rapid advancement of solid-state technologies has significantly improved qubit quality, including the time scales characterizing electrical operation, relaxation, and dephasing. At this stage of development, understanding the relations between the underlying spin-orbit coupling and experimental parameters, such as quantum dot geometry and external electric and magnetic fields, has become a priority. Here we focus on a Ge hole double quantum dot in the Pauli spin blockade regime and present a complete analysis of the leakage current under an out-of-plane magnetic field. By considering a model of anisotropic in-plane confinement and $k^3$-Rashba spin-orbit coupling, we determine the behaviour of the leakage current as a function of detuning, magnetic field magnitude, interdot distance, and individual dot ellipticities. We identify regions in which the leakage current can be suppressed by quantum dot geometry designs. Most importantly, by rotating one of the quantum dots, we observe that the quantum dot shape induces a strongly anisotropic leakage current. These findings provide guidelines for probing the spin-orbit coupling, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio, and improving the precision of Pauli spin blockade readout in hole qubit architectures.</description>

      <title>Spin wave propagation in a ring-shaped magnonic waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate frequency-selective spin wave (SW) transmission in a micrometre-scale, ring-shaped magnonic resonator integrated with a linear Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) stripe. Using super-Nyquist-sampling magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy (SNS-MOKE) and micro-focused Brillouin light scattering ({\mu}-BLS), we probe SW dynamics in the dipolar regime under in-plane magnetisation. Spatially resolved measurements reveal a sharp transmission peak at 3.92 GHz for an external field of 74 mT, demonstrating strong frequency selectivity.
  Our results show that this selectivity arises from scattering and interference between multiple SW modes within the ring. These modes are governed by the anisotropic dispersion relation, transverse mode quantisation due to geometric confinement, and inhomogeneities of the effective magnetic field. In addition, the anisotropy enforces fixed group velocity directions, leading to caustic-like propagation that limits efficient out-coupling. Fourier analysis reveals discrete wavevector components consistent with quantised transverse eigenmodes. Additional {\mu}-BLS measurements at 70 mT show a shift of the transmission peak, confirming that the filtering characteristics are tunable by external parameters.</description>

      <title>Correlated insulating states in slow Dirac fermions on a honeycomb moir{\'e} superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong Coulomb repulsion is predicted to open a many-body charge gap at the Dirac point of graphene, transforming the semimetal into a Mott insulator. However, this correlated insulating phase has remained inaccessible in pristine graphene, where a large Fermi velocity dominates the interaction effects. To overcome this limitation, we realize a honeycomb moir{\'e} superlattice in a twisted MoSe$_2$ homobilayer, where a graphene-like band structure forms with a Fermi velocity reduced by nearly two orders of magnitude. These slow moir{\'e} bands are folded from the valence band maximum at the $\Gamma$ valley of the extended Brillouin zone with negligible spin-orbital coupling, and can therefore simulate massless Dirac fermions in the strongly correlated regime with full SU(2) symmetry. By correlating Rydberg exciton sensing with moir{\'e} trions of different spatial characters, we detect a Mott gap at the Dirac point that persists up to 110 K. We further identify correlated insulating states at $\nu=-1$ with a weak ferromagnetic coupling as well as at several fractional fillings. Our results highlight the potential of studying a wide range of quantum many-body phenomena in twisted two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Single Organic Radicals with Sub-Molecular Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in the magnetism of organic compounds is growing because of new organic magnets, spin-based electronics and the diverse properties of magnetic edge states in graphene nanoribbons. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy combined with the scanning tunneling microscopy has recently been developed as a powerful tool to address individual magnetic atoms and molecules at the atomic scale. Here we demonstrate electron spin resonance and magnetic resonance imaging of all-organic radical anions adsorbed on a protective thin insulating film grown on a metal support. We show that using the highly localized exchange field of the magnetic tip apex allows visualization of the delocalized spin density with sub-molecular resolution, enabling spin-density tomography that can distinguish similar molecular species. These results provide new opportunities for visualizing spin density and magnetic interactions at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Observation of gauge field induced non-Hermitian helical spin skin effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic gauge fields and non-Hermitian skin effects are pivotal to topological phases and non-Hermitian physics, each recently attracting great interest across diverse research fields. Notably, realizing skin effects typically require nonreciprocal couplings or on-site gain and loss. Here, we theoretically and experimentally report that, under gauge fields, non-Hermitian systems with reciprocal couplings and without gain and loss, can nontrivially give rise to an unprecedented nonreciprocal skin effect, featuring helical spin-dependent skin accumulations, dubbed as the ``helical spin skin effect". Specifically, we construct a lattice model with reciprocal dissipative couplings and gauge fields, implemented in circuit metamaterials. Before introducing the gauge fields, this model exhibits localized spin edge modes and extended bulk modes, without skin effects. As the gauge field strength is applied from $0$ to $\pi$, we observe the emergence of two distinct spin skin effects and their transitions: the hybrid-order and second-order helical spin skin effects. Furthermore, we show that these effects can be harnessed to realize helical spin-dependent nonreciprocal transmissions. Our findings not only highlight gauge field induced and enriched non-Hermitian topology, but also brings spin-dependent helicity into skin effects and nonreciprocality.</description>

      <title>Electric-field independent spin-orbit coupling gap in hBN-encapsulated bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in bilayer graphene (BLG) is essential for encoding spin qubits while bringing technical challenges for extracting the opened small SOC gap {\Delta}_SO in experiments. Moreover, in addition to the intrinsic Kane-Mele term, extrinsic mechanisms also contribute to SOC in BLG, especially under experimental conditions including encapsulation of BLG with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and applying an external out-of-plane electric displacement field D. Although measurements of {\Delta}_SO in hBN-encapsulated BLG have been reported, the relatively large experimental variations and existing experimental controversy make it difficult to fully understand the physical origin of {\Delta}_SO. Here, we report a combined experimental and theoretical study on {\Delta}_SO in hBN-encapsulated BLG. We use an averaging method to extract {\Delta}_SO in gate-defined single quantum dot devices. Under D fields as large as 0.57-0.90 V/nm, {\Delta}_SO=53.4-61.8 {\mu}eV is obtained from two devices. Benchmarked with values reported at lower D field regime, our results support a D field-independent {\Delta}_SO. This behavior is confirmed by our first-principle calculations, based on which {\Delta}_SO is found to be independent of D field, regardless of different hBN/BLG/hBN stacking configurations. Our calculations also suggest a weak proximity effect from hBN, indicating that SOC in hBN-encapsulated BLG is dominated by the intrinsic Kane-Mele mechanism. Our results offer insightful understandings of SOC in BLG, which benefit SOC engineering and spin manipulations in BLG.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Backgate Tunability on Interfacial Carrier Concentration in Ionic Liquid-Gated MoS2 Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The periodic spatial modulation potential arising from the zig-zag distribution of ions at large gate voltage in an ionic liquid gated device may enable functionalities in a similar way as nanopatterning and moir\'e engineering. However, the inherent coupling between periodic modulation potential and carrier concentration in ionic liquid devices has hindered further exploration. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of decoupling manipulation on periodic modulation potential and carrier density in an ionic liquid device by using a conventional backgate. The backgate is found to have a tunability on carrier concentration comparable to that of ionic gating, especially at large ionic liquid gate voltage, by activating the bulk channels mediated back tunneling between the trapped bands and interfacial channel.</description>

      <title>Graphene Enhanced Resonant Raman Spectroscopy of Gallium Nitride Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering of lattice excitations (phonons) with the photoexcited charge carriers is of a major concern in optoelectronic devices. Here, the resonant Raman scattering will be utilized to study an exciton-phonon interaction in GaN nanocrystals, further enhanced by the underlying graphene. Raman spectroscopy using various excitation energies shows how the exciton-phonon interaction behaves, unveiling the scattering strength. The origin of the interaction is in the condition of resonance, which is directly observed in the temperature resolved spectra. Most importantly, the underlying graphene strongly enhances the coupling of phonons and excitons. Consequently, an enhanced resonant Raman spectrum of GaN nanocrystals possessing clearly observable phonon overtones up to the 4th order has been obtained. It has been demonstrated that the responsible effect is the electron transfer between nanocrystals and the underlying graphene. The utilization of such an increased coupling effect can be beneficial for a study of the charge carrier scattering in semiconducting nanomaterials, analysis of their crystal quality, improvement of sensor sensitivity and in the subsequent development of new-generation optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Acoustic phonons, spin-phonon coupling and spin relaxation via the lattice reorientation mechanism in hexagonal germanium nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin relaxation via electron-phonon interaction is an important decoherence mechanism for spin qubits. In this work, we study spin relaxation in hexagonal (2H) germanium, a novel direct-gap semiconductor showing great potential to combine highly coherent spin qubits with optical functionality. Focusing on electrostatically defined quantum dots in hexagonal germanium nanowires, we (i) identify geometries where spin qubit experiments are feasible, (ii) compute the nanowire phonon modes, and (iii) describe spin relaxation of hole spin qubits due to phonon-induced lattice reorientation, a direct spin-phonon coupling mechanism that is absent in cubic semiconductors typically used for spin qubits (GaAs, cubic Si, cubic Ge). We obtain the spin relaxation time as a function of nanowire cross section, quantum dot confinement length, and magnetic field. For realistic parameters, we find relaxation times above 10 ms, and reveal that the magnetic field direction maximizing the relaxation time depends on the qubit Larmor frequency. Our results facilitate the design of nanowire quantum dot experiments with long qubit relaxation times.</description>

      <title>Dressed basis sets for the modeling of exchange interactions in double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the microscopic modeling of exchange interactions between double semiconductor quantum dots used as spin qubits. Starting from a reference full configuration interaction (CI) calculation for the two-particle wave functions, we build a reduced basis set of dressed states that can describe the ground-state singlets and triplets over the whole operational range with as few as one hundred basis functions (as compared to a few thousands for the full CI). This enables fast explorations of the exchange interactions landscape as well as efficient time-dependent simulations. We apply this methodology to a double hole quantum dot in germanium, and discuss the physics of exchange interactions in this system. We show that the net exchange splitting results from a complex interplay between inter-dot tunneling, Coulomb exchange and correlations. We analyze, moreover, the effects of confinement, strains and Rashba interactions on the anisotropic exchange and singlet-triplet mixings at finite magnetic field. We finally illustrate the relevance of this methodology for time-dependent calculations on a singlet-triplet qubit.</description>

      <title>The impact of electrical contacts on the optical properties of a MoS$_{2}$ monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving high performance in transition-metal-dichalcogenide-based optoelectronic devices is challenging -- the realization of an efficient electrical contacting scheme should not be obtained at the expense of their optical quality. Here we present the optical properties of MoS$_{2}$ monolayers which have been electrically contacted with bismuth and gold. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the samples contacted with both materials is significantly broadened. In the case of the bismuth contacted sample we note an additional, low energy band in the PL spectrum, attributed to a defect state formed during the evaporation of Bi. Comparing the intensity of the excitonic peak and of the defect-related peak, we note that there is a correlation between the type of contacts and the optical properties.</description>

      <title>Higher-order topological corner states and edge states in grid-like frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuum grid-like frames composed of rigidly jointed beams, wherein bending is the predominant deformation mode, are classic subjects of study in the field of structural mechanics. However, their topological dynamical properties have only recently been revealed. As the structural complexity of the frame increases along with the number of beam members arranged in the two-dimensional plane, the vibration modes also increase significantly in number, with frequency ranges of topological states and bulk states overlapped, leading to hybrid mode shapes. Therefore, concise theoretical results are necessary to guide the identification of topological modes in such planar continuum systems with complex spectra. In this work, within an infinitely long frequency spectrum, we obtain analytical expressions for the frequencies of higher-order topological corner states, edge states, and bulk states in kagome frames and square frames, as well as the criteria of existence of these topological states and patterns of their distribution in the spectrum. Additionally, we present the frequency expressions and the existence criterion for topological edge states in quasi-one-dimensional structures such as bridge-like frames, along with an approach to determine the existence of topological edge states based on bulk topological invariants. These theoretical results fully demonstrate that the grid-like frames, despite being a large class of continuum systems with complex spectra, have topological states (including higher-order topological states) that can be accurately characterized through concise analytical expressions. This work contributes to an excellent platform for the study of topological mechanics, and the accurate and concise theoretical results facilitate direct applications of topological grid-like frame structures in industry and engineering.</description>

      <title>The structural effects of (111) growth of La$_2$CoMnO$_6$ on SrTiO$_3$ and LSAT -- new insights from 3D crystallographic characterisation with 4D-STEM and Digital Dark Field imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 3-dimensional orientation of La atom modulations has been mapped in two thin films of La$_2$CoMnO$_6$ grown on SrTiO$_3$ and LSAT ([La,Sr,Al,Ta] oxide) using a 4D-scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) method based on the recently developed Digital Dark Field method. This images the shifts of diffraction spots and the azimuthal intensity distribution in the First Order Laue Zone, and then uses them to reconstruct and map the 3D crystallography. This clearly shows a flip from out-of-plane modulation with tensile strain on SrTiO3 to in-plane modulation with compressive strain on LSAT. This hitherto unobserved crystallographic change had a significant influence on the out-of-plane lattice parameter which left more room for the full incorporation of the larger CoO6 octahedra on LSAT and therefore explained the improved Mn-Co ordering and better properties for this film. Moreover, the method would be applicable to many other systems of epitaxial growth of complex oxides, revealing crystallographic details of crucial importance to properties which are not visible in conventional atomic resolution imaging.</description>

Their development is crucial for both energy-efficient optical interconnects and photonic quantum technologies, but neither rigorous theoretical frameworks nor systematic experimental methods governing deterministic emitters and their identification were so far available. A central -- and seemingly obvious -- assumption underpinning previous works is that the radiative emission probability is proportional to the internal quantum efficiency. Here, we introduce a stochastic model of the decay dynamics in quantum emitters that disproves this assumption and provides a systematic framework for the development of deterministic quantum light sources. Our model agrees with a wide range of experimental findings, including time-resolved spectroscopy, autocorrelation measurements, and saturation spectroscopy, and it also explains a number of hitherto unexplained experiments. For example, our model shows that above-band continuous-wave excitation selects the exciton transitions with the lowest quantum efficiency, which is of direct importance for photonic quantum technologies relying on aligning nanostructures to emitters. We show that the underlying physics is governed by incoherent trapping of the population in metastable states, which has profound consequences for the physics of quantum emitters. Finally, we provide a straightforward experimental protocol for obtaining deterministic emitters.</description>

      <title>Topological phases of coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18228v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase diagrams of arbitrary number $N_{\text{w}}$ of diagonally and perpendicularly coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires have been identified. The diagonally coupled wires have rich topological phase diagrams exhibiting insulating phases with winding numbers $0\leq w \leq N_{\text{w}}$ and topological critical lines restricted by the reflection mirror symmetry. Even number of perpendicularly coupled wires exhibit either gapless or trivial topological phases. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires additionally exhibit nontrivial topological phases with winding number $w=1$. Due to the mirror reflection symmetry, their gapless regions can be topologically nontrivial. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires reveal coherent confined correlations in the odd indexed wires away from the gapless regions.</description>

      <title>Valley Polarization and Anomalous Valley Hall Effect in Altermagnet Ti2Se2S with Multipiezo Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, altermagnets demonstrate numerous newfangle physical phenomena due to their inherent antiferromagnetic coupling and spontaneous spin splitting, that are anticipated to enable innovative spintronic devices. However, the rare two-dimensional altermagnets have been reported, making it difficult to meet the requirements for high-performance spintronic devices on account of the growth big data. Here, we predict a stable monolayer Ti2Se2S with out-of-plane altermagnetic ground state and giant valley splitting. The electronic properties of altermagnet Ti2Se2S are highly dependent on the onsite electron correlation. Through symmetry analysis, we find that the valleys of X and Y points are protected by the mirror Mxy symmetry rather than the time-reversal symmetry. Therefore, the multipiezo effect, including piezovalley and piezomagnetism, can be induced by the uniaxial strain. The total valley splitting of monolayer Ti2Se2S can be as high as ~500 meV. Most interestingly, the direction of valley polarization can be effectively tuned by the uniaxial strain, based on this, we have defined logical "0", "+1", and "-1" states for data transmission and storage. In addition, we have designed a schematic diagram for observing the anomalous Hall effect in experimentally. Our findings have enriched the candidate materials of two-dimensional altermagnet for the ultra-fast and low power consumption device applications.</description>

      <title>Coupled-wire Construction of a Non-crystalline Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect, a paradigmatic topologically ordered state, has been realised in two-dimensional strongly correlated quantum gases and Chern bands of crystals. Here we construct a non-crystalline analogue by coupling quantum wires that are not periodically placed in real-space. Remarkably, the model remains solvable using bosonisation techniques. Due to the non-uniform couplings between the wires, the ground state has different degeneracy compared to the crystalline case. It displays a rich phenomenology of excitations, which can either behave like anyons confined to move in one dimension (lineons), anyons confined to hop between two wires (s-lineons), and anyonic excitations that are free to travel across the system. Both the ground state degeneracy and mutual statistics are directly determined by the real-space positions of the wires. By providing an analytically solvable model of a non-crystalline fractional quantum Hall effect, our work showcases that topological order can display richer phenomenology beyond crystals. More broadly, the non-uniform wire construction we develop can serve as a tool to explore richer many-body phenomenology in non-crystalline systems.</description>

      <title>How to accurately measure the mobility and viscosity of two-dimensional carriers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two different methods of \emph{metrological} accuracy are proposed to determine the mobility and viscosity of ultra clean two-dimensional electron liquids. The experimental data analysis is based on the Gurzhi hydrodynamic model under no-slip boundary conditions without preliminary assumptions about carrier scattering times. The applicability of no-slip boundary conditions has been proven. A Hall bar with several conducting channels of different widths in a zero magnetic field and a sample with a single channel in a perpendicular field are considered. In both cases, it was possible to accurately isolate the ohmic part of the total measured resistance and, then find the exact mobility and viscosity of the charge liquid. The extracted e-e scattering time is extremely close to that obtained by other experimental group for transport measurements of superballistic point contact. At low temperatures the e-e scattering time demonstrates a stronger dependence compare to $1/T^{2}$ behavior predicted by Fermi liquid theory. We propose both methods as powerful tools for viscometry and finding the mobility of two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a magnetic domain wall in the ferromagnetic phase in chiral magnets in two dimensions with an in-plane easy-axis anisotropy and an out-of-plane Zeeman magnetic field, and find a chiral soliton lattice (spiral) phase beside a ferromagnetic phase inside the domain line, where the former represents a domain-wall skyrmion crystal from the bulk point of view. We first determine the phase diagram on the domain wall by numerically constructing domain-wall solutions. We then analytically reproduce the phase diagram in a domain-wall theory (a chiral double sine-Gordon model) that we construct within the moduli approximation by treating the Zeeman magnetic field perturbatively. While we find good agreements between the phase diagrams of the numerical and effective theory methods, the numerical solution exhibits a decomposition of the topological charge into a bimeron which cannot be captured by the effective theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators with propagating topological edge states are promising for dissipationless transport, while their one-dimensional analogs are capable of hosting localized topological junction states that are mainly envisaged for quantum computing and spintronics. Here, in contrast, we propose to use the localized nature of topological junction states for sensing applications. We report a systematic topological classification of a wide class of graphene nanoribbons represented by already synthesized extended chevron species. Using this classification, we theoretically model a double junction transport that shows an enhanced interaction with the NO$_2$ molecule. Our results show that topological junction states of nanoribbons can open an avenue for topological sensing and junction-assisted chemistry applications.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Fluctuations and Charge Fractionalization in Quantum Wires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum information method for measuring fractional charges in ballistic quantum wires generalizing bipartite fluctuations to the chiral quasiparticles in Luttinger liquids. This is equivalent to add charge and current fluctuations in a region of the wire. This reveals from an equilibrium approach the entangled nature of the two counter-propagating fractional charges associated to the same electron in the system. Bipartite fluctuations at equilibrium are characterized through a logarithmic scaling with distance encoding the entangled nature of these fractional charges in one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This approach also clarifies the physical meaning of the dephasing factor of electronic interferences in a ring geometry at zero temperature from a space-time correspondence in 1D. We formulate an analogy towards ground-state energetics. We show how bipartite current fluctuations represent a useful tool to locate quantum phase transitions associated to Mott physics. We address a spin chain equivalence and verify the fractional charges through an algorithm such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group. Adding a potential difference between the two sides (parties) of the wire, also we show how bipartite fluctuations can detect the presence of a bound state localized at the interface through the Jackiw-Rebbi model coexisting with fractional charges.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the creation of negatively charged boron vacancies in He-ion irradiated hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) hosts luminescent defects possessing spin qualities compatible with quantum sensing protocols at room temperature. Vacancies, in particular, are readily obtained via exposure to high-energy ion beams. While the defect creation mechanism via such irradiation is well understood, the occurrence rate of optically active negatively charged vacancies ($V_B^-$) is an open question. In this work, we exploit focused helium ions to systematically generate optically active vacancy defects in hBN flakes at varying density. By comparing the density-dependent spin splitting measured by magnetic resonance to calculations based on a microscopic charge model, in which we introduce a correction term due to a constant background charge, we are able to quantify the number of $V_B^-$ defects generated by the ion irradiation. We find a lower bound for the fraction (0.2%) of all vacancies in the optically active, negatively charged state. Our results provide a protocol for measuring the generation efficiency of $V_B^-$, which is necessary for understanding and optimizing luminescent centers in hBN.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors induced by magnetic field. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. Experiments find that the thermal Hall angle is maximal at the temperature at which the longitudinal thermal conductivity peaks. At this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions (which do not produce entropy) dominate Umklapp and boundary scattering events (which do). In the presence of a magnetic field, Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a geometric [Berry] phase. Its origin is the difference in the spatial distributions of the positive charge of the nuclei and the negative charge of the electron cloud. The magnetic flux is negligible for the point-like nuclei, but not for the electron cloud. Therefore, the molecular wave-function becomes a complex number in the presence of the magnetic field. In a crystal, this implies a complex amplitude for transverse acoustic phonons, modifying three-phonon interference patterns, and twisting the quasi-momentum of the outgoing phonon. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest displacement amplitude, $u_m$, of transverse acoustic phonons at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</description>

Abstract: We report on a study of the interplay between the supercurrent and spin-polarization in a two-dimensional superconducting system in the presence of a d-wave symmetric antiferromagnetic exchange interaction (altermagnetism). It is demonstrated that the supercurrent exhibits a transverse contribution in the presence of both constant and momentum-dependent exchange interactions. We also discuss the analog of the Edelstein effect for such magnetic material, showing that the induced spin polarization is quadratic in the supercurrent and d-wave symmetric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how the supercurrent flow pattern is altered by inhomogeneities in superconducting films. Working in the vicinity of the critical temperature and assuming a model of short-range disorder in the quadratic term of the Ginzburg-Landau functional, we develop a perturbation theory in the inhomogeneity strength. Absorbing the ultraviolet divergences into the renormalization of the critical temperature, we arrive at a well-defined theory governed by large-scale physics. In the presence of inhomogeneities, the correlation functions of the order parameter and supercurrent exhibit a long-range power-law behavior, which can be attributed to the mixing of the amplitude and phase modes. The fluctuation magnitude grows with increasing the average current, and the system becomes strongly inhomogeneous near the critical current. An inhomogeneous superflow will generate a random magnetic field, whose magnitude in thin NbN films can be comparable to Earth's magnetic field. We discuss the feasibility of detecting it using the SQUID-on-tip technique.</description>

      <title>Integrative Learning of Quantum Dot Intensity Fluctuations under Excitation via Tailored Dynamic Mixture Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor nano-crystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), have attracted significant attention for their unique fluorescence properties. Under continuous excitation, QDs emit photons with intricate intensity fluctuation: the intensity of photon emission fluctuates during the excitation, and such a fluctuation pattern can vary across different QDs even under the same experimental conditions. What adding to the complication is that the processed intensity series are non-Gaussian and truncated due to necessary thresholding and normalization. Conventional normality-based single-dot analysis fall short of addressing these complexities. In collaboration with chemists, we develop an integrative learning approach to simultaneously analyzing intensity series from multiple QDs. Motivated by the unique data structure and the hypothesized behaviors of the QDs, our approach leverages the celebrated hidden Markov model as its structural backbone to characterize individual dot intensity fluctuations, while assuming that, in each state the normalized intensity follows a 0/1 inflated Beta distribution, the state/emission distributions are shared across the QDs, and the state transition dynamics can vary among a few QD clusters. This framework allows for a precise, collective characterization of intensity fluctuation patterns and have the potential to transform current practice in chemistry. Applying our method to experimental data from 128 QDs, we reveal three shared intensity states and capture several distinct intensity transition patterns, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach in providing deeper insights into QD behaviors and their design and application potential.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamic Theory of Proximity Ferroelectricity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05219v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proximity ferroelectricity has recently been reported as a new design paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar material becomes a ferroelectric by interfacing with a thin ferroelectric layer. Strongly polar materials, such as AlN and ZnO, which were previously unswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown fields, can now be switched with practical coercive fields when they are in intimate proximity to a switchable ferroelectric. Here, we develop a general Landau-Ginzburg theory of proximity ferroelectricity in multilayers of non-ferroelectrics and ferroelectrics to analyze their switchability and coercive fields. The theory predicts regimes of both "proximity switching" where the multilayers collectively switch, as well as "proximity suppression" where they collectively do not switch. The mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity is an internal electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness in a self-consistent manner that renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier. Further reduction in the coercive field emerges from charged defects in the bulk that act as nucleation centers. The application of the theory to proximity ferroelectricity in Alx-1ScxN/AlN and Zn1-xMgxO/ZnO bilayers is demonstrated. The theory further predicts that multilayers of dielectric/ferroelectric and paraelectric/ferroelectric layers can potentially result in induced ferroelectricity in the dielectric or paraelectric layers, resulting in the entire stack being switched, an exciting avenue for new discoveries. This thawing of "frozen ferroelectrics", paraelectrics and potentially dielectrics, promises a large class of new ferroelectrics with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable domain-patterned optoelectronic and memory technologies.</description>

Abstract: We numerically investigate the behavior of a Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier assuming a current-phase relation with a second--harmonic contribution. We find that varying the weight of harmonic terms in the Josephson current affects the gain profile. The analysis of gain characteristics, phase-space portraits, Poincar\'e sections, and Fourier spectra demonstrates that the nonsinusoidal contribution influences the operating mode and stability of the device. In particular, we identify the optimal weighting of harmonic contributions that maximizes amplification, achieving gains up to $\sim 13\;\text{dB}$ in a device without dispersion engineering.</description>

      <title>Reversible magneto ionics in crystallized W Co20Fe60B20 MgO HfO2 ultra-thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy</title>

Abstract: We have investigated electric field (E-field) induced modulation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in both amorphous and crystalline W/CoFeB/MgO/HfO2 ultra-thin films. We find that in the amorphous state, the E-field effect is volatile and reversible, which is consistent with the conventional electrostatic effect through charge accumulation and depletion. In the crystallized system annealed at 370{\deg}C, we find that two effects are at play, a non-volatile and reversible voltage-induced effect on PMA and an electrostatic response. We discuss these results in terms of higher oxygen mobility at the crystallized CoFeB-MgO interface, which induces a non-volatile magnetoionic response. Modulating PMA in crystallized CoFeB-MgO materials through ionic migration opens the path to integrating magneto-ionics in full magnetic tunnel junctions.</description>

      <title>In-plane Ising superconductivity revealed by exchange interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19599</link>

Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing states and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We observed an unusual in-plane Ising like uniaxial anisotropy in the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic. This anisotropy is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. The interactions between the uniaxial spin texture and the magnetic overlayer offer new ways to explore the interplay between magnetism and 2D superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Ultrashort Orbital Transport in Heavy Metals Revealed by Terahertz Emission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum of electrons offers a promising, yet largely unexplored, degree of freedom for ultrafast, energy-efficient information processing. As the foundation of orbitronics, understanding how orbital currents propagate and convert into charge currents is essential - but remains elusive due to the challenge in disentangling orbital and spin dynamics in ultrathin films. Although orbital currents have been predicted to propagate over long distances in materials, recent theoretical studies argue that lattice symmetry may constrain their mean free paths (MFPs) to the scale of a single atomic layer. In this work, we provide the first direct experimental evidence for ultrashort orbital MFPs in heavy metals (HMs) - W, Ta, Pt - revealed by femtosecond terahertz emission spectroscopy. This is enabled by sub-nanometer-precision control of thin-film thickness using wedge-shaped HM|Ni heterostructures. By employing a multi-component terahertz-emission model, we quantitatively extract the orbital MFPs, consistently finding them shorter than their spin counterparts. Furthermore, control experiments rule out interfacial orbital-to-charge conversion as the dominant mechanism, confirming that the process is governed by the bulk inverse orbital Hall effect. Our findings resolve a central controversy in orbitronics and provide key insights into orbital transport and conversion mechanisms.</description>
