      <title>Analyzing Students Critical Thinking as a Basis for Developing Interactive Physics Multimedia with Generative Learning and Cognitive Conflict Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of abstract concepts in physics education and the low level of students critical thinking skills demand innovative instructional strategies aligned with 21st century competencies. This study aims to analyze students critical thinking skills as the foundation for developing physics interactive multimedia using a generative learning model integrated with a cognitive conflict strategy. The research was conducted in three public high schools in Lima Puluh Kota Regency using a quantitative descriptive survey method, involving 125 eleventh-grade students. Data were collected using five validated instruments: teacher questionnaires on instructional practices and critical thinking, student learning style and attitude surveys, a multimedia needs assessment, and a critical thinking skills test. Results show that current instruction relies heavily on static and non-interactive media such as PowerPoint and videos, failing to support students varied learning styles especially the dominant visual preference (53.06). While students exhibit moderately positive attitudes toward physics learning (65.69), their critical thinking skills are critically low (average score 27.80), particularly in inference (24.00) and evaluation (28.00) indicators. These findings underscore the urgent need to develop visual and interactive multimedia that facilitates cognitive conflict and deeper reflection. The novelty of this study lies in linking multimedia design with cognitive strategies tailored to enhance critical thinking in physics. The study contributes to physics education by offering empirical evidence for the pedagogical integration of generative learning and cognitive conflict approaches in digital environments, paving the way for targeted multimedia interventions that promote critical reasoning in conceptually demanding physics topics.</description>

      <title>Subatomic Heroes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sharing the amazing achievements of the (particle) physics world with the general public is at the heart of the mission of the Subatomic Heroes, based at the University of Siegen, Germany. Originally this started out as an endeavor of theoretical particle physics, now we are steadily spreading out to cover and include more branches of physics and science. Our activities range from merging art with public physics lectures via marvelous artistic performances at the local theater, over dedicated events for high-school students, to our Subatomic Heroes channel on Instagram and TikTok where you may also find out when and where our famous "hadronic ice-cream" will be served next! So follow us on https://www.instagram.com/subatomic_heroes and https://www.tiktok.com/@subatomic_heroes.</description>

      <title>Navigating Through Turbulence: Blueprint for the Next Generation of Weather-Climate Scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of weather and climate science is at a pivotal moment, defined by the dual forces of unprecedented technological advancement. While a shifting research and employment landscape has created career uncertainty, leading to a significant migration of talent toward the private sector, it has simultaneously spurred an expansion of the ecosystem through the emergence of new computational tools and the growing role of industry innovators and stakeholders. This perspective paper argues that this new, expanded ecosystem presents extraordinary opportunities for students and early-career professionals. We outline the emerging scientific frontiers powered by high-resolution simulations and artificial intelligence, suggest a practical path for navigating a more fluid career landscape, and propose how education and training must evolve to equip the next generation for success.</description>
