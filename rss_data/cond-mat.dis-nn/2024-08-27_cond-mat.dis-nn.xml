      <title>Stochastic quantum models for the dynamics of power grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While electric power grids play a key role in the decarbonization of society, it remains unclear how recent trends, such as the strong integration of renewable energies, can affect their stability. Power oscillation modes, which are key to the stability of the grid, are traditionally studied numerically with the conventional view-point of two regimes of extended (inter-area) or localized (intra-area) modes. In this article we introduce an analogy based on stochastic quantum models and demonstrate its applicability to power systems. We show from simple models that at low frequency the mean free path induced by disorder is inversely cubic in the frequency. This stems from the Courant-Fisher-Weyl theorem, which predicts a strong protection of the lowest frequency modes from disorder. As a consequence a power oscillation, induced by some local disruption of the grid, can propagate in a ballistic, diffusive or localised regime. In contrast with the conventional view-point, the existence of these three regimes is confirmed in a realistic model of the European power grid.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of Levy Rosenzweig-Porter model via supersymmetric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using the Efetov's super-symmetric formalism we computed analytically the mean spectral density $\rho(E)$ for the L\'evy and the L\'evy -Rosenzweig-Porter random matrices which off-diagonal elements are strongly non-Gaussian with power-law tails. This makes the standard Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation inapplicable to such problems. We used, instead, the functional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation which allowed to solve the problem analytically for large sizes of matrices. We show that $\rho(E)$ depends crucially on the control parameter that drives the system through the transition between the ergodic and the fractal phases and it can be used as an order parameter.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of Parisi's replica symmetry breaking and overlaps in random energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random energy model (REM) is the simplest spin glass model which exhibits replica symmetry breaking. It is well known since the 80's that its overlaps are non-selfaveraging and that their statistics satisfy the predictions of the replica theory. All these statistical properties can be understood by considering that the low energy levels are the points generated by a Poisson process with an exponential density. Here we first show how, by replacing the exponential density by a sum of two exponentials, the overlaps statistics are modified. One way to reconcile these results with the replica theory is to allow the blocks in the Parisi matrix to fluctuate. Other examples where the sizes of these blocks should fluctuate include the finite size corrections of the REM, the case of discrete energies and the overlaps between two temperatures. In all these cases, the blocks sizes not only fluctuate but need to take complex values if one wishes to reproduce the results of our replica-free calculations.</description>

      <title>Resolving the pressure induced 'self-insertion' in skutterudite CoSb3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CoSb3, a skutterudite compound, is key in studying thermoelectric materials. Under compression, it undergoes a 'self-insertion' isostructural transition, redistributing large Sb atoms among crystallographic sites. We investigated CoSb3's structural stability up to 70 GPa using single crystal X-ray diffraction and high-resolution X-ray scattering, including Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging. We examined the material in three pressure transmitting media (PTMs), exploring how PTMs and nonhydrostatic stresses affect CoSb3. Notably, the 'self-insertion' transition may reduce or even make compressibility negative. Additionally, we report a previously unknown phase transformation from cubic Im-3 to trigonal R-3 above 40 GPa and discuss the phases' distinctive behaviors.</description>

      <title>How transformers learn structured data: insights from hierarchical filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a hierarchical filtering procedure for generative models of sequences on trees, enabling control over the range of positional correlations in the data. Leveraging this controlled setting, we provide evidence that vanilla encoder-only transformer architectures can implement the optimal Belief Propagation algorithm on both root classification and masked language modeling tasks. Correlations at larger distances corresponding to increasing layers of the hierarchy are sequentially included as the network is trained. We analyze how the transformer layers succeed by focusing on attention maps from models trained with varying degrees of filtering. These attention maps show clear evidence for iterative hierarchical reconstruction of correlations, and we can relate these observations to a plausible implementation of the exact inference algorithm for the network sizes considered.</description>

      <title>q-neighbor Ising model on a polarized network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the interplay between the lobby size $q$ in the $q$-neighbor Ising model of opinion formation [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 92}, 052105] and the level of overlap $v$ of two fully connected graphs. Results suggest that for each lobby size $q \ge 3$, a specific level of overlap $v^*$ exists, which destroys initially polarized clusters of opinions. By performing Monte-Carlo simulations, backed by an analytical approach, we show that the dependence of the $v^*$ on the lobby size $q$ is far from trivial in the absence of temperature, showing consecutive maximum and minimum, that additionally depends on the parity of $q$. The temperature is, in general, a destructive factor; its increase leads to the collapse of polarized clusters for smaller values of $v$ and additionally brings a substantial decrease in the level of polarization. However, we show that this behavior is counter-intuitively inverted for specific lobby sizes and temperature ranges.</description>

      <title>Transport properties in non-Fermi liquid phases of nodal-point semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this review, we survey the current progress in computing transport properties in semimetals which harbour non-Fermi liquid phases. We first discuss the widely-used Kubo formalism, which can be applied to the effective theory describing the stable non-Fermi liquid phase obtained via a renormalization group procedure and, hence, is applicable for temperatures close to zero (e.g., optical conductivity). For finite-temperature regimes, which apply to the computations of the generalized DC conductivity tensors, we elucidate the memory matrix approach. This approach is based on an effective hydrodynamic description of the system, and is especially suited for tackling transport calculations in strongly-interacting quantum field theories, because it does not rely on the existence of long-lived quasiparticles. As a concrete example, we apply these two approaches to find the response of the so-called Luttinger-Abrikosov-Benelavskii phase of isotropic three-dimensional Luttinger semimetals, which arises under the effects of long-ranged (unscreened) Coulomb interactions, with the chemical potential fine-tuned to cut exactly the nodal point. In particular, we focus on the electric conductivity tensors, thermal and thermoelectric response, Raman response, free energy, entropy density, and shear viscosity.</description>
