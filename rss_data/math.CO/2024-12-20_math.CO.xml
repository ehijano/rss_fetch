      <title>F\o{}lner, Banach, and translation density are equal and other new results about density in left amenable semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In any semigroup $S$ satisfying the Strong Folner Condition, there are three natural notions of density for a subset $A$ of $S$: Folner density $d(A)$, Banach density $d^*(A)$, and translation density $d_t(A)$. If $S$ is commutative or left cancellative, it is known that these three notions coincide. We shall show that these notions coincide for every semigroup $S$ which satisfies the Strong Folner Condition. Using this fact, we solve a problem that has been open for decades, showing that the set of ultrafilters every member of which has positive Folner density is a two sided ideal of $\beta S$. We also show that, if $S$ is a left amenable semigroup, then the set of ultrafilters every member of which has positive Banach density is a two sided ideal of $\beta S$. We investigate the density properties of subsets of $S$ in the case in which the minimal left ideals of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification $\beta S$ are singletons. This occurs in many familiar examples, including all semilattices and all semigroups which have a right zero. We show that this is equivalent to the statement that $S$ satisfies the Strong Folner Condition and that, for every subset $A$ of $S$, $d(A)\in \{0,1\}$. We also examine the relation between the density properties of two semigroups when one is a quotient of the other. The Folner density of a subset of $S$ is always determined by some Folner net in $S$. We show that an arbitrary Folner net in $S$ determines the density of all of the subsets of $S$. And we prove that, if $S$ and $T$ are left amenable semigroups, then $d^*(A\times B)=d^*(A)d^*(B)$ for every subset $A$ of $S$ and every subset $B$ of $T$.</description>

      <title>Subset Selection Problems in Planar Point Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite set satisfying condition $\mathcal{A}$, the subset selection problem asks, how large of a subset satisfying condition $\mathcal{B}$ can we find? We make progress on three instances of subset selection problems in planar point sets. Let $n,s\in\mathbb{N}$ with $n\geq s$, and let $P\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ be a set of $n$ points, where at most $s$ points lie on the same line.
  Firstly, we select a general position subset of $P$, i.e., a subset containing no $3$ points on the same line. This problem was proposed by Erd\H{o}s under the regime when $s$ is a constant. For $s$ being non-constant, we give new lower and upper bounds on the maximum size of such a subset. In particular, we show that in the worst case such a set can have size at most $O(n/s)$ when $n^{1/3}\leq s\leq n$ and $O(n^{5/6+o(1)}/\sqrt{s})$ when $3\leq s\leq n^{1/3}$.
  Secondly, we select a monotone general position subset of $P$, that is, a subset in general position where the points are ordered from left to right and their $y$-coordinates are either non-decreasing or non-increasing. We present bounds on the maximum size of such a subset. In particular, when $s=\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, our upper and lower bounds differ only by a logarithmic factor.
  Lastly, we select a subset of $P$ with pairwise distinct slopes. This problem was initially studied by Erd\H{o}s, Graham, Ruzsa, and Taylor on the grid. We show that for $s=O(\sqrt{n})$ such a subset of size $\Omega((n/\log{s})^{1/3})$ can always be found in $P$. When $s=\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, this matches a lower bound given by Zhang on the grid. As for the upper bound, we show that in the worst case such a subset has size at most $O(\sqrt{n})$ for $2\leq s\leq n^{3/8}$ and $O((n/s)^{4/5})$ for $n^{3/8}\leq s=O(\sqrt{n})$.
  The proofs use a wide range of tools such as incidence geometry, probabilistic methods, the hypergraph container method, and additive combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Minimum degree conditions for graph rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study minimum degree conditions that guarantee that an $n$-vertex graph is rigid in $\mathbb{R}^d$. For small values of $d$, we obtain a tight bound: for $d = O(\sqrt{n})$, every $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $(n+d)/2 - 1$ is rigid in $\mathbb{R}^d$. For larger values of $d$, we achieve an approximate result: for $d = O(n/{\log^2}{n})$, every $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $(n+2d)/2 - 1$ is rigid in $\mathbb{R}^d$. This bound is tight up to a factor of two in the coefficient of $d$.
  As a byproduct of our proof, we also obtain the following result, which may be of independent interest: for $d = O(n/{\log^2}{n})$, every $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $d$ has pseudoachromatic number at least $d+1$; namely, the vertex set of such a graph can be partitioned into $d+1$ subsets such that there is at least one edge between each pair of subsets. This is tight.</description>

      <title>Coloring of some $(P_2\cup P_4)$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We denote a path on $t$ vertices as $P_t$ and a cycle on $t$ vertices as $C_t$. For two vertex-disjoint graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, the {\em union} $G_1\cup G_2$ is the graph with $V(G_1\cup G_2)=V(G_1)\cup V(G_2)$ and $E(G_1\cup G_2)=E(G_1)\cup E(G_2)$. A {\em diamond} (resp. {\em gem}) is a graph consisting of a $P_3$ (resp. $P_4$) and a new vertex adjacent to all vertices of the $P_3$ (resp. $P_4$), and a {\em butterfly} is a graph consisting of two triangles that share one vertex. In this paper, we show that $\chi(G)\le 3\omega(G)-2$ if $G$ is a ($P_2\cup P_4$, gem)-free graph, $\chi(G)\le \frac{\omega(G)^2+3\omega(G)-2}{2}$ if $G$ is a ($P_2\cup P_4$, butterfly)-free graph. We also study the class of ($P_2\cup P_4$, diamond)-free graphs, and show that, for such a graph $G$, $\chi(G)\leq4$ if $\omega(G)=2$, $\chi(G)\leq7$ if $\omega(G)=3$, $\chi(G)\leq9$ if $\omega(G)=4$, and $\chi(G)\leq2\omega(G)-1$ if $\omega(G)\ge 5$. Moreover, we prove that $G$ is perfect if $G$ is ($P_2\cup P_4$, diamond, $C_5$)-free with $\omega(G)\geq5$.</description>

      <title>Some permutation pentanomials over finite fields of even characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper Zhang et al. constructed 17 families of permutation pentanomials of the form $x^t+x^{r_1(q-1)+t}+x^{r_2(q-1)+t}+x^{r_3(q-1)+t}+x^{r_4(q-1)+t}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ where $q=2^m$. In this paper for 14 of these 17 families we provide a simple explanation as to why they are permutations. We also extend these 14 families into three general classes of permutation pentanomials over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$.</description>

      <title>Introducing irrational enumeration: analytic combinatorics for objects of irrational size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the scope of analytic combinatorics to classes containing objects that have irrational sizes. The generating function for such a class is a power series that admits irrational exponents (which we call a Ribenboim series). A transformation then yields a generalised Dirichlet series from which the asymptotics of the coefficients can be extracted by singularity analysis using an appropriate Tauberian theorem. In practice, the asymptotics can often be determined directly from the original generating function. We illustrate the technique with a variety of applications, including tilings with tiles of irrational area, ordered integer factorizations, lattice walks enumerated by Euclidean length, and plane trees with vertices of irrational size. We also explore phase transitions in the asymptotics of families of irrational combinatorial classes.</description>

      <title>$k$-fold Circuits in Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double circuits were introduced by Lov\'{a}sz in 1980 as a fundamental tool in his derivation of a min-max formula for the size of a maximum matching in certain families of matroids. This formula was extended to all matroids satisfying the so-called `double circuit property' by Dress and Lov\'{a}sz in 1987. We extend these notions to $k$-fold circuits for all natural numbers $k$ and derive foundational results about these $k$-fold circuits. Our results imply, in particular, that certain families of matroids which are known to satisfy the double circuit property, satisfy the $k$-fold circuit property for all natural numbers $k$. These families include all pseudomodular matroids (such as full linear, algebraic and transversal matroids) and count matroids.</description>

      <title>Large Induced Subgraphs of Bounded Degree in Planar Graphs and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the following question. Let $\mathcal G$ be a family of graphs and let $k\geq 3$ be an integer. What is the largest value $f_k(n)$ such that every $n$-vertex graph in $\mathcal G$ has an induced subgraph with degree at most $k$ and with $f_k(n)$ vertices? Similar questions, in which one seeks a large induced forest, or a large induced linear forest, or a large induced $d$-degenerate graph, rather than a large induced graph of bounded degree, have been studied for decades and have given rise to some of the most fascinating and elusive conjectures in Graph Theory. We tackle our problem when $\mathcal G$ is the class of the outerplanar graphs, or the class of the planar graphs, or the class of the graphs whose degree is bounded by a value $d&gt;k$. In all cases, we provide upper and lower bounds on the value of $f_k(n)$. For example, we prove that every $n$-vertex planar graph has an induced subgraph with degree at most $3$ and with $\frac{5n}{13}&gt;0.384n$ vertices, and that there exist $n$-vertex planar graphs whose largest induced subgraph with degree at most $3$ has $\frac{4n}{7}+O(1)&lt;0.572n+O(1)$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Construction of directed strongly regular graphs via their orbit matrices and genetic algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce orbit matrices of directed strongly regular graphs (DSRGs). Further, we propose a method of constructing directed strongly regular graphs with prescribed automorphism group using genetic algorithm. In the construction, we use orbit matrices, i.e. quotient matrices related to equitable partitions of adjacency matrices of putative directed strongly regular graphs induced by an action of a prescribed automorphism group. Further, we apply this method to construct directed strongly regular graphs with parameters $(36,10,5,2,3)$, $(52,12,3,2,3)$, $(52,15,6,5,6)$, $(55,20,8,6,8)$ and $(55,24,12,11,10)$.</description>

      <title>On the Spread of Graph-Related Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an $n\times n$ real symmetric matrix. The spread of $M$ is defined as the difference between its largest and smallest eigenvalue. When considering the spread of graph-related matrices, this topic has attracted significant attention, resulting in a substantial collection of findings. In this paper, we study a general spread problem regarding $A_{\alpha}$-matrix of graphs. The $A_{\alpha}$-matrix of a graph $G$, introduced by Nikiforov in 2017, is a convex combinations of its diagonal degree matrix $D(G)$ and adjacency matrix $A(G)$, defined as $A_{\alpha} (G) = \alpha D(G) + (1-\alpha) A(G)$. Let $\lambda_1^{(\alpha)} (G)$ and $\lambda_n^{(\alpha)} (G)$ denote the largest and least eigenvalues of $A_{\alpha} (G)$, respectively. We determined the unique graph that maximizes $\lambda^{(\alpha)}_1 (G) - \beta\cdot\lambda^{(\gamma)}_n (G)$ among all connected $n$-vertex graphs for sufficiently large $n$, where $0 \leq \alpha &lt; 1$, $1/2\leq \gamma &lt; 1$ and $0&lt;\beta\gamma\leq 1$. As applications, we confirm a conjecture proposed by Lin, Miao, and Guo [Linear Algebra Appl. 606 (2020) 1--22], and derive a new finding.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Enumerating Independent Sets in Regular $k$-Partite $k$-Uniform Hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of independent sets in regular bipartite expander graphs can be efficiently approximated by expressing it as the partition function of a suitable polymer model and truncating its cluster expansion. While this approach has been extensively used for graphs, surprisingly little is known about analogous questions in the context of hypergraphs. In this work, we apply this method to asymptotically determine the number of independent sets in regular $k$-partite $k$-uniform hypergraphs which satisfy natural expansion properties. The resulting formula depends only on the local structure of the hypergraph, making it computationally efficient. In particular, we provide a simple closed-form expression for linear hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>A hypergraph bandwidth theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cornerstone of extremal graph theory due to Erd\H{o}s and Stone states that the edge density which guarantees a fixed graph $F$ as subgraph also asymptotically guarantees a blow-up of $F$ as subgraph. It is natural to ask whether this phenomenon generalises to vertex-spanning structures such as Hamilton cycles. This was confirmed by B\"ottcher, Schacht and Taraz for graphs in the form of the Bandwidth Theorem. Our main result extends the phenomenon to hypergraphs.
  A graph on $n$ vertices that robustly contains a Hamilton cycle must satisfy certain conditions on space, connectivity and aperiodicity. Conversely, we show that if these properties are robustly satisfied, then all blow-ups of cycles on $n$ vertices with clusters of size at most $\operatorname{poly}(\log \log n)$ are guaranteed as subgraphs. This generalises to powers of cycles and to the hypergraph setting.
  As an application, we recover a series of classic results and recent breakthroughs on Hamiltonicity under degree conditions, which are then immediately upgraded to blown up versions. The proofs are based on a new setup for embedding large substructures into dense hypergraphs, which is of independent interest and does not rely on the Regularity Lemma or the Absorption Method.</description>

      <title>An Optimization Approach to Degree Deviation and Spectral Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite, simple, and undirected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and average degree $d$, Nikiforov introduced the degree deviation of $G$ as $s=\sum_{u\in V(G)}\left|d_G(u)-d\right|$. Provided that $G$ has largest eigenvalue $\lambda$, minimum degree at least $\delta$, and maximum degree at most $\Delta$, where $0\leq\delta&lt;d&lt;\Delta&lt;n$, we show $$s\leq \frac{2n(\Delta-d)(d-\delta)}{\Delta-\delta} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mbox{and}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \lambda \geq \begin{cases} \frac{d^2n}{\sqrt{d^2n^2-s^2}} &amp; \mbox{, if } s\leq \frac{dn}{\sqrt{2}},\\[3mm] \frac{2s}{n} &amp; \mbox{, if } s&gt; \frac{dn}{\sqrt{2}}. \end{cases}$$ Our results are based on a smoothing technique relating the degree deviation and the largest eigenvalue to low-dimensional non-linear optimization problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To find crystals of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ representations of the form $\Lambda^n\text{Sym}^r\mathbb{C}^2$ it suffices to solve the combinatorial problem of decomposing Young's lattice into symmetric, saturated chains. We review the literature on this latter problem, and present a strategy to solve it. For $n \le 4$, the strategy recovers recently discovered solutions. We obtain (i) counting formulas for plethystic coefficients, (ii) new recursive formulas for plethysms of Schur functions, and (iii) formulas for the number of constituents of $\Lambda^n\text{Sym}^r\mathbb{C}^2$.</description>

      <title>The hypergraph removal process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k\geq 2$ and fix a $k$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{F}$. Consider the random process that, starting from a $k$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ on $n$ vertices, repeatedly deletes the edges of a copy of $\mathcal{F}$ chosen uniformly at random and terminates when no copies of $\mathcal{F}$ remain. Let $R(\mathcal{H},\mathcal{F})$ denote the number of edges that are left after termination. We show that $R(\mathcal{H},\mathcal{F})=n^{k-1/\rho\pm o(1)}$, where $\rho:=(\lvert E(\mathcal{F})\rvert-1)/(\lvert V(\mathcal{F})\rvert -k)$, holds with high probability provided that $\mathcal{F}$ is strictly $k$-balanced and $\mathcal{H}$ is sufficiently dense with pseudorandom properties. Since we may in particular choose $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{H}$ to be complete graphs, this confirms the major folklore conjecture in the area in a very strong form.</description>

      <title>Induced arithmetic removal for partition-regular patterns of complexity 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2019, Fox, Tidor and Zhao (arXiv:1911.03427) proved an induced arithmetic removal lemma for linear patterns of complexity 1 in vector spaces over a fixed finite field. With no further assumptions on the pattern, this induced removal lemma cannot guarantee a fully pattern-free recolouring of the space, as some `non-generic' instances must necessarily remain. On the other hand, Bhattacharyya et al. (arXiv:1212.3849) showed that in the case of translation-invariant patterns, it is possible to obtain recolourings that eliminate the given pattern completely, with no exceptions left behind. This paper demonstrates that such complete removal can be achieved for all partition-regular arithmetic patterns of complexity 1.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Reductions Using Graph Neural Networks and a New Concurrent Local Search for the Maximum Weight Independent Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Maximum Weight Independent Set problem is a fundamental NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization with several real-world applications. Given an undirected vertex-weighted graph, the problem is to find a subset of the vertices with the highest possible weight under the constraint that no two vertices in the set can share an edge. An important part of solving this problem in both theory and practice is data reduction rules, which several state-of-the-art algorithms rely on. However, the most complicated rules are often not used in applications since the time needed to check them exhaustively becomes infeasible. In this work, we introduce three main results. First, we introduce several new data reduction rules and evaluate their effectiveness on real-world data. Second, we use a machine learning screening algorithm to speed up the reduction phase, thereby enabling more complicated rules to be applied. Our screening algorithm consults a Graph Neural Network oracle to decide if the probability of successfully reducing the graph is sufficiently large. For this task, we provide a dataset of labeled vertices for use in supervised learning. We also present the first results for this dataset using established Graph Neural Network architectures. Third, we present a new concurrent metaheuristic called Concurrent Difference-Core Heuristic. On the reduced instances, we use our new metaheuristic combined with iterated local search, called CHILS (Concurrent Hybrid Iterated Local Search). For this iterated local search, we provide a new implementation specifically designed to handle large graphs of varying densities. CHILS outperforms the current state-of-the-art on all commonly used benchmark instances, especially the largest ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute an analogue of Pascal's triangle enriched in bilinear forms over a finite field. This gives an arithmetically meaningful count of the ways to choose $j$ embeddings into an \'etale extension of degree $n$. We also compute a quadratic twist. These (twisted) enriched binomial coefficients are defined in joint work of Brugall\'e and the second-named author, building on work of Garibaldi, Merkurjev, and Serre. Such binomial coefficients support curve counting results over non-algebraically closed fields, using $A^1$-homotopy theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give Euler-like recursive formulas for the $t$-colored partition function when $t=2$ or $t=3,$ as well as for all $t$-regular partition functions. In particular, we derive an infinite family of ``triangular number" recurrences for the $3$-colored partition function. Our proofs are inspired by the recent work of Gomez, Ono, Saad, and Singh on the ordinary partition function and make extensive use of $q$-series identities for $(q;q)_{\infty}$ and $(q;q)_{\infty}^3.$</description>

      <title>Coupling and Tensorization of Kinetic Theory and Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a non-exchangeable multi-agent system and rigorously derive a strong form of the mean-field limit. The convergence of the connection weights and the initial data implies convergence of large-scale dynamics toward a deterministic limit given by the corresponding extended Vlasov PDE, at any later time and any realization of randomness. This is established on what we call a bi-coupling distance defined through a convex optimization problem, which is an interpolation of the optimal transport between measures and the fractional overlay between graphs. The proof relies on a quantitative stability estimate of the so-called observables, which are tensorizations of agent laws and graph homomorphism densities. This reveals a profound relationship between mean-field theory and graph limiting theory, intersecting in the study of non-exchangeable systems.</description>

Abstract: We consider the weakening of Ramsey's theorem that arises from considering only translation-invariant colourings of pairs, and show that this has the same strength (both from the viewpoint of Reverse Mathematics and from the viewpoint of Computability Theory) as the "adjacent Hindman's theorem", proposed by L. Carlucci (Arch. Math. Log. 57 (2018), 381--359). We also investigate some higher dimensional versions of both of these statements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Additive codes may have better parameters than linear codes. However, still very few cases are known and the explicit construction of such codes is a challenging problem. Here we show that a Griesmer type bound for the length of additive codes can always be attained with equality if the minimum distance is sufficiently large. This solves the problem for the optimal parameters of additive codes when the minimum distance is large and yields many infinite series of additive codes that outperform linear codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey is devoted to the geography problem of log-surfaces constructed as pairs consisting of a smooth projective surface and a reduced boundary divisor. In the first part we focus on the geography problem for log-surfaces associated with pairs of the form $(\mathbb{P}^{2}, C)$, where $C$ is an arrangement of smooth plane curves admitting ordinary singularities. In particular, we focus on the case where $C$ is an arrangement of smooth rational curves. In the second part, containing original new results, we study log surfaces constructed as pairs consisting of a $K3$ surface and a rational curve arrangement. In particular, we provide some combinatorial conditions for such pairs to have the log-Chern slope equal to $3$. Our survey is illustrated with many explicit examples of log-surfaces.</description>

      <title>Sparse induced subgraphs in $P_7$-free graphs of bounded clique number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many natural computational problems, including e.g. Max Weight Independent Set, Feedback Vertex Set, or Vertex Planarization, can be unified under an umbrella of finding the largest sparse induced subgraph, that satisfies some property definable in CMSO$_2$ logic.
  It is believed that each problem expressible with this formalism can be solved in polynomial time in graphs that exclude a fixed path as an induced subgraph.
  This belief is supported by the existence of a quasipolynomial-time algorithm by Gartland, Lokshtanov, Pilipczuk, Pilipczuk, and Rz\k{a}\.zewski [STOC 2021], and a recent polynomial-time algorithm for $P_6$-free graphs by Chudnovsky, McCarty, Pilipczuk, Pilipczuk, and Rz\k{a}\.zewski [SODA 2024].
  In this work we extend polynomial-time tractability of all such problems to $P_7$-free graphs of bounded clique number.</description>

      <title>Long induced paths and forbidden patterns: Polylogarithmic bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a graph $G$ with a long path $P$. When is it the case that $G$ also contains a long induced path? This question has been investigated in general as well as within a number of different graph classes since the 80s. We have recently observed in a companion paper (Long induced paths in sparse graphs and graphs with forbidden patterns, arXiv:2411.08685, 2024) that most existing results can recovered in a simple way by considering forbidden ordered patterns of edges along the path $P$. In particular we proved that if we forbid some fixed ordered matching along a path of order $n$ in a graph $G$, then $G$ must contain an induced path of order $(\log n)^{\Omega(1)}$. Moreover, we completely characterized the forbidden ordered patterns forcing the existence of an induced path of polynomial size.
  The purpose of the present paper is to completely characterize the ordered patterns $H$ such that forbidding $H$ along a path $P$ of order $n$ implies the existence of an induced path of order $(\log n)^{\Omega(1)}$. These patterns are star forests with some specific ordering, which we called constellations.
  As a direct consequence of our result, we show that if a graph $G$ has a path of length $n$ and does not contain $K_t$ as a topological minor, then $G$ contains an induced path of order $(\log n)^{\Omega(1/t \log^2 t)}$. The previously best known bound was $(\log n)^{f(t)}$ for some unspecified function $f$ depending on the Topological Minor Structure Theorem of Grohe and Marx (2015).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that several sets of interest arising from the study of partition regularity and density Ramsey theory of polynomial equations over integral domains are undecidable. In particular, we show that the set of homogeneous polynomials $p \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$ for which the equation $p(x_1,\cdots,x_n) = 0$ is partition regular over $\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$ is undecidable conditional on Hilbert's tenth problem for $\mathbb{Q}$. For other integral domains, we get the analogous result unconditionally. More generally, we determine the exact lightface complexity of the various sets of interest. For example, we show that the set of homogeneous polynomials $p \in \mathbb{F}_q(t)[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$ for which the equation $p(x_1,\cdots,x_n) = 0$ is partition regular over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)\setminus\{0\}$ is $\Pi_2^0$-complete.
  We also prove several other results of independent interest. These include a compactness principle and a uniformity principle for density Ramsey theory on countable cancellative left amenable semigroups, as well as the existence of the natural extension for measure preserving systems of countable cancellative left reversible semigroups.</description>

Abstract: We study ancient solutions to discrete heat equations on some weighted graphs. On a graph of the form of a product with $\bb Z,$ we show that there are no non-trivial ancient solutions with polynomial growth. This result is parallel to the case of finite graphs, which is also discussed. Along the way, we prove a backward uniqueness result for solutions with appropriate decaying rate based on a monotonicity formula of parabolic frequency.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph of a network system with vertices, $V(G)$, representing physical locations and edges, $E(G)$, representing informational connectivity. A \emph{locating-dominating (LD)} set $S \subseteq V(G)$ is a subset of vertices representing detectors capable of sensing an "intruder" at precisely their location or somewhere in their open-neighborhood -- an LD set must be capable of locating an intruder anywhere in the graph. We explore three types of fault-tolerant LD sets: \emph{redundant LD} sets, which allow a detector to be removed, \emph{error-detecting LD} sets, which allow at most one false negative, and \emph{error-correcting LD} sets, which allow at most one error (false positive or negative). In particular, we determine lower and upper bounds for the minimum density of these three fault-tolerant locating-dominating sets in the \emph{infinite king grid}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01560v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a tuple $\Phi = (\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_m)$ of commuting maps on a finitary matroid $X$. We show that if $\Phi$ satisfies certain conditions, then for any finite set $A\subseteq X$, the rank of $\{\phi_1^{r_1}\cdots\phi_m^{r_m}(a):a \in A\text{ and }r_1+\cdots+r_m = t\}$ is eventually a polynomial in $t$ (we also give a multivariate version of the polynomial). This allows us easily recover Khovanskii's theorem on the growth of sumsets, the existence of the classical Hilbert polynomial, and the existence of the Kolchin polynomial. We also prove some new Kolchin polynomial results for differential exponential fields and derivations on o-minimal fields, as well as a new result on the growth of Betti numbers in simplicial complexes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph is reducible if it is the lexicographic product of two smaller non-trivial graphs. It is well-known a 1-planar graph with $n ~(\ge3)$ vertices has at most $4n-8$ edges, and a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices is optimal if $G$ has exactly $4n-8$ edges. In this paper, we characterize the reducibility of optimal 1-planar graphs. This work is motivated by a problem posed by Bucko and Czap in 2015, which concerns determining the 1-planarity of the lexicographic product of a graph and two isolated vertices.</description>

      <title>On the evolution of random integer compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore how the asymptotic structure of a random $n$-term weak integer composition of $m$ evolves, as $m$ increases from zero. The primary focus is on establishing thresholds for the appearance and disappearance of substructures. These include the longest and shortest runs of zero terms or of nonzero terms, longest increasing runs, longest runs of equal terms, largest squares (runs of $k$ terms each equal to $k$), as well as a wide variety of other patterns. Of particular note is the dichotomy between the appearance and disappearance of exact consecutive patterns, with smaller patterns appearing before larger ones, whereas longer patterns disappear before shorter ones.</description>

      <title>On naturally labelled posets and permutations avoiding 12-34</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A partial order $\prec$ on $[n]$ is naturally labelled (NL) if $x\prec y$ implies $x&lt;y$. We establish a bijection between {3, 2+2}-free NL posets and 12-34-avoiding permutations, determine functional equations satisfied by their generating function, and use series analysis to investigate their asymptotic growth, presenting evidence of stretched exponential behaviour. We also exhibit bijections between 3-free NL posets and various other objects, and determine their generating function. The connection between our results and a hierarchy of combinatorial objects related to interval orders is described.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Bogolyubov for special linear groups via tensor rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a polynomial Bogolyubov type lemma for the special linear group over finite fields. Specifically, we show that there exists an absolute constant $C&gt;0,$ such that if $A$ is a density $\alpha$ subset of the special linear group, then the set $AA^{-1}AA^{-1}$ contains a subgroup $H$ of density $\alpha^C$. Moreover, this subgroup is isomorphic to a special linear group of a smaller rank. We also show that if $A$ is an approximate subgroups then it can be covered by the union of few cosets of $H$. Our proof makes use of the Gurevich--Howe notion of tensor rank, and of a strengthened Bonami type Lemma for global functions on the bilinear scheme. We also present applications to spectral bounds for global convolution operators, global product free sets, and covering numbers corresponding to global sets.</description>

      <title>On a Pieri-like rule for the Petrie symmetric functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $k$-ribbon tiling is a decomposition of a connected skew diagram into disjoint ribbons of size $k$. In this paper, we establish a connection between a subset of $k$-ribbon tilings and Petrie symmetric functions, thus providing a combinatorial interpretation for the coefficients in a Pieri-like rule for the Petrie symmetric functions due to Grinberg (Algebr. Comb. 5 (2022), no. 5, 947-1013). This also extends a result by Cheng, Chou and Eu et al. (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 151 (2023), no. 5, 1839-1854). As a bonus, our findings can be effectively utilized to derive certain specializations.</description>

      <title>When entropy meets Tur\'an: new proofs and hypergraph Tur\'an results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a new proof of a density version of Tur\'an's theorem. We also rephrase both the theorem and the proof using entropy. With the entropic formulation, we show that some naturally defined entropic quantity is closely connected to other common quantities such as Lagrangian and spectral radius. In addition, we also determine the Tur\'an density for a new family of hypergraphs, which we call tents. Our result can be seen as a new generalization of Mubayi's result on the extended cliques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on a determinantal formula for the higher derivative of a quotient of two functions, we first present the determinantal expressions of Eulerian polynomials and Andre polynomials. In particular, we discover that the Euler number (number of alternating permutations) can be expressed as a lower Hessenberg determinant. We then investigate the determinantal representations of the up-down run polynomials and the types A and B alternating run polynomials. As applications, we deduce several new recurrence relations, which imply the multiplicity of -1 in these three kinds of polynomials. And then, we provide two determinantal representations for the alternating run polynomials of dual Stirling permutations. In particular, we discover a close connection between the alternating run polynomials of dual Stirling permutations and the type B Eulerian polynomials.</description>

      <title>Energy bounds for weighted spherical codes and designs via linear programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal bounds for the potential energy of weighted spherical codes are obtained by linear programming. The universality is in the sense of Cohn-Kumar -- every attaining code is optimal with respect to a large class of potential functions (absolutely monotone), in the sense of Levenshtein -- there is a bound for every weighted code, and in the sense of parameters (nodes and weights) -- they are independent of the potential function. We derive a necessary condition for optimality (in the linear programming framework) of our lower bounds which is also shown to be sufficient when the potential is strictly absolutely monotone. Bounds are also obtained for the weighted energy of weighted spherical designs. We explore our bounds for several previously studied weighted spherical codes.</description>

      <title>Critical beta-splitting, via contraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The critical beta-splitting tree, introduced by Aldous, is a Markov branching phylogenetic tree. Aldous and Pittel recently proved, amongst other results, a central limit theorem for the height of a random leaf. We give an alternative proof, via contraction methods for random recursive structures. These methods were developed by Neininger and R\"{u}schendorf, motivated by Pittel's article "Normal convergence problem? Two moments and a recurrence may be the clues." Aldous and Pittel estimated the leading order terms in the first two moments. More recently, Aldous and Janson obtained an asymptotic expansion for the average height. We show that a central limit theorem follows, and bound the distance to normality. Our results also apply to the continuous version of the model, in which branching times are exponential.</description>

      <title>Monomial web basis for the SL(N) skein algebra of the twice punctured sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof of a slightly modified version of a result of Queffelec--Rose, by constructing a linear basis for the $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ skein algebra of the twice punctured sphere for any non-zero complex number $q$, excluding finitely many roots of unity of small order. In particular, the skein algebra is a commutative polynomial algebra in $n-1$ generators, where each generator is represented by an explicit $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ web, without crossings, on the surface. This includes the case $q=1$, where the skein algebra is identified with the coordinate ring of the $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ character variety of the twice punctured sphere. The proof of both the spanning and linear independence properties of the basis depends on the so-called $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ quantum trace map, due originally to Bonahon--Wong in the case $n=2$. Two consequences of our method are that the quantum trace map and the so-called splitting map embed the polynomial algebra into the Fock--Goncharov quantum higher Teichm\"uller space and the L\^{e}--Sikora stated skein algebra, respectively, of the annulus. We end by discussing the relationship with Fock--Goncharov duality.</description>

      <title>Polynomial functions on a class of finite non-commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a finite non-commutative ring with $1\ne 0$. By a polynomial function on $R$, we mean a function $F\colon R\longrightarrow R$ induced by a polynomial $f=\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}a_ix^i\in R[x]$ via right substitution of the variable $x$, i.e.
  $F(a)=f(a)= \sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}a_ia^i$ for every $a\in R$. In this paper, we study the polynomial functions of the free $R$-algebra with a central basis $\{1,\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_k\}$ ($k\ge 1$) such that $\beta_i\beta_j=0$ for every $1\le i,j\le k$, $R[\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_k]$. %, the ring of dual numbers over $R$ in $k$ variables.
  Our investigation revolves around assigning a polynomial $\lambda_f(y,z)$ over $R$ in non-commutating variables $y$ and $z$ to each polynomial $f$ in $R[x]$; and describing the polynomial functions on $R[\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_k]$ through the polynomial functions induced on $R$ by polynomials in $R[x]$ and by their assigned polynomials in the non-commutating variables $y$ and $z$. %and analyzing the resulting polynomial functions on $R[\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_k]$.
  By extending results from the commutative case to the non-commutative scenario, we demonstrate that several properties and theorems in the commutative case can be generalized to the non-commutative setting with appropriate adjustments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to study the restriction conjecture using decoupling theorems and two-ends Furstenberg inequalities. Specifically, we pose a two-ends Furstenberg conjecture, which implies the restriction conjecture. As evidence, we prove this conjecture in the plane by using the Furstenberg set estimate. Moreover, we use this planar result to prove a restriction estimate for $p&gt;22/7$ in three dimensions, which implies Wolff's $5/2$-hairbrush bound for Kakeya sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Our approach also makes improvements for the restriction conjecture in higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an alternative probabilistic proof for the sharp Assouad--Nagata dimension bound of a doubling metric space. In addition, we explore some partial rigidity results and applications to scalar curvature. A significant technical tool in our argument is the concept of padded decomposition, which originates in computer science and has been extended to general separable metric spaces by us. Along the way, we extend the sharp upper bound on the asymptotic dimension of graphs with polynomial growth to noncollapsed locally compact metric measure spaces with polynomial volume growth. This sheds light on broader applications of probabilistic methods in metric geometry.</description>
