      <title>Reinforcement Learning Pair Trading: A Dynamic Scaling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency is a cryptography-based digital asset with extremely volatile prices. Around $70 billion worth of crypto-currency is traded daily on exchanges. Trading crypto-currency is difficult due to the inherent volatility of the crypto-market. In this work, we want to test the hypothesis: "Can techniques from artificial intelligence help with algorithmically trading cryptocurrencies?". In order to address this question, we combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) with pair trading. Pair trading is a statistical arbitrage trading technique which exploits the price difference between statistically correlated assets. We train reinforcement learners to determine when and how to trade pairs of cryptocurrencies. We develop new reward shaping and observation/action spaces for reinforcement learning. We performed experiments with the developed reinforcement learner on pairs of BTC-GBP and BTC-EUR data separated by 1-minute intervals (n = 263,520). The traditional non-RL pair trading technique achieved an annualised profit of 8.33%, while the proposed RL-based pair trading technique achieved annualised profits from 9.94% - 31.53%, depending upon the RL learner. Our results show that RL can significantly outperform manual and traditional pair trading techniques when applied to volatile markets such as cryptocurrencies.</description>

      <title>On Deep Learning for computing the Dynamic Initial Margin and Margin Value Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work addresses the challenge of training neural networks for Dynamic Initial Margin (DIM) computation in counterparty credit risk, a task traditionally burdened by the high costs associated with generating training datasets through nested Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. By condensing the initial market state variables into an input vector, determined through an interest rate model and a parsimonious parameterization of the current interest rate term structure, we construct a training dataset where labels are noisy but unbiased DIM samples derived from single MC paths. A multi-output neural network structure is employed to handle DIM as a time-dependent function, facilitating training across a mesh of monitoring times. The methodology offers significant advantages: it reduces the dataset generation cost to a single MC execution and parameterizes the neural network by initial market state variables, obviating the need for repeated training. Experimental results demonstrate the approach's convergence properties and robustness across different interest rate models (Vasicek and Hull-White) and portfolio complexities, validating its general applicability and efficiency in more realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Alleviating Non-identifiability: a High-fidelity Calibration Objective for Financial Market Simulation with Multivariate Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16566v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-identifiability issue has been frequently reported in the social simulation works, where different parameters of an agent-based simulation model yield indistinguishable simulated time series data under certain discrepancy metrics. This issue largely undermines the simulation fidelity yet lacks dedicated investigations. This paper theoretically analyzes that incorporating multiple time series data features in the model calibration phase can alleviate the non-identifiability exponentially with the increasing number of features. To implement this theoretical finding, a maximization-based aggregation function is applied to existing discrepancy metrics to form a new calibration objective function. For verification, the financial market simulation, a typical and complex social simulation task, is considered. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real market data witness the significant improvements in alleviating the non-identifiability with much higher simulation fidelity of the chosen agent-based simulation model. Importantly, as a model-agnostic method, it achieves the first successful simulation of the high-frequency market at seconds level. Hence, this work is expected to provide not only a rigorous understanding of non-identifiability in social simulation, but a high-fidelity calibration objective function for financial market simulations.</description>
