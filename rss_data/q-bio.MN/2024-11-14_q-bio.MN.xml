      <title>Absolute concentration robustness: Algebra and geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the question of how biological systems maintain homeostasis in changing environments, Shinar and Feinberg introduced in 2010 the concept of absolute concentration robustness (ACR). A biochemical system exhibits ACR in some species if the steady-state value of that species does not depend on initial conditions. Thus, a system with ACR can maintain a constant level of one species even as the environment changes. Despite a great deal of interest in ACR in recent years, the following basic question remains open: How can we determine quickly whether a given biochemical system has ACR? Although various approaches to this problem have been proposed, we show that they are incomplete. Accordingly, we present new methods for deciding ACR, which harness computational algebra. We illustrate our results on several biochemical signaling networks.</description>

      <title>Theory of epigenetic switching due to stochastic histone mark loss during DNA replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How much information does a cell inherit from its ancestors beyond its genetic sequence? What are the epigenetic mechanisms that allow this? Despite the rise in available epigenetic data, how such information is inherited through the cell cycle is still not fully understood. Often, epigenetic marks can display bistable behaviour and their bistable state is transmitted to daughter cells through the cell cycle, providing the cell with a form of memory. However, loss-of-memory events also take place, where a daughter cell switches epigenetic state (with respect to the mother cell). Here, we develop a framework to compute these epigenetic switching rates, for the case when they are driven by DNA replication, i.e., the frequency of loss-of-memory events due to replication. We consider the dynamics of histone modifications during the cell cycle deterministically, except at DNA replication, where nucleosomes are randomly distributed between the two daughter DNA strands, which is therefore implemented stochastically. This hybrid stochastic-deterministic approach enables an analytic derivation of the replication-driven switching rate. While retaining great simplicity, this framework can explain experimental switching rate data, establishing its biological importance as a framework to quantitatively study epigenetic inheritance.</description>

      <title>Active learning of digenic functions with boolean matrix logic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply logic-based machine learning techniques to facilitate cellular engineering and drive biological discovery, based on comprehensive databases of metabolic processes called genome-scale metabolic network models (GEMs). Predicted host behaviours are not always correctly described by GEMs. Learning the intricate genetic interactions within GEMs presents computational and empirical challenges. To address these, we describe a novel approach called Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP) by leveraging boolean matrices to evaluate large logic programs. We introduce a new system, $BMLP_{active}$, which efficiently explores the genomic hypothesis space by guiding informative experimentation through active learning. In contrast to sub-symbolic methods, $BMLP_{active}$ encodes a state-of-the-art GEM of a widely accepted bacterial host in an interpretable and logical representation using datalog logic programs. Notably, $BMLP_{active}$ can successfully learn the interaction between a gene pair with fewer training examples than random experimentation, overcoming the increase in experimental design space. $BMLP_{active}$ enables rapid optimisation of metabolic models and offers a realistic approach to a self-driving lab for microbial engineering.</description>
