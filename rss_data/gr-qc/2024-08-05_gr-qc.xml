      <title>Leveraging Time-Dependent Instrumental Noise for LISA SGWB Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variations in the instrumental noise of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) over time are expected as a result of e.g. scheduled satellite operations or unscheduled glitches. We demonstrate that these fluctuations can be leveraged to improve the sensitivity to stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) compared to the stationary noise scenario. This requires optimal use of data segments with downward noise fluctuations, and thus a data analysis pipeline capable of analysing and combining shorter time segments of mission data. We propose that simulation based inference is well suited for this challenge. In an approximate, but state-of-the-art, modeling setup, we show by comparison with Fisher Information Matrix estimates that the optimal information gain can be achieved in practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultralocal limit along timelike geodesics, in which any geometry reduces to Bianchi I, does not extend to non-geodesic timelike observers. Exceptions are discussed, including particles with variable mass, test particles in Einstein frame scalar-tensor gravity, and self-interacting dark matter.</description>

      <title>Two distinct types of echoes in compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the black hole perturbation theory framework, two different physical pictures for echoes in compact objects have been proposed. The first mechanism interprets echoes as repeated reflections of gravitational waves within a potential well, where the echo period is defined by twice the distance related to the spatial displacement operator that separates two local maxima of the effective potential. The second mechanism associates echoes with a discontinuity in the effective potential, potentially associated with specific accretion processes, without necessarily introducing a second local maximum in the effective potential. This discontinuity leads to echo signals that are typically attenuated over time more quickly, with their period dictated by the characteristics of the transfer amplitudes. In both scenarios, the echoes correspond to a new category of quasinormal modes with minor real parts, with their period connected to the spacing between successive modes in the frequency domain. This work elaborates on a unified framework in compact stars that encompasses both echo mechanisms. It suggests that these two types of echoes derive from different physical origins and can be independently triggered. The occurrence and interplay between these two types of echoes are demonstrated through numerical simulations. %The observational relevance of this study is also addressed.</description>

      <title>Fully metallic geodesic lenses as analog electromagnetic models of static and spherically symmetric gravitational fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a fully metallic and air-filled geodesic waveguide can be employed as an analog electromagnetic model of a static and spherically symmetric gravitational field. By following the Plebanski formalism, a space-time metric of the aforementioned type is firstly encoded into the electromagnetic properties of a flat space-time region in the form of an isotropic and radially varying refractive index distribution. Then, a three-dimensional, air-filled, and axially symmetric waveguide, composed of two equally spaced and curved metallic surfaces, is employed. Its shape is tailored such that the effective paths, followed by transverse electromagnetic beams of microwave radiation within this waveguide, result equivalent to null-geodesics taking place in the aforementioned refractive medium. This strategy avoids the need for a refractive medium, although it only allows to reproduce the space-time metric on the invariant plane. Two analog electromagnetic models of gravity, using the proposed approach, are designed to reproduce the metric of both a Schwarzschild black hole and a Morris-Thorne wormhole. The results from full-wave simulations demonstrate that a one-dimensional Gaussian beam faithfully follows a path completely equivalent to general relativistic null geodesics with a mean relative error within 4%.</description>

      <title>Self-Excited Gravitational Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to constructing gravitational instantons based on the observation that the gravitational action of general relativity in its teleparallel formulation can be expressed as a product of torsion and excitation forms. We introduce a new class of solutions where these two forms are equal, which we term the self-excited instantons, and advocate for their use over the self-dual instantons of Eguchi and Hanson. These new self-excited instantons exhibit striking similarities to BPST instantons in Yang-Mills theory, as their action reduces to a topological Nieh-Yan term, which allows us to identify the axial torsion as a topological current and to define a topological charge.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing Effects and Observational Behaviors of the Rotating Short-Hairy Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The successful capture of black hole(BH) images by the Event Horizon Telescope(EHT) has sparked a surge in research on strong gravitational lensing, providing new methods for studying behavior near the event horizon of BHs. For the short-hair that has significant effects only near the BH event horizon, studying its strong gravitational lensing effects helps to understand the nature of this hair. This paper explores the behaviors of the rotating short-hairy BH in strong gravitational lensing. Simulations show that the short-hair parameter results in a smaller event horizon radius, photon sphere, and impact parameter compared to the Kerr BH. Moreover, the lensing coefficients $ \bar{a} $ and $ \bar{b} $ show opposite trends due to the short-hair parameter $ Q_m $, with the former increasing and the latter decreasing. It is worth mentioning that in certain cases, the short-hair parameter can make $ \bar{b} $ slightly higher than that of the Kerr BH. The deflection angle $ \alpha_D $ decreases with an increasing impact parameter and diverges at $ u_m $, with the divergent impact parameter of rotating short-hairy BH being smaller than that of the Kerr BH. In the context of $M87^*$ and $Sgr A^*$ BHs, their Einstein rings, relativistic images, and time delays differ significantly from those of the Kerr BH. Although current equipment cannot yet distinguish these differences, future high-precision instruments are expected to achieve this goal, thereby differentiating rotating short-hairy BH from the Kerr BH, exploring the nature of the short-hair, and testing the no-hair theorem of BH. This provides a new perspective for understanding the extreme physical environments of BHs and offers necessary references for future observational and theoretical research.</description>

      <title>Regularity and temperature of stationary black hole event horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Available proofs of the regularity of stationary black hole event horizons rely on some assumptions on the existence of sections that imply a $C^1$ differentiability assumption. By using a quotient bundle approach, we remedy this problem by proving directly that, indeed, under the null energy condition event horizons of stationary black holes are totally geodesic null hypersurfaces as regular as the metric. Only later, by using this result, we show that the cross-sections, whose existence was postulated in previous works, do indeed exist. These results hold true under weak causality conditions. Subsequently, we prove that under the dominant energy condition stationary black hole event horizons indeed admit constant surface gravity, a result that does not require any non-degeneracy assumption, requirements on existence of cross-sections or a priori smoothness conditions. We are able to make sense of the angular velocity and of the value (not just sign) of surface gravity as quantities related to the horizon, without the need of assuming Einstein's vacuum equations and the Killing extension. Physically, the result means that under very general conditions every stationary black hole has indeed a constant temperature (the zeroth law of black hole thermodynamics).</description>

      <title>Evolution of an effective Hubble constant in $f(R)$ modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Hubble constant tension within $f(R)$ modified gravity in the Jordan frame, focusing on its application to the dynamics of an isotropic Universe. A scalar field, non-minimally coupled to the metric, provides an extra degree of freedom compared to General Relativity. We analyze the impact of such a scalar field on the cosmic expansion, leading to an effective Hubble constant $H_{0}^{\text{eff}}(z)$, dependent on redshift $z$. We show that our $f(R)$ model might mimic dark energy and provide an apparent variation of the Hubble constant. Our results align with recent cosmological data analysis in redshift bins, indicating a decreasing trend of the Hubble constant. The redshift dependence of $H_{0}^{\text{eff}}(z)$ might potentially reconcile measurements of the Hubble constant from probes at different redshifts.</description>

      <title>Analog Unruh effect of inhomogeneous one-dimensional Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional Dirac fermions in the presence of a spatially-varying Dirac velocity $v(x)$, that can form an approximate lab-based Rindler Hamiltonian describing an observer accelerating in Minkowski spacetime. A sudden switch from a spatially homogeneous velocity ($v(x)$ constant) to a spatially-verying velocity ($v(x)$ inhomogeneous) leads to the phenomenon of particle creation, i.e., an analog Unruh effect. We study the dependence of the analog Unruh effect on the precise form of the velocity profile, finding that while the ideal Unruh effect occurs for $v(x) \propto |x|$, a modified Unruh effect still occurs for more realistic velocity profiles that are linear for $|x|$ smaller than a length scale $\lambda$ and constant for $|x|\gg \lambda$ (such as $v(x)\propto \tanh \big(|x|/\lambda \big)$). We show that the associated particle creation is localized to $|x|\ll \lambda$.</description>

      <title>Impact of dark energy on the structure of neutron stars: The vacuum case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential role of a cosmic vacuum dark component in the properties of neutron stars is investigated. It is assumed that the static, spherically symmetric distribution of matter within neutron stars is supported by two distinct components: ordinary matter and a vacuum fluid. For normal matter we use a set of state-of-the-art nuclear matter equations of state, each grounded in nuclear physics experiments. The vacuum energy component is inhomogeneously distributed within the star and obeys the standard equation of state ($p_v = -\epsilon_v$). This is characterized by an energy density fraction $y = \epsilon_m/ (\epsilon_m + \epsilon_v)$, which we model as either a constant or radius-dependent. Our findings reveal that the inclusion of vacuum energy significantly affects the mass-radius relationships in neutron stars, influencing both the maximum achievable masses and the qualitative form of these relationships. Some constraints from current multimessenger observational data limiting the amount of vacuum energy within neutron stars are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Geometric Linearization for Constraint Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the geometric linearization of constraint Hamiltonian systems using the Jacobi metric and the Eisenhart lift. We establish a connection between linearization and maximally symmetric spacetimes, focusing on the Noether symmetries admitted by the constraint Hamiltonian systems. Specifically, for systems derived from the singular Lagrangian $$ L\left( N,q^{k},\dot{q}^{k}\right) =\frac{1}{2N}g_{ij}\dot{q}^{i}\dot{q}^{j}-NV(q^{k}), $$ where $N$ and $q^{i}$ are dependent variables and $\dim g_{ij}=n$, the existence of $\frac{n\left( n+1\right) }{2}$ Noether symmetries is shown to be equivalent to the linearization of the equations of motion. The application of these results is demonstrated through various examples of special interest. This approach opens new directions in the study of differential equation linearization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considerations of high energies in quantum field theories on smooth manifolds have led to generalized uncertainty principles and the possibility of a physical minimal length in quantum gravitational scenarios. In these models, the minimal length would be a physical limit, not just a mathematical tool, and should be Lorentz invariant. In this paper, we study two-qubit communication and entanglement harvesting in a field subject to a covariant bandlimit (minimum length) and present the changes induced by this bandlimit. We find the bandlimit introduces nonlocality and acausal communication in a manner unlike non-covariant bandlimits or other quantum optical approximations. We also observe that this covariant bandlimit introduces uncertainties in time and temporal ordering with the unusual behavior attributed to the behavior of virtual particles being modified by the covariant cutoff.</description>

      <title>Topological Casimir effect in models with helical compact dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the helical compactification of spatial dimension on the local properties of the vacuum state for a charged scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter. A general background geometry is considered with rotational symmetry in the subspace with the coordinates appearing in the helical periodicity condition. It is shown that by a coordinate transformation the problem is reduced to the problem with standard quasiperiodicity condition in the same local geometry and with the effective compactification radius determined by the length of the compact dimension and the helicity parameter. As an application of the general procedure we have considered locally de Sitter spacetime with a helical compact dimension. By using the Hadamard function for the Bunch-Davies vacuum state, the vacuum expectation values of the field squared, current density, and energy-momentum tensor are studied. The topological contributions are explicitly separated and their asymptotics are described at early and late stages of cosmological expansion. An important difference, compared to the problem with quasiperiodic conditions, is the appearance of the nonzero off-diagonal component of the energy-momentum tensor and of the component of the current density along the uncompact dimension.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the relativistic behavior of spin--half particles possessing an Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) in a curved spacetime background induced by a spiral dislocation. A thorough review of the mathematical formulation of the Dirac spinor in the framework of quantum field theory sets the foundation for our investigation. By deriving the action that governs the interaction between the spinor field, the background spacetime, and an external electric field, we establish a framework to study the dynamics of the system. Solving the resulting wave equation reveals a set of coupled equations for the radial components of the Dirac spinor, which give rise to a modified energy spectrum attributed to the EDM. To validate our findings, we apply them to the geometric phase and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum geodesics reflecting the internal structure of stars composed of shells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general relativity, an external observer cannot distinguish distinct internal structures between two spherically symmetric stars that have the same total mass $M$. However, when quantum corrections are taken into account, the external metrics of the stars will receive quantum corrections depending on their internal structures. In this paper, we obtain the quantum-corrected metrics at linear order in curvature for two spherically symmetric shells characterized by different internal structures: one with an empty interior and the other with $N$ internal shells. The dependence on the internal structures in the corrected metrics tells us that geodesics on these backgrounds would be deformed according to the internal structures. We conduct numerical computations to find out the angle of geodesic precession and show that the presence of internal structures amplifies the precession angle reflecting the discrepancy between the radial and orbital periods within the geodesic orbit. The amount of the precession angle increases monotonically as the number of internal shells increases and it eventually converges to a certain value for $N \to \infty$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the thermodynamic properties of an exact black hole solution obtained in Weyl geometric gravity theory, by considering the simplest conformally invariant action, constructed from the square of the Weyl scalar, and the strength of the Weyl vector only. The action is linearized in the Weyl scalar by introducing an auxiliary scalar field, and thus it can be reformulated as a scalar-vector-tensor theory in a Riemann space, in the presence of a nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar and the scalar field. In static spherical symmetry, this theory admits an exact black hole solution, which generalizes the standard Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution through the presence of two new terms in the metric, having a linear and a quadratic dependence on the radial coordinate, respectively. The solution is obtained by assuming that the Weyl vector has only a radial component. After studying the locations of the event and cosmological horizons of the Weyl geometric black hole, we investigate in detail the thermodynamical (quantum properties) of this type of black holes, by considering the Hawking temperature, the entropy, specific heat and the Helmholtz free energy functions on both the event and the cosmological horizons. The Weyl geometric black holes have thermodynamic properties that clearly differentiate them from similar solutions of other modified gravity theories. The obtained results may lead to the possibility of a better understanding of the properties of the black holes in alternative gravity, and of the relevance of the thermodynamic aspects in black hole physics.</description>

Abstract: A connection is established between transonic sound waves propagating along a de Laval nozzle and quasinormal modes emitted from hairy black holes obtained with the gravitational decoupling method applied to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om geometry. Aerodynamical features provide an analogue setup to experimentally test fluid flow perturbations in a de Laval nozzle producing quasinormal modes. In particular, nozzle shape, pressure, Mach number, temperature, density, and thrust coefficient profiles are determined as functions of the black hole parameters for several multipole numbers. The black hole quasinormal mode frequencies are also investigated for different overtones, evaluating the quality factor of the nozzle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational solitons (gravisolitons) are particular exact solutions of Einstein field equation in vacuum build on a given background solution. Their interpretation is not yet fully clear but they contain many of the physically relevant solutions low $N$-solitons solutions. However, a systematic study and characterization of gravisolitons solution for every $N$ is lacking and their relevance in a theory of quantum gravity is not fully understood. This work aims to investigate and characterize some properties of $N$-axialsoliton solutions such as their asymptotically behaviour and asymptotic symmetries given minimal assumptions on the background metric. We develop an explicit systematic asymptotically expansion for the $N$-axialsoliton solution and we compute the leading order of the asymptotic killing vectors. Moreover, in the perspective to better understand the role of gravisolitons in quantum gravity we make a link, and a one of the first explicit test, to the corner symmetry proposal deriving which subalgebra of the universal corner symmetry algebra is generated by the asymptotic Killing vectors of $N$-axialsoliton solution. In the spirit of the corner proposal, the axialgravisoliton corner symmetry algebra (\textfrak{agcsa}) can be useful for the quantization of the non-asymptotically flat sector of gravity while, in the spirit of IR triangle, new soft theorems and memory effects could emerge.</description>

      <title>Gravity Rainbow Effects on Higher Curvature Modification of R2 inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study several extensions of the higher curvature modification of $R^{2}$ inflation in the context of gravity's rainbow. We modify the $(R+R^{2})$ model by adding an $f_{1}R^3$-term, an $f_{2}R^4$-term, and an $f_{3}R^{3/2}$-term to the original model. We calculate the inflationary observables and confront them using the latest observational bounds from Planck 2018 data. We assume the rainbow function of the form $\tilde{f}=1+\left(\frac{H}{M}\right)^{\lambda }$ with $\lambda$ being a rainbow parameter and $M$ a mass-dimensional parameter. We demonstrate that the power spectrum of curvature perturbation relies on the dimensionless coefficient $f_{i},\,i=1,2,3$, a rainbow parameter $\lambda$ and a ratio $H/M$. Likewise, the scalar spectral index $n_s$ is affected by both $f_{i}$ and the rainbow parameter. Moreover, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is solely determined by the rainbow parameter. Interestingly, by ensuring that $n_s$ aligns with the Planck collaboration's findings at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, the tensor-to-scalar ratio could reach up to $r\sim 0.01$, which is possibly measurable for detection in forthcoming Stage IV CMB ground experiments and is certainly feasible for future dedicated space missions.</description>

      <title>Black hole in a generalized Chaplygin-Jacobi dark fluid: shadow and light deflection angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a generalized Chaplygin-like gas with an anisotropic equation of state, characterizing a dark fluid within which a static spherically symmetric black hole is assumed. By solving the Einstein equations for this black hole spacetime, we explicitly derive the metric function. The spacetime is parametrized by two critical parameters, $\mathcal{B}$ and $\alpha$, which measure the deviation from the Schwarzschild black hole and the extent of the dark fluid's anisotropy, respectively. We explore the behavior of light rays in the vicinity of the black hole by calculating its shadow and comparing our results with the Event Horizon Telescope observations. This comparison constrains the parameters to $0 \leq \mathcal{B} &lt; 0.03$ and $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 0.1$. Additionally, we calculate the deflection angles to determine the extent to which light is bent by the black hole. These calculations are further utilized to formulate possible Einstein rings, estimating the angular radius of the rings to be approximately $37.6\,\mathrm{\mu as}$. Throughout this work, we present analytical solutions wherever feasible, and employ reliable approximations where necessary to provide comprehensive insights into the spacetime characteristics and their observable effects.</description>

Abstract: Bosonic stars represent a hypothetical exotic type of compact stellar objects that could be observed from the gravitational signal of coalescing binaries in current and future gravitational wave detectors. There are two main families of bosonic stars, which depend on the nature that governs the particles that build them: Einstein-Klein-Gordon and Proca Stars. We study the multipolar structure for both families of rotating objects, using realistic potentials with the aim of finding possible universal relations and, thus, a method that allows us to distinguish between these and other compact objects in the gravitational wave paradigm. We also show how certain relevant observables can be obtained for these hypothetical but well-motivated astrophysical objects.</description>

Abstract: Mergers of binary neutron stars (BNSs) emit signals in both the gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) spectra. Famously, the 2017 multi-messenger observation of GW170817 led to scientific discoveries across cosmology, nuclear physics, and gravity. Central to these results were the sky localization and distance obtained from GW data, which, in the case of GW170817, helped to identify the associated EM transient, AT 2017gfo, 11 hours after the GW signal. Fast analysis of GW data is critical for directing time-sensitive EM observations; however, due to challenges arising from the length and complexity of signals, it is often necessary to make approximations that sacrifice accuracy. Here, we present a machine learning framework that performs complete BNS inference in just one second without making any such approximations. Our approach enhances multi-messenger observations by providing (i) accurate localization even before the merger; (ii) improved localization precision by $\sim30\%$ compared to approximate low-latency methods; and (iii) detailed information on luminosity distance, inclination, and masses, which can be used to prioritize expensive telescope time. Additionally, the flexibility and reduced cost of our method open new opportunities for equation-of-state studies. Finally, we demonstrate that our method scales to extremely long signals, up to an hour in length, thus serving as a blueprint for data analysis for next-generation ground- and space-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Shadow of a Renormalization Group Improved Regular Rotating Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study on quantum gravity effects on the shadow of a regular rotating black hole (BH) obtained in the setting of the asymptotic safety (AS) gravity. We show that the rotating metric, which results from a static regular one recently presented in the literature, remains regular after being constructed using the generalized Newman-Janis (NJ) algorithm.. The novelty of the static regular metric lies in the fact that it is the outcome of an effective Lagrangian which describes dust whose spherically symmetric collapse is non-singular as a consequence of the antiscreening character of gravity at small distances. The effective Lagrangian includes a multiplicative coupling, denoted as chi, with the Lagrangian of the collapsing fluid. The resulting exterior metric for large radii depends on a free parameter xi which captures the quantum gravity effects. The form of the coupling chi and its connection with the quantum parameter xi are determined by the running of the Newton coupling G(k) along a renormalization group trajectory that stops at the ultraviolet (UV) non-gaussian fixed point of the AS theory. Varying both the spin parameter a/M and the quantum parameter xi, we explore the quantum gravity effects on several astronomical observables used to describe the shadow features of rotating BHs. In order to obtain constraints on the parameter xi, we confront our results with the recent EHT observations of the shadows of the supermassive BHs M87 and Sgr A. We find that the ranges of variation of all the studied shadow observables fall entirely within the ranges determined by the EHT collaboration. We then conclude that the current astronomical data do not rule out the renormalization group improved regular rotating BH.</description>

Abstract: Force-Free Electrodynamics (FFE) describes magnetically dominated relativistic plasma via non-linear equations for the electromagnetic field alone. Such plasma is thought to play a key role in the physics of pulsars and active black holes. Despite its simple covariant formulation, FFE has primarily been studied in 3+1 frameworks, where spacetime is split into space and time. In this article we systematically develop the theory of force-free magnetospheres taking a spacetime perspective. Using a suite of spacetime tools and techniques (notably exterior calculus) we cover 1) the basics of the theory, 2) exact solutions that demonstrate the extraction and transport of the rotational energy of a compact object (in the case of a black hole, the Blandford-Znajek mechanism), 3) the behavior of current sheets, 4) the general theory of stationary, axisymmetric magnetospheres and 5) general properties of pulsar and black hole magnetospheres. We thereby synthesize, clarify and generalize known aspects of the physics of force-free magnetospheres, while also introducing several new results.</description>

      <title>Black Hole from Entropy Maximization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00602v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One quantum characterization of a black hole motivated by (local) holography and thermodynamics is that it maximizes thermodynamic entropy for a given surface area. In the context of quantum gravity, this could be more fundamental than the classical characterization by a horizon. As a step, we explore this possibility by solving the 4D semi-classical Einstein equation with many matter fields, and find a picture of a black hole. For spherical static highly-excited configurations, we apply local typicality and estimate the entropy including self-gravity to derive its upper bound. The saturation condition uniquely determines the entropy-maximized configuration: self-gravitating quanta condensate into a radially-uniform dense configuration with no horizon, where the self-gravity and a large quantum pressure induced by the curvatures are balanced and no singularity appears. The interior metric is a self-consistent and non-perturbative solution for Planck's constant. The maximum entropy, given by the volume integral of the entropy density, agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula through self-gravity, deriving the Bousso bound for thermodynamic entropy. Finally, 10 future prospects are discussed, leading to the speculative view that the configuration represents semi-classically a quantum-gravitational condensate with holographic bulk dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We present and investigate two issues within the measurement scheme for QFT presented by J. Polo-G\'omez, L. J. Garay and E. Mart\'in-Mart\'inez in "A detector-based measurement theory for quantum field theory". We point out some discrepancies that arise when the measurement scheme is applied to contextual field states and show that $n$-point function assignments based on local processing regions sometimes lead to inconsistencies. To solve these issues, we modify the measurement scheme to use non-relativistic detectors to induce an update rule for algebraic states in the Haag-Kastler formulation of quantum field theory. In this way, $n$-point functions can be consistently evaluated across any region having a definite causal relation with measurements.</description>

      <title>Inflation with vector fields revisited: heavy entropy perturbations and primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit inflation coupled with vector fields employing kinetic coupling in the comoving gauge. It is known that there is a cumulative effect $\tilde{I}N^2$ on curvature power spectrum. For a large number of e-foldings $N$, this contribution is so significant that it could violate observational constraints when the ratio of kinetic energy between vector fields and inflaton $\tilde{I}$ is not extremely small. In this paper, we explore the regime where $\tilde{I}\gg 1$, a realm that has not been extensively explored due to the limitations of perturbative methods. We found that the entropy perturbation becomes heavy in this regime and the cumulative effect decays away on super-horizon scales. Consequently, the power spectrum retains its scale invariance in the decoupling limit. By straightforwardly integrating out the heavy modes near horizon-crossing, we derive a low-energy effective field theory describing a massless adiabatic perturbation with an imaginary speed of sound $c_s^2= -1/3$. Namely, the inflation with vector fields presents a potential mechanism for generating primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects in gravity beyond the Newton potential from a delocalised quantum source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in table-top experiments offers the opportunity to show for the first time that gravity is not compatible with a classical description. In all current experimental proposals, such as the generation of gravitationally induced entanglement between two quantum sources of gravity, gravitational effects can be explained with the Newton potential, namely in a regime that is consistent with the weak-field limit of general relativity and does not probe the field nature of gravity. Hence, the Newtonian origin of the effects is a limitation to the conclusions on the nature of gravity that can be drawn from these experiments.
  Here, we identify two effects that overcome this limitation: they cannot be reproduced using the Newton potential and are independent of graviton emission. First, we show that the interaction between two generic quantum sources of gravity, e.g. in wide Gaussian states, cannot be reproduced with the Newton potential nor with a known classical theory or gravity. Hence, observing the form of this interaction would require either a modification to classical gravity or its quantum description. Second, we show that the quantum commutator between the gravitational field and its canonically conjugate momentum appears as an additional term in the relative phase of a generic quantum source interacting with a test particle. Observing this term in the phase would be a test of the gravitational field as a quantum mediator.
  Identifying stronger quantum aspects of gravity than those reproducible with the Newton potential is crucial to prove the nonclassicality of the gravitational field and to plan a new generation of experiments testing quantum aspects of gravity in a broader sense than what proposed so far.</description>

      <title>A non-Perturbative and Background-Independent Formulation of Quadratic Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A non-perturbative and background-independent quantum formulation of quadratic gravity is provided. A canonical quantization procedure introduced in previous works, named after Dirac and Pauli, is here applied to quadratic gravity to obtain, as required by consistency, a well-defined Euclidean path integral. The theory is unitary: all probabilities are non negative and they sum up to one. We obtain path-integral expressions for the transition amplitudes, Green's functions and generic matrix elements of time-ordered products of the metric. As a byproduct, similar results are also obtained for a scalar-field four-derivative interacting model. In this way, among other things, previous perturbative and background-dependent calculations are justified. The (quantum) quadratic gravity effective action, whose field equations determine the vacuum expectation value of the metric in the presence of a generic energy-momentum tensor, is constructed. The classical limit of the effective action turns out to be equivalent to the starting classical action of quadratic gravity, whose runaway rates were previously shown to be slow enough to be compatible with observations. Finally, the constructed non-perturbative and background-independent quantum quadratic gravity is applied to quantum cosmology to obtain a path-integral expression for the wave function of the universe, which satisfies a sort of Wheeler-DeWitt equation. This application allows us to understand at the quantum level why our universe is nearly homogeneous and isotropic.</description>

      <title>Unimodular Quadratic Gravity and the Cosmological Constant</title>

Abstract: Unimodular gravity addresses the old cosmological constant (CC) problem, explaining why such constant is not at least as large as the largest particle mass scale, but classically it is indistinguishable from ordinary gravity. Conversely, quantum physics may give us a way to distinguish the two theories. Thus, here the unimodular constraint is imposed on a non-perturbative and background-independent quantum version of quadratic gravity, which was recently formulated. It is shown that unimodularity does lead to different predictions for some inflationary quantum observables. Unimodular gravity per se does not solves the new CC problem (why the CC has the observed value?) even in this realization. To address this issue a multiverse made by different eras in a single big bang is considered and the observed scale of dark energy is explained anthropically.</description>

      <title>Neutron-quark stars: Discerning viable alternatives for the higher-density part of the equation of state of compact stars</title>

Abstract: By taking into account the latest observations and theoretical constraints, we investigate the merger and post-merger of binary neutron stars (NSs) with general-relativistic numerical simulations employing hadronic and hybrid equations of state (EOSs). We name our hybrid stars neutron-quark stars (NQS), because the transition from hadrons to quarks starts at a density lower than the central density of $\sim 1 M_{\odot}$ stars. We address two viable scenarios for the transition to quark matter: a crossover or a strong first-order phase transition (1PT). We find that a crossover transition is in principle observable when both the inspiral and post-merger signals are detected because the post-merger gravitational-wave (GW) main frequency $f_2$ is generally lower than that of hadronic models with the same tidal deformability ($\Lambda$). Since it is viable according to current multi-messenger constraints, we also highlight the possibility of an EOS with a strong 1PT that takes place at 1.8 times the nuclear saturation density, with a stiff quark EOS after the transition. It is the first time that mergers of binary NQSs with a deconfined quark-matter core are studied numerically in full general relativity. In this case, although ($\Lambda$, compactness) lies significantly outside the hadronic relation, ($\Lambda$, $f_2$) is close to the relation valid for hadronic EOSs. We also point out a linear correlation, valid within the observational constraints and not sensitive to the presence of a hadron-quark transition, between the emitted energy in GWs and their frequency.</description>
