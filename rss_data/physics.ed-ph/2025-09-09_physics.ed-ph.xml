      <title>Teaching STEM Courses using Ignatian Pedagogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the impact of the Jesuit educational endeavor on the rise of science, the Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm (IPP), the signature Jesuit pedagogy, is not frequently used to teach courses in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), and very little literature exists documenting any such attempts. In this paper, I describe a framework for how to apply the IPP to STEM courses using active-engagement strategies and assessment tools from disciplinary educational research (DBER). I provide three examples of how I have implemented the IPP in physics courses at various levels in the curriculum at a Jesuit University complete with assessment results that demonstrate student learning. I stress that beyond the technical, cyclical elements of the IPP, a truly Ignatian course needs to pay close attention to Jesuit charisms such as cura personalis, magis, and educating men and women with and for others.</description>

      <title>A Compact Two-Dimensional Radiation Detector for Educational Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in low-cost, portable cosmic-ray detectors have broadened citizen-science engagement in particle physics studies. Imaging applications such as muography, however, remain largely inaccessible because existing detectors typically require tens to hundreds of sensors, making them costly and complex. This gap underscores the need for a compact imaging detector.
  In this study, we developed SAKURA, a palm-sized two-dimensional muon scintillation detector that uses only four silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) and can be built for less than 1,000 USD. Its spatial resolution was evaluated using a 5 GeV/c muon beam at CERN's T10 beamline in September 2024, yielding 13.4 mm along the x-axis and 7.48 mm along the y-axis. The entire study, including designing and testing the detector, and analysing data, was undertaken by high school students, demonstrating that SAKURA makes radiation imaging accessible and practical even for non-specialists with the help of some professional scientists.</description>

      <title>Women in Physics in the United Kingdom: A Review of Recent Policy and Initiatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Across the United Kingdom, initiatives designed to increase the participation and outcomes for women in physics continue, working with children of various ages as well as with adults. Improvements have been achieved by a combination of these initiatives and an accompanying strengthening of policy, but significant gender imbalances remain.</description>

      <title>The Reciprocal Velocity Force of a Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reciprocal velocity force, $F(v)=\frac{C}{v}$, despite its theoretical and practical importance, is often neglected in mechanics courses. We use graphical methods to explain how such a force naturally arises from a device called a transmission, and discuss the kinematic consequences of this force. As an application, we discuss the role of this force for both internal combustion engines and electric vehicles.</description>

      <title>Constructing a Photonic Implementation of Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) stands as a revolutionary approach to secure communication, using the principles of quantum mechanics to establish unbreakable channels. Unlike traditional cryptography, which relies on the computational difficulty of mathematical problems, QKD utilizes the inherent properties of quantum states to achieve information-theoretic security. This means that the security of the key exchange is guaranteed by the laws of physics, making it theoretically unbreakable even by an adversary with unlimited computational power. Currently, one of the most viable ways to implement QKD for communication is via photonics, namely, using phase-preserving long-distance optical fibers. The objective of this project is to implement photonic QKD in a laboratory setting. This will help demonstrate the protocol's robustness and provide a feasible implementation for educational demonstrations.</description>
