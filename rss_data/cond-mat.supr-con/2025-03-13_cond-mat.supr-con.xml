      <title>Many-body effects of two-level systems in superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits are often adversely affected by two-level systems (TLSs) within the Josephson junction, which contribute to decoherence and subsequently limit the performance of the qubit. By treating the TLS as a soft (i.e., low-frequency) bosonic mode localized in real space, we find that a single TLS in either the amorphous oxide surface or the superconducting bulk may result in a localized "hot spot" of amplified Josephson energy. Such amplification is shown to have a non-negligible effect on the $T_1$ time of certain superconducting qubits, regardless of whether or not the TLS is on resonance with the qubit frequency. With this study, we identify sources of decoherence unique to the superconducting element of superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Collective mode spectroscopy in time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) superconductors show a rich collective mode spectrum. In general, collective excitations in superconductors can provide crucial information on the symmetry of the broken phase, in particular, serving as a fingerprint for determining the groundstate gap symmetry. In this work, we consider several even parity two-dimensional TRSB superconductors characterized by an order parameter of the form $\Delta = \Delta_1 + i\Delta_2$. We provide a classification scheme of the collective excitations in the above systems as a function of the ratio between the components $\Delta_1/\Delta_2$. In order to excite the modes in the systems we have adopted two different probes: a quench of the condensate symmetry and a finite momentum transfer induced by an external electric field. Both methods allow us to excite and characterize the different modes in the spectra. To further interpret the results of the numerical calculations we provide a Ginzburg-Landau analysis and we construct a dynamical theory, deriving the linearized equations of motion in the pseudospin formalism. Our results could help distinguish between different order parameters symmetries of a TRSB superconducting condensate and estimate the magnitude of its different components.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic low-temperature magnetic properties on the ultra-clean UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}$ = 2.1 K revealed by $^{125}$Te NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09109v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the intrinsic magnetic properties of UTe$_2$, we performed $^{125}$Te-NMR measurements on the ultra-clean single-crystalline UTe$_2$ with superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ = 2.1~K and compared the results with those of the $T_{\rm c}$ = 1.6~K sample. The broadening of the linewidth of the NMR spectrum in the $a$-axis magnetic field and the low-temperature magnetic fluctuations observed in the 1.6~K sample are suppressed in the ultra-clean sample, indicating that such magnetic properties originate from a tiny amount of U deficiency. The present results suggest that the magnetic properties in UTe$_2$ are sensitive to the U deficiency. We also observed a peculiar angular dependence of the NMR quantities due to large magnetic anisotropy with the $a$-axis as the magnetic easy axis.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale spin ordering and spin screening effects in tunnel ferromagnetic Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Josephson junctions (MJJs) have emerged as a prominent playground to explore the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. A series of fascinating experiments have revealed striking phenomena at the Superconductor/Ferromagnet (S/F) interface, pointing to tunable phase transitions and to the generation of unconventional spin-triplet correlations. Here, we show that the Josephson effect, being sensitive to phase space variation on the nanoscale, allows a direct observation of the spin polarization of the S/F interface. By measuring the temperature dependence of the Josephson magnetic field patterns of tunnel MJJs with strong and thin F-layer, we demonstrate an induced nanoscale spin order in S along the superconducting coherence length at S/F interface, i.e., the inverse proximity effect, with the first evidence of full spin screening at very low temperatures, as expected by the theory. A comprehensive phase diagram for spin nanoscale ordering regimes at S/F interfaces in MJJs has been derived in terms of the magnetic moment induced in the S-layer. Our findings contribute to drive the design and the tailoring of S/F interfaces also in view of potential applications in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Cooperation and competing of antipolar charge order and superconducting states in a quasi-2D superatomic metallic crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09216v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring various unexpected new quantum states and their corresponding extraordinary physics in low dimensional quantum materials, and investing them into application fields, is a primary concern of condensed matter physics. Previously, we performed joint experiments and theoretical calculations to investigate a superatomic crystal of Au6Te12Se8 with low symmetry, which stacks through non-covalent inter-cube quasi-bonds. Au6Te12Se8 exhibits a triple-cube charge density wave and spatially polarized metallic states interweaving at 9 K. In addition, it undergoes a BKT phase transition at 2.8 K to form a quasi-two-dimensional superconducting state. The subsequent high-pressure experimental results indicate that the two quantum states above compete with superconductivity. Here, we experimentally revealed competition and coexistence among superconductivity, triple-cube charge density waves, and polarized metallic states during further temperature-decreasing process, as examined using ultra-low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, transport measurement, and Raman spectra. An extraordinary inversion symmetry broken emerged inside the triple-cube-period of the original CDW at 300 mK, leading to the polarized metallic states transforming into parallel polarization states. The evidence of spontaneous polarization coexisting with superconductivity in real space is extremely rare and has been revealed by STM. In addition, transport and Raman measurements indicate that there are multiple phase transition temperatures from 80K to that below the superconducting transition temperature of Au6Te12Se8, which may also contain more unknown exotic quantum states, providing a platform for further exploration of intriguing physical properties.</description>

      <title>Contrasting $c$-axis and in-plane uniaxial stress effects on superconductivity and stripe order in La$_{1.885}$Ba$_{0.115}$CuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cuprate superconductor La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$ (LBCO) near $x=0.125$ is a striking example of intertwined electronic orders, where 3D superconductivity is anomalously suppressed, allowing spin and charge stripe order to develop, in a manner consistent with the emergence of a pair-density-wave (PDW) state. Understanding this interplay remains a key challenge in cuprates, highlighting the necessity of external tuning for deeper insight. While in-plane (within the CuO plane) uniaxial stress enhances superconductivity and suppresses stripe order, the effects of $c$-axis compression (perpendicular to the CuO plane) remains largely unexplored. Here, we use muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) and AC susceptibility with an in situ piezoelectric stress device to investigate the spin-stripe order and superconductivity in LBCO-0.115 under $c$-axis compression. The measurements reveal a gradual suppression of the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) with increasing $c$-axis stress, in stark contrast to the strong enhancement observed under in-plane stress. We further show that while in-plane stress rapidly reduces both the magnetic volume fraction ($V_{\rm m}$) and the spin-stripe ordering temperature ($T_{\rm so}$), $c$-axis compression has no effect, with $V_{\rm m}$ and $T_{\rm so}$ exhibiting an almost unchanged behavior up to the highest applied stress of 0.21 GPa. These findings demonstrate a strong anisotropy in stress response, underscoring the critical role of crystallographic anisotropy in governing competing electronic phases in LBCO.</description>

      <title>Topography of Fermi Arcs in t-PtBi$_2$ Using High Resolution Angle-resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use high resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the electronic structure of trigonal phase ${\rm PtBi_2}$ (t-${\rm PtBi_2}$), a proposed Weyl semimetal that is expected to exhibit topological Fermi Arcs. Our ARPES data elucidates the topography of these objects and confirms their Fermi arc character. The arcs are formed by surface bands that have fairly flat bottom located very close to the chemical potential $\sim$ 6-8 meV, before they merge with bulk bands at higher binding energy. Comparison of the ARPES data with DFT calculations shows good agreement about their location and topography. Data acquired at low temperatures does not show any signatures of superconductivity down to 3 K in terms of expected changes in dispersion due to formation of Bogoliubov quasiparticles or superconducting gap in form of reliable shifts of peaks in energy distribution curves.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Interferometric single-shot parity measurement in InAs-Al hybrid devices", Microsoft Quantum, Nature 638, 651-655 (2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the 'parity readout' of a (topological) superconductor claimed in Nature 638, 651-655 (2025). A prerequisite for this claim is the existence of a superconducting gap in the nanowire device. However, to determine the presence of a gap, Nature 638, 651-655 (2025) relied on the so-called topological gap protocol (TGP). Here, we show that the TGP can report the regions where the 'parity readout' occurred as either gapped or gapless, depending on data parameters such as magnetic field range and cutter pair (junction transparency). Compounding these issues are inaccuracies in the presented TGP outcomes, which limited investigation of reproducibility. Since these inconsistent outcomes demonstrate that the TGP is not a reliable diagnostic tool for the presence of a superconducting gap, we instead investigate the conductance data for the studied regions -- data that were not presented in Nature 638, 651-655 (2025), but are in the public data repository. These conductance data show that the regions where 'parity readout' occurred are in fact highly disordered and present no clear gap in the nanowire, i.e., the underlying conductance data show that these regions are indeed gapless. That these regions are gapless contradicts the claim that the reported measurements are of the parity of a superconducting nanowire, let alone the parity of a topological superconducting nanowire. Taken together, these issues mean that the core findings in Nature 638, 651-655 (2025) are not reliable and should be revisited.</description>

      <title>Correlated quasiparticle poisoning from phonon-only events in superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Throughout multiple cooldowns we observe a power-law reduction in time for the rate of multi-qubit correlated poisoning events, while the rate of shifts in qubit offset-charge remains constant; evidence of a non-ionizing source of pair-breaking phonon bursts for superconducting qubits. We investigate different types of sample packaging, some of which are sensitive to mechanical impacts from the cryocooler pulse tube. One possible source of these events comes from relaxation of thermally-induced stresses from differential thermal contraction between the device layer and substrate.</description>

      <title>Interplay of electron-phonon coupling, pseudogap, and superconductivity in CsCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ studied using ultrafast optical spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasiparticle relaxation dynamics of the iron-based superconductor CsCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ ($T_c$ $\sim$ 29 K) were investigated using ultrafast optical spectroscopy. A pseudogap ($\Delta_{PG}$ $\approx$ 3.3 meV) was observed to open below $T^{\ast}$ $\approx$ 60 K, prior to the emergence of a superconducting gap ($\Delta$ $\approx$ 6.6 $\pm$ 0.4 meV). At high excitation fluence, a coherent A1g phonon mode at 5.49 THz was identified, exhibiting deviations from anharmonic behavior below $T_c$. The electron-phonon coupling constant for this mode was estimated to be $\lambda_{A_{1g}}$ $\approx$ 0.23. These results provide insights into the interplay between the electron-phonon interactions, pseudogap, and the superconducting pairing mechanism in CsCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$.</description>

Abstract: We study theoretically the thermoelectric effect in a superconducting state having the Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces which stays in a thin superconducting layer between a conventional superconductor and an insulator. The thermoelectric coefficients calculated based on the linear response theory show the remarkable anisotropy in real space, which are explained well by the anisotropic shape of the Bogoliubov-Fermi surface in momentum space. Our results indicate a way to check the existence of the Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces in a stable superconducting state because the anisotropy is controlled by the direction of an applied magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of \emph{interlayer} interaction terms in the competition between different superconducting gap symmetries in the bilayer nickelate $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ under high pressure. We study a two-layer, two-orbital electron model that encompasses both intra- and interlayer Coulomb interaction terms within the matrix random-phase approximation. We find that interlayer interactions favor a $d_{xy}$-wave superconducting pairing symmetry over the $s^{\pm}$-wave symmetry, which has been found to prevail when interlayer interactions are disregarded. Moreover, our findings indicate that interlayer interactions enhance the interorbital pairing, incorporating contributions from all three electron pockets, arising from both $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital character, resulting in nodes within the gap function (not present in the $s^{\pm}$-wave state) and consequently favoring the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strange metals develop near quantum critical points in a variety of strongly correlated systems. Some of the issues that are central to the field include how the quantum-critical state loses quasiparticles, how it drives superconductivity, and to what extent the strange-metal physics in different classes of correlated systems are interconnected. In this Review, we survey some of these issues from the vantage point of heavy fermion metals. We will describe the notion of Kondo destruction and how it leads to several crucial effects. These include a transformation of the Fermi surface from large to small when the system is tuned across the quantum-critical point, a loss of quasiparticles everywhere on the Fermi surface when it is perched at the quantum-critical point, and a dynamical Planckian scaling in various physical properties including charge responses. We close with a discussion about the connections between the strange-metal physics in heavy fermion metals and its counterparts in the cuprates and other correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Quantization Condition of the Bound States in $n$th-order Schr\"{o}dinger equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a general approximate quantization rule $ \int_{L_{E}}^{R_{E}}k_0(x)$ $dx=(N+\frac{1}{2})\pi $ or $ \oint k_0(x)$ $dx=(2N+1)\pi $ (including both forward and backward processes) for the bound states in the potential well of the $n$th-order Schr\"{o}dinger equations $ e^{-i\pi n/2}{{}\frac{d^n\Psi(x)}{d x^n} } =[E-{} V(x)]\Psi(x) ,$ where ${} k_0(x)=(E-V(x) )^{1/n}$ with $N\in\mathbb{N}_{0} $, $n$ is an even natural number, and $L_{E}$ and $R_{E}$ the boundary points between the classically forbidden regions and the allowed region. The only hypothesis is that all exponentially growing components are negligible, which is appropriate for not narrow wells. Applications including the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Globally driven superconducting quantum computing architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a platform for implementing a universal, globally driven quantum computer based on a 2D ladder hosting three different species of superconducting qubits. In stark contrast with the existing literature, our scheme exploits the always-on longitudinal ZZ coupling. The latter, combined with specific driving frequencies, enables the reach of a blockade regime, which plays a pivotal role in the computing scheme.</description>

      <title>DFT+DMFT study of correlated electronic structure in the monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By preforming DFT+DMFT calculations, we systematically investigate the correlated electronic structure in the newly discovered monolayer-trilayer (ML-TL) phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La327). Our calculated Fermi surfaces are in good agreement with the result of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We find that 1313-La327 is a multiorbital correlated metal. An orbital-selective Mott behavior is found in ML in our zero- and finite-temperature calculations. The ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits a Mott behavior, while the ML Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is metallic due to self-doping. We also find a large static local spin susceptibility of ML Ni, suggesting that there is large spin fluctuation in 1313-La327. The TL Ni-$e_g$ orbitals possess similar electronic correlation to those in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The $e_g$ orbitals of the outer-layer Ni in TL show non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Besides, large weight of high-spin states are found in TL-outer Ni and ML Ni, implying Hundness. Under 16 GPa, a Lifshitz transition is revealed by our calculations and a La-related band crosses the Fermi level. Our work provides a theoretical reference for studying other potential mixed-stacked nickelate superconductors.</description>
