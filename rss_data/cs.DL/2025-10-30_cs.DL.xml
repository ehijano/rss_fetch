      <title>Measuring the Research Output and Performance of the University of Ibadan from 2014 to 2023: A Scientometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs scientometric methods to assess the research output and performance of the University of Ibadan from 2014 to 2023. By analyzing publication trends, citation patterns, and collaboration networks, the research aims to comprehensively evaluate the university's research productivity, impact, and disciplinary focus. This article's endeavors are characterized by innovation, interdisciplinary collaboration, and commitment to excellence, making the University of Ibadan a significant hub for cutting-edge research in Nigeria and beyond. The goal of the current study is to ascertain the influence of the university's research output and publication patterns between 2014 and 2023. The study focuses on the departments at the University of Ibadan that contribute the most, the best journals for publishing, the nations that collaborate, the impact of citations both locally and globally, well-known authors and their total production, and the research output broken down by year. According to the university's ten-year publication data, 7159 papers with an h-index of 75 were published between 2014 and 2023, garnering 218572 citations. Furthermore, the VOSviewer software mapping approach is used to illustrate the stenographical mapping of data through graphs. The findings of this study will contribute to understanding the university's research strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement. Additionally, the results will inform evidence-based decision-making for enhancing research strategies and policies at the University of Ibadan.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Search for Large-Scale Map Collections with ColPali</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal approaches have shown great promise for searching and navigating digital collections held by libraries, archives, and museums. In this paper, we introduce map-RAS: a retrieval-augmented search system for historic maps. In addition to introducing our framework, we detail our publicly-hosted demo for searching 101,233 map images held by the Library of Congress. With our system, users can multimodally query the map collection via ColPali, summarize search results using Llama 3.2, and upload their own collections to perform inter-collection search. We articulate potential use cases for archivists, curators, and end-users, as well as future work with our system in both machine learning and the digital humanities. Our demo can be viewed at: http://www.mapras.com.</description>
