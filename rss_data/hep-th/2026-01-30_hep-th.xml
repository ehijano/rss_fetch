      <title>Resource-Theoretic Quantifiers of Weak and Strong Symmetry Breaking: Strong Entanglement Asymmetry and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying how much a quantum state breaks a symmetry is essential for characterizing phases, nonequilibrium dynamics, and open-system behavior. Quantum resource theory provides a rigorous operational framework to define and characterize such quantifiers of symmetry-breaking. As a starter, we exemplify the usefulness of resource theory by noting that second-R\'enyi entanglement asymmetry can increase under symmetric operations, and hence is not a resource monotone, and should not solely be used to capture Quantum Mpemba effect. More importantly, motivated by mixed-state physics where weak and strong symmetries are inequivalent, we formulate a new resource theory tailored to strong symmetry, identifying free states and strong-covariant operations. This framework systematically identifies quantifiers of strong symmetry breaking for a broad class of symmetry groups, including a strong entanglement asymmetry. A particularly transparent structure emerges for U(1) symmetry, where the resource theory for the strong symmetry breaking has a completely parallel structure to the entanglement theory: the variance of the conserved quantity fully characterizes the asymptotic manipulation of strong symmetry breaking. By connecting this result to the knowledge of the geometry of quantum state space, we obtain a quantitative framework to track how weak symmetry breaking is irreversibly converted into strong symmetry breaking in open quantum systems. We further propose extensions to generalized symmetries and illustrate the qualitative impact of strong symmetry breaking in analytically tractable QFT examples and applications.</description>

      <title>Quiver-Invariant Dualities between Brane Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study pairs of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories that share the same vacuum moduli space and the same chiral field content, encoded by a common quiver, but differ in their superpotentials. These theories arise as worldvolume theories on a D3-brane probing a toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold and admit a description in terms of bipartite graphs on a 2-torus, known as brane tilings. Using an explicit example, we show that the correspondence is realized by a single `tilting' mutation along the diagonals of hexagonal faces in the brane tiling, which is equivalent to a specific sequence of Seiberg dualities performed at distinct gauge nodes in the quiver.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Safety in Generalized Proca Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Proca Theories are the most general higher-derivative extensions of a massive vector field that retain second-order equations of motion. They are phenomenologically interesting as models of dynamical dark energy that, unlike scalar-tensor theories, can naturally accommodate cosmological anisotropies. A key open question is whether such theories can be fundamental. As a first step in this direction, we investigate whether they admit an ultraviolet completion within a quantum field theory framework, working with a truncation comprising up to four powers of the Proca field and up to two derivatives. We find a triplet of non-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed points, that lie very close to one another. Only one of them features a non-tachyonic Proca mass and could thus serve as a consistent ultraviolet completion for Generalized Proca Theories. We name it the Proca fixed point. We discuss its stability and contrast its features with those of the standard Reuter fixed point of the asymptotic safety scenario for quantum gravity and matter. In particular, we show that the Gaussian and Reuter fixed points lie on singular hypersurfaces of the flow of Generalized Proca Theories, yet can act as quasi-fixed points in certain regimes.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic structure of massive scalar fields in $\text{(A)dS}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar field theories in $\text{(A)dS}_{2}$ with integer scaling dimensions $\Delta = k+1$ are characterised by the existence of a pair of (anti-)holomorphic higher-spin currents. We explore the consequences of this to describe their quantisation and subsets of their linear and non-linear symmetries, taking care to treat $\text{AdS}_{2}$ and $\text{dS}_{2}$ separately. In particular, we point out that the theories admit mode expansions reminiscent of standard two-dimensional conformal field theories in complex coordinates, with which we are able to construct operators implementing global conformal and Virasoro symmetry. We further leverage holomorphicity of the currents to show that the full set of symmetries of theories with $k&gt;0$ is captured by a chiral algebra, which is a subalgebra of the one in the $k=0$ (massless) theory. This allows us to identify integrable deformations for $k \in \{0,1,2\}$. We finally observe that a lack of integrable deformations for $k&gt;2$ is a consequence of a known conjecture.</description>

      <title>Spectral Form Factor of Gapped Random Matrix Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the spectral form factor of random matrix models which exhibit a large number of degenerate ground states accompanied by a macroscopic gap in the spectrum. The central aim of this work is to understand how the standard narrative about the behavior of the spectral form factor is modified in the presence of these parametrically large number of ground states. We show that, at sufficiently low temperatures, the spectral form factor is dominated by the disconnected contribution, even at arbitrarily late times. Moreover, we demonstrate that the connected form factor only depends on the eigenvalues of the non-degenerate sector. Using the Christoffel-Darboux kernel, we analyze a number of examples including the Bessel model and $\mathcal{N}=2$ Jackiw-Teitelboim supergravity. In these examples, we find damped oscillations in the disconnected form factor, with a period set by the inverse size of the gap. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the slope of the ramp in the connected form factor arises from a universal sine-kernel, which emerges from a truncation of the full non-perturbative kernel in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit, and find agreement with the leading double trumpet result. Finally, we present predictions for how the ramp will transition to a plateau in the connected form factor and demonstrate how the transition depends on the details of the leading spectral density of states.</description>

      <title>The Tensionless Lives of Null Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tensionless limit probes the very high energy regime of string theory in contrast to the well studied point-particle limit which reduces to Einstein gravity. Tensionless strings sweep out null worldsheets in the target space and hence are also called null strings. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of tensionless null string theory beginning with the initial work of Schild, and continuing to the foundational work of Isberg et al (ILST) and then focussing on developments in the past decade.
  Recent work centres on the emergence of the Carrollian Conformal Algebra as residual worldsheet symmetries of the ILST action and the identification of tensionless limit as a worldsheet Carrollian limit on the string worldsheet. Carrollian structures are used to address the classical and quantum aspects of the null string. In the classical theory, the aforementioned limit agrees with the analysis from the ILST action. Symmetries, constraints, mode expansions computed from both perspectives match nicely providing a robust cross-check of the analyses. We discuss closed and open null strings as well as their supersymmetric cousins.
  The quantum null string comes with several surprises, the foremost of which is the emergence of three consistent quantum theories from the ILST action. We detail the canonical quantisation and the spectrum of the triumvirate of theories. We discuss the novelties of the quantum null theories and the effect compactifaction has on them. We also discuss Carroll strings, applications of these ideas to strings approaching black holes and give a quick overview of other related developments.</description>

      <title>On the Integrable Structure of the SU(2) Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the quantum integrable structure of Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models, formed by an infinite number of commuting Integrals of Motion (IMs) in their current algebra. Focusing for simplicity on the SU(2) case, we obtain the first four commuting higher-spin local IMs, starting from a general SU(2)-invariant ansatz and imposing their commutativity. We further show evidence of their commutativity with quantum non-local IMs, which were already built in the literature as Kondo defects. We then investigate the diagonalization of these local operators on $\widehat{\mathfrak{su}(2)}_k$ Verma modules: we explicitly find the first few eigenvectors and further discuss the affine Bethe ansatz and ODE/IQFT conjectures, which predict the full eigenstates and spectrum of the integrable structure. Our results show a perfect match between the direct diagonalization and these overarching conjectures. We conclude by discussing several outlooks, including multi-current generalisations, massive deformations and a general long-term program towards the first principle quantisation of 2-dimensional integrable sigma-models.</description>

      <title>Extremal Love: tidal/electromagnetic deformability, logarithmic running and the weak gravity conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In General Relativity, the tidal Love numbers of black holes vanish, implying they are resistant to tidal deformation. This "rigidity" is easily broken in the presence of higher-derivative corrections. Focusing on extremal charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell EFT, we compute the static linear response for both the vector ($\ell=1$) and parity-odd tensor ($\ell \ge 2$) sectors. We find that the resulting tidal Love numbers are non-zero and exhibit logarithmic running, a hallmark of quantum corrections. Crucially, we show that the sign of these deformations is not arbitrary; the induced electric and magnetic susceptibilities and their log runnings in the $\ell=1$ sector are constrained by unitarity and the Weak Gravity Conjecture. Furthermore, due to gravito-electromagnetic mixing, we find the cross log runnings and show that they are the same, which we explain through the worldline effective field theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leading contribution to the de Sitter no-boundary state comes from geometries with spherical spatial slices, including the Hartle-Hawking geometry and fluctuations around it. Recent work showed that this leading contribution has vanishing norm at one loop. Here we show that the norm in fact vanishes to all orders in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Fourfold path to Thermality: Inequivalent purifications of Rindler wedge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate thermal behaviour in quantum fields by analysing a hierarchy of null-shifted Rindler wedges in Minkowski spacetime. Starting from the Minkowski vacuum restricted to an initial Rindler wedge, we construct several inequivalent transformation paths, including direct Minkowski--Rindler mappings, spatial translations, and sequential null displacements, and analyse the resulting particle content using Bogoliubov transformations.
  In the standard Unruh effect, entanglement between left- and right-moving sectors across the Rindler horizon produces Gibbsian thermality, with both sectors described by mixed thermal states. In contrast, we show that null-shifted wedge constructions lead to a selective and non-Gibbsian form of thermality: only a single chiral sector develops Bose--Einstein--distributed occupation numbers, while the complementary sector remains in the vacuum. Along composite transformation paths, the global Minkowski state remains pure, and the induced states associated with null-shifted wedges are pure tensor-product states. The observed thermal behaviour arises from Bogoliubov mixing and modular time evolution rather than horizon-induced entanglement or Gibbsian mixedness.
  These results demonstrate the existence of inequivalent purifications of thermal spectra and clarify the distinct roles of horizon structure, observer dependence, Bogoliubov transformations, and entanglement in relativistic quantum field theory. The null-shifted construction may be viewed as a converse of the Unruh effect, in which thermal spectra arise without entanglement-induced mixedness, highlighting the operational independence of thermality and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Background instability of quintessence model in light of entropy and distance conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the covariant entropy bound argument supporting the de Sitter swampland conjecture to the quintessence model, to find out the condition for the background to be unstable. More concretely, the background is unstable when the matter entropy given by the species number of the effective field theory increases more rapidly than the geometrical entropy proportional to the apparent horizon area, since it contradicts the covariant entropy bound. The rapid increase in the matter entropy is proposed by the distance conjecture, which states that the time evolution of some scalar field along the geodesic in the field space brings about the descent of a tower of states from UV. From this, we find that for the quintessence model, the accelerating background having the event horizon is unstable, and the instability condition as well as the lifetime of the unstable background is equivalent to the trans-Planckian censorship bound forbidding the classicalization of the trans-Planckian modes. We also point out that the scale separation between the Kaluza-Klein mass scale and the Hubble parameter can be realized when the product between the increasing rates of the matter and the geometrical entropies is bounded from below, which is consistent with the AdS distance conjecture. Our study suggests that various swampland conjectures can be comprehensively understood in the language of the entropy.</description>

      <title>Electric birefringence in Euler-Heisenberg pseudo-electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fermion sector of the pseudo-quantum electrodynamics is integrated functionally to generate a non-linear electrodynamics, that it is called Euler-Heisenberg pseudo-electrodynamics. A non-local Chern-Simons topological term is added to the original lagrangian of the pseudo-quantum electrodynamics in which a most complete electrodynamics gauge invariant in 1+2 dimensions is proposed. As consequence of the fermionic sector, we obtain a non-linear contribution in the electromagnetic fields that breaks the Lorentz symmetry due to Fermi velocity. From the Euler-Heisenberg pseudo-electrodynamics, we study the properties of the plane wave propagating in a planar medium under an uniform and constant electromagnetic background field. The properties of the planar material are discussed through the electric permittivity tensor and magnetic permeability, that are functions of the frequency, wavelength and of the background fields. The dispersion relations and the refractive index are calculated in the presence of a uniform magnetic field, and also in the case only of an electric background field. The birefringence phenomenon emerges only when the electric background field is considered.</description>

      <title>Holographic Network and Traversable Parallel Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the holographic network connecting different CFTs, modeled by Gauss-Bonnet gravity with varying couplings across different bulk branches. By applying the holographic Noether's theorem, we prove that the junction condition on the Net-brane leads to conservation laws at network nodes. We analyze the stability of the gravitational KK modes on the Net-brane and derive the constraints on theory parameters. Additionally, we discuss various proposals for network entropy, confirm that the type I and II network entropies obey the holographic g-theorem, and show that the type III network entropy is non-negative.
  We explore the two-point functions of various NCFTs at different edges, using examples like free scalars and the AdS/NCFT with a tensionless brane. We then examine the gravitational dual of compact networks, which feature both EOW branes and Net-branes in the bulk. We derive the joint condition for EOW branes at the Net-brane and analyze vacuum solutions in AdS$_3$/NCFT$_2$. Finally, we demonstrate that AdS/NCFT provides a natural way to envision traversable parallel universes that have different geometries and physical laws. Remarkably, unlike traversable wormholes, our model of parallel universes satisfies all the energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Holographic Entanglement Propagation Through Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how energy and quantum entanglement are transferred when two identical CFTs are entangled locally. This is probed by considering a local operator insertion in one of the CFTs. When the CFTs have holographic duals via the AdS/CFT correspondence, the transfer happens through an AdS wormhole that allows signal propagation even beyond the horizon from one AdS boundary to the other; we demonstrate this in explicit CFT calculations. We argue that this transmission is possible because the insertion of a local operator is not a unitary process but a regularized version of projection measurement, and that this is interpreted as quantum teleportation. We also find that this leads to a phenomenon opposite to scrambling, where mutual information, instead of being suppressed, gets enhanced by the insertion of a local operator excitation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational amplitudes in the Regge limit: waveforms, shock waves and unitarity cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in the high-energy description of gravitational scattering, we develop a systematic Regge-theory framework for $2\to2+n$ amplitudes describing the scattering of two massive particles with $n$ graviton emissions, including spin effects. Working in the ultra-relativistic limit at leading logarithmic accuracy, the massive result smoothly reduces to its massless counterpart. We describe both quantum (Regge trajectory and BFKL $t$-channel evolution) and classical ($s$-channel multi-$H$ evolution) contributions using both an exponential representation of the S-matrix and a shock-wave formalism in light-cone quantisation. In the latter approach, gravitational Wilson lines evolve in rapidity space under a boost-invariant Hamiltonian, providing a space-time realisation of the high-energy dynamics and making contact with recent effective field theory descriptions in the forward limit. As an application, we compute the leading-logarithmic contribution to the massive spinless $2\to2$ amplitude at 5PM-2SF order, recovering the previously determined massless result, and derive the tree-level $2\to3$ amplitude and its associated scattering waveform for Kerr black holes in the ultra-relativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Celestial Energy-Energy Correlation in Yang-Mills Theory and Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Celestial Energy-Energy Correlator (cEEC), an infrared and collinear safe observable that makes the celestial conformal symmetry of four-dimensional scattering manifest. The cEEC is defined as a correlation function of Average Null Energy operators measured on boost eigenstates, and takes the form of a four-point function in a fictitious two-dimensional CFT on the celestial sphere. An important feature of the cEEC is that it smoothly interpolates between different key regimes of perturbative gauge theory and gravity, such as the collinear limit, the Sudakov limit, and the Regge limit. We compute the cEEC to the first non-trivial order in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills, pure Yang-Mills, Einstein gravity, and $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity. In $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity, the cEEC is uniquely determined by celestial symmetries and boundary data, demonstrating that bootstrap methods can yield closed-form results for this class of observables.</description>

      <title>Defect Relative Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of \textit{defect relative entropy} as a measure of distinguishability within the space of defects. We compute the defect relative entropy for conformal/topological defects, deriving a universal formula in conformal field theories (CFTs) on a circle. This formula reduces to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Furthermore, we provide a detailed expression of the defect relative entropy for diagonal CFTs with specific topological defect choices, utilizing the theory's modular $\mathcal{S}$ matrix. We also present a general formula for the \textit{ defect sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy} and the \textit{defect fidelity}. Through explicit calculations in specific models, including the Ising model, the tricritical Ising model, and the $\widehat{su}(2)_{k}$ WZW model, we have made an intriguing finding: zero defect relative entropy between reduced density matrices associated with certain topological defect. Notably, we introduce the concept of the \textit{defect relative sector}, representing the set of topological defects with zero defect relative entropy.</description>

      <title>Loops and legs: ABJM amplitudes from $f$-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study on how to extract planar integrands of (supersymmetric) scattering amplitudes with $L$ loops and $n$ legs in Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena (ABJM) theory from the recently proposed (bosonic) generating function for squared amplitudes with $N:=n{+}L$ dual points; the latter enjoys a hidden permutation symmetry $S_N$ and is given by a linear combination of weight-$3$ planar $f$-graphs that can be recast as bipartite graphs, which manifest important properties of ABJM amplitudes. We provide evidence that it contains sufficient information to reconstruct individual amplitudes, despite the absence of squared amplitudes at odd loops. The extraction of the four-point amplitude is already non-trivial and closely parallels the extraction of five-point amplitudes in ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM) from weight-$4$ $f$-graphs: we comment on this similarity and provide new results for $n=4$ ABJM loop integrand up to $L=6$. For higher multiplicities, based on Yangian invariants (including BCFW building blocks for tree amplitudes) and an appropriate basis of planar dual conformal invariant(DCI) integrands, we disentangle six-point integrands up to two loops and eight-point tree amplitude from the squared amplitudes. Our results suggest that ABJM amplitudes of arbitrary multiplicity and loop order can be reconstructed from squared amplitudes, closely paralleling the role of $f$-graphs in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically solve the conjectured Quantum Spectral Curve for strings on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times$T$^4$ with R--R charge from weak to strong coupling. At strong coupling, the spectrum organises into flat-space string mass levels with universal square-root scaling in the string tension at leading order, and additional Kaluza-Klein fine-splitting at subleading order. At weak coupling, the energies are determined by a nearest-neighbour Bethe Ansatz, with universal subleading corrections that are suppressed at large volume.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose non-supersymmetric analogues of 6d N=2 Type II/heterotic dualities via a quotient of a K3 surface: an Enriques surface. We start from Type~II strings on a K3 surface and construct orbifold theories using an involution of K3. We extract the massless and tachyonic spectra and identify the moduli spaces locally. We further reinterpret the constructions as Type 0A/0B strings compactified on an Enriques surface, and argue that the theories are dual to recently constructed non-supersymmetric heterotic asymmetric orbifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation, detection and coarse-graining of black holes in AdS/CFT, with an emphasis on the tension between boundary unitarity and the production of mixed state Hawking radiation in the bulk. We construct CFT states dual to black hole formation and evaporation by colliding bulk particle wavepackets at trans-Planckian energy. We propose boundary probes which are able to distinguish small AdS black holes from other states within the microcanonical ensemble. We investigate different coarse-graining prescriptions acting on the evolving CFT state, including averaging over CFT data, Hamiltonians and time windows, and compare their purities to those expected from the bulk semiclassical description. Our results clarify how semiclassical black hole behaviour can arise from an ensemble-averaging of the exact unitary dynamics, and take a step towards a better understanding of coarse-graining in the single-sided black hole information problem.</description>

      <title>Convergent sum of EFT corrections to Schwarzschild metric requires UV locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Corrections to vacuum black hole solutions of general relativity (GR) are considered in an effective field theory (EFT) framework, perturbatively in EFT coefficients, focusing on the Schwarzschild solution of GR. We find dominant corrections to the Schwarzschild metric in all orders in the derivative expansion far away from the horizon. These corrections can be summed up in a closed form through EFT coefficients up to all orders in derivatives and to the second order in curvature. It occurs that such a summation is convergent only for localizable theories, making a direct connection between the graviton scattering amplitudes properties and the applicability of a perturbative treatment of an EFT of gravity. We further apply our results to logarithmic form-factors which appear in the 1-loop effective action for GR in four dimensions. We find out that the corresponding corrections to the Schwarzschild metric are stronger than those from the tree-level EFT operators. The developed framework can be extended to account for the corrections to the other BH solutions in GR, such as the Kerr metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that a very old black hole can tunnel into a white hole through the emission of a large baby universe. This process can be modeled by a genus-one geometry corresponding to a single baby universe emission, with a tunneling probability proportional to \( t^{2} e^{-2S(E)} \), where \( t \) denotes the black hole age and \( S(E) \) its entropy at energy \( E \). The growth of this probability at late times raises the question of its behavior near \( t \sim e^{S} \). A natural possibility is that the full genus expansion, together with its non-perturbative completion, leads to saturation of the tunneling probability. Motivated by this idea, the present analysis employs a non-perturbative bulk inner product in place of the perturbative one and shows that, at late times, the probabilities of realizing firewall geometries and smooth geometries approach constant values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a quantum Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effective field theory for the diffusive hydrodynamics of a conserved scalar field. Quantum corrections within the SK framework are guided by fluctuation-dissipation relations, enforced via a dynamical Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) symmetry. We find that the KMS symmetry necessarily generates fluctuation contributions in the SK effective action at all orders in the noise field, thereby giving rise to intrinsically non-Gaussian noise. We use our results to compute one-loop quantum corrections to the two-point density-density retarded correlation function, leading to a quantum generalization of hydrodynamic long-time tails. Our results apply at arbitrarily high orders in $\hbar$. The one-loop results for retarded correlation functions have been expressed in terms of a family of polynomials. We also provide a closed-form expression for the one-loop results at leading order in the wavevector expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model for nonperturbative unitarization of the four-point contact scalar amplitude in four dimensions. It is defined through an infinite sum of planar diagrams, constructed using two-particle unitarity and crossing symmetry. We reformulate the problem in terms of a set of nonlinear integral equations obeyed by the single and double discontinuities of the amplitude. We then solve them using a neural-network ansatz trained by minimizing a physics-informed loss functional. We obtain a one-parameter family of amplitudes, which exhibit rich structure: sizeable particle production, nontrivial emergent Regge behavior, Landau curves, a logarithmic decay at high energy and fixed angle. Finally, we go beyond the two-particle-reducible setup by treating the multi-particle data -- supported above the multi-particle Landau curves due to multi-particle unitarity -- as a dynamical variable. We demonstrate that it can be tuned to suppress low-spin particle production -- a phenomenon we call Aks screening -- at the cost of generating larger and oscillatory double spectral density in the multi-particle region.</description>

      <title>Varying Newton constant, entropy and the black hole evaporation law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Einstein equations we represent the energy-momentum tensor as the one ($T^{\mu\nu}$ ) of an ideal fluid plus the cosmological term. We consider time-dependent Newton ``constant" $G$, the cosmological term $\Lambda$ and non-conserved $T^{\mu\nu}$. The Bianchi identity imposes a relation between the energy-momentum (non)conservation and the variation of $G$ and $\Lambda$. If the energy-momentum $T^{\mu\nu}$ is conserved then both the Newton ``constant" $G$ and the cosmological term $\Lambda $ either do not change or both must depend on time. If the energy-momentum $T^{\mu\nu}$ is not conserved then the Bianchi identity implies a relation between the energy-momentum and a variation in time of either $G$ or $\Lambda$ (or both). We apply thermodynamics in order to express the non-conservation of the energy-momentum of an ideal fluid by entropy and relate the time variations of $G$ and $\Lambda$ to a change of entropy. Using the relation between a varying Newton constant G and the black hole entropy we derive a modified formula for the Schwarzschild black hole evaporation (a slower evaporation). Its life time is $\frac{9}{5}$ times larger than the one for a constant $G$. The average black hole's density remains constant when the black hole's radius shrinks to zero .</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study a cosmological model driven by Generalized ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics. We find that, with an appropriate choice of the theory's parameters, the universe's initial singularity can be avoided. Moreover, we also find that this model has an inflationary epoch that is consistent with the current values for $N$, $n_s$ and $r$. Therefore, using Generalized ModMax, we can construct a non singular Universe with an inflationary epoch.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Exponents and Phase Transitions in Four-Dimensional AdS Black Holes with a Nonlinear Electrodynamics Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between dynamical instability and thermodynamic phase transitions in four-dimensional Anti--de Sitter black holes in Einstein gravity coupled to a nonlinear power-law electromagnetic field with exponent $p = 3/4$. In the canonical ensemble, we identify a critical electric charge $Q_c$ separating a regime exhibiting a first-order small/large black-hole (SBH/LBH) phase transition from a regime with a single thermodynamically stable phase. For both massless and massive probes, the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda(T)$ becomes multivalued in the SBH/LBH coexistence region and exhibits a finite discontinuity at the transition temperature. This jump vanishes continuously as $Q \to Q_c$, signaling the termination of the first-order transition at a second-order critical point. Near criticality, the Lyapunov discontinuity obeys a universal mean-field scaling law with critical exponent $1/2$. For massless probes, we further analyze the critical impact parameter $b_c$, which displays the same multivalued structure and critical behavior as the Lyapunov exponent. We also demonstrate that the spinodal temperatures, defined by the extrema of the $T(r_h)$ curve where the heat capacity at fixed charge diverges, coincide with singular features in the Lyapunov exponent. Our results identify the Lyapunov exponent as a unified dynamical probe capable of capturing both first-order phase coexistence and second-order critical behavior in black-hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Hidden localization transitions in generalized Aubry-Andr\'e models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization is a phase transition between a metallic phase, where wavefunctions are extended and delocalized in space, and an insulating phase, where wavefunctions are completely localized. These transitions are driven by uncorrelated disorder or quasiperiodic disorder, e.g., in the case of the Aubry-Andr\'e model. Here, I consider a family of Hamiltonians that generalizes the Aubry-Andr\'e model obtained when position and momentum operators are replaced by an arbitrary couple of canonically conjugate operators. In these models, a hidden localization transition occurs between metallic/insulating phases with wavefunctions delocalized/localized with respect to one of the two canonically conjugate operators. If the canonically conjugate operators coincide with a linear combination of position and momentum, the phase transition is signaled by a zero in the normalized participation ratio in the usual position space. Surprisingly, I found that at the phase transition, this model Hamiltonian coincides with the lattice Hamiltonian of a massless Dirac fermion in a curved spacetime background, indicating an unexpected relation between many-body localization and analog gravity.</description>

      <title>When does a lattice higher-form symmetry flow to a topological higher-form symmetry at low energies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the lattice version of higher-form symmetries on tensor-product Hilbert spaces. Interestingly, at low energies, these symmetries may not flow to the topological higher-form symmetries familiar from relativistic quantum field theories, but instead to non-topological higher-form symmetries. We present concrete lattice models exhibiting this phenomenon. One particular model is an $\mathbb{R}$ generalization of the Kitaev honeycomb model featuring an $\mathbb{R}$ lattice 1-form symmetry. We show that its low-energy effective field theory is a gapless, non-relativistic theory with a non-topological $\mathbb{R}$ 1-form symmetry. In both the lattice model and the effective field theory, we demonstrate that the non-topological $\mathbb{R}$ 1-form symmetry is not robust against local perturbations. In contrast, we also study various modifications of the toric code and their low-energy effective field theories to demonstrate that the compact $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice 1-form symmetry does become topological at low energies unless the Hamiltonian is fine-tuned. Along the way, we clarify the rules for constructing low-energy effective field theories in the presence of multiple superselection sectors. Finally, we argue on general grounds that non-compact higher-form symmetries (such as $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ 1-form symmetries) in lattice systems generically remain non-topological at low energies, whereas compact higher-form symmetries (such as $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ and $U(1)$ 1-form symmetries) generically become topological.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local structure of the Higgs sector around the vacuum does not uniquely determine its global properties. Most of the current experimental data provides only local information, which allows for a rich variety of global features, including several distinct topologies of the scalar manifold, and the existence of zero, one, or two fixed points of the symmetry transformations. Here, I provide, under general conditions, a complete classification of realizations of the electroweak symmetry with minimal field content -- the three would-be Goldstone bosons and the Higgs -- and outline some of their physical consequences.</description>

      <title>Self-dual Higgs transitions: Toric code and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The toric code, when deformed in a way that preserves the self-duality $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry exchanging the electric and magnetic excitations, admits a transition to a topologically trivial state that spontaneously breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Numerically, this transition was found to be continuous, which makes it particularly enigmatic given the longstanding absence of a continuum field-theoretic description. In this work we propose such a continuum field theory for the transition dubbed the $SO(4)_{2,-2}$ Chern-Simons-Higgs (CSH) theory. We show that our field theory provides a natural "mean-field" understanding of the phase diagram. Moreover, it can be generalized to an entire series of theories, namely the $SO(4)_{k,-k}$ CSH theories, labeled by an integer $k$. For each $k&gt;2$, the theory describes an analogous transition involving different non-Abelian topological orders, such as the double Fibonacci order ($k=3$) and the $S_3$ quantum double ($k=4$). For $k=1$, we conjecture that the corresponding CSH transition is in fact infrared-dual to the $3d$ Ising transition, in close analogy with the particle-vortex duality of a complex scalar.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate numerically the existence of solutions of five-dimensional vacuum gravity describing the formation, in finite time, of an extremal rotating black hole from a pre-existing Schwarzschild black hole. This is the first example of a violation of the third law of black hole mechanics in vacuum gravity and demonstrates that the third law is false independently of any matter model. We also demonstrate the existence of solutions describing the formation, in finite time, of an extremal rotating black hole from vacuum initial data that does not contain a black hole.</description>

      <title>Proposal to Search for the CP Violating Electromagnetic Vacuum Angle at the Event Horizon Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the possibility that evidence for a non-zero value of the CP violating $ \frac{e^2 }{32\pi^2}\theta_{EM} \int d^4 x {\vec E}\cdot {\vec B}$ coupling might be extracted from Event Horizon Telescope observations of the black holes SgA* and M87*. The Fischler-Kundu\cite{FK} effect predicts a universal Hall current in the relaxation of charge falling onto the black hole horizon. We argue that this leads to a non-zero value of a certain CP-violating observable ${\cal C}$, defined below. The effect can be masked by parity violating plasma currents. In particular, evidence for polarization flips \cite{flip} in the signals from M87* indicate strong plasma effects in the data. We suggest that time averaging the data over periods including the flip might leave over a residual that would be an indicator of the FK signal. In addition, similarities in the polarization patterns between the two very different black holes, and a part of the signal that is uniform in frequency, might enable us to distinguish the universal topological signal from source and frequency dependent plasma effects. Current data does not appear to be sufficient to perform such a test.</description>

      <title>Medium separation scheme effects on the magnetized and cold two-flavor superconducting quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the impact of the Medium Separation Scheme (MSS) on two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) dense quark matter under the influence of a constant external magnetic field. The effects of the proper treatment of the model divergences are examined through a comparison of different approaches, including the combined implementation of the Magnetic Field Independent Regularization (MFIR) and the MSS, as well as the standard use of smooth form factors. Our findings for the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model emphasize the critical role of properly separating medium effects from vacuum contributions in the model. The combined MFIR-MSS scheme suppresses spurious unphysical oscillations, often misinterpreted in the literature as de Haas--van Alphen oscillations, and ensures the correct high-density behavior of the diquark condensate. Furthermore, within the MSS framework, the magnetization remains positive across the explored parameter space, in sharp contrast with the behavior obtained in the traditional approach.</description>

      <title>Building Holographic Entanglement by Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for preparing quantum states with a holographic entanglement structure, in the sense that the entanglement entropies are governed by minimal surfaces in a chosen bulk geometry. We refer to such entropies as holographic because they obey a relation between entropies and bulk minimal surfaces, known as the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, that is a key feature of holographic models of quantum gravity. Typically in such models, the bulk geometry is determined by solving Einstein's equations. Here, we simply choose a bulk geometry, then discretize the geometry into a coupling graph comprising bulk and boundary nodes. Evolving under this graph of interactions and measuring the bulk nodes leaves behind the desired pure state on the boundary. We numerically demonstrate that the resulting entanglement properties approximately reproduce the predictions of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in the chosen bulk geometry. We consider graphs associated with hyperbolic disk and wormhole geometries, but the approach is general. The minimal ingredients in our proposal involve only Gaussian operations and measurements and are readily implementable in photonic and cold-atom platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an effective continuum description for information scrambling in a chain of randomly interacting Majorana fermions. The approach is based on the semiclassical treatment of the path integral for an effective spin chain that describes "two-replica" observables such as the entanglement purity and the OTOC. This formalism gives exact results for the entanglement membrane and for operator spreading in the limit of weak interactions. In this limit there is a large crossover lengthscale between free and interacting behavior, and this large lengthscale allows for a continuum limit and a controlled saddle-point calculation. The formalism is also somewhat different from that known from random unitary circuits. The entanglement membrane emerges as a kind of bound state of two travelling waves, and shows an interesting unbinding phenomenon as the velocity of the entanglement membrane approaches the butterfly velocity.</description>

Abstract: Exact, analytic, asymptotically flat rotating black-hole solutions are exceedingly rare, with only a handful of examples known. Using a Kerr-Schild ansatz, we derive a multitude of exact, analytic, asymptotically flat rotating black-hole solutions within a broad class of Generalized Proca theories. These black holes differ significantly from Kerr black holes, as they possess primary hair and are non-circular, thus breaking a symmetry that vacuum black holes exhibit in General Relativity.</description>

Abstract: Temperature and baryon, charge, and strangeness chemical potentials characterize QCD matter under extreme conditions. Differences between these chemical potentials and their ratios probe conserved-charge correlations and the system's response in the multidimensional QCD phase diagram. We extract these quantities from STAR Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr isobar collisions using a Bayesian thermal analysis of hadron yields, which substantially reduces systematic uncertainties, and compare them with Taylor-expanded lattice-QCD and Chiral Mean Field model predictions. Isobar collisions thus emerge as a precision probe of four-dimensional QCD thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Realizing the phantom-divide crossing with vector and scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In generalized Proca theories, characterized by a vector field with broken $U(1)$ gauge invariance, late-time cosmic acceleration can be realized with a dark energy equation of state in the regime $w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$. In such scenarios, however, a phantom-divide crossing, as recently suggested by DESI observations, is not achieved without encountering theoretical inconsistencies. We incorporate a canonical scalar field with a potential, in addition to the vector field, and show that the phantom-divide crossing from $w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$ to $w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$ can occur at low redshifts. We propose a minimal model that admits such a transition and identify the region of parameter space in which all dynamical degrees of freedom in the scalar, vector, and tensor sectors are free from ghost and Laplacian instabilities. We further investigate the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations by applying the quasi-static approximation to modes well inside the Hubble radius. The dimensionless quantities $\mu$ and $\Sigma$, which characterize the growth of matter perturbations and the bending of light rays, respectively, depend on the sound speed $c_\psi$ of the longitudinal scalar perturbation associated with the vector field. Since $c_\psi$ is influenced by the transverse vector mode, the model exhibits sufficient flexibility to yield values of $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ close to 1. Consequently, unlike theories such as scalar Galileons, the present model can be consistent with observations of redshift-space distortions and integrated Sachs-Wolfe-galaxy cross-correlations.</description>

      <title>Is Phantom Divide Crossing in General Relativity Completely Impossible? Shortcomings and Possible Solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity has its successes at the local astrophysical level, however, it seems to be insufficient in describing the Universe at large scales. In this work we investigate how the most general field theories in the context of general relativity can accomodate a phantom-to-quintessence transition which may be essential element of realistic Dark Energy scenarios in the late Universe. As we demonstrate in a very detailed manner, this is impossible for a canonical and minimally coupled single scalar field theory, but it may be possible for ghost condensate theories like $k$-essence theories. We point out how the ghost instabilities may be eliminated, and we analyze the quantitative features of a $k$-essence theory that may realize a phantom-to-quintessence transition in the late Universe. We also qualitatively compare the difficulties and fine-tunings required for $k$-essence theories to realize a phantom-to-quintessence transition, and how such a transition is naturally realized in modified gravity, without unnecessary fine-tunings and ghost eliminations.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{R}^2$-corrected Tachyon Scalar Field Inflation, the ACT Data, and Phantom Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phantom divide line transitions are not possible in the context of single scalar field scalar-tensor theories. In this article we study a combined framework of a tachyonic minimally coupled single scalar field theory in the presence of an $\mathcal{R}^2$ correction term and with a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term of the form $\sim \lambda \frac{\mathcal{R}}{16\pi G}$. Such terms can be part of an $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity which in the large curvature regime yields such correction terms effectively. Alternatively, such terms can simply be quantum corrections to the scalar field action. We aim to answer two questions, firstly if this framework can lead to phantom divide line transitions and secondly whether the resulting model can be compatible with the ACT data. The model we studied is an inverse square power-law model, well known from tachyon inflation models. As we show, the field equations can be cast in terms of the scalar field solely, however the resulting theory is distinct from a single scalar field theory, because the phantom divide line is crossed during inflation. Thus initially the tachyonic nature of the scalar field generates a phantom equation of state parameter, and during inflation the phantom divide line is crossed, with the effective equation of state parameter at the end of inflation being $w=-1/3$ which corresponds to the non-accelerating state of the Universe. The model is proved to be compatible with the ACT data, only when the gravity during inflation is stronger than Einstein-Hilbert gravity, with the effective gravitational constant during inflation being $\frac{G}{\lambda}$. The effective theory is valid only during inflation, thus Big-Bang nucleosynthesis is not affected by the rescaling of the Einstein-Hilbert gravity. The feature of a phantom crossing in $f(\mathcal{R},\phi)$ frameworks is new in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the finite-size corrections to the crosscap overlap in the two-dimensional classical Ising model along its self-dual critical line. Using a fermionic formulation, we express the lattice crosscap overlap in terms of Bogoliubov angles and develop a contour-integral approach by analytically continuing the lattice momentum to the complex plane. This leads to a remarkably simple expression for the crosscap overlap, which demonstrates that the finite-size corrections decay exponentially with system size. We further derive an exact analytical formula for the corresponding decay constant and show that it is determined by the complex singularity structure of the Bogoliubov angle.</description>

      <title>Six-loop renormalization group analysis of the $\phi^4 + \phi^6$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $\lambda\ph^4+g\ph^6$ model using the renormalization group method and the $\ep$ expansion. This model is used in a situation where the coefficients $\lambda$, $g$ and the coefficient $\tau$ of the term $\tau \ph^2$ depend on two parameters $T$ and $P$, and there is a point ($T_c,P_c$) at which $\tau$ and $\lambda$ are zero. This point is named the tricritical point. The description of a system depends on a trajectory that leads to the tricritical point on the plane ($T,P$). In the trajectories, when $\lambda$ goes to zero fast enough, the description is defined by the $\ph^6$ interaction and then the $\ph^4$ term can be considered as a composite operator. In this case, the logarithmic dimension is $d=3$, and the $\ep$ expansion is carried out in the dimension $d=3-2\ep$. The main exponents of the \textit{tricritical} model have been calculated in the third order of the $\ep$ expansion. Taking into account the $\ph^4$ interaction, we were able to calculate the value of the parameter that determines the required decrease rate in $\lambda$ to implement the tricritical behavior. The tricritical dimensions of the composite operators $\ph^k$ for $k=1, 2, 4, 6$ have been computed. The resulting values are compared to those known from a conformal field theory and non-perturbative renormalization group.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible translation from Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry provides powerful non-perturbative constraints in quantum many-body systems. A prominent example is the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly -- a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between internal and translational symmetries that forbids a trivial symmetric gapped phase. In this work, we investigate lattice translation operators in systems with an LSM anomaly. We construct explicit lattice models in two and three spatial dimensions and show that, after gauging the full internal symmetry, translation becomes non-invertible and fuses into defects of the internal symmetry. The result is supported by the anomaly-inflow in view of topological field theory. Our work extends earlier one-dimensional observations to a unified higher-dimensional framework and clarifies their origin in mixed anomalies and higher-group structures, highlighting a coherent interplay between internal and crystalline symmetries.</description>

      <title>Elementary blocks of Loop Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We embark on the vast program of integrating the dynamics of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). Adopting the strategy of decomposing spin network states into small blocks of (quantum) geometry which can later be glued back together, we focus on the more modest objective of studying the Hamiltonian dynamics on the {\it candy graph}, that is two nodes linked together by an arbitrary number of edges and also having open edges. This elementary setting allows both for curvature to develop around the bulk loops and both non-trivial boundary data and dynamics on the open edges. We study this system at the classical level and leave the detailed of its quantum regime for future investigation. Working on a single loop with two external legs, we show how the LQG Hamiltonian ansatz reduces to a pair of non-linear differential equations, similar to the cubic Schr\"odinger equation, on the areas carried by the bulk links. We provide analytical solutions to this evolution equation, identifying oscillatory modes (bounded modes) and divergent modes (similar to bouncing cosmological trajectories). This provides an explicit template for future investigations of LQG dynamics on more sophisticated spin network architecture built as arrays of candy graphs.</description>

      <title>Beyond Kasner Epochs: Ordered Oscillations and Spike Dynamics Inside Black Holes with Higher-Derivative Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building upon the long-standing paradigm that dynamics near a spacelike singularity are governed by a sequence of Kasner epochs, we demonstrate that this picture is fundamentally altered when higher-curvature or quantum gravitational corrections are included. By incorporating such terms alongside a minimally coupled scalar field, we discover three distinct dynamical phases near the singularity: modified Kasner eons, persistent periodic oscillations, and oscillatory spike dynamics with growing amplitude. In particular, the Kasner-like geometry persisting only in highly constrained situations. The latter two regimes represent a clean departure from classical Kasner phenomenology, revealing a richer and more ordered landscape of behaviors in the deep interior of black holes beyond Einstein gravity. This work establishes a comprehensive approach for understanding the gravitational nonlinearity in the most extreme gravitational environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unimodular version of the Kaluza-Klein theory is briefly recalled, and its projection on the $4$-dimensional spacetime is constructed. Imposing unimodularity condition on the $5$-dimensional Kaluza-Klein metric, det$g_{AB}=1$ is equivalent with introducing cosmological term in Einstein's equations in $4$ dimensions, and with scalar field of the Brans-Dicke type. Singularity-free cosmological solutions with scalar field and with matter sources are constructed, and their basic properties analyzed, along the results obtained in previous publications. In the present paper, attention is focussed on the perturbative analysis of cosmological solutions, providing a clue concerning their stability against small fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Detection of Gravitational Anomaly at Low Acceleration from a Highest-quality Sample of 36 Wide Binaries with Accurate 3D Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set out to accurately measure gravity in the low-acceleration range $(10^{-11},10^{-9})$ m\,s$^{-2}$ from 3D motions of isolated wide binary stars. Gaia DR3 provides precise measurements of the four sky-plane components of the 3D relative displacement and velocity ($\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{v}$) for a wide binary, but not comparably precise line-of-sight (radial) separation and relative velocity $v_{r}$. Based on our new observations and the public databases/publications, we assemble a sample of 36 nearby (distance $&lt;150$pc) wide binaries in the low-acceleration regime with accurate values of $v_{r}$ (uncertainty $&lt; 100$ m\,s$^{-1}$). Kinematic contaminants such as undetected stellar companions are well under control using various observational diagnostics such as Gaia's ruwe parameter, the color-magnitude diagram, multi-epoch observations of radial velocities, Speckle interferometric follow-up observations, and requiring Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion consistency. For the parameter $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{\gamma}$ with $\gamma \equiv G/G_{\rm N}$ (where $G$ is a parameter generalizing Newton's constant $G_{\rm N}$ in elliptical orbits), we find $\Gamma=0.102_{-0.021}^{+0.023}$, inconsistent with standard gravity at $4.9\sigma$, giving a gravity boost factor of $\gamma=1.600_{-0.141}^{+0.171}$. Four wide binaries have 3D relative velocities exceeding their estimated Newtonian escape velocities with $1&lt;v_{\rm obs}/v_{\rm escN}\le1.2$. These systems are unlikely to be chance associations and are expected in a nonstandard paradigm such as Milgromian dynamics (MOND). The hypothesis that Newtonian gravity can be extrapolated to the low-acceleration limit is falsified by this independent study with accurate 3D velocities. Future radial velocity monitoring and Speckle interferometric imaging for larger samples will be useful to refine the present result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes exactly incorporating quantum matter backreaction effects, namely, quantum black holes, are notoriously difficult to construct, let alone study their horizon thermodynamics. Here, we derive the thermodynamics of three-dimensional charged and rotating quantum black holes via the tree-level gravitational partition function. Specifically, we primarily focus on holographic quantum BTZ black holes, dual to $(3+1)$-dimensional accelerating black holes in anti-de Sitter space that localize on Karch-Randall end-of-the-world (ETW) branes. To derive their horizon thermodynamics, we regulate the bulk Euclidean geometry by adding a second ETW brane at asymptotic spatial infinity. We compute the on-shell action of the complexified accelerating black hole in the grand canonical ensemble and derive the quantum BTZ black hole thermodynamics, where the thermal entropy is equal to the generalized entropy. This provides a first principles derivation of the generalized entropy of three-dimensional quantum black holes. Further, we construct charged and rotating quantum black holes in three-dimensional de Sitter and Minkowski space using Randall-Sundrum ETW branes, and compute their horizon thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that dark matter halos can support regular black holes or compact stars by assuming an anisotropic energy-momentum tensor. In this paper, we extend the analysis to the dark matter halo as an isotropic perfect fluid. By employing galactic dark matter profiles-specifically the Einasto and Dehnen models-as the mass-energy density source, we numerically solve the Einstein field equations and find a class of non-singular, horizonless compact star solutions. Moreover, these configurations remain stable against axial perturbations while satisfying the dominant energy condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for generative machine learning that leverages the holographic principle of quantum gravity, or to be more precise its manifestation as the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, with techniques for deep learning and transport theory. Our proposal is to represent the flow of data from a base distribution to some learned distribution using the bulk-to-boundary mapping of scalar fields in AdS. In the language of machine learning, we are representing and augmenting the flow-matching algorithm with AdS physics. Using a checkerboard toy dataset and MNIST, we find that our model achieves faster and higher quality convergence than comparable physics-free flow-matching models. Our method provides a physically interpretable version of flow matching. More broadly, it establishes the utility of AdS physics and geometry in the development of novel paradigms in generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Probing the Sound Speed of Dark Energy with a Lunar Laser Interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sound speed of dark energy encodes fundamental information about the microphysics underlying cosmic acceleration, yet remains essentially unconstrained by existing observations. We demonstrate that a lunar-based laser interferometer, such as the proposed Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA), can directly probe the sound speed of dark energy by measuring the real-time evolution of horizon-scale gravitational potentials. Operating in the ultra-low-frequency gravitational band inaccessible from Earth, LILA is sensitive to scalar metric perturbations sourced by dark energy dynamics. Using both fluid and effective field theory descriptions, we develop a complete framework linking dark energy sound speed to observable strain signatures. We construct a likelihood pipeline and Fisher forecasts, showing that LILA can either detect clustering dark energy or exclude broad classes of models with unprecedented sensitivity. This establishes lunar interferometry as a novel and powerful probe of the physics driving cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We take a step toward answering a long-standing question in the asymptotic expansion of Feynman integrals: how to systematically determine the regions in the Expansion-by-Regions technique for multiscale processes? Focusing on generic massless wide-angle scattering, we provide an all-order momentum-space prescription for facet regions, which generally dominate -- and in most cases exhaust -- the contributions in a given asymptotic expansion. This extends the Euclidean-space picture, where regions correspond to specific subgraphs, to the complexities of Minkowski space. Our results are derived from a novel analytical approach combining graph theory and convex geometry; as a key byproduct, we uncover for the first time the algebraic structure underlying momentum modes (collinear, soft, and their hierarchies).</description>

      <title>Emergent Strings in Type IIB Calabi--Yau Compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study infinite distance limits in the complex structure moduli space of Type IIB compactifications on Calabi--Yau threefolds, in light of the Emergent String Conjecture. We focus on the so-called type II limits, which, based on the asymptotic behaviour of the physical couplings in the low-energy effective theory, are candidates for emergent string limits. However, due to the absence of Type IIB branes of suitable dimensionality, the emergence of a unique critical string accompanied by a tower of Kaluza--Klein states has so far remained elusive. By considering a broad class of type II$_b$ limits, corresponding to so-called Tyurin degenerations, and studying the asymptotic behaviour of four-dimensional EFT strings in this geometry, we argue that the worldsheet theory of the latter describes a unique critical heterotic string on $T^2\times\mathrm{K3}$ with a gauge bundle whose rank depends on $b$. In addition, we establish the presence of an infinite tower of BPS particles arising from wrapped D3-branes by identifying a suitable set of special Lagrangian 3-cycles in the geometry. The associated BPS invariants are conjectured to be counted by generalisations of modular forms. As a consistency check, we further show that in special cases mirror symmetry identifies the EFT strings with the well-understood emergent string limits in the K\"ahler moduli space of Type IIA compactifications on K3-fibred Calabi--Yau threefolds. Finally, we discuss the implications of the Emergent String Conjecture for type II limits which do not correspond to Tyurin degenerations, and predict new constraints on the possible geometries of type II degenerations which resemble those arising in the Kulikov classification of degenerations of K3 surfaces.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Quantization of Gauge Field Theories: Sandwich Quantization Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantization of field theories with gauge symmetry is an extensively discussed and well-established topic. In this short note, we revisit this old problem. While we confirm all details of the existing literature, we highlight a potentially important point which may provide a better understanding of and insights on the quantization of gauged systems. The gauge degrees of freedom have vanishing momenta, and hence their equations of motion appear as constraints on the system. We argue that to ensure consistency of quantization one can impose these constraints as ``sandwich conditions'': The physical Hilbert space of the theory consists of all states for which the constraints sandwiched between any two physical states vanish. We solve the sandwich constraints and show they have solutions not discussed in the gauge field theory literature. We briefly discuss the physical meaning of these solutions and the implications of the "sandwich quantization scheme".</description>

      <title>On Solving Dual Conformal Integrals in Coulomb-branch Amplitudes and Their Periods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and study infinite families of all-loop planar, dual conformal invariant (DCI) integrals, which contribute to four-point Coulomb-branch amplitudes and correlators in ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, by solving ``boxing'' differential equations via \texttt{HyperlogProcedures}~\cite{hyperlogprocedures}; The resulting single-valued harmonic polylogarithmic functions (SVHPL) are nicely labeled by ``binary'' strings of $0$ and $1$ without consecutive $1$'s. These functions are special cases of the so-called generalized ladders studied in~\cite{Drummond:2012bg}, where extended Steinmann relations (no consecutive $1$'s) are imposed due to planarity. Our results can be viewed as ``two-dimensional'' extensions of the well-known ladder integrals to many more infinite families of DCI integrals: the ladders have strings with a single $1$ followed by all $0$'s, and the other extreme, which nicely evaluate to the ``zigzag'' SVHPL functions with alternating $1$'s and $0$'s, are nothing but the four-point DCI integrals from the very special family of anti-prism $f$-graphs (while all other binary DCI integrals lie in between these two extreme cases). We also study periods of these integrals: while their periods are in general complicated single-valued multiple zeta values (SVMZV), the ``zigzag'' DCI integrals from anti-prism gives exactly the famous ``zigzag'' periods proportional to $\zeta_{2L{+}1}$, and empirically it provides a numerical lower-bound for $L$-loop periods of any binary string, with the upper-bound given by that of the ladder (also proportional to $\zeta_{2L{+}1}$). Based on $f$-graphs as a tool for studying these periods, we discuss several interesting facts and observations about these (motivic) SVMZV and relations among them to all loops, and enumerate a basis for them up to $L=10$.</description>

      <title>The neural networks with tensor weights and emergent fermionic Wick rules in the large-width limit</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study complex-valued neural network (CVNNs) with tensor-valued hidden-to-output weights within the framework of neural-network quantum field theory (NN-QFT). For standard CVNNs with scalar weights, we derive the generating functional and identify the exact Gaussian process that arises in the infinite-width limit, together with its associated effective quantum state. When the last-layer weights are promoted to Clifford-algebra-valued tensors, the network output becomes complex matrix-valued, and a fermion-like sign structure in the large-width correlation functions of the network output is induced. We show that, in the infinite-width limit, correlators with equal numbers of $f^{\dag}$ and $f$ obey fermionic Wick rules and can be written as determinants built from a scalar Euclidean kernel $S(x,y)=\langle f^{\dag}(x)f(y)\rangle$. This provides a sign-structured extension of NN-QFT at the level of Euclidean correlators and Feynman rules, even though a microscopic Grassmann path integral representation for the network parameters has not yet been constructed. Our analysis thus pushes the NN-QFT correspondence beyond purely bosonic Gaussian fields and suggests a possible route to encoding fermion-like symmetries in neural architectures for QFT correspondence.</description>

Abstract: Scalar fields with masses protected by global shift symmetries, commonly referred to as axions, are abundantly used in effective field theories in cosmology and particle physics. However, global symmetries cannot be expected to be protected at the fundamental level. Finding consistent ultra-violet completions for axions is therefore a necessity. In this work, we identify the axion with the position mode of a charged 3-brane in (4+1)-dimensions. The shift symmetry of the axion is then a residual diffeomorphism in the fifth dimension orthogonal to the brane. Meanwhile, the brane is coupled to a flux in the fifth dimension. From the (3+1)-dimensional perspective, this construction generates (perturbatively) a mass for the axion and matches previously known proposals in the literature based on the coupling between the axion and a three-form gauge field. In a second step, we uplift this (4+1)-dimensional model to M-theory, where the same three-form is found to couple to the membrane with a (2+1)-dimensional worldvolume. In particular, our proposal also elucidates the duality between the axion and a two-form gauge field in the literature. We show that this dual two-form couples to the boundary of an open membrane in M-theory. Finally, we comment on the relations to and differences from other closed and open string axion monodromy models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Effects for Black Holes with On-Shell Amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework based on modern amplitude techniques to analyze emission and absorption effects in black hole physics, including Hawking radiation. We first discuss quantum field theory on a Schwarzschild background in the Boulware and Unruh vacua, and introduce the corresponding $S$-matrices. We use this information to determine on-shell absorptive amplitudes describing processes where a black hole transitions to a different mass state by absorbing or emitting quanta, to all orders in gravitational coupling. This on-shell approach allows for a universal description of black holes, with their intrinsic differences encapsulated in the discontinuities of the amplitudes, without suffering from off-shell ambiguities such as gauge freedom. Furthermore, the absorptive amplitudes serve as building blocks to describe physics beyond that of isolated black holes. As applications, we find that the Hawking thermal spectrum is well understood by three-point processes. We also consider a binary system and compute the mass shift of a black hole induced by the motion of a companion object, including quantum effects. We show that the mean value of the mass shift is classical and vacuum-independent, while its variance differs depending on the vacuum choice. Our results provide confirmation of the validity of the on-shell program in advancing our understanding of black hole physics.</description>

Abstract: The demand to know the structure of functionally independent invariants of tensor fields arises in many problems of theoretical and mathematical physics, for instance for the construction of interacting higher-order tensor field actions. In mathematical terms the problem can be formulated as follows. Given a semi-simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ and a $\mathfrak g$-module $V$, one may ask about the structure of the sub-ring of $\mathfrak g$-invariants inside the ring freely generated by the module. We point out how some information about the ring of invariants may be obtained by studying an extended Lie algebra. Numerous examples are given, with particular focus on the difficult problem of classifying invariants of a self-dual 5-form in 10 dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Stability at One Loop for BPS Membranes in a Lorentz-Covariant RVPD Matrix Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the first rigorous one-loop proof of quantum stability for BPS membranes in the Lorentz-covariant M2-brane matrix model with Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformations (RVPD). Exploiting the closure of restricted $\kappa$-symmetry with RVPD ensures that the BRST complex terminates without an infinite ghost tower, keeping the gauge-fixed measure analytically controllable.
  Our main result establishes that the 2D, 4D, 6D, and 8D noncommutative membranes remain stable, while the 10D configuration inevitably develops a tachyonic mode.
  Our analysis unifies the treatment of zero-modes, connects the effective action to central charges, and clarifies relations to BFSS, BLG/ABJM, and prospective M5-brane matrix models, providing a roadmap for RVPD-based extensions.</description>

Abstract: We study the cosmology of axion-scalar pairs, coupled by a hyperbolic field-space metric and with a string-motivated rational scalar potential. Borrowing tools from the theory of dynamical systems, we are able to classify all late-time trajectories and extract physical properties of the asymptotic solutions. These results suggest a Dynamical Distance Conjecture: along the physical (possibly non-geodesic) trajectories, towers of states become exponentially light as a function of the traversed field-space distance. We further rule out possible counterexamples with wildly oscillating solutions. The considered axion-scalar systems are realized in F-theory compactifications, where the axion-scalar pair is a complex-structure modulus and four-form fluxes induce the asymptotic potentials. We also provide a complete Hodge-theoretic classification of all one-modulus asymptotic potentials of this type.</description>

Abstract: We study the symmetry-resolved genuine multi-entropy, a measure that captures genuine multi-partite entanglement, in Haar random states and random graph states in the presence of a conserved quantity. For Haar random states, we derive explicit formulae for the genuine multi-entropy under a global $U(1)$ symmetry in the thermodynamic limit, and find that its dependence on subsystem sizes closely resembles that of fully Haar random states without a conserved charge. We also perform numerical analyses, focusing on spin systems for both Haar random and graph states. For random graph states, our numerical analyses reveal distinctive features of their multi-partite entanglement structure and we contrast them with the Haar random case.</description>

      <title>On the six-loop scaling dimensions of the $(\phi^2)^n$ operators in $d=3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of singlet operators $(\phi^2)^n$ in the three-dimensional $O(N)$ model with $\lambda^2 \phi^6$ interaction. Recently, the corresponding anomalous dimensions $\gamma_{2n}$ were computed by semiclassical methods and the all-loop result for the leading-$n$ corrections in the small $\lambda$ limit was found. In this paper, we obtain the six-loop expressions not only for the leading-$n$ contribution but also for the subleading one. While the leading correction confirms the predictions of recent semiclassical calculation, the subleading one is a new result and will serve as a future welcome check for all-loop expressions. As an important by-product of our calculation, we provide a full dependence on $n$ of the four-loop $\gamma_{2n}$ in the $O(N)$ case.</description>

      <title>Schubert line defects in 3d GLSMs, part I: Complete flag manifolds and quantum Grothendieck polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct new half-BPS line defects in 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric quiver gauge theories whose Higgs branches are complete flag manifolds $X = {\rm Fl}(n)$. Upon circle compactification, the bulk theory flows to a non-linear sigma model (NLSM) with target space $X$ and the line defects flow to objects supported on Schubert varieties $X_w \subseteq X$. These Schubert line defects form an important basis of the quantum K-theory of $X$. They are realized as $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SQM) quivers coupled to the 3d gauge theory. We show that the insertion of the Schubert line defect restricts the target space of the 3d gauged linear sigma model (GLSM) to the Schubert variety $X_w$, with the 1d degrees of freedom physically realizing a Bott--Samelson resolution of $X_w$. Moreover, we verify in examples that the 1d flavored Witten index of the quiver SQM reproduces the (equivariant) Chern character of the structure sheaf $\mathcal{O}_{X_w}$ as a (double) quantum Grothendieck polynomial, generalizing previous results for $X$ a Grassmannian manifold. Our construction thus provides a more direct realization of the 3d GLSM/quantum K-theory correspondence for complete flag manifolds. Finally, in the small-circle limit, we obtain a 0d-2d coupled system that realizes the Schubert classes $[X_w]$ in the quantum cohomology ring of $X$.</description>

      <title>2d Conformal Field Theories on Magic Triangle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magic triangle due to Cvitanovi\'c and Deligne--Gross is an extension of the Freudenthal--Tits magic square of semisimple Lie algebras. In this paper, we identify all two-dimensional rational conformal field theories associated to the magic triangle. These include various Wess--Zumino--Witten (WZW) models, Virasoro minimal models, compact bosons and their non-diagonal modular invariants. At level one, we uncover a two-parameter family of fourth-order modular linear differential equation whose solutions yield the affine characters of all elements in the magic triangle. We further establish a universal coset relation for the whole triangle, generalizing the dual-pair structure with respect to $(E_8)_1$ in the Cvitanovi\'c--Deligne exceptional series. This coset structure determines the dimensions and degeneracies of all primary fields and leads to five atomic models from which all theories in the triangle can be constructed. At level two, we find that a distinghuished row of the triangle -- the subexceptional series -- exhibits emergent $N=1$ supersymmetry. The corresponding Neveu--Schwarz/Ramond characters satisfy a one-parameter family of fermionic modular linear differential equations. In addition, we find several new uniform coset constructions involving WZW models at higher levels.</description>

      <title>Boundary flow and geometric realization in holographic $T\bar T$-deformed BCFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $T\bar T$ deformation of boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) from an intrinsic field-theoretic perspective. Formulating the deformation as a modification of the asymptotic variational principle in AdS$_3$, we obtain the exact quadratic trace relation for the stress tensor without introducing a finite radial cutoff, which we take as the fundamental definition of the deformed theory. When restricted to a BCFT without independent boundary degrees of freedom, the intrinsic $T\bar T$ deformation becomes genuinely boundary-localized. Imposing reflective boundary conditions collapses the bulk composite operator to a universal one-dimensional irrelevant flow governed entirely by the displacement operator. We integrate this flow in closed form and derive an induced boundary action, showing that the deformation reorganizes existing boundary data without introducing new boundary degrees of freedom. We further establish a precise equivalence between a fixed-boundary description and a moving-boundary description, interpreted as a reparametrization of the variational problem rather than physical boundary dynamics.
  On the holographic side, we analyze two inequivalent realizations in AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$, referred to as Type~A and Type~B. In Type~A, a rigid cutoff surface intersects the end-of-the-world brane at finite position, leading to an apparent boundary displacement. In Type~B, the cutoff surface is asymptotically AdS$_2$, so that the BCFT boundary is geometrically pinned and the displacement operator vanishes identically. Using entanglement entropy at zero and finite temperature, we disentangle universal consequences of the intrinsic boundary-localized flow from features that depend on the holographic implementation.</description>

      <title>On $\sqrt{T\overline{T}}$ deformed pathways: CFT to CCFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the marginal $\sqrt{T\overline{T}}$ deformation of massless scalar field theories in two dimensions from a dynamical perspective. The operator flow equations for such deformations induce a particular Legendre Transformation between flowed Lagrangians and flowed Hamiltonians. The marginal deformation does not change the conformal symmetries of the theory, until some special points in the moduli space are reached, and the relativistic conformal algebra smoothly changes to the Carrollian conformal (equivalently BMS) one. We investigate this change of symmetry from both configuration space and phase space point of view, while keeping the notion of Legendre Transformation unchanged during the flow. By expanding the actions, in the extreme limits of the flow parameter, we recover the usual ``Electric'' Carroll theory and further uncover a novel ``Magnetic'' counterpart. We discuss the intriguing geometric understanding of such dynamical maps for the deformed theories, and also provide a concrete example for the same from a deformed string theory in flat space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supergravity theories in de Sitter spacetime are known to be very constrained, and rather unnatural within String/M Theory. We revisit the seminal paper by Pilch, van Nieuwenhuizen and Sohnius, where the possible existence of a real Lagrangian for ${\cal N}=2$ pure supergravity in four-dimensional de Sitter spacetime was pointed out. We clarify several issues related to the non-unitarity of the theory and explicitly construct the unique, complete theory searched for long ago by the aforementioned authors. We argue that the lack of unitarity of the Lorentzian theory may be revisited in the Euclidean approach to de Sitter quantum gravity, where alternative definitions of unitarity can be introduced.</description>

      <title>EFT Perspective On de-Sitter S-Matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-perturbative limitations on low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) based on the characteristics of high-energy theory are provided by the analyticity of the flat-space version of the S-matrix. Although the analyticity of the flat-space S-matrix is widely established, it is difficult to apply this framework to de Sitter space because the growing backdrop breaks time-translation symmetry and makes it more difficult to define asymptotic states. The flat-space analyticity imprint on the de Sitter S-matrix is examined in this study. On a certain limit, we derive a comprehensive relationship between the flat-space amplitude and the de Sitter S-matrix. In particular, we demonstrate that the relationship is valid for tree-level amplitude exchanging with arbitrary local derivative interactions with a large scalar field. Next, we contend that this specific limit is more consistent with the definition of EFT since, similar to flat space, the Mandelstam variable may be identified as the unique energy scale because the total energy dependence of the de Sitter S-matrix becomes negligible. Finally, we also find an unexpected connection between the idea of generalized energy conservation of an S-matrix of four-dimensional de Sitter and exceptional EFTs in de Sitter space. We restrict the coupling constants in theories of self-interacting scalars dwelling in the exceptional series of de Sitter representations by requiring that such an S-matrix only has support when the total energies of in and out states are equal. We rediscover the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) and Special Galileon theories, in which a single coupling constant uniquely fixes the four-point scalar self-interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism of impurity screening in (1+1)$d$ quantum critical states described by conformal field theories (CFTs). An impurity can be screened if it has the same quantum numbers as some gapless degrees of freedom of the CFT. The common source of these degrees of freedom is the chiral primary fields of the CFT, but we uncover that topological defect lines of the CFT may also take this role. Theoretical analysis relies on the insight that the impurities can be interpreted as edge modes of certain symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states. By stacking a SPT state with a CFT, one or two interfaces on which the SPT edge modes reside are created. If screening occurs due to topological defect lines, a symmetry-enriched CFT with exotic boundary states are obtained. The boundary conditions that appear in these cases are difficult to achieve using previously known methods. As a concrete example, we consider a spin-1 chain whose bulk is described by the SU(3)$_{1}$ CFT and edges are coupled to spin-1/2 impurities. We demonstrate that both the low-energy eigenstates and the extracted Affleck-Ludwig entropy are in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Untangling PBH overproduction in $w$-SIGWs generated by Pulsar Timing Arrays for MST-EFT of single field inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15065v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our work highlights the crucial role played by the equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$ within the context of single field inflation with Multiple Sharp Transitions (MSTs) to untangle the current state of the PBH overproduction issue. We examine the situation for a broad interval of EoS parameter that remains most favourable to explain the recent data released by the pulsar timing array (PTA) collaboration. Our analysis yields the interval, $0.2 \leq w \leq 1/3$, to be the most acceptable window from the SIGW interpretation of the PTA signal and where sizeable PBHs abundance, $f_{\rm PBH} \in (10^{-3},1)$, is observed. We also obtain $w=1/3$, radiation-dominated era, to be the best scenario to explain the early stages of the Universe and address the overproduction problem. Within the range of $1 \leq c_{s} \leq 1.17$, we construct a regularized-renormalized-resummed scalar power spectrum whose amplitude obeys the perturbativity criterion while being substantial enough to generate EoS dependent scalar induced gravitational waves ($w$-SIGWs) consistent with NANOGrav-15 data. Working for both $c_{s} = 1\;{\rm and}\;1.17$, we find the $c_{s}=1.17$ case more favourable for generating large mass PBHs, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6}-10^{-3})M_{\odot}$, as potential dark matter candidates with substantial abundance after constraints coming from microlensing experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affleck-Dine (AD) baryogenesis is compelling yet challenging to probe because of the high-energy physics involved. We demonstrate that this mechanism can be generically realized with low-energy new physics, without supersymmetry, while producing detectable gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by the parametric resonance of a light scalar field. In viable models, the scalar has a mass of $\mathcal{O}(0.1-10)$ GeV, yielding GWs with peak frequencies of $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ Hz. This study further reveals a new complementarity between upcoming LIGO-frequency GW detectors and laboratory searches across frontiers of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Convective stability analysis of massive neutron stars formed in binary mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform fully general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers over $100\,\rm ms$ post-merger to investigate the dynamics of remnant massive neutron stars (NSs). Our focus is mainly on the analysis of convective stability and mode characteristics of the massive NSs. We derive stability criteria for hot, differentially rotating relativistic stars that account for both buoyant and rotational restoring forces, and apply them for the first time to the post-merger massive NSs. Our results show no evidence of large-scale convective instability, as both angle-averaged specific entropy and specific angular momentum increase outward within the massive NSs. Rotational effects significantly enhance stability for local regions that would be otherwise unstable by the Schwarzschild criterion. Additionally, our mode analysis of matter fields and gravitational waves reveals no excitation of observable inertial modes after the damping of quadrupolar $f$-modes in the massive NSs, contrasting with previous studies. As in many previous works, we observe the excitation of an $m=1$ one-armed mode. However, we also find that the growth of the $m=1$ mode amplitude after the merger may correlate strongly with the violation of linear momentum conservation, indicating that we cannot reject the possibility that the excitation of the one-armed mode has a numerical origin.</description>

      <title>Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a novel quantum protocol called Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation (TQET) between two separated parties $A$ and $B$, designed for transporting quantum energy across spacetime. The amount of energy gained through TQET is always greater than or equal to that obtained via natural time evolution for any spin chain where $A$ and $B$ are distinguishable. This protocol uses temporal and spatial quantum correlations between agents separated by space and time. The energy supplier injects energy into the system by measuring the ground state of a many-body system that evolves over time, while the distant recipient performs a conditional operation using feedback from the supplier. When Bob acts immediately after receiving Alice's outcome, the protocol reduces to conventional QET. We present a proof-of-concept demonstration in the Ising model using quantum simulations. TQET increases energy efficiency from approximately 3\% to around 40\%, representing over a 13-fold improvement compared to QET. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between entanglement in time and TQET, validating the role of temporal correlations in energy activation between agents across spacetime.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Harvesting from Quantum Field: Insights via the Partner Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the condition necessary for extracting entanglement from a quantum field through the use of two local modes A and B (detector modes). We show that Simon's entanglement criterion for the bipartite Gaussian state can be reformulated in terms of commutators between the canonical operators of the detector mode B and the partner mode P of the detector mode A. Using the profile representation of detector modes, we identify that harvesting is prohibited under certain specific conditions. According to analyses based on moving mirror models, Hawking radiation originates from the Milne modes at past null infinity, that reflect off at the mirror and ultimately transform into real particle modes. Drawing parallels between the Unruh effect and Hawking radiation, our findings indicate an absence of quantum correlations between ``real particles" emitted as Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Large $n$-point Functions in Resonant Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a qualitatively new regime of inflationary models with small and rapid oscillations in the potential--resonant non-Gaussianity. In contrast to the standard scenario, where most of the observable information is encoded in the power spectrum, in this regime the oscillatory signal predominantly appears in higher-order correlation functions with large $n$. This behavior emerges when the oscillation frequency $\omega$ exceeds the naive cutoff of the theory, $4\pi f$. However, as noted by Hook and Rattazzi [2306.12489], the actual cutoff is somewhat higher -- though only logarithmically -- when the amplitude of the oscillations is small. We identify a phenomenologically relevant window in which $n$-point functions with $3 \lesssim n \lesssim 9$ are potentially observable. In this regime, the signal exhibits 350-1000 oscillations per decade in $k$.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Foundations of the General Standard Model: A Unified Framework for Particle Physics and Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the General Standard Model (GSM), a recently proposed framework that unifies particle physics and cosmology within the Gravitational Quantum Field Theory (GQFT). Constructed from first principles based exclusively on the intrinsic properties of leptons and quarks, the GSM reveals an enlarged gauge symmetry structure, WS$_{c}$(1,3)$\times$GS(1)$\times$Z$_2$, which extends beyond the conventional U$_Y$(1)$\times$SU$_L$(2)$\times$SU$_C$(3) symmetry of the Standard Model. Here, WS$_{c}$(1,3) = SP(1,3)$\rtimes$W$^{1,3}\rtimes$SP$_c$(1,1) emerges as the conformal inhomogeneous spin gauge symmetry. Within GQFT, the GSM provides a consistent unification of the Standard Model of particle physics with cosmological models. It incorporates the four known fundamental interactions, electromagnetic, weak, strong, and gravitational, plus the Higgs scalar interaction, and also predicts novel interactions. These include spin gauge, chirality boost-spin gauge, chiral conformal-spin gauge, and scaling gauge forces, as well as additional scalar interactions. Furthermore, the GSM offers profound insights into the nature of gravity and spacetime and elucidates key mysteries of the dark side of the universe, such as the origins of dark matter, the dynamics of dark energy, and the physics of the early inflationary epoch. By establishing a new theoretical bridge between quantum field theory and general relativity, the GSM opens novel pathways for addressing long-standing challenges in fundamental physics. It provides a unified description of both fundamental interactions and cosmic evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anyons, unique to two spatial dimensions, underlie extraordinary phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, but their generalization to higher dimensions has remained elusive. The topology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces constrains the loop statistics to be only bosonic or fermionic in any dimension. In this work, we introduce the novel anyonic statistics for membrane excitations in four dimensions. Analogous to the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-particle exhibiting $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(2,N)}$ anyonic statistics in two dimensions, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-membrane possesses $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(3,N)}$ anyonic statistics in four dimensions. Given unitary volume operators that create membrane excitations on the boundary, we propose an explicit 56-step unitary sequence that detects the membrane statistics. We further analyze the boundary theory of $(5{+}1)$D 1-form $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry-protected topological phases and demonstrate that their domain walls realize all possible anyonic membrane statistics. We then show that the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ subgroup persists in all higher dimensions. In addition to the standard fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ membrane statistics arising from Stiefel-Whitney classes, membranes also exhibit $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics associated with Pontryagin classes. We explicitly verify that the 56-step process detects the nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics in 5, 6, and 7 spatial dimensions. Moreover, in 7 and higher dimensions, the statistics of membrane excitations stabilize to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$, with the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ sector consistently captured by this process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, systematic method for the complete symbolic reduction of multi-loop Feynman integrals, leveraging the power of generating functions. The differential equations governing these generating functions naturally yield symbolic recurrence relations. We develop an efficient algorithm that utilizes these recurrences to reduce integrals to a minimal set of master integrals. This approach circumvents the exponential growth of traditional integration-by-parts relations, enabling the reduction of high-rank, multi-loop integrals critical for state-of-the-art calculations in perturbative quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Vector Horndeski black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a spherically symmetric and static background, we study the existence of linearly stable black hole (BH) solutions in nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) with a Horndeski vector-tensor (HVT) coupling, with and without curvature singularities at the center ($r=0$). Incorporating the electric charge $q_E$ and the magnetic charge $q_M$, we first show that nonsingular BHs can exist only if $q_M = 0$. We then study the stability of purely electric BHs by analyzing the behavior of perturbations in the metric and the vector field. Nonsingular electric BHs are unstable due to a Laplacian instability in the vector perturbation near the regular center. In the absence of the HVT coupling ($\beta=0$), singular BHs in power-law NED theories can be consistent with all linear stability conditions, while Born-Infeld BHs encounter strong coupling due to a vanishing propagation speed as $r \to 0$. In power-law NED and Born-Infeld theories with $\beta \neq 0$, the electric fields for singular BHs are regular near $r=0$, while the metric functions behave as $\propto r^{-1}$. Nevertheless, we show that Laplacian instabilities occur for regions inside the outer horizon $r_h$, unless the HVT coupling constant $\beta$ is significantly smaller than $r_h^2$. For $\beta \neq 0$, we also reconstruct the NED Lagrangian so that one of the metric functions takes the Reissner-Nordstr\"om form. In this case, there exists a branch where all squared propagation speeds are positive, but the ghost and strong coupling problems are present around the BH center. Thus, the dominance of the HVT coupling generally leads to BH instability in the high-curvature regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider models of chaotic inflation driven by the real parts of a conjugate pair of Higgs superfields involved in the spontaneous breaking of a grand unification symmetry at a scale assuming its value within MSSM. We combine a superpotential, which is uniquely determined by applying a continuous R symmetry, with two fractional shift-symmetric Kaehler potentials introducing two free parameters (p,N). The inflationary observables provide an excellent match to the recent ACT data for 1.355&lt;=p&lt;=6.7 and 6x10^-5&lt;= N&lt;=0.7. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and possibly detectable primordial gravitational waves with (p,N) values of order unity. A solution to the mu problem of MSSM and baryogenesis via non-thermal leptogenesis can be also accommodated by embedding the model into a B-L extension of MSSM.</description>

Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) are magnetic fields generated during the early universe. These fields are thought to be the seeds of extragalactic magnetic fields. The origin of PMFs is not well known. Further, if they are indeed sources of extragalactic fields, then there is a possibility that observations of extragalactic magnetic fields could provide insights into the primordial physics. With this motivation, we study the generation of the primordial magnetic field in the context of loop quantum cosmology (LQC). In LQC, inflation is preceded by a quantum bounce. In this work, we consider an electromagnetic field coupled to the background as a test field and study its evolution through the bounce and through the subsequent inflationary phase. We investigate the power spectra generated in LQC and show that it is scale-dependent. We study the power spectra with different initial conditions, discuss equivalent forms of coupling functions, investigate backreaction, and compute the amount of primordial magnetic field which can be measured today. We conclude the article with a summary and discussion of the results.</description>

Abstract: False vacuum decay typically proceeds via the nucleation of spherical bubbles of true vacuum, described by $O(4)$ symmetric field configurations in Euclidean time. In this work, we investigate how the presence of cosmic strings can catalyze the decay process. To this end, we consider a complex scalar field charged under a global or local $U(1)$ symmetry. Assuming a non-trivial vacuum manifold, realizable for example in a simple sextic potential, we derive relativistic bounce solutions with $O(2) \times O(2)$ symmetry, corresponding to elongated bubbles seeded by a cosmic string of the same scalar field. Building up on earlier results in the literature, we identify the region of parameter space where vacuum decay predominantly proceeds via this alternative channel, thereby providing an explicit mechanism for the quantum decay of cosmic strings. Finally, we present an initial discussion of the gravitational wave signal associated with this type of vacuum decay and its possible connection to the recently observed stochastic signal in pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>The Nontrivial Vacuum Structure of an Extended $t\bar{t}$ BEH (Higgs) Bound State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent reformulation of top-quark condensation for the Brout-Englert-Higgs boson, we introduced an extended internal wave-function, $\phi(r)$. We show how this leads to a manifestly Lorentz invariant formalism, where the absence of ``relative time'' is a gauge invariance of the bilocal field theory. This dictates a novel and nontrivial Lorentz invariant vacuum structure for the BEH boson, the relativistic generalization of a condensed matter state such as a BCS condensate.</description>

      <title>Generalized Birkhoff theorems and 2+2 direct pruduct spacetimes in Weyl conformal gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study 2+2 direct product spacetimes sourced by separated electromagnetic and Yang--Mills fields within Weyl conformal gravity. We prove that all such configurations admit at least 2 independent, commuting non-null Killing vectors, which we use to find general solutions. As a special case, we obtain a generalization of the Birkhoff--Riegert theorem to all spacetimes containing a two-dimensional subspace of constant Gaussian curvature, and we also revisit the original formulation of the theorem. We further analyze the resulting solutions in terms of Weyl equivalence classes. Their connections to known solutions in both Weyl conformal gravity and Einstein gravity are established through conformal relations. We also examine the fundamental physical and geometric properties of the newly obtained configurations and their equivalence classes.</description>
