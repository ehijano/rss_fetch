      <title>Two concurrent exponential decays in a vacuum capacitor-resistor circuit: effect of surface charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relaxation in a vacuum capacitor-resistor circuit is comprised of two exponential decays, one caused by surface charge and the other by the decay of energy stored between the capacitor plates. A simple phenomenological model of this relaxation is shown to be supported by measurements even though Maxwell's equations are difficult to apply in this case. Similar behavior is also observed for polypropylene capacitors, indicating that this surface charge effect is applicable to all capacitors and potentially other circuit components.</description>

      <title>Acoustic and Electromagnetic Co-Modeling of Piezoelectric Devices at Millimeter Wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports the procedure for modeling piezoelectric acoustic resonators and filters at millimeter wave (mmWave). Different from conventional methods for lower frequency piezoelectric devices, we include both acoustic and electromagnetic (EM) effects, e.g., self-inductance, in both the circuit-level fitting and finite element analysis, toward higher accuracy at higher frequencies. To validate the method, thin-film lithium niobate (LiNbO3) first-order antisymmetric (A1) mode devices are used as the testbed, achieving great agreement for both the standalone resonators and a fifth-order ladder filter. Upon further development, the reported acoustic and EM co-modeling could guide the future design of compact piezoelectric devices at mmWave and beyond.</description>

      <title>Computing Elastic Tensors of Amorphous Materials from First-Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in modern semiconductor devices increasingly depend on the utilization of amorphous materials and the reduction of material thickness, pushing the boundaries of their physical capabilities. The mechanical properties of these thin layers are critical in determining both the operational efficacy and mechanical integrity of these devices. Unlike bulk crystalline materials, whose calculation techniques are well-established, amorphous materials present a challenge due to the significant variation in atomic topology and their non-affine transformations under external strain. This study introduces a novel method for computing the elastic tensor of amorphous materials, applicable to both bulk and ultra-thin films in the linear elastic regime using Density Functional Theory. We exemplify this method with a-SiO2, a commonly used dielectric. Our approach accounts for the structural disorder inherent in amorphous systems, which, while contributing to remarkable material properties, complicates traditional elastic tensor computation. We propose a solution involving the inability of atomic positions to relax under internal relaxation, near the boundaries of the computational unit cell, ensuring the affine transformations necessary for linear elasticity. This method's efficacy is demonstrated through its alignment with classical Young's modulus measurements, and has potential for broad application in fields such as Technology Computer Aided Design and stress analysis via Raman spectra. The revised technique for assessing the mechanical properties of amorphous materials opens new avenues for exploring their impact on device reliability and functionality.</description>

      <title>Magnetic nonreciprocity in a hybrid device of asymmetric artificial spin-ice-superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the size and distribution of potential barriers within a medium of interacting particles can unveil unique collective behaviors and innovative functionalities. In this study, we introduce a unique superconducting hybrid device using a novel artificial spin ice structure composed of asymmetric nanomagnets. This structure forms a distinctive superconducting pinning potential that steers unconventional motion of superconducting vortices, thereby inducing a magnetic nonreciprocal effect, in contrast to the electric nonreciprocal effect commonly observed in superconducting diodes. Furthermore, the polarity of the magnetic nonreciprocity is in-situ reversible through the tunable magnetic patterns of artificial spin ice. Our findings demonstrate that artificial spin ice not only precisely modulates superconducting characteristics but also opens the door to novel functionalities, offering a groundbreaking paradigm for superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Anomalously Strong Size Effect on Thermal Conductivity of Diamond Microparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamond has the known highest thermal conductivity of around \SI{2000}{\watt\per\meter\per\kelvin} and is therefore widely used for heat dissipation. In practical applications, synthetic diamond microparticles are usually assumed to have similar thermal conductivity to that of bulk diamond because the particle size is larger than theoretical phonon mean free path so that boundary scattering of heat-carrying phonons is absent. In this report, we find the thermal conductivity of diamond microparticles anomalously depends on their sizes. Thermal conductivity of diamond microparticles increases from \SI{400}{\watt\per\meter\per\kelvin} to \SI{2000}{\watt\per\meter\per\kelvin} with the size growing from \SI{20}{\micro\meter} to \SI{300}{\micro\meter}. We attribute the abnormally strong size effect to the long-range defects during the growth process based on analysis of point defects, dislocations, and thermal penetration depth dependence of thermal conductivity. Our results play a vital role in the design of diamond composites and in the improvement of thermal conductivity of synthetic diamonds.</description>

      <title>Integrated diode lasers for the generation of sub-GHz repetition rate frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate absorber-free passive and hybrid mode-locking at sub-GHz repetition rates using a hybrid integrated extended cavity diode laser around 1550 nm. The laser is based on InP as gain medium and a long Si$_3$N$_4$ feedback circuit, with three highly frequency selective microring resonators. The feedback resonators not only increases the cavity length up to 0.6 m to achieve sub-GHz repetition rates but also serve as a dispersive narrowband mirror for sharp spectral filtering, which enables Fourier domain mode-locking. We observe passive mode-locking with repetition rates below 500 MHz, with $\approx$ 15 comb lines at around 0.2 mW total power. To stabilize the repetition rate, hybrid mode-locking is demonstrated by weak RF modulation of the diode current at frequencies around 500 MHz. The RF injection reduces the Lorentzian linewidth component from 8.9 kHz to a detection limited value around 300 mHz. To measure the locking range of the repetition rate, the injected RF frequency is tuned with regard to the passive mode-locking frequency and the injected RF power is varied. The locking range increases approximately as a square-root function of the injected RF power. At 1 mW injection a wide locking range of about 80 MHz is obtained. We observe the laser maintaining stable mode-locking also when the DC diode pump current is increased from 40 mA to 190 mA, provided that the cavity length is maintained constant with thermo-refractive tuning.</description>

      <title>Control of the local and nonlocal electromagnetic response in all-dielectric reconfigurable metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable metasurfaces are potent platforms to control the propagation properties of light dynamically. Among different reconfiguration mechanisms available at optical frequencies, using non-volatile phase change materials is one of the most prominent. Tuning the refractive index of these materials, and thus changing the electromagnetic response of the device, can be achieved by external modulation that enables the transition between their amorphous and crystalline structural states. In this work, we study a structure that exploits these materials to fully control the electromagnetic response, i.e., electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic coupling. Powered by this controllability, we present how the metasurface can be designed to perform beam steering and switchable one-way absorption applications. In addition, we demonstrate that the same platform can be designed to work in a nonlocal regime to implement a more efficient way of controlling light.</description>

      <title>Near zero-field microwave-free magnetometry with ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cross-relaxation features near zero magnetic field with ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond and examine their properties in samples with a range (0.9 ppm - 16.0 ppm) of NV concentrations. The observed NV-NV cross-relaxation features between differently oriented NV centers in high (greater than 0.9 ppm)-NV-density samples hold promise for a variety of magnetometry applications where microwave fields (or any bias field) disturb the system under study. We theoretically determine the values of the bias magnetic fields corresponding to cross-relaxations between different axes and experimentally validate them. The behavior of zero-field cross-relaxation features as a function of temperature is also investigated.</description>
