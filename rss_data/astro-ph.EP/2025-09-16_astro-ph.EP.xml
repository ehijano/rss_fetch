      <title>VADER: A Variational Autoencoder to Infer Planetary Masses and Gas-Dust Disk Properties Around Young Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present \textbf{VADER} (Variational Autoencoder for Disks Embedded with Rings), for inferring both planet mass and global disk properties from high-resolution ALMA dust continuum images of protoplanetary disks (PPDs). VADER, a probabilistic deep learning model, enables uncertainty-aware inference of planet masses, $\alpha$-viscosity, dust-to-gas ratio, Stokes number, flaring index, and the number of planets directly from protoplanetary disk images. VADER is trained on over 100{,}000 synthetic images of PPDs generated from \texttt{FARGO3D} simulations post-processed with \texttt{RADMC3D}. Our trained model predicts physical planet and disk parameters with $R^2 &gt; 0.9$ from dust continuum images of PPDs. Applied to 23 real disks, VADER's mass estimates are consistent with literature values and reveal latent correlations that reflect known disk physics. Our results establish VAE-based generative models as robust tools for probabilistic astrophysical inference, with direct applications to interpreting protoplanetary disk substructures in the era of large interferometric surveys.</description>

      <title>Do Outer Giants Inflate Neptune-sized Planets? An Architecture-Dependent Mass-Radius Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanet demographics increasingly reveal that planetary properties depend not only on local irradiation and composition but also on the wider system architecture. We analyse a sample of Neptune-sized short-period planets with well-measured masses and radii, identifying those whose host stars harbour at least one confirmed outer-giant (OG) companion. On the mass-radius (M-R) plane, the two populations diverge modestly: inner planets in OG systems cluster at systematically larger radii than their counterparts in no-giant (NG) systems, a result that remains suggestive after controlling for planet and stellar properties. Bayesian modelling quantifies the offset, revealing an average radius enhancement of $17 \pm 4 \%$ for inner planets in OG systems relative to NG systems at fixed mass. Alternative cuts, including the use of a homogeneous set of parameters, confirm the robustness of the signal, though the result still relies on small-number statistics. Possible mechanisms for the observed inflation include boosted envelope accretion, reduced atmospheric loss, or volatile enrichment by giant-planet stirring. If upheld, this empirical link between outer giants and inflated inner-planet radii offers a new constraint on coupled formation and evolution in planetary systems.</description>

      <title>No Giant Planets in the Eta Cassiopeiae System: Dynamical Implications of a Wide Binary Companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the vast number of stars that exist within binary systems, it remains important to explore the effect of binary star environments on the formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems. Nearby binaries provide opportunities to characterize their properties and orbits through a combination of radial velocities, astrometry, and direct imaging. Eta Cassiopeiae is a bright, well-known binary system for which recent observations have provided greatly improved stellar masses and orbital parameters. We present additional radial velocity data that are used to perform an injection-recovery analysis for potential planetary signatures. We further provide a detailed dynamical study that explores the viability of planetary orbits throughout the system. Our combined analysis shows that giant planets are significantly ruled out for the system, and indeed no planetary orbits are viable beyond $\sim$8 AU of the primary star. However, terrestrial planets may yet exist within the Habitable Zone where orbits can remain long-term stable. We discuss the implications of these results, highlighting the effect of wide binary companions on giant planet formation, and the consequences for occurrence rates and planetary habitability.</description>

      <title>Catastrophic disruption of asteroid 2023 CX1 and implications for planetary defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitigation of the threat from airbursting asteroids requires an understanding of the potential risk they pose for the ground. How asteroids release their kinetic energy in the atmosphere is not well understood due to the rarity of significant impacts. Ordinary chondrites, in particular L chondrites, represent a frequent type of Earth-impacting asteroids. Here, we present the first comprehensive, space-to-lab characterization of an L chondrite impact. Small asteroid 2023 CX1 was detected in space and predicted to impact over Normandy, France, on 13 February 2023. Observations from multiple independent sensors and reduction techniques revealed an unusual but potentially high-risk fragmentation behavior. The nearly spherical 650 $\pm$ 160 kg (72 $\pm$ 6 cm diameter) asteroid catastrophically fragmented around 28 km altitude, releasing 98% of its total energy in a concentrated region of the atmosphere. The resulting shockwave was spherical, not cylindrical, and released more energy closer to the ground. This type of fragmentation increases the risk of significant damage at ground level. These results warrant consideration for a planetary defense strategy for cases where a &gt;3-4 MPa dynamic pressure is expected, including planning for evacuation of areas beneath anticipated disruption locations.</description>

      <title>BOWIE-ALIGN: Weak spectral features in KELT-7b's JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum imply a high cloud deck or a low-metallicity atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters and their atmospheres are prime targets for transmission spectroscopy due to their extended atmospheres and the corresponding large signal-to-noise, providing the best possible constraints for the atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio and metallicity of exoplanets. Within BOWIE-ALIGN, we aim to compare JWST spectra of a sample of orbitally aligned and misaligned hot Jupiters orbiting F-type stars to probe the link between hot Jupiter atmospheres and planet formation history. Here, we present a near-infrared transmission spectrum of the aligned planet KELT-7b using one transit observed with JWST NIRSpec/G395H. We find weak features, only tentative evidence for H$_2$O and CO$_2$ in the atmosphere of KELT-7b. This poses a challenge to constrain the atmospheric properties of KELT-7b and two possible scenarios emerge from equilibrium chemistry and free chemistry retrievals: a high-altitude cloud deck muting all features or an extremely low metallicity atmosphere, respectively. The retrieved C/O ratios from our data reductions range from $0.43 - 0.74$, while the atmospheric metallicity is suggested to be solar to super-solar ($1-16 \times$ solar). Although these wide constraints prevent detailed conclusions about KELT-7b's formation history, a solar-to-super-solar metallicity would imply the accretion of solid material during its formation, which is valuable information for the survey's wider goals of understanding the relative importance of gaseous to solid accretion.</description>

      <title>Identifying Fixed Points in the Three-Body Problem Using a High-Order Transfer Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic orbits (POs) play a central role in the circular restricted three-body problem (CRTBP). This paper introduces a method to search for POs by identifying single- and multiple-revolution fixed points in chosen Poincare maps that describe the CRTBP dynamics, with a theoretical capability to detect all fixed points across arbitrary revolution counts exhaustively.First, high-order transfer maps (HOTMs), represented as polynomials, are constructed within the differential algebra (DA) framework for both planar and spatial CRTBP to map states between successive Poincare section crossings, with the Jacobi constant used to reduce the number of independent variables. Next, an automatic domain splitting (ADS) strategy is employed to generate subdomains, preserving HOTM accuracy, with an integrated feasibility estimation to reduce ADS's computation burden.Then, a two-stage HOTM-based polynomial optimization framework is introduced, first identifying combinable subdomain sequences and then refining the fixed point solutions. Finally, the method is applied to the Earth-Moon CRTBP, identifying POs up to nine revolutions in the planar case and four in the spatial case. Known families such as distant retrograde orbits (DROs) and Lyapunov orbits are recovered, along with a previously undocumented family that exhibits a hybrid character between DROs and Lyapunov orbits.</description>

      <title>Cislunar Resonant Transport and Heteroclinic Pathways: From 3:1 to 2:1 to L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical structure of cislunar space beyond geosynchronous orbit is critical for both lunar exploration and for high-Earth-orbiting trajectories. In this study, we investigate the role of mean-motion resonances and their associated heteroclinic connections in enabling natural semi-major axis transport in the Earth-Moon system. Working within the planar circular restricted three-body problem, we compute and analyze families of periodic orbits associated with the interior 4:1, 3:1, and 2:1 lunar resonances. These families exhibit a rich bifurcation structure, including transitions between prograde and retrograde branches and connections through collision orbits. We construct stable and unstable manifolds of the unstable resonant orbits using a perigee-based Poincar\'e map, and identify heteroclinic connections - both between resonant orbits and with lunar $L_1$ libration-point orbits - across a range of Jacobi constant values. Using a new generalized distance metric to quantify the closeness between trajectories, we establish operational times-of-flight for such heteroclinic-type orbit-to-orbit transfers. These connections reveal ballistic, zero-$\Delta v$ pathways that achieve major orbit changes within reasonable times-of-flight, thus defining a network of accessible semi-major axes. Our results provide a new dynamical framework for long-term spacecraft evolution and cislunar mission design, particularly in regimes where lunar gravity strongly perturbs high Earth orbits.</description>

      <title>Multiple Giant Impacts and Chemical Equilibria: An Integrated Approach to Rocky Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the formation of rocky planets, the surface environments of growing protoplanets were dramatically different from those of present-day planets. The release of gravitational energy during accretion would have maintained a molten surface layer, forming a magma ocean. Simultaneously, sufficiently massive protoplanets could acquire hydrogen-rich proto-atmospheres by capturing gas from the protoplanetary disk. Chemical equilibration among the atmosphere, magma ocean, and iron core plays a key role in determining the planet's interior composition. In this study, we investigate terrestrial planet formation under such primitive surface conditions. We conduct N-body simulations to model the collisional growth from protoplanets to planets, coupled with chemical equilibrium calculations at each giant impact event, where surface melting occurs. Our results show that planetary growth proceeds through a series of giant impacts, and the timing of these impacts relative to the dissipation of disk gas significantly influences the volatile budget. In particular, initial impacts, occurring while nebular gas is still present, can lead to excess hydrogen incorporation into the protoplanet's core. Subsequent impacts with hydrogen-poor bodies, after gas dispersal, can dilute this hydrogen content. This process allows for the formation of a planet with a hydrogen inventory consistent with Earth's current core. Our findings suggest that late giant impacts, occurring after the depletion of nebular gas, provide a viable mechanism for producing Earth-like interior compositions near 1 AU.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in the 2021/2022 apparition. I. Photometry, spectroscopy, morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during its 2021/22 apparition, aiming to investigate its dust and gas environment and compare the results with those obtained in 2015/16 using the same telescope. Quasi-simultaneous photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric observations were carried out at the 6-m BTA SAO telescope. The comet was observed on 6 October 2021, 31 days before perihelion, with \textit{g}-SDSS and \textit{r}-SDSS filters, and on 6 February 2022, 96 days after perihelion, using narrowband cometary filters: BC ($\lambda4450/62$~\AA), RC ($\lambda6839/96$~\AA), and CN ($\lambda3870/58$~\AA). These were complemented by images from the 2-m Liverpool Telescope (La Palma). On 6 October 2021, a sunward jet and long dust tail were detected. By 6 February 2022, the dust coma morphology had changed noticeably, revealing a bright sunward neckline structure superimposed on the projected dust tail, along with two jets at position angles of 133$^{\circ}$ and 193$^{\circ}$. Spectra showed strong CN emission, with relatively weak C$_2$, C$_3$ and NH$_2$ emissions. The dust production rate $Af\rho$ did not exceed 200~cm (uncorrected for phase angle) in both epochs. An unusual CN coma morphology was observed, with evidence of an additional CN source associated with dust jets. Geometric modeling of the jets' dynamics indicated an active area at latitude $-70^{\circ} \pm 4^{\circ}$ with a jet opening angle of $20^{\circ} \pm 6^{\circ}$ on 6 October 2021, and two active areas at latitudes $-58^{\circ} \pm 5^{\circ}$ and $-53^{\circ} \pm 10^{\circ}$, separated by longitude $150^{\circ} \pm 20^{\circ}$, producing the observed jets on 6 February 2022. The average particle velocity in the jets was about $0.32 \pm 0.04$~km~s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>TSD: An inverse problem approach for recovering the exoplanetary atmosphere transmission spectrum from high-resolution spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our ability to observe, detect, and characterize exoplanetary atmospheres has grown by leaps and bounds over the last 20 years, aided largely by developments in astronomical instrumentation; improvements in data analysis techniques; and an increase in the sophistication and availability of spectroscopic models. Over this time, detections have been made for a number of important molecular species across a range of wavelengths and spectral resolutions. Ground-based observations at high resolution are particularly valuable due to the high contrast achievable between the stellar spectral continuum and the cores of resolved exoplanet absorption features. However, the model-independent retrieval of such features remains a major hurdle in data analysis, with traditional methods being limited by both the choice of algorithm used to remove the non-exoplanetary components of the signal, as well as the accuracy of model template spectra used for cross-correlation. Here we present a new algorithm TSD (Transmission Spectroscopy Decomposition) formulated as an inverse problem in order to minimize the number of assumptions and theoretically modelled components included in the retrieval. Instead of cross-correlation with pre-computed template exoplanet spectra, we rely on high spectral resolution and instrument stability to distinguish between the stellar, exoplanetary, and telluric components and velocity frames in the sequence of absorption spectra taken during multiple transits. We demonstrate the performance of our new method using both simulated and real K band observations from ESO's VLT/CRIRES+ instrument, and present results obtained from two transits of the highly-inflated super-Neptune WASP-107 b which orbits a nearby K7V star.</description>

      <title>Deimos photometric properties: analysis of 20 years of observations (2004-2024) by the Mars Express HRSC camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this study is to analyze the photometric properties of Deimos using Mars Express (MEX) observations, to improve the photometric properties and provide new insights into the texture and composition of the surface of Deimos, in preparation for the MMX mission. We analyzed the data obtained by the HRSC and the SRC cameras onboard MEX. The HRSC data, obtained through the use of four filters (blue, green, red, IR), provides 390 to 800 m/px resolution, while the SRC data reach 85 to 300 m/px and cover a wide phase angle range (0.06-138{\deg}). We performed the disk-integrated and disk-resolved photometric analysis using the Hapke model. The Deimos surface is dark and predominantly backscattering, with a single-scattering albedo (SSA) value (6.8%-7.5%) comparable to Phobos. The Deimos phase curve shows a strong opposition effect due to shadow-hiding, with negligible coherent backscattering. The amplitude and the half-width of the shadow-hiding opposition surge were found to be 2.14 +/- 0.14 and 0.065 +/- 0.004, respectively. We found a high porosity of 86% at the top-layer surface, consistent with complex-shaped grains or fractal aggregates, suggesting a thick dust layer. We did not observe significant variations of the opposition surge across the surface. A blue unit on Deimos, located on streamers of the equatorial ridge, shows reflectance increases up to 58%, and a spectral slope decrease of 50% in comparison with the average surface. This blue unit may be due to a different texture of the surface between the two units, with finer grain and/or higher porosity. Deimos photometric properties, including SSA, opposition surge, and phase integral, are very similar to Phobos. The presence of a blue unit on Deimos reinforces the idea that the Martian moons have a common origin, making the capture of two different bodies with such similar properties unlikely.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric radiation in binary systems: Implications for disk evolution and chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current models of binary systems often depend on simplified approach of the radiation field, which are unlikely to accurately capture the complexities of asymmetric environments. We investigate the dynamical and chemical implications of a 3D asymmetric radiation field that accounts for the optical properties of sub-structures present in a protoplanetary disk, as well as the inclusion of a secondary radiation source in binary systems. We conducted a series of 3D-SPH hydrodynamical simulations using PHANTOM, coupled with the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code MCFOST, to compute disc temperatures on-the-fly. We explored different binary-disk orientations (0$^o$ and 30$^o$) for an eccentric binary, along with a constant dust-to-gas ratio and dust as a mixture prescription. We also simulated an outburst event as an example of a drastic increase in luminosity. Heating from the secondary star inflates the outer disk, increasing the aspect ratio facing the companion by about 25% in inclined cases compared to 10% in coplanar ones. Dust settling in the mid-plane enhances extinction along the disk plane, making the coplanar case cooler than the inclined one on the side of the disk facing the companion. Besides, heating causes a shift in the snow line for species with freeze-out temperatures below 50 K, depending on the disk-binary inclination and binary phase. During outbursts, the aspect ratio doubles on the star-facing side and increases by 50% on the opposite side in inclined cases. The snow line shift would impact all the species considered in the outburst case. Disk heating in binaries depends on stellar properties, orbital phase, and disk local and global characteristics. This results in temperature asymmetries, especially during secondary star outbursts, leading to variations in aspect ratio and snow lines that can affect chemistry and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Puffed-up Inner Rings and Razor-thin Outer Rings in Structured Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vertical distribution of pebbles in protoplanetary disks is a fundamental property influencing planet formation, from dust aggregation to the assembly of planetary cores. In the outer region of protoplanetary disks, the intensity of the optically thin but geometrically thick dust ring decreases along the minor axis due to reduced line-of-sight optical depth. Multi-ring disks thus provide an excellent opportunity to study the radial variation of the vertical properties of dust. We investigate the vertical dust distribution in 6 protoplanetary disks with resolved double rings, using high-resolution ALMA Band 6 continuum observations. By modeling the azimuthal intensity variations in these rings, we constrain the dust scale heights for each ring. Our results reveal a dichotomy: inner rings exhibit puffed-up dust layers with heights comparable to the gas scale height, while outer rings are significantly more settled, with dust scale heights less than 20\% of the gas scale height. This suggests a radial dependence in dust settling efficiency within the disks, potentially driven by localized planetary interactions or the global radial dependence of the Vertical Shear Instability (VSI). We discuss the implications of these findings for dust trapping, planet formation, and protoplanetary disk evolution. Our work highlights the importance of vertical dust distribution in understanding the early stages of planet formation and suggests that outer ($&gt;80$~au), settled rings are preferred sites for planet formation over inner ($&lt;80$~au), turbulent rings.</description>

      <title>Massive Retrograde Moons May Survive During Different Hot Jupiters' Migration Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for exomoons is attempted via Kepler and TESS, but none is confirmed. Theoretically, similar with Jupiter, the gas giants are possible to generate moons. However, HJs which are considered to form outside and then move close to the star are thought not easy to sustain the original moons via dynamical effects. In this paper, we assume the HJ to form at 1 AU and move inward via disk migration or migration due to planet secular coplanar. Then we simulate the dynamics of exomoon-planet systems during migration, and we want to study the fates of different original moons. We find that both prograde and retrograde moons could maintain stable after disk migration, although the retained fraction of retrograde moons is 5 times higher than the prograde moons. Only massive and retrograde moons (greater than 10 Earth masses) might survive around HJs during the coplanar excitation. Furthermore, 6\% of the original Jupiter-like planet can also form free-floating planets after undergoing coplanar excitation, and most of them retain their moons. Our results focus on the fate of the exomoons and provide a clue on where to find the moon for future missions.</description>

      <title>Redefining interiors and envelopes: hydrogen-silicate miscibility and its consequences for the structure and evolution of sub-Neptunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first evolving interior structure model for sub-Neptunes that accounts for the miscibility between silicate magma and hydrogen. Silicate and hydrogen are miscible above $\sim 4000$K at pressures relevant to sub-Neptune interiors. Using the H$_2$-MgSiO$_3$ phase diagram, we self-consistently couple physics and chemistry to determine the radial extent of the fully miscible interior. Above this region lies the envelope, where hydrogen and silicates are immiscible and exist in both gaseous and melt phases. The binodal surface, representing a phase transition, provides a physically/chemically informed boundary between a planet's "interior" and "envelope". We find that young sub-Neptunes can store several tens of per cent of their hydrogen mass within their interiors. As the planet cools, its radius and the binodal surface contract, and the temperature at the binodal drops from $\sim 4000$K to $\sim 3000$K. Since the planet's interior stores hydrogen, its density is lower than that of pure-silicate. Gravitational contraction and thermal evolution lead to hydrogen exsolving from the interior into the envelope. This process slows planetary contraction compared to models without miscibility, potentially producing observable signatures in young sub-Neptune populations. At early times ($\sim 10$-$100$Myr), the high temperature at the binodal surface results in more silicate vapour in the envelope, increasing its mean molecular weight and enabling convection inhibition. After $\sim$Gyr of evolution, most hydrogen has exsolved, and the radii of miscible and immiscible models converge. However, the internal distribution of hydrogen and silicates remains distinct, with some hydrogen retained in the interior.</description>

      <title>SIMBA: A Python-based single-point astrochemical solver and analysis tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining molecular abundances in astrophysical environments is crucial for interpreting observational data and constraining physical conditions in these regions. Chemical modelling tools are essential for simulating the complex processes that govern molecular evolution. We present SIMBA, a new Python-based single-point astrochemical modelling package designed to solve chemical reaction networks across diverse astrophysical environments. The software follows standardised rate equation approaches to evolve molecular abundances under specified physical conditions, incorporating gas-phase chemistry, grain-surface processes, and photochemistry. While leveraging Python for accessibility, performance-critical routines utilise just-in-time compilation to achieve computational efficiency suitable for research applications. A key feature of SIMBA is its graphical interface, which enables rapid investigation of chemical evolution under varying physical conditions. This makes it particularly valuable for exploring parameter dependencies and complementing more computationally intensive multi-dimensional models. We demonstrate the package's capabilities by modelling chemical evolution in a photoevaporative flow driven by external FUV irradiation. Using simplified gas dynamics, we chain multiple SIMBA instances to create a dynamic 1D model where gas evolves both chemically and dynamically. Comparing this approach to typical static models - where chemistry in each grid cell evolves independently - reveals that molecular ices, especially those with relatively high binding energies like H2O, can survive much farther into the flow than static models predict. This example case highlights how SIMBA can be extended to higher dimensions for investigating complex chemical processes. The package is open-source and includes comprehensive documentation.</description>

      <title>Space Mission Options for Reconnaissance and Mitigation of Asteroid 2024 YR4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-Earth asteroid 2024 YR4 was discovered on 2024-12-27 and its probability of Earth impact in December 2032 peaked at about 3% on 2025-02-18. Additional observations ruled out Earth impact by 2025-02-23. However, the probability of lunar impact in December 2032 then rose, reaching about 4% by the end of the apparition in May 2025. James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations on 2025-03-26 estimated the asteroid's diameter at 60 +/- 7 m. Studies of 2024 YR4's potential lunar impact effects suggest lunar ejecta could increase micrometeoroid debris flux in low Earth orbit up to 1000 times above background levels over just a few days, possibly threatening astronauts and spacecraft. In this work, we present options for space missions to 2024 YR4 that could be utilized if lunar impact is confirmed. We cover flyby &amp; rendezvous reconnaissance, deflection, and robust disruption of the asteroid. We examine both rapid-response and delayed launch options through 2032. We evaluate chemical and solar electric propulsion, various launch vehicles, optimized deep space maneuvers, and gravity assists. Re-tasking extant spacecraft and using built spacecraft not yet launched are also considered. The best reconnaissance mission options launch in late 2028, leaving only approximately three years for development at the time of this writing in August 2025. Deflection missions were assessed and appear impractical. However, kinetic robust disruption missions are available with launches between April 2030 and April 2032. Nuclear robust disruption missions are also available with launches between late 2029 and late 2031. Finally, even if lunar impact is ruled out there is significant potential utility in deploying a reconnaissance mission to characterize the asteroid.</description>

      <title>Increasing science yield with a twilight observing program with the SCALES instrument at Keck</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While astronomical twilight closes the observing window for optical astronomers, the infrared sky remains dark even through sunrise, allowing IR astronomers to observe through twilight. The Slicer Combined with an Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy (SCALES) instrument is a 2-5 micron coronagraphic integral field spectrograph scheduled to arrive at Keck in early 2026. SCALES has the potential to execute exciting science and support the astronomical community and upcoming NASA missions through a dedicated cadenced twilight observing program. We estimate that the current twilight observing program on Keck conducts 18+-1 hours per year of science observations; a facilitized twilight observing program that is prioritized by the observatory could yield 151+-2 hours of science time per year. This work presents the scientific motivation and high-level feasibility of two primary SCALES twilight science cases, monitoring of Solar System objects and a high-contrast imaging search for exoplanets around bright nearby stars, taking lessons from the existing NIRC2 and OSIRIS Twilight Zone program and considering increases in program scope. We also consider technical and operational challenges to overcome before the SCALES instrument begins its twilight observing program.</description>

      <title>Probing Stellar Kinematics with the Time-Asymmetric Hanbury Brown and Twiss Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intensity interferometry (II) offers a powerful means to observe stellar objects with a high resolution. In this work, we demonstrate that II can also probe internal stellar kinematics by revealing a time-asymmetric Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) effect, causing a measurable shift in the temporal correlation peak away from zero delay. We develop numerical models to simulate this effect for two distinct astrophysical scenarios: an emission-line circumstellar disk and an absorption-line binary system. Our simulations reveal a clear sensitivity of this temporal asymmetry to the system's inclination angle, velocity symmetry, and internal dynamics. This suggests that, with sufficiently high time resolution, II can be used to extract quantitative information about internal kinematics, offering a new observational window on stellar dynamics.</description>

      <title>Apache Point rapid response characterization of primitive imminent impactor 2024 RW$_1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imminent impactors may be detected only a few hours before their impact with Earth, providing a brief opportunity to characterize them before impact. We describe the characterization of imminent impactor 2024 RW$_1$, which was discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey on 2024 September 4 at 05:43 UTC, before it entered the atmosphere near the northern Philippines at 16:39 UTC. We observed 2024 RW$_1$ with the Astrophysical Research Consortium Telescope Imaging Camera on the Apache Point Astrophysical Research Consortium's 3.5-m telescope on 2024 September 4 10:16 UTC. We obtained g, r, i, and z photometry of 2024 RW$_1$, yielding color indices of g-r = 0.47$\pm$0.04, r-i = 0.13$\pm$0.04, i-z = -0.11$\pm$0.07, and g-i = 0.60$\pm$0.04, corresponding to a spectral slope of 0.67$\pm$0.40~$\%$/100 nm. The closest match to an asteroid spectral type is with B-type asteroids from the C-complex. We detect variations in the time series photometry of the asteroid with an amplitude of $\sim$0.75, and a double-peaked rotation period of $\sim$1900 s. Assuming a visible albedo of 0.07$\pm$0.03, a density of $\sim$1500 kg/m$^3$, and a calculated absolute magnitude of 30.92$\pm$0.05, we estimate that the asteroid has a diameter of 3.3$\pm$0.7 m and a total mass of $\sim$28,000 kg. Comparing our astrometric orbital solutions to NEOMOD3, the most likely source of 2024 RW$_1$ is the 3:1 main belt mean motion resonance (77\% probability) followed by the $\nu_6$ resonance (13\% probability), consistent with its organic B-type nature.</description>

      <title>Granulation on a quiet K dwarf: HD 166620 I. Spectral signatures as a function of line-formation temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Radial velocity (RV) spectrographs reach unprecedented precision and stability below 1 m/s, the challenge of granulation in the context of exoplanet detection has intensified. Despite promising advancements in post-processing tools, granulation remains a significant concern for the EPRV community. We present a pilot study to detect and characterise granulation using the High-Accuracy Radial-velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) spectrograph. We observed HD166620, a K2 star in the Maunder Minimum phase, intensely for two successive nights, expecting granulation to be the dominant nightly noise source in the absence of strong magnetic activity. Following the correction for a newly identified instrumental signature arising from illumination variations across the CCD, we detected the granulation signal using structure functions and a one-component Gaussian Process (GP) model. The granulation signal exhibits a characteristic timescale of 43.65$\pm$15.8 minutes, within one $\sigma$, and a standard deviation of 22.9$\pm$0.77 cm/s, with in three $\sigma$ of the predicted value. By examining spectra and RVs as a function of line formation temperature , we investigated the sensitivity of granulation-induced RV variations across different photospheric layers. We extracted RVs from various photospheric depths using both the line-by-line (LBL) and cross-correlation function (CCF) methods to mitigate any extraction method biases. Our findings indicate that granulation variability is detectable in both temperature bins, with the cooler bins, corresponding to the shallower layers of the photosphere, aligning more closely with predicted values.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of time on Mars with lunar and terrestrial clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As space exploration extends into cislunar space and further towards Mars, understanding the relativistic effects on clocks on Mars, particularly in relation to multibody gravitational influences, becomes increasingly important for accurate clock synchronization. This study estimates clock rates on Mars and compares them to those on the Moon and Earth. We find that, on average, clocks on Mars tick faster than those on the Earth's geoid by 477 microseconds per day, with a variation of 226 microseconds per day over a Martian year. Additionally, there is an amplitude modulation of approximately 40 microseconds per day over seven synodic cycles. We also introduce a formalism for addressing the effects of solar tides on the Earth-Moon system for predicting clock rates on the Moon and Mars more accurately when compared to using only Keplerian orbit approximations. Our analysis quantifies the relativistic proper time offsets among Martian, lunar, and terrestrial clocks, highlighting important implications for mission planning and the implementation of timekeeping systems on Mars.</description>
