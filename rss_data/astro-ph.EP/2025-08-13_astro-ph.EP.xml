      <title>Primordial planet spin driven by boundary layer effects in a decretion disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion of material from a protoplanetary disc on to a forming giant planet can spin the planet up to close to its breakup rate, $\Omega_{\rm b}=(G M_{\rm p}/R_{\rm p}^3)$, where $M_{\rm p}$ is the mass and $R_{\rm p}$ is the radius of the planet. After the protoplanetary disc dissipates, the rapidly rotating planet may eject a decretion (outflowing) disc in a similar way to a Be star. Boundary layer effects in a hydrodynamic disc allow for decretion disc formation at spin rates below the breakup spin rate of the planet. The decretion disc exerts a torque on the planet that slows its spin to an equilibrium value that is sensitive to the planet temperature. By considering steady state circumplanetary decretion disc solutions, we show that the equilibrium spin rate for planets is around $0.4\,\Omega_{\rm b}$ for $H/R=0.2$ and around $0.2\,\Omega_{\rm b}$ for $H/R=0.3$, where $H$ is the disc scale height at radius $R$. These values are in line with the spins of the giant planets in the solar system and observed exoplanet spins.</description>

      <title>Dynamos driven by top-heavy double-diffusive convection in the strong-field regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic fields of terrestrial planets are generated in their liquid cores through dynamo action driven by thermal and compositional convection. The coexistence of these two buoyancy sources gives rise to double-diffusive convection (DDC) due to the contrast between thermal and compositional diffusivities. However, most dynamo simulations adopt the co-density model, where the two diffusivities are assumed to be equal. In this study, we performed both hydrodynamic and dynamo simulations of top-heavy DDC in a rotating spherical shell with the Lewis number $Le=100$, and compared them with corresponding co-density models. In the hydrodynamic regime, the convective flow morphology is strongly influenced by the nature of the buoyancy sources. However, our dynamo simulations in the strong-field regime demonstrate that the co-density and DDC models yield qualitatively similar magnetic fields at comparable magnetic Reynolds numbers, albeit with some differences in detail. These numerical models further justify the use of the co-density model in planetary dynamo simulations. Finally, we demonstrate that dynamo models based on DDC and co-density produce similar magnetic fields and secular variations at the core-mantle boundary. This suggests that it may not be possible to distinguish the buoyancy sources responsible for planetary dynamos based solely on magnetic field observations.</description>

      <title>The watery atmosphere of HD~209458~b revealed by joint $K$- and $L$-band high-resolution spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a joint analysis of high-resolution $K$- and $L$-band observations of the benchmark hot Jupiter \hdb\ from the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC). One half night of observations were obtained in each bandpass covering similar pre-eclipse phases. The two epochs were then jointly analyzed using our atmospheric retrieval pipeline based on \petit\ to constrain the atmospheric pressure-temperature profile and chemical composition. Consistent with recent results from \textit{JWST} observations at lower spectral resolution, we obtain an oxygen-rich composition for \hdb\ ($\rm C/O &lt; 10^{-3}$ at 95\% confidence) and a lower limit on the volatile metallicity similar to the solar value ($\rm [(C+O)/H] &gt; -0.2$ at 95\% confidence). Leveraging the large spectral grasp of the multi-band observations, we constrain the H$_2$O mixing ratio to $\rm \log H_2O_{VMR} &gt; -3.1$ at 95\% confidence, and obtain 95\% upper limits on the atmospheric mixing ratios of CO ($&lt;10^{-4.8}$), CH$_4$ ($&lt;10^{-4.5}$), NH$_3$ ($&lt;10^{-5.8}$), H$_2$S ($&lt;10^{-3.3}$), and HCN ($&lt;10^{-5.6}$). The limits on CH$_4$, NH$_3$, and HCN are consistent with recent results from \textit{JWST} transmission spectroscopy, demonstrating the value of multi-band ground-based high resolution spectroscopy for precisely constraining trace species abundances in exoplanet atmospheres. The retrieved low-C/O, moderate-metallicity composition for \hdb\ is consistent with formation scenarios involving late accretion of substantial quantities of oxygen-rich refractory solids and/or ices.</description>

      <title>Linking planet formation to exoplanet characteristics: C/O as a diagnostic of planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas-giant exoplanets are test cases for theories of planet formation as their atmospheres are proposed to carry signatures of their formation within the protoplanetary disk. The metallicity and C/O are key diagnostics, allowing to distinguish formation location within the disk (e.g., relative to snowlines), and mechanism (e.g., core accretion versus gravitational instability). We can now probe the composition of the planet-forming regions of disks, and that in gas-giant exoplanets, to scrutinise these theories and diagnostics. So far, ALMA has revealed that the outer disk regions are typically metal-depleted and O-poor, whereas JWST is showing that the inner disk regions around Sun-like stars are mostly O-rich. Further, JWST is showing that most transiting gas-giant planets are typically metal-enriched and O-rich, consistent with formation at/within the water snowline and pollution by icy bodies. There is emerging an arguably "conventional" picture of gas-giant planet formation for transiting planets, to be confirmed, of course, with future data.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Exoplanet Detection: A Comparative Analysis Using Kepler Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of exoplanets has expanded our understanding of planetary systems and opened new avenues for astronomical research. In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework for exoplanet identification using a time-series photometric dataset from the Kepler Space Telescope, comprising 3,198 flux measurements across 5,074 stars. We investigate the performance of four supervised classification algorithms, namely Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, using a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), confusion matrices, and learning curves. Among the models, Random Forest achieves the highest accuracy (99.8\%) and near-perfect F1-scores, demonstrating superior generalization and robustness. KNN also performs strongly, achieving 99.3\% accuracy, while Decision Tree demonstrates moderate performance with 97.1\% accuracy, and Logistic Regression trails behind with the lowest accuracy and generalization at 95.8\%. Notably, the application of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) significantly improves performance across all models by addressing class imbalance. These findings underscore the effectiveness of ensemble-based machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forest, in handling large volumes of photometric data for automated exoplanet detection. This approach holds significant potential for implementation at ground-based facilities, such as the Iranian National Observatory (INO), where such extensive and precise datasets can further advance exoplanet discovery and characterization efforts.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 10,059 new three-dimensional periodic orbits of general three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A very few three-dimensional (3D) periodic orbits of general three-body problem (with three finite masses) have been discovered since Newton mentioned it in 1680s. Using a high-accuracy numerical strategy we discovered 10,059 three-dimensional periodic orbits of the three-body problem in the cases of $m_{1}=m_{2}=1$ and $m_{3}=0.1n$ where $1\leq n\leq 20$ is an integer, among which 1,996 (about 20\%) are linearly stable. Note that our approach is valid for arbitrary mass $m_{3}$ so that in theory we can gain an arbitrarily large amount of 3D periodic orbits of the three-body problem. In the case of three equal masses, we discovered twenty-one 3D ``choerographical'' periodic orbits whose three bodies move periodically in a single closed orbit. It is very interesting that, in the case of two equal masses, we discovered 273 three-dimensional periodic orbits with the two bodies ($m_{1}=m_{2}=1$) moving along a single closed orbit and the third ($m_{3}\neq 1$) along a different one: we name them ``piano-trio'' orbits, like a trio for two violins and one piano. To the best of our knowledge, all of these 3D periodic orbits have never been reported, indicating the novelty of this work. The large amount of these new 3D periodic orbits are helpful for us to have better understandings about chaotic properties of the famous three-body problem, which ``are, so to say, the only opening through which we can try to penetrate in a place which, up to now, was supposed to be inaccessible'', as pointed out by Poincar\'e, the founder of chaos theory.</description>

      <title>The Loeb Scale: Astronomical Classification of Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to increase interstellar object (ISO) detections from a few over the past decade to potentially one per few months, demanding a systematic classification scheme. We present the Loeb Scale, formally the Interstellar Object Significance Scale (IOSS), a 0-10 classification system extending the proven Torino Scale framework, to address ISOs' unique anomalies, including potential technosignatures. The scale provides quantitative thresholds for natural phenomena (Levels 0-3) and graduated protocols for increasingly anomalous characteristics (Levels 4-7), with Levels 8-10 reserved for confirmed artificial origin. Each level specifies observable criteria and response protocols. We demonstrate the scale's application using 1I/'Oumuamua (Level 4), 2I/Borisov (Level 0), and 3I/ATLAS (Level 4) as test cases. The Loeb Scale provides the astronomical community with a standardized framework for consistent, evidence-based and dynamic evaluation while maintaining scientific rigor across the full spectrum of possibilities as we enter an era of routine ISO encounters.</description>

      <title>Studying Exoplanets in the Radio from the Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanets with and without a magnetic field are predicted to form, behave, and evolve very differently. Therefore, there is great need to directly constrain these fields to holistically understand the properties of exoplanets including their potential habitability. This goal aligns with the Astro2020 Decadal Survey recommendations. Observing planetary auroral radio emissions is among the most promising detection methods, but decades of searching have yet to yield a conclusive detection, though promising hints are now emerging from ground-based radio telescopes. However, these ground-based efforts are fundamentally limited by Earth's ionosphere, which blocks the low-frequency signals (&lt;10 MHz) expected from terrestrial and Neptune-like exoplanets. In this white paper, we outline a strategy to overcome this barrier by utilizing the unique environment of the Moon. We discuss how the upcoming LuSEE-Night and ROLSES pathfinder missions will study our Solar System's planets as exoplanet analogs and place the first meaningful upper limits on exoplanetary radio flux below 10 MHz. Furthermore, we explore the revolutionary potential of the proposed future lunar arrays FarView and FARSIDE. For example, FarView will be sensitive enough to study the magnetic fields of a diverse set of exoplanets (super-Earths to gas giants) and an order of magnitude more Jupiter-like planets than ground-based telescopes, providing crucial tests for dynamo theory. Most significantly, FARSIDE will be able to detect the magnetospheres of nearby terrestrial exoplanets, offering a powerful synergy with atmospheric characterization efforts by JWST and HWO to fully assess their potential habitability. By opening this unexplored low-frequency window, radio astronomy from the Moon is poised to transform the field of exoplanet magnetospheric science. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>Bridging Clarity and Accuracy: A Simple Spectral Longwave Radiation Scheme for Idealized Climate Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameterizing radiative transfer in means navigating trade-offs between physical accuracy and conceptual clarity. However, currently available schemes sit at the extremes of this spectrum: correlated-k schemes are fast and accurate but rely on lookup tables which obscure the underlying physics and make such schemes difficult to modify, while gray radiation schemes are conceptually straightforward but introduce significant biases in atmospheric circulation. Here we introduce a Simple Spectral Model (SSM) for clear-sky longwave radiative transfer which bridges this `clarity-accuracy' gap. The SSM accomplishes this by representing the spectral structure of H$_{2}$O and CO$_{2}$ absorption using analytic fits at reference conditions, then uses simple functional forms to extend these fits to different atmospheric conditions. This, coupled to a simple, two-stream solver, yields a system of six equations and ten physically-meaningful parameters which can solve for clear-sky longwave fluxes given atmospheric profiles of temperature and humidity. When implemented in an idealized aquaplanet GCM, the SSM produces zonal-mean climate states which accurately mimic the results using a benchmark correlated-k code. The SSM also alleviates the significant zonal-mean climate biases associated with using gray radiation, including an improved representation of radiative cooling profiles, tropopause structure, jet dynamics, and Hadley Cell characteristics both in control climates and in response to uniform warming. This work demonstrates that even a simple spectral representation of atmospheric absorption suffices to capture the essential physics of longwave radiative transfer, and the SSM promises to be a valuable tool both for idealized climate modeling, and for teaching radiative transfer in the classroom.</description>

      <title>Classifying Cool Dwarfs: Comprehensive Spectral Typing of Field and Peculiar Dwarfs Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-mass stars and brown dwarfs -- spectral types (SpTs) M0 and later -- play a significant role in studying stellar and substellar processes and demographics, reaching down to planetary-mass objects. Currently, the classification of these sources remains heavily reliant on visual inspection of spectral features, equivalent width measurements, or narrow-/wide-band spectral indices. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) methods offer automated approaches for spectral typing, which are becoming increasingly important as large spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, SDSS, and SPHEREx generate datasets containing millions of spectra. We investigate the application of ML in spectral type classification on low-resolution (R $\sim$ 120) near-infrared spectra of M0--T9 dwarfs obtained with the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. We specifically aim to classify the gravity- and metallicity-dependent subclasses for late-type dwarfs. We used binned fluxes as input features and compared the efficacy of spectral type estimators built using Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models. We tested the influence of different normalizations and analyzed the relative importance of different spectral regions for surface gravity and metallicity subclass classification. Our best-performing model (using KNN) classifies 95.5 $\pm$ 0.6% of sources to within $\pm$1 SpT, and assigns surface gravity and metallicity subclasses with 89.5 $\pm$ 0.9% accuracy. We test the dependence of signal-to-noise ratio on classification accuracy and find sources with SNR $\gtrsim$ 60 have $\gtrsim$ 95% accuracy. We also find that zy-band plays the most prominent role in the RF model, with FeH and TiO having the highest feature importance.</description>

      <title>The Hot Inner AU of V883 Ori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The V883 Ori system is a rapidly accreting young stellar object that has been used as a laboratory for studying the molecular inventory of young circumstellar disks with high luminosity. We simultaneously fit high resolution spectroscopy and medium resolution spectrophotometry of the system to constrain the physical conditions in the inner au. Using our thin viscous accretion disk model, we find $\dot{M} = 10^{-3.9 \pm 0.2} \ M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, $R_\mathrm{inner} = 5.86 \pm 1 \ R_\odot$, $i = 38.2 \pm 3$ degrees and $A_V = 20.8 \pm 0.7$ mag, resulting in an accretion luminosity of 458 $L_\odot$ and maximum disk temperature of 7045 K. The optical portion of the SED greatly exceeds the flux level expected for a highly extincted accretion disk. We propose that the excess emission arises from a contribution due to scattering of the accretion disk spectrum off nearby envelope material that is viewed along a less-extincted line of sight. Additionally, we use photometric observations spanning 137 years to demonstrate that the source has accreted at least 18 $M_\mathrm{Jup}$ of disk material to date. Finally, we discuss the importance of considering both the viscous heating from the midplane and the consequent irradiation effects on the outer disk when modeling the temperature structure to reproduce millimeter-wavelength observations.</description>

      <title>Chemical composition of planetary hosts: II. Abundances of neutron-capture elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of neutron-capture element abundances (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Pr, and Eu) in a large and homogeneous sample of 160 F-, G-, and K-type planet-host stars located in the northern hemisphere, including 32 stars in multi-planetary systems. The sample hosts a total of 175 high-mass planets and 47 Neptunian and super-Earth planets. High-resolution spectra were obtained with the 1.65-metre telescope at the Mol\.etai Astronomical Observatory using a fibre-fed spectrograph covering 4000-8500 \r{A}. Elemental abundances were determined by differential line-by-line spectrum synthesis with the TURBOSPECTRUM code and MARCS model atmospheres. The analysis of $[\mathrm{El}/\mathrm{Fe}]$ ratios shows that most elements in PHSs follow the Galactic chemical evolution, but $[\mathrm{Zr}/\mathrm{Fe}]$, $[\mathrm{La}/\mathrm{Fe}]$, and $[\mathrm{Ce}/\mathrm{Fe}]$ are overabundant in PHSs relative to reference stars at a given $[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]$. Correlations between $[\mathrm{El}/\mathrm{Fe}]$ and planet mass are generally positive, except for Sr, Y, and Ba, which show no significant trends. The distribution of $\Delta[\mathrm{El}/\mathrm{H}]$ versus condensation temperature ($T_{\mathrm{cond}}$) slopes is positively skewed for PHSs, indicating enrichment in refractory elements compared to analogues. While no strong correlations are found between $\Delta[\mathrm{El}/\mathrm{H}]$-$T_{\mathrm{cond}}$ slopes and stellar or planetary parameters, older dwarf stars with multiple planets tend to have smaller or negative slopes, whereas younger dwarf stars exhibit larger positive slopes. Our results also confirm that multi-planetary systems are more frequent around metal-rich stars.</description>

Abstract: Sub-Neptune exoplanets are the most abundant type of planet known today. As they do not have a Solar System counterpart, many open questions exist about their composition and formation. Previous spectroscopic studies rule out aerosol-free hydrogen-helium-dominated atmospheres for many characterized sub-Neptunes but are inconclusive about their exact atmospheric compositions. Here we characterize the hot (Teq=1311K) sub-Neptune HD 86226 c, which orbits its G-type host star. Its high equilibrium temperature prohibits methane-based haze formation, increasing the chances for a clear atmosphere on this planet. We use HST data taken with WFC3 and STIS from the Sub-neptune Planetary Atmosphere Characterization Experiment (SPACE) Program to perform near-infrared 1.1-1.7micrometer transmission spectroscopy and UV characterization of the host star. We report a featureless transmission spectrum that is consistent within 0.4 sigma with a constant transit depth of 418+-14ppm. The amplitude of this spectrum is only 0.01 scale heights for a H/He-dominated atmosphere, excluding a cloud-free solar-metallicity atmosphere on HD 86226 c with a confidence of 6.5 sigma. Based on an atmospheric retrieval analysis and forward models of cloud and haze formation, we find that the featureless spectrum could be due to a metal enrichment [M/H] above 2.3 (3 sigma confidence lower limit) of a cloudless atmosphere, or silicate (MgSiO3), iron (Fe), or manganese sulfide (MnS) clouds. For these species, we perform an investigation of cloud formation in high-metallicity, high-temperature atmospheres. Our results highlight that HD 86226c does not follow the aerosol trend of sub-Neptunes found by previous studies. Follow-up observations with the JWST could determine whether this planet aligns with the recent detections of metal-enriched atmospheres or if it harbors a cloud species otherwise atypical for sub-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>SPHERE/ZIMPOL insights into discs around evolved stars: arcs, asymmetries and dust properties</title>

Abstract: Second-generation circumbinary discs around evolved binary stars, such as post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) binaries, provide insights into poorly understood mechanisms of dust processing and disc evolution across diverse stellar environments. We present a multi-wavelength polarimetric survey of five evolved binary systems - AR Pup, HR 4049, HR 4226, U Mon, and V709 Car - using the Very Large Telescope SPHERE/ZIMPOL instrument. Post-AGB discs show significant polarimetric brightness at optical and near-IR wavelengths, often exceeding 1% of the system's total intensity. We also measured a maximum fractional polarisation of the scattered light for AR Pup of ~0.7 in the V-band and ~0.55 in the I-band. To investigate wavelength-dependent polarisation, we combine the SPHERE/ZIMPOL dataset with results from previous SPHERE/IRDIS studies. This analysis reveals that post-AGB discs exhibit a grey to blue polarimetric colour in the optical and near-IR. Along with high fractional polarisation of the scattered light and polarised intensity distribution, these findings are consistent with a surface dust composition dominated by porous aggregates, reinforcing independent observational evidence for such grains in post-AGB circumbinary discs. We also find evidence of diverse disc geometries within the post-AGB sample, including arcs, asymmetries and significant variations in disc size across optical and near-IR wavelengths for some systems (U Mon, V709 Car). On comparing post-AGB discs to circumstellar environments around AGB stars and YSOs, we found that post-AGB systems exhibit a higher degree of polarisation than single AGB stars and are comparable to the brightest protoplanetary discs around YSOs.</description>
