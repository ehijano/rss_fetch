      <title>A unified approach for degree bound estimates of linear differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a common scheme in several existing algorithms adressing computational problems on linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients. These algorithms reduce to computing a linear relation between vectors obtained as iterates of a simple differential operator known as pseudo-linear map.
  We focus on establishing precise degree bounds on the output of this class of algorithms. It turns out that in all known instances (least common left multiple, symmetric product,. . . ), the bounds that are derived from the linear algebra step using Cramer's rule are pessimistic. The gap with the behaviour observed in practice is often of one order of magnitude, and better bounds are sometimes known and derived from ad hoc methods and independent arguments. We propose a unified approach for proving output degree bounds for all instances of the class at once. The main technical tools come from the theory of realisations of matrices of rational functions and their determinantal denominators.</description>
