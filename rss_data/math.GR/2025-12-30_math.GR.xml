      <title>Connectivity of $p$-subgroup posets with irreducible characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. For a prime $p$ and an integer $e \geq 0$, we denote by $\Gamma_{p,e}(G)$ the set of all pairs $(H, \varphi)$, where $H$ is a $p$-subgroup of $G$ of order greater than $p^e$ and $\varphi$ is a complex irreducible character of $H$. In this paper, we investigate the connected components of the poset $\Gamma_{p,e}(G)$. For the case $e = 0$, we prove that $\Gamma_{p,0}(G)$ is disconnected if and only if either $G$ has a strongly $p$-embedded subgroup, or every Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ contains a unique subgroup of order $p$. Furthermore, for $e = 1$ and $G$ a $p$-group, we show that the number of connected components of $\Gamma_{p,1}(G)$ equals the order of the intersection of all subgroups of $G$ of order $p^2$.</description>

      <title>The Burness-Giudici Conjecture on Primitive Groups of Lie-type with Rank One: Part (II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was conjectured by Burness and Giudici that every primitive permutation group $G$ containing some regular suborbits has the property that $\Gamma \cap \Gamma^g\neq \emptyset$ for any $g\in G$, where $\Gamma$ is the union of all regular suborbits of $G$ relative to $\alpha$. We focused on proving the conjecture for all primitive groups $G$ whose socle is a simple group of Lie-type of rank $1$, that is, those with $soc(G)\in \{PSL(2,q), PSU(3,q), Ree(q),Sz(q)\}$. The case of $soc(G)=PSL(2,q)$ has been published in two papers. The case of $soc(G)=PSU(3,q)$ is divided into two parts:Part (I) addressed all primitive groups $G$ with socle $PSU(3,q)$ whose point stabilizers contain $PSO(3,q)$ and based on it, this Part (II) will finish all cases of $soc(G)=PSU(3,q)$. The cases for $soc(G)\in\{Ree(q),Sz(q)\}$ will be treated in Part (III).</description>

Abstract: It was conjectured by Burness and Giudici that every primitive permutation group $G$ containing some regular suborbits has the property that $\Gamma \cap \Gamma^g\neq \emptyset$ for any $g\in G$, where $\Gamma$ is the union of all regular suborbits of $G$ relative to $\alpha$. We focused on proving the conjecture for all primitive groups $G$ whose socle is a simple group of Lie-type of rank $1$, that is, those with $soc(G)\in \{PSL(2,q), PSU(3,q), Ree(q),Sz(q)\}$. The case of $soc(G)=PSL(2,q)$ has been published in two papers. The case of $soc(G)=PSU(3,q)$ is divided into two parts: this paper constitutes Part (I), addressing all primitive groups $G$ with socle $PSU(3,q)$ whose point stabilizers contain $PSO(3,q)$; and the remaining primitive actions will be covered in Part (II). The cases for $soc(G)\in\{Ree(q),Sz(q)\}$ are treated in Part (III).
  To finsh this work, we draw on methods from abstract- and permutation- group theory, finite unitary geometry, probabilistic approach, number theory (employing Weil's bound), and, most importantly, algebraic combinatorics, which provides us some key ideas.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of epimorphisms onto products of hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit examples of finitely presented subgroups $P$ of direct products of hyperbolic groups for which there is no algorithm that detects whether a finitely presented group has a quotient isomorphic to $P$. For any torsion-free, linear, hyperbolic group $Q$ that maps onto the free group of rank $2$ and $m\geq 2$, we construct a recursive sequence $(\Gamma_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ of torsion-free, hyperbolic $C'(\frac{1}{6})$ small cancellation groups, with the property that there is no algorithm determining the values $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\Gamma_n$ has a quotient isomorphic to the direct product $Q^{m}$ of $m$-copies of $Q$.</description>

      <title>A Note on Lagrange Subsets of Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a finite group, a subset is called a Lagrange subset if its size divides the group order, and a factor if it admits a complementary subset. We provide a new and comparatively direct proof of the classification of groups in which every Lagrange subset is a factor. We show that any nontrivial such group must be a cyclic group of prime order, the cyclic group of order 4, or an elementary abelian group of order 4, 8, or 9.</description>

      <title>On the density of Sylow numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number. We say that a positive integer $n$ is a Sylow $p$-number if there exists a finite group having exactly $n$ Sylow $p$-subgroups. When $p=2$, every odd integer is a Sylow $2$-number. In contrast, when $p$ is odd, there exist two positive constants $c_p$ and $c_p^\prime$ such that, denoting by $\beta(p,x)$ the number of Sylow $p$-numbers less than or equal to $x$,
  \[c_p\,x(\log x)^{\frac{1}{p-1}-1}
  \leq \beta(p,x)\leq
  c_p^\prime\,x(\log x)^{\frac{1}{p-1}-1}.
  \]
  Moreover if $\beta_s(p,x)$ is the number of positive integers $n\le x$ such that $n$ is the Sylow $p$-number of some finite solvable group then $$\beta_s(p,x)\sim c_p\,x(\log x)^{\,\frac{1}{p-1}-1}
  \qquad\text{as } x\to\infty.$$
  In particular, when $p$ is odd, the natural density of Sylow $p$-numbers is $0$.</description>

      <title>Groups with fast-growing conjugator length functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the first examples of finitely presented groups where the conjugator length function is exponential; these are central extensions of groups of the form $F_m \rtimes F_2$. Further, we use a fibre product construction to exhibit a family of finitely presented groups $\Gamma_k$ where, for each $k$, the conjugator length function of $\Gamma_k$ grows like functions in the $k$-th level of the Grzegorczyk hierarchy of primitive recursive functions.</description>

      <title>Representations of the symmetry groups of infinite crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the representations of the symmetry groups of infinite crystals. Crystal symmetries are usually described as the finite symmetry group of a finite crystal with periodic boundary conditions, for which the Brillouin zone is a finite set of points. However, to deal with the continuous crystal momentum $\mathbf{k}$ required to discuss the continuity, singularity or analyticity of band energies $\epsilon_n(\mathbf{k})$ and Bloch states $\psi_{\mathbf{k}}$, we need to consider infinite crystals. The symmetry groups of infinite crystals belong to the category of infinite non-compact groups, for which many standard tools of group theory break down. For example, character theory is no longer available for these groups and we use harmonic analysis to build the group algebra, the regular representation, the induction of irreducible representations of the crystallographic group from projective representations of the point groups and the decomposition of a representation into its irreducible parts. We deal with magnetic and non-magnetic groups in arbitrary dimensions. In the last part of the paper, we discuss Mackey's restriction of an induced representation to a subgroup, the tensor product of induced representations and the symmetric and antisymmetric squares of induced representations.</description>

      <title>A Short Note on Disjointness Conditions for Triples of Group Subsets Satisfying the Triple Product Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3671</link>
      <description>arXiv:0908.3671v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract:   We deduce some elementary pairwise disjointness and semi-disjointness conditions on triples of subsets in arbitrary groups satisfying the so-called triple product property (TPP) as originally defined by H. Cohn and C. Umans in 2003. This property TPP for a triple of group subsets, called a TPP triple, allows the group to "realize" matrix multiplication of dimensions the sizes of the subsets, with the subsets acting as indexing sets for input matrices which are embedded into the regular algebra of the group. We derive nine different disjointness casetypes for an arbitrary TPP triple, and classify these into four different disjointness classes based on an integer measure of the degree of pairwise disjointness among the subsets. Finally, we derive lower and upper bounds for the sum of sizes of the subsets forming a TPP triple, which is the additive equivalent of the multiplicative bounds originally derived by Cohn and Umans for the product of sizes of subsets forming a TPP triple.</description>

      <title>Examples of cubulable groups with fixed-point properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every $n \geq 1$, let $(\mathrm{FW}_n)$ denote the fixed-point property for median graphs of cubical dimension $n$ (or equivalently, for CAT(0) cube complexes of dimension $n$). In this article, we construct explicit examples of groups satisfying $(\mathrm{FW}_n)$ but with good cubical properties in higher dimensions. First, we prove that, for a finitely generated group $G$ with no non-abelian free subgroup, $G$ satisfies $(\mathrm{FW}_n)$ if and only if no subgroup $H \leq G$ of index $\leq n$ can be mapped to $\mathbb{D}_\infty$ with an infinite image. For instance, the affine Coxeter group $\tilde{A}_n$ satisfies $(\mathrm{FW}_n)$ but not $(\mathrm{FW}_{n+1})$. In another direction, we investigate virtually graph products of finite groups. As an application of our constructions, we find explicit examples, for every $n \geq 1$, of acylindrically hyperbolic groups that are cocompactly cubulable but satisfy $(\mathrm{FW}_n)$. Several conjectures and open questions are included.</description>

      <title>The semi-simple theory of higher rank acylindricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new notion of non-positively curved groups: the collection of discrete countable groups acting (AU-)acylindrically on finite products of $\delta$-hyperbolic spaces with general type factors. Inspired by the classical theory of ($S$-arithmetic) lattices and the flourishing theory of acylindrically hyperbolic groups, we show that, up to virtual isomorphism, finitely generated groups in this class enjoy a strongly canonical product decomposition. This semi-simple decomposition also descends to the outer-automorphism group, allowing us to give a partial resolution to a recent conjecture of Sela. We also develop various structure results including a free vs abelian Tits' Alternative, and connections to lattice envelopes. Along the way we give representation-theoretic proofs of various results about acylindricity -- some methods are new even in the rank-1 setting.
  The vastness of this class of groups is exhibited by recognizing that it contains, for example, $S$-arithmetic lattices with rank-1 factors, acylindrically hyperbolic groups, HHGs, groups with property (QT), and is closed under direct products, passing to (totally general type) subgroups, and finite index over-groups.</description>

      <title>A "cubist" decomposition of the Handel-Mosher axis bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the axis bundle of a nongeometric fully irreducible outer automorphism admits a canonical "cubist" decomposition into branched cubes that fit together with special combinatorics. From this structure, we locate a canonical finite collection of periodic fold lines in each axis bundle. This can be considered as an analogue of results of Hamenst\"adt and Agol from the surface setting, which state that the set of trivalent train tracks carrying the unstable lamination of a pseudo-Anosov map can be given the structure of a CAT(0) cube complex, and that there is a canonical periodic fold line in this cube complex. This work also gives an answer to questions of Handel-Mosher and Bridson-Vogtmann regarding the geometry of the axis bundle and a solution of a new flavor to the fully irreducible conjugacy problem in $\mathrm{Out}(F_r)$.</description>

      <title>The monoid of monotone and decreasing partial transformations on a finite chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the monoid of all monotone and order-decreasing partial transformations denoted as $\mathcal{DORP}_{n}$ on an $n$ ordered chain $[n]=\{1, \ldots,n\}$, its two-sided ideal $I(n,p)= \{\rho \in \mathcal{DORP}_{n} : \, |Im \, \rho| \leq p\}$ and the Rees quotient ${RQ}_{p}(n)$ of the ideal $I(n,p)$. We compute the order of the monoid $\mathcal{DORP}_{n}$ and show that for any semigroup $S$ in $\{\mathcal{DORP}_{n}, \, I(n,p), \, {RQ}_{p}(n)\}$, $S$ is abundant for all values of $n$. In particular, we show that the Rees quotient ${RQ}_{p}(n)$, is a non-regular $0-*$bisimple abundant semigroup. In addition, we compute the ranks of the Rees quotient ${RQ}_{p}(n)$ and the two-sided ideal $I(n,p)$. Finally, the rank of $\mathcal{DORP}_{n}$ is determined to be $3n-2$.</description>

      <title>Time-inhomogeneous random walks on finite groups and cokernels of random integer block matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study time-inhomogeneous random walks on finite groups in the case where each random walk step need not be supported on a generating set of the group. When the supports of the random walk steps satisfy a natural condition involving normal subgroups of quotients of the group, we show that the random walk converges to the uniform distribution on the group and give bounds for the convergence rate using spectral properties of the random walk steps. As an application, we use the moment method of Wood to prove a universality theorem for cokernels of random integer matrices allowing some dependence between entries.</description>

      <title>The strong hull property for affine irreducible Coxeter groups of rank 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A conjecture proposed by Gaetz and Gao asserts that the Cayley graph of any Coxeter group possesses the strong hull property. In this paper, we prove this conjecture for all affine irreducible Coxeter groups of rank 3. Our approach exploits the geometry of affine buildings to reduce the analysis of convex hulls to finitely many manageable configurations. These geometric reduction techniques offer a novel framework that may be applicable to higher-rank cases.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap for the signed interchange process with arbitrary sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2020, F. Cesi introduced a random walk on the hyperoctahedral group $B_n$ and analysed its spectral gap when the allowed generators are transpositions and diagonal elements corresponding to singletons. In this paper we extend the allowed generators to transpositions and any diagonal elements, and characterise completely the set of representations from which the spectral gap arises. This settles a conjecture posed in Cesi's paper.</description>

      <title>Word Length Formulae and Normal Forms of Conjugacy Classes in Surface Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we primarily investigate the following symmetric presentation of the surface group $\pi_1(\Sigma_g)=\left\langle c_1,\dots, c_{2g}\mid c_1\cdots c_{2g}c_1^{-1}\cdots c_{2g}^{-1}\right\rangle$. For every nontrivial element $x\in \pi_1(\Sigma_g)$, we obtain a uniform representation of the normal forms of $x^k$ under the length-lexicographical order. Based on this, we find a new relation among these normal forms, and then derive the following three formulae related to the word length: $|x^2|&gt;|x|$; $|x^k|=(k-1)(|x^2|-|x|)+|x|$; $\lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{|x^k|}{k}=|x^2|-|x|$. Moreover, we extend these results to obtain analogous but less precise formulae for every minimal geometric presentation. Then, we define the normal forms of conjugacy classes in $\pi_1(\Sigma_g)$ and give a criterion for determining the conjugacy of elements. As a consequence, we give efficient algorithms for solving the root-finding and conjugacy problems. Finally, we present applications concerning the computation of some growth rates.</description>
