      <title>Linear-in-degree monomial Rota-Baxter of weight zero and averaging operators on $F[x, y]$ and $F_0[x, y]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rota-Baxter operators on the polynomial algebra have been actively studied since the work of S.H. Zheng, L. Guo, and M. Rosenkranz (2015). Monomial operators of an arbitrary weight (2016), as well as injective operators of weight zero on $F[x]$ (2021), have been described. The author described monomial Rota-Baxter operators of nonzero weight on $F[x, y]$ coming from averaging operators (2023) and studied the connection between monomial Rota-Baxter operators and averaging operators (2024). The main result of the current work is the classification of monomial Rota-Baxter operators of weight zero on $F[x,y]$ coming from monomial linear-in-degree averaging operators.</description>

      <title>Pure Core Sets of $n \times n$ Matrices over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the structure of core sets under different similarity classes. We investigate the influence of factors of the minimal polynomial with different degrees on the structure of core sets. When $F$ is a finite field of prime order, we study the upper bound on the size of a non-core set in a similarity class in $M_n(F)$. We prove that as $|F|$ increases, the proportion of pure core sets among subsets of $M_n(F)$ tends to $1$.</description>

      <title>Module structure of Weyl algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The seminal paper "J.T. Stafford, Module structure of Weyl algebras, J. London Math. Soc. (2) 18 (1978), no. 3, 429--442" was a major step forward in our understanding of Weyl algebras. Beginning with Serre's Theorem on free summands of projective modules and Bass' Stable Range Theorem in commutative algebra, we attempt to trace the origins of this work and explain how it led to Stafford's construction of non-holonomic simple modules over Weyl algebras. We also describe Bernstein-Lunt's geometric construction of infinite families of non-holonomic simple modules. We recall more recent developments related to Weyl algebras, especially that of parametrizing right ideals in the first Weyl algebra and its relation to Calogero-Moser spaces. Finally, we revisit Stafford's results in the context of quantized symplectic singularities, where they lead naturally to open problems on the behaviour of simple modules.</description>

      <title>Simplicity of algebras and $C^*$-algebras of self-similar groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many previously studied path algebras or self-similar group algebras may be viewed as Steinberg algebras of self-similar groupoids. By way of inverse semigroup algebras, we characterize when the Steinberg algebra of a self-similar groupoid is simple. We show that the simplicity of the reduced $C^*$-algebra of a contracting self-similar groupoid coincides with the simplicity of the Steinberg algebra. As an aside, we show that simplicity of the two algebras sometimes depends only on the skeleton of the self-similar groupoid acting on a strongly connected graph. Finally, we apply our methods to examples including a self-similar groupoid akin to multispinal self-similar groups and a self-similar groupoid built from the well-known Basilica group.</description>

      <title>Identifying the simple finite-dimensional Lie algebras over C by means of simple sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel method of determining which Dynkin diagrams represent simple finite-dimensional Lie algebras over C is presented. It is based on a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a suitably defined Cartan matrix to be expressible by scalar products in a Euclidean vector space. The sufficiency of this condition makes unnecessary subsequent verification of the existence of a Lie algebra or root system corresponding to each Dynkin diagram by explicit construction. The Dynkin diagrams are selected by examination of an easily calculated sequence of minors of a symmetrised Cartan matrix. These minors are mostly integers.</description>

      <title>Twisted group ring isomorphism problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:1611.00499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and study a variation of the classical isomorphism problem for group rings in the context of projective representations. We formulate several weaker conditions following from our notion and give all logical connections between these condition by studying concrete examples. We introduce methods to study the problem and provide results for various classes of groups, including abelian groups, groups of central type, $p$-groups of order $p^4$ and groups of order $p^2q^2$, where $p$ and $q$ denote different primes.</description>

      <title>The Modular Isomorphism Problem over all fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Modular Isomorphism Problem asks, if an isomorphism between modular group algebras of finite $p$-groups over a field $F$ implies an isomorphism of the group bases. We explore the differences of knowledge on the problem when $F$ is either assumed to be a prime field or a general field of characteristic $p$. After revising the literature and explaining reasons for the differences, we generalize some of the positive answers to the problem from the prime field case to the general case.</description>

      <title>Width bounds and Steinhaus property for unit groups of continuous rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an algebraic decomposition theorem for the unit group $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ of an arbitrary non-discrete irreducible, continuous ring $R$ (in von Neumann's sense), which entails that every element of $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ is both a product of $7$ commutators and a product of $16$ involutions. Combining this with further insights into the geometry of involutions, we deduce that $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ has the so-called Steinhaus property with respect to the natural rank topology, thus every homomorphism from $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ to a separable topological group is necessarily continuous. Due to earlier work, this has further dynamical ramifications: for instance, for every action of $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ by homeomorphisms on a non-void metrizable compact space, every element of $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ admits a fixed point in the latter. In particular, our results answer two questions by Carderi and Thom, even in generalized form.</description>

      <title>Eventually periodic resolutions for groups of type $\textbf{VFP}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a construction of eventually periodic projective resolutions for modules of type $\textbf{FP}_{\infty}$ over the integral group rings of $\Gamma = G / (c)$ of type $\textbf{VFP}$, with $G$ of type $\textbf{FP}$ and $c$ a central element. Our approach also applies more generally to quotients of rings of finite left global dimension by a regular central element. It utilises a construction of Shamash, combined with the iterated mapping cone technique, to systematically `purge' homology from a complex. We demonstrate the computability of our method through explicit calculations for several families of groups including hyperbolic triangle groups and mapping class groups of the punctured plane.</description>
