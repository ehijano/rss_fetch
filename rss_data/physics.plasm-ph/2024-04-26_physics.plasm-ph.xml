      <title>Elastic properties of three-dimensional Yukawa or dust crystals from molecular dynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I calculate elastic properties of three-dimensional Yukawa or dust crystals using molecular dynamic simulations. The elastic properties are computed by deforming (compressing/expanding) a cubic dust crystal along different directions. The bulk modulus, shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio are determined as a function of shielding parameter $\kappa$ and strong coupling parameter $\Gamma$. Furthermore, I calculate sound wave velocity and shear wave velocity using bulk and shear modulus values and compare them with the velocities obtained from the slope of longitudinal and transverse wave dispersion relations. It is found that the sound and shear velocities obtained using bulk and shear modulus agree with the previously observed experimental values.</description>

      <title>Phase and morphology of water-ice grains formed in a cryogenic laboratory plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grains of ice are formed spontaneously when water vapor is injected into a weakly-ionized laboratory plasma in which the background gas has been cooled to cryogenic temperatures comparable to those of deep space. These ice grains are levitated indefinitely within the plasma so that their time evolution can be observed under free-floating conditions. Using microscope imaging, ice grains are shown to have a spindle-like fractal structure and grow over time. Both crystalline and amorphous phases of ice are observed using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. A mix of crystalline and amorphous grains coexist under certain thermal conditions and a linear mixing model is used on the ice absorption band surrounding 3.2 microns to examine the ice phase composition and its temporal stability. The extinction spectrum is also affected by inelastic scattering as grains grow, and characteristic grain radii are obtained from Mie scattering theory and compared to size measurements from direct imaging. Observations are used to compare possible ice nucleation mechanisms, and it is concluded that nucleation is likely catalyzed by ions, as ice does not nucleate in absence of plasma and impurities are not detected. Ice grain properties and infrared extinction spectra show similarity to observations of some astrophysical ices observed in protoplanetary disks, implying that the fractal morphology of the ice and observed processes of homogeneous ice nucleation could occur as well in such astrophysical environments with weakly-ionized conditions.</description>

      <title>Reduced turbulent transport in the quasi-isodynamic stellarator configuration CIEMAT-QI4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CIEMAT-QI4 is a quasi-isodynamic stellarator configuration that simultaneously features very good fast-ion confinement in a broad range of $\beta$ values, low neoclassical transport and bootstrap current, and ideal magnetohydrodynamic stability up to $\beta=5\%$. In this paper it is shown that CIEMAT-QI4 also exhibits reduced turbulent transport. This is demonstrated through nonlinear electrostatic simulations with the gyrokinetic code stella, including kinetic ions and electrons. The relation between reduced turbulent transport and the fact that CIEMAT-QI4 very approximately satisfies the so-called maximum-J property is discussed.</description>

      <title>Implementation of matrix compression in the coupling of JOREK to realistic 3D conducting wall structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JOREK is an advanced non-linear simulation code for studying MHD instabilities in magnetically confined fusion plasmas and their control and/or mitigation. A free-boundary and resistive wall extension was introduced via coupling to the STARWALL and CARIDDI codes, both able to provide dense response matrices describing the electromagnetic interactions between plasma and conducting structures. For detailed CAD representations of the conducting structures and high resolutions for the plasma region, memory and computing time limitations restrict the possibility of simulating the ITER tokamak. In the present work, the Singular Value Decomposition provided by routines from the ScaLAPACK library has been successfully applied to compress some of the dense response matrices and thus optimize memory usage. This is demonstrated for simulations of Tearing Mode and Vertical Displacement Event instabilities. An outlook to future applications on large production cases and further extensions of the method are discussed.</description>

      <title>Resonance of low-frequency electromagnetic and ion-sound modes in the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parker Solar Probe measurements have recently shown that coherent fast magnetosonic and Alfv\'{e}n ion-cyclotron waves are abundant in the solar wind and can be accompanied by higher-frequency electrostatic fluctuations. In this letter we reveal the nonlinear process capable of channelling the energy of low-frequency electromagnetic to higher-frequency electrostatic fluctuations observed aboard Parker Solar Probe. We present Hall-MHD simulations demonstrating that low-frequency electromagnetic fluctuations can resonate with the ion-sound mode, which results in steepening of plasma density fluctuations, electrostatic spikes and harmonics in the electric field spectrum. The resonance can occur around the wavenumber determined by the ratio between local sound and Alfv\'{e}n speeds, but only in the case of {\it oblique} propagation to the background magnetic field. The resonance wavenumber, its width and steepening time scale are estimated, and all indicate that the revealed two-wave resonance can frequently occur in the solar wind. This process can be a potential channel of energy transfer from cyclotron resonant ions producing the electromagnetic fluctuations to Landau resonant ions and electrons absorbing the energy of the higher-frequency electrostatic fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of FEL-generated THz waves using linear and helical undulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emission of terahertz waves in free electron lasers (FELs) with both linear and helical undulators has been explored. The analysis employs Lienard-Wiechert fields to characterize FEL radiation within the THz region. Specifically, the study delves into the analytical examination of radiation pattern of THz waves, which provides insight into the angular distribution of radiation energy. The variations of radiation pattern for various parameters such as different harmonics, Lorentz factor, magnetic parameter, and total number of periods of linear and helical undulators were investigated. The Fourier transform of free electron laser electric field is showcased across four distinct sets of FEL parameters. The interplay between electron beam and undulators parameters sheds light on how these factors influence the directionality of THz waves. Simulation results indicate that linear undulators often produce radiation with noticeable side lobes, especially at higher harmonics, while helical undulators typically exhibit reduced side lobes, resulting in a more focused main radiation peak. However, the radiation pattern of THz waves tends to concentrate predominantly in the forward direction and the polarization of the emitted radiation is determined by the properties of the undulator and electron beam, rather than the specific undulator geometry. The study underscores that an optimal selection of undulator and beam parameters can effectively maximize the angular distribution of emitted radiation.</description>

      <title>On the Upper Bound of Non-Thermal Fusion Reactivity with Fixed Total Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fusion reactivity represents the integration of fusion cross-sections and the velocity distributions of two reactants. In this study, we investigate the upper bound of fusion reactivity for a non-thermal reactant coexisting with a thermal Maxwellian background reactant while maintaining a constant total energy. Our optimization approach involves fine-tuning the velocity distribution of the non-thermal reactant. We employ both Lagrange multiplier and Monte Carlo methods to analyze Deuterium-Tritium (D-T) and Proton-Boron11 (p-B11) fusion scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that, within the relevant range of fusion energy, the maximum fusion reactivity can often surpass that of the conventional Maxwellian-Maxwellian reactants case by a substantial margin, ranging from 50\% to 300\%. These enhancements are accompanied by distinctive distribution functions for the non-thermal reactant, characterized by one or multiple beams. These results not only establish an upper limit for fusion reactivity but also provide valuable insights into augmenting fusion reactivity through non-thermal fusion, which holds particular significance in the realm of fusion energy research.</description>

      <title>An exact analytical solution for the weakly magnetized flow around an axially symmetric paraboloid, with application to magnetosphere models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07419v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotationally symmetric bodies with longitudinal cross sections of parabolic shape are frequently used to model astrophysical objects, such as magnetospheres and other blunt objects, immersed in interplanetary or interstellar gas or plasma flows. We discuss a simple formula for the potential flow of an incompressible fluid around an elliptic paraboloid whose axis of symmetry coincides with the direction of incoming flow. Prescribing this flow, we derive an exact analytical solution to the induction equation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics for the case of an initially homogeneous magnetic field of arbitrary orientation being passively advected in this flow. Our solution procedure employs Euler potentials and Cauchy's integral formalism based on the flow's stream function and isochrones. Furthermore, we use a particular renormalization procedure that allows us to generate more general analytical expressions modeling the deformations experienced by arbitrary scalar or vector-valued fields embedded in the flow as they are advected first towards and then past the parabolic obstacle. Finally, both the velocity field and the magnetic field embedded therein are generalized from incompressible to mildly compressible flow, where the associated density distribution is found from Bernoulli's principle.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of Density Fluctuations in the Solar Wind at 1 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A well-known property of solar wind plasma turbulence is the observed anisotropy of the autocorrelations, or equivalently the spectra, of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations. Here we explore the related but apparently not well-studied issue of the anisotropy of plasma density fluctuations in the energy-containing and inertial ranges of solar wind turbulence. Using 10 years (1998-2008) of in situ data from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) mission, we find that for all but the fastest wind category, the density correlation scale is slightly larger in directions quasi-parallel to the large-scale mean magnetic field as compared to quasi-perpendicular directions. The correlation scale in fast wind is consistent with isotropic. The anisotropy as a function of the level of correlation is also explored. We find at small correlation levels, i.e., at energy-containing scales and larger, the density fluctuations are close to isotropy for fast wind, and slightly favor more rapid decorrelation in perpendicular directions for slow and medium winds. At relatively smaller (inertial range) scales where the correlation values are larger, the sense of anisotropy is reversed in all speed ranges, implying a more "slab-like" structure, especially prominent in the fast wind samples. We contrast this finding with published results on velocity and magnetic field correlations.</description>
