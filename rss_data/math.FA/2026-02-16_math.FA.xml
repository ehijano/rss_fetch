      <title>Infinite-Dimensional Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a preliminary version of a book on infinite-dimensional Lie groups. It covers the basics of calculus and manifolds in the context of locally convex spaces, based on Bastiani's notion of a smooth map. Starting from this concept, we develop the basics of smooth manifolds and define Lie groups as manifolds with smooth group operations. We discuss in particular several classes of Lie groups, such as regular ones, or those with an exponential function that is a local diffeomorphism. The local theory, subgroups and quotients are explored in some detail. Classes of Lie groups that are discussed in detail include: unit groups of continuous inverse algebras, groups of smooth maps, direct limit groups and groups of diffeomorphism. We also included chapters on the topology of infinite-dimensional Lie group and on various selected topics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct operator analogues of Hermite functions which form an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space $ \mathcal{S}_2$ of Hilbert-Schmidt operators on $ L^2(\R^n).$ We use this orthonormal basis to define Fourier transform on $ \mathcal{S}_2 $ and study some of its basic properties.</description>

      <title>Fractional $k$-positivity: a continuous refinement of the $k$-positive scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a real-parameter refinement of the classical integer hierarchies underlying Schmidt number, block-positivity, and $k$-positivity for maps between matrix algebras. Starting from a compact family of $\alpha$-admissible unit vectors ($\alpha\in[1,d]$), we define closed cones $\mathsf K_\alpha$ of bipartite positive operators that interpolate strictly between successive Schmidt-number cones, together with their dual witness cones. Via the Choi--Jamio\l{}kowski correspondence this yields a matching filtration of map cones $\mathsf P_\alpha$, recovering the usual $k$-positive/$k$-superpositive classes at integer parameters and complete positivity at the top endpoint.
  Two results show that the fractional levels capture genuinely new structure. First, we prove a \emph{fractional Kraus theorem}: $\alpha$-superpositive maps are precisely the completely positive maps admitting a Kraus decomposition whose Kraus operators satisfy an explicit singular-value (Ky--Fan) constraint, extending the classical rank-$k$ characterization. Second, for non-integer $\alpha$ the cones $\mathsf P_\alpha$ fail stability under CP post-composition, highlighting a sharp structural transition away from the integer theory. Finally, we derive sharp thresholds on canonical symmetric families (including the depolarizing ray and the isotropic slice), turning familiar stepwise criteria into continuous, computable profiles.</description>

      <title>A Complex Analogue of Spencer's Six Standard Deviations Theorem and the Complex Banach-Mazur Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a complex analogue of Spencer's Six Standard Deviations Theorem. Specifically, we propose the following conjecture: for any dimension $n \geq 2$, given vectors $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in \mathbb{C}^n$ satisfying $\|a_i\|_{\infty} \leq 1$ for each $i=1, \ldots, n$, there exists a vector $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$ with all coordinates of modulus one such that $|\langle x, a_i \rangle| \leq \sqrt{n}$ for every $i=1, \ldots, n$. The bound of $\sqrt{n}$ is sharp, as demonstrated by the row vectors of any complex $n \times n$ Hadamard matrix. Furthermore, if the conjecture holds in dimension $n$, it implies that the Banach--Mazur distance between the complex $\ell_1^n$ and $\ell_{\infty}^n$ spaces is equal to $\sqrt{n}$. We prove the conjecture for $n =2, 3$, thereby establishing also that $d_{BM}(\ell_1^n, \ell_{\infty}^n) = \sqrt{n}$ for these dimensions. Additionally, we propose a conjecture about the Banach--Mazur distances between complex $\ell_p^n$ spaces and we verify it for $n=2$. This leads to a complete determination of all possible Banach--Mazur distances between complex $\ell_p^2$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Packings in classical Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain several new results on the simultaneous packing and covering constant $\gamma(\mathcal{X})$ of a Banach space $\mathcal{X}$, and its lattice counterpart $\gamma^*(\mathcal{X})$. These constants measure how efficient a (lattice) packing by unit balls in $\mathcal{X}$ can be, the optimal case being that $\gamma(\mathcal{X})= 1$ and the worst that $\gamma(\mathcal{X})= 2$. Our first main result is that $\gamma(\mathcal{X})&gt; 1$ whenever $B_\mathcal{X}$ admits a LUR point, which leads us to a negative answer to a question of Swanepoel. We also develop general methods to compute these constants for a large class of spaces. As a sample of our findings:
  (i) $\gamma^*(\mathcal{X})= 1$ when $\mathcal{X}$ is a separable octahedral Banach space, or $\mathcal{X}= \mathcal{C}(\mathcal{K})$, where $\mathcal{K}$ is zero-dimensional;
  (ii) $\gamma(\ell_p(\kappa)\oplus_r \mathcal{X})= \gamma^*(\ell_p(\kappa)\oplus_r \mathcal{X})= \frac{2}{2^{1/p}}$, whenever $\rm{dens}(\mathcal{X})&lt; \kappa$ and $1\leq r\leq p&lt; \infty$;
  (iii) $\gamma(L_p(\mu))= \gamma^*(L_p(\mu))= \frac{2}{2^{1/p}}$ for $1\leq p\leq 2$ and every measure $\mu$;
  (iv) there exist reflexive (resp. octahedral) Banach spaces $\mathcal{X}$ with $\gamma(\mathcal{X})= 2$.
  We leave a large area open for further research and we indicate several possible directions.</description>

      <title>Parametrized equivalence relation on the global class of morphisms of a category and frame-theoretic examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an equivalence relation on the global class of morphisms of a category that extends several classical notions of equivalence in mathematics. We show that the standard group-action equivalence is a special case of our framework. A more interesting example is provided by an equivalence relation defined on the class of Bessel families and based on a coarse invariant that is the pointwise norm of the analysis operator of the Bessel family -- this is also a special case of our framework, and the formalism developed here can be seen as a first step toward a categorical invariant theory for Bessel families and continuous frames.</description>

      <title>Topological Classification of Insulators: III. Non-interacting Spectrally-Gapped Systems in All Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-interacting electrons in disordered materials which exhibit a spectral gap, in each of the ten Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, in all space dimensions. We define an appropriate space of Hamiltonians and a topology on it so that the so-called strong topological invariants become complete invariants yielding the Kitaev periodic table, but now derived as the set of path-connected components of the space of Hamiltonians, rather than as $K$-theory groups. We thus confirm the conjecture regarding a one-to-one correspondence between topological phases of gapped non-interacting systems and the respective Abelian groups $\{0\},\mathbb{Z},2\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_2$ in the spectral gap regime. We do this by providing the appropriate notion of locality, as well as a novel, so-called bulk non-triviality, which together reproduce the Kitaev table. Once the natural definitions are identified, the main technical achievement is lifting $K$-theory calculations to $\pi_0$ of unitaries and projections.</description>

      <title>The condition number of a random banded Toeplitz matrix is typically large</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that square matrices with independent and identically distributed (iid) random entries are typically well conditioned. A natural question is whether this favorable behavior persists for random matrices whose entries obey additional structure, i.e., their position inside of the matrix. A prominent class of structured matrices is given by {\it Toeplitz matrices}, characterized by constant diagonals. A particular tractable subclass is that of circulant matrices, whose additional characteristic (its entries {\it circulate} row by row) allows one to express their conditioning in terms of the localization of the zeros of a associated polynomial. When the entries of a circulant matrix are iid, the matrix is well conditioned precisely when the corresponding random polynomial has no zeros on the unit circle. This connection is especially relevant because, as the degree of a random polynomial increases, its zeros tend to concentrate near the unit circle, making it a delicate problem to quantify how close the closest zeros lie to the unit circle. Another notable family within the Toeplitz class is that of {\it banded Toeplitz matrices}, namely matrices for which only finitely many diagonals around the main diagonal may be nonzero. These matrices have been extensively studied in Operator Theory, nevertheless, despite their apparent simplicity, they raise subtle questions regarding the behavior of their condition numbers. In present work we show that the bandwidth asymmetry plays a decisive role: if the band contains $r$ diagonals below and $s$ diagonal above the main diagonal, then if $r=s$ the banded Toeplitz matriz is well conditioned with high probability, whereas if $r\neq s$ it is typically ill conditioned. This highlights that structural constraints can have a impact on the numerical behavior of random matrices.</description>

      <title>Potential trace inequalities via a Calder\'on-type theorem</title>

Abstract: In this paper we develop a general theoretical tool for the establishment of the boundedness of notoriously difficult operators (such as potentials) on certain specific types of rearrangement-invariant function spaces from analogous properties of operators that are easier to handle (such as fractional maximal operators). A principal example of the new results one obtains by our analysis is the following inequality, which generalizes a result of Korobkov and Kristensen (who had treated the case $\mu=\mathcal{L}^n$, the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$): There exists a constant $C&gt;0$ such that \[\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |I_\alpha^\mu f|^p d\nu \leq C \|f\|_{L^{p,1}(\mathbb{R}^n,\mu)}^p\] for all $f$ in the Lorentz space $L^{p,1}(\mathbb{R}^n,\mu)$, where $\mu, \nu$ are Radon measures such that \[\sup_{Q} \frac{\mu(Q)}{l(Q)^{d}} &lt; \infty \quad \text{and} \quad \sup_{\mu(Q)&gt;0} \frac{\nu(Q)}{\quad\mu(Q)^{1-\frac{\alpha p}{d}}} &lt; \infty,\] and $I_\alpha^\mu$ is the Riesz potential defined with respect to $\mu$ of order $\alpha \in (0,d)$. More broadly, we obtain inequalities in this spirit in the context of rearrangement-invariant spaces through a result of independent interest, an extension of an interpolation theorem of Calder\'on where the target space in one endpoint is a space of bounded functions.</description>

Abstract: Let $\{\tau_j\}_{j=1}^n$ and $\{\omega_k\}_{k=1}^n$ be two orthonormal bases for a finite dimensional p-adic Hilbert space $\mathcal{X}$. Let $M,N\subseteq \{1, \dots, n\}$ be such that \begin{align*} \displaystyle \max_{j \in M, k \in N}|\langle \tau_j, \omega_k \rangle|&lt;1, \end{align*} where $o(M)$ is the cardinality of $M$. Then for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$, we show that \begin{align} (1) \quad \quad \quad \quad \|x\|\leq \left(\frac{1}{1-\displaystyle \max_{j \in M, k \in N}|\langle \tau_j, \omega_k \rangle|}\right)\max\left\{\displaystyle \max_{j \in M^c}|\langle x, \tau_j\rangle |, \displaystyle \max_{k \in N^c}|\langle x, \omega_k\rangle |\right\}. \end{align}
  We call Inequality (1) as \textbf{p-adic Ghobber-Jaming Uncertainty Principle}. Inequality (1) is the p-adic version of uncertainty principle obtained by Ghobber and Jaming \textit{[Linear Algebra Appl., 2011]}. We also derive analogues of Inequality (1) for non-Archimedean Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>On Weak Compactness and Uniform Regularity in Lipschitz free Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the properties of weakly compact sets in Lipschitz free spaces. Prior research has established that, for a complete metric space $M$, weakly precompact sets in the Lipschitz free space $\mathcal F(M)$ are tight. In this paper, we prove that these sets actually exhibit a stronger property, which we call uniform regularity. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to characterize weakly compact sets, except in the case of scattered metric spaces. On the other hand, if $T$ is an $\mathbb R$-tree, we leverage Godard's isometry between $\mathcal F(T)$ and $L^1(\lambda_T)$ to obtain an intrinsic characterization of weakly compact sets in $\mathcal F(T)$. This approach allows us to identify conditions that may describe weak compactness across a wider range of spaces. In particular, we provide a characterization of norm-compactness in terms of sums of "large molecules'', while we show that sums of "small molecules'' contain an $\ell_1$-basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.15402v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Hilbert-type operator defined by
  $$
  H_{\omega}(f)(z)=\int_0^1 f(t)\left(\frac{1}{z}\int_0^z B^{\omega}_t(u)\,du\right)\,\omega(t)dt,$$ where $\{B^{\omega}_\zeta\}_{\zeta\in\mathbb{D}}$ are the reproducing kernels of the Bergman space $A^2_\omega$ induced by a radial weight $\omega$ in the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$. We prove that $H_{\omega}$ is bounded from $H^\infty$ to the Bloch space if and only if $\omega$ belongs to the class $\widehat{\mathcal{D}}$, which consists of radial weights $\omega$ satisfying the doubling condition $\sup_{0\le r&lt;1} \frac{\int_r^1 \omega(s)\,ds}{\int_{\frac{1+r}{2}}^1\omega(s)\,ds}&lt;\infty$. Further, we describe the weights $\omega\in \widehat{\mathcal{D}}$ such that $H_\omega$ is bounded on the Hardy space $H^1$, and we show that for any $\omega\in \widehat{\mathcal{D}}$ and $p\in (1,\infty)$, $H_\omega:\,L^p_{[0,1)} \to H^p$ is bounded if and only if the Muckenhoupt type condition
  \begin{equation*}
  \sup\limits_{0&lt;r&lt;1}\left(1+\int_0^r \frac{1}{\widehat{\omega}(t)^p} dt\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
  \left(\int_r^1 \omega(t)^{p'}\,dt\right)^{\frac{1}{p'}} &lt;\infty,
  \end{equation*} holds. Moreover, we address the analogous question about the action of $H_{\omega}$ on weighted Bergman spaces $A^p_\nu$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the theory of base norm spaces to the complex case, and further to the noncommutative setting relevant to `quantum convexity'. In particular, we establish the duality between complex Archimedean order unit spaces and complex base norm spaces, as well as the corresponding duality between their noncommutative counterparts. Additional topics include an exploration of natural connections with various notions of quantum convexity and regularity of noncommutative convex sets, and an analysis of how these concepts interact with complexification. We also define, as in the classical case, a class that contains and generates the noncommutative base norm spaces, but is defined by fewer axioms. We show how this may be applied to provide new and interesting examples of noncommutative base norm spaces.</description>
