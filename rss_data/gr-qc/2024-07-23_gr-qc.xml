      <title>A parametrized quasi-normal mode framework for modified Teukolsky equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modifications to general relativity lead to effects in the spectrum of quasi-normal modes of black holes. In this paper, we develop a parametrized formalism to describe deviations from general relativity in the Teukolsky equation, which governs linear perturbations of spinning black holes. We do this by introducing a correction to the effective potential of the Teukolsky equation in the form of a $1/r$ expansion controlled by free parameters. The method assumes that a small deviation in the effective potential induces a small modification in the spectrum of modes and in the angular separation constants. We isolate and compute the universal linear contribution to the quasi-normal mode frequencies and separation constants in a set of coefficients, and test them against known examples in the literature (massive scalar field, Dudley-Finley equation and higher-derivative gravity). We make the coefficients publicly available for relevant overtone, angular momentum and azimuthal numbers of modes and different values of the black hole spin.</description>

      <title>Quantum two-level systems and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interaction between gravitational waves and a quantum two-level system consisting of a spin 1/2 particle using the formalism of the proper detector frame. This approach highlights the effects of gravitational waves on both the particles and the observer, emphasizing that only relative measurements can be made. Specifically, within this framework, the gravitational field of the waves is described using the gravitoelectromagnetic analogy. The interaction of the system is then determined by the gravitomagnetic field of the wave, which induces a time-dependent perturbation. We analyze this perturbation for both generic frequencies and resonance conditions, and discuss its implications.</description>

      <title>The enhancement of Gaussian mixture modelling as an application to the coherent WaveBurst algorithm in the search for short gravitational wave transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an enhanced method for the application of Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM) to the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) algorithm in the search for short-duration gravitational wave (GW) transients. The supervised Machine Learning method of GMM allows for the multi-dimensional distributions of noise and signal to be modelled over a set of representative attributes, which aids in the classification of GW signals against noise transients (glitches) in the data. We demonstrate that updating the approach to model construction eliminates bias previously seen in the GMM analysis, increasing the robustness and sensitivity of the analysis over a wider range of burst source populations. The enhanced methodology is applied to the generic burst all-sky short search in the LIGO-Virgo full third observing run (O3), marking the first application of GMM to the 3 detector Livingston-Hanford-Virgo network. For both 2- and 3- detector networks, we observe comparable sensitivities to an array of generic signal morphologies, with significant sensitivity improvements to waveforms in the low Quality factor parameter space at false alarm rates of 1 per 100 years. This proves that GMM can effectively mitigate blip glitches, which are one of the most problematic sources of noise for un-modelled GW searches. The cWB-GMM search recovers similar numbers of compact binary coalescence (CBC) events as other cWB post-production methods, and concludes on no new gravitational wave detection after known CBC events are removed.</description>

      <title>Born-Infeld stars and charged black holes surrounded by scalar clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the formation of scalar clouds on charged, spherically symmetric and static stars and black holes. We first discuss Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes with electric and magnetic charge and present new results demonstrating the existence of a second branch of solutions. Moreover, we find that the presence of the magnetic charge allows for smaller mass and Noether charge when the clouds are close to their minimal possible mean radius. Replacing standard electrodynamics by Born-Infeld (BI) electrodynamics, the background model possesses globally regular, star-like as well as black hole solutions. We show that the former can be scalarized as well and that the scalar clouds become more compact when decreasing the electric charge of the BI star. Finally, we discuss a magnetic dipole field in the background of the scalarized BI star and show that the strong gravitational field of this star leads to a significant change.</description>

      <title>Gravity experiments with radio pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the first pulsar in a binary star system, the Hulse--Taylor pulsar, 50 years ago opened up an entirely new field of experimental gravity. For the first time it was possible to investigate strong-field and radiative aspects of the gravitational interaction. Continued observations of the Hulse--Taylor pulsar eventually led, among other confirmations of the predictions of general relativity (GR), to the first evidence for the reality of gravitational waves. In the meantime, many more radio pulsars have been discovered that are suitable for testing GR and its alternatives. One particularly remarkable binary system is the Double Pulsar, which has far surpassed the Hulse--Taylor pulsar in several respects. In addition, binary pulsar-white dwarf systems have been shown to be particularly suitable for testing alternative gravitational theories, as they often predict strong dipolar gravitational radiation for such asymmetric systems. A rather unique pulsar laboratory is the pulsar in a hierarchical stellar triple, that led to by far the most precise confirmation of the strong-field version of the universality of free fall. Using radio pulsars, it could be shown that additional aspects of the Strong Equivalence Principle apply to the dynamics of strongly self-gravitating bodies, like the local position and local Lorentz invariance of the gravitational interaction. So far, GR has passed all pulsar tests with flying colours, while at the same time many alternative gravity theories have either been strongly constrained or even falsified. New telescopes, instrumentation, timing and search algorithms promise a significant improvement of the existing tests and the discovery of (qualitatively) new, more relativistic binary systems.</description>

      <title>Boosted Kerr-Newman Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain a new solution of Einstein field equations which describes a boosted Kerr-Newman black hole relative to a Lorentz frame at future null infinity. To simplify our analysis we consider a particular configuration in which the boost is aligned with the black hole angular momentum. The boosted Kerr-Newman black hole is obtained considering the complete asymptotic Lorentz transformations of Robinson-Trautman coordinates to Bondi-Sachs, including the perturbation term of the boosted Robinson-Trautman metric. To verify that the final form of the metric is indeed a solution of Einstein field equations, we evaluate the corresponding energy-momentum tensor the boosted Kerr-Newman solution. To this end, we consider the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor built with the Kerr boosted metric together with its timelike killing vector. We show that the Papapetrou field thus obtained engender an energy-momentum tensor which satisfies Einstein field equations up to 4th order for the Kerr-Newman metric. To proceed, we examine the causal structure of the boosted Kerr-Newman black hole in Bondi-Sachs coordinates as in a preferred timelike foliation. We show that the ultimate effect of a nonvanishing charge is to shrink the overall size of the event horizon and ergosphere areas when compared to the neutral boosted Kerr black holes. Considering the preferred timelike foliation we obtain the electromagnetic fields for a proper nonrotating frame of reference. We show that while the electric field displays a pure radial behaviour, the magnetic counterpart develops an involved structure with two intense lobes of the magnetic field observed in the direction opposite to the boost.</description>

      <title>Joint Inference of Population, Cosmology, and Neutron Star Equation of State from Gravitational Waves of Dark Binary Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) are expected to be accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) emissions, which help to identify the host galaxy. Since GW events directly measure their luminosity distances, joint GW-EM observations from BNSs help to study cosmology, particularly the Hubble constant, unaffected by cosmic distance ladder systematics. However, detecting EM counterparts from BNS mergers is not always possible. Additionally, the tidal deformations of BNS components offer insights into the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS). In such cases, the tidal parameters of NSs, combined with the knowledge of the NS EoS, can break the degeneracy between mass parameters and redshift, allowing for the inference of the Hubble constant. Several efforts have aimed to infer the Hubble constant using the tidal parameters of BNSs, without EM counterparts, termed dark BNSs. Moreover, some studies have focused on the joint estimation of population and NS EoS for unbiased NS EoS estimation. However, none of the works consistently combined the uncertainties of population, cosmology, and NS EoS within a Bayesian framework. In this study, we propose a novel Bayesian analysis to jointly constrain the NS EoS, population, and cosmological parameters using a population of dark BNSs detected through GW observations. This method can well constrain the Hubble constant with as few as $5$ BNS observations using current-generation detectors. This level of precision is unattainable without incorporating the NS EoS, especially when observing BNS mergers without EM counterpart information.</description>

      <title>Fractional Holographic Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic dark energy theories present a fascinating interface to probe late-time cosmology, as guided by contemporary ideas about quantum gravity. In this work, we present a new holographic dark energy scenario designated Fractional Holographic Dark Energy (FHDE). This model extends the conventional framework of HDEs by incorporating specific features from fractional calculus recently applied, e.g., in cosmological settings. In this manner, we retrieve a novel form of HDE energy density. We then show how FHDE can provide a consistent picture of the evolution of the late-time universe even with the simple choice of the Hubble horizon as the IR (infrared) cutoff. We provide detailed descriptions of the cosmological evolution, showing how the fractional calculus ingredients can alleviate quite a few issues associated with the conventional HDE scenario. Concretely, we compute and plot diagrams using the Hubble horizon cutoff for HDE. The density parameters for DE and dark matter (DM), the deceleration parameter, and the DE EoS parameter indicate how the universe may evolve within our FHDE model, fitting within an appropriate scenario of late-time cosmology.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian path-integral of Robin Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational path-integral of Gauss-Bonnet gravity is investigated and the transition from one spacelike boundary configuration to another is analyzed. Of particular interest is the case of Neumann and Robin boundary conditions which is known to lead to stable Universe in Einstein-Hilbert gravity in four spacetime dimensions. After setting up the variational problem and computing the necessary boundary terms, the transition amplitude can be exactly computed in the mini-superspace approximation. The $\hbar\to0$ limit brings out the dominant pieces in the path-integral which is traced to an initial configuration corresponding to Hartle-Hawking no-boundary Universe. A deeper study involving Picard-Lefschetz methods not only allow us to find the integration contour along which the path-integral becomes convergent but also aids in understanding the crossover from Euclidean to Lorentzian signature. Saddle analysis further highlights the boundary configurations giving dominant contribution to the path-integral which is seen to be those corresponding to Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal and agrees with the exact computation. To ensure completeness, a comparison with the results from Wheeler-DeWitt equation is done.</description>

      <title>The Low Energy Limit of BFSS Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the low-energy regime of BFSS quantum mechanics using its holographic dual. We identify three distinct thermodynamic phases (black holes) and analyze their thermodynamic properties extensively, including phase transitions amongst the several phases. While the properties of the canonical ensemble aligns with existing conjectures on BFSS thermodynamics, we uncover intriguing and unexpected behavior in the microcanonical ensemble. Specifically, for sufficiently low energies, we observe the dominance of the localized phase. Surprisingly, we also identify an energy range where the non-uniform phase becomes dominant. The transition between these phases is mediated by a Kol-type topology-changing phenomenon.</description>

      <title>H-infinity Optimization for Active Seismic Isolation Systems in Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-frequency seismic noise poses a significant challenge in gravitational-wave detectors, prompting the use of active seismic isolation systems. These systems employ advanced control configurations, including feedback control, sensor correction, and sensor fusion, to mitigate seismic disturbances. Optimal performance of these systems is achieved through the application of the H-infinity method, which optimizes control filters. The H-infinity method was employed to optimize a sensor correction filter and complementary filters for sensor fusion for a KAGRA Type-B suspension, resulting in the development of an instrumentation-optimal ``super sensor''. The super sensor exhibits comparable overall displacement noise RMS performance to a relative sensor, yet offers significantly better band-limited RMS performance around the secondary microseism frequency, making it highly robust to seismic noise. This highlights the efficacy of the H-infinity method in generating seismic isolation filters tailored to instrument limitations, thereby transforming the system into a fully functional active seismic isolation system.</description>

      <title>Robustness of neutron star merger simulations to changes in neutrino transport and neutrino-matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers play an important role in nuclear astrophysics: their gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals carry information about the equation of state of cold matter above nuclear saturation density, and they may be one of the main sources of r-process elements in the Universe. Neutrino-matter interactions during and after merger impact the properties of these electromagnetic signals, and the relative abundances of the produced r-process elements. Existing merger simulations are however limited in their ability to realistically model neutrino transport and neutrino-matter interactions. Here, we perform a comparison of the impact of the use of state-of-the art two-moment or Monte-Carlo transport schemes on the outcome of merger simulations, for a single binary neutron star system with a short-lived neutron star remnant ($(5-10)\,{\rm ms}$). We also investigate the use of different reaction rates in the simulations. While the best transport schemes generally agree well on the qualitative impact of neutrinos on the system, differences in the behavior of the high-density regions can significantly impact the collapse time and the properties of the hot tidal arms in this metastable merger remnant. The chosen interaction rates, transport algorithm, as well as recent improvements by Radice et al to the two-moment algorithms can all contribute to changes at the $(10-30)\%$ level in the global properties of the merger remnant and outflows. The limitations of previous moment schemes fixed by Radice et al also appear sufficient to explain the large difference that we observed in the production of heavy-lepton neutrinos in a previous comparison of Monte-Carlo and moment schemes in the context of a low mass binary neutron star system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-established that black holes obey laws of thermodynamics, in particular, there is the seminal Iyer-Wald derivation of the first law of thermodynamics for any stationary black hole solution of a generic diffeomorphism invariant theory of gravity. We revisit Iyer-Wald derivation within the framework of covariant phase space with fluctuating boundaries. We extend Iyer-Wald derivation by relaxing the need for the assumptions at a bifurcation surface and asymptotic infinity, as well as addressing the questions regarding the integrability of charges. Along the way, we also shed a clarifying light on the longstanding question of defining covariant charges in general relativity and present a first principles derivation of the Smarr relation within our framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive formulae for the soft limit of tree-level gluon and graviton correlators in Anti-de Sitter space, which arise from Feynman diagrams encoding the Weinberg soft theorems in flat space. Other types of diagrams can also contribute to the soft limit at leading order in the soft momentum, but have a different pole structure. We derive these results at four points using explicit formulae recently obtained from the cosmological bootstrap and double copy, and extend them to any multiplicity using bootstrap techniques in Mellin-momentum space.</description>

      <title>Parametric Representations of Neutron-Star Equations of State With Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of low-dimensional parametric representations of neutron-star equations of state that include discontinuities caused by phase transitions. The accuracies of optimal piecewise-analytic and spectral representations are evaluated for equations of state having first- or second-order phase transitions with a wide range of discontinuity sizes. These results suggest that the piecewise-analytic representations of these non-smooth equations of state are convergent, while the spectral representations are not. Nevertheless, the lower-order (2 &lt;= N_parms &lt;= 7) spectral representations are found to be more accurate than the piecewise-analytic representations with the same number of parameters.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we consider some initial data rigidity results concerning marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS). As is well known, MOTS play an important role in the theory of black holes and, at the same time, are interesting spacetime analogues of minimal surfaces in Riemannian geometry. The main results presented here expand upon earlier works by the authors, specifically addressing initial data sets incorporating charge.</description>

      <title>Axion species scale and axion weak gravity conjecture-like bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a cutoff scale of quantum gravity, the species scale can be defined by the scale at which the perturbativity of the non-renormalizable gravitational interaction begins to break down. Since it is determined by the number of species in the effective field theory, we can find the close connection to the distance conjecture, which predicts the lowering of the cutoff at the asymptotic limit of the moduli space caused by the descent of a tower of states from UV. Meanwhile, the same kind of the cutoff scale can be obtained from any non-renormalizable interaction, in particular the interaction between the axion and the gauge field through the $\theta F\wedge F$ term. Demanding this `axion species scale' not to exceed the gravitational species scale, we obtain the bound $(8\pi^2/g^2)f \lesssim M_{\rm Pl}$. This is quite similar to the axion weak gravity conjecture bound, but can be applied to any gauge as well as the string interactions which are relevant to towers of states. We also investigate the implications of the (axion) species scale and the axion weak gravity conjecture-like bound by considering the Peccei-Quinn charge reduction of black hole through the interaction between black hole and the string or wormhole.</description>

      <title>In Which Sense Can We Say That First-Class Constraints Generate Gauge Transformations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I consider a recent controversy about whether first-class constraints generate gauge transformations in the case of electromagnetism. I argue that there is a notion of gauge transformation, the extended notion, which is different from the original gauge transformation of electromagnetism, but at the same time not trivial, which allows the making of that claim. I further argue that one can expect that this claim can be extended to more general theories, and that Dirac's conjecture may be true for some physically reasonable theories and only in this sense of gauge transformation. Finally, I argue that the extended notion of gauge transformation seems unnatural from the point of view of classical theories, but that it nicely fits with the way quantum versions of gauge theories are constructed.</description>

      <title>Primordial Intermediate-mass Binary Black Holes as Targets for Space Laser Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) with log-normal mass spectrum with masses up to $\sim 10^4-10^5 M_\odot$ can be created after QCD phase transition in the early Universe at $z\sim 10^{12}$ by the modified Affleck-Dine baryogenesis. Using a model binary PBH formation, the expected detection rate of such binary intermediate-mass PBHs by the TianQin space laser interferometer is calculated to be from a few to hundreds events per year for the assumed parameters of the PBH log-normal mass spectrum and abundance consistent with LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA results. Distinctive features of such primordial IMBH mergings are vanishingly small effective spins, possible high redshifts $z&gt;20$ and lack of association with gas-rich regions or galaxies.</description>

      <title>Constraints on scalar and vector dark matter admixed neutron stars with linear and quadratic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of dark matter scalar and vector-mediated interactions on dark matter admixed neutron stars. In particular, we exploit the two-fluid formalism of Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations as generic framework for dark matter admixed neutron stars. The fluids couple to each other only by gravity. In particular, the baryonic sector is described by the BSk22 equation of state, whereas we employ a relativistic mean field model for the dark matter, where we include the interaction of dark massive fermions with light dark scalar and vector mediators. We consider both the linear and the quadratic scalar interactions with the dark fermion. In the quadratic scalar scenario, we take into account a quartic self-interaction that significantly affects the stellar properties. Interestingly, in both cases, the effect of the scalar coupling is smaller than that of the vector, though quantitative differences arise. We also compute the sound speed of DM, finding that the scalar and quadratic couplings have an important influence on it. We compare our results with GW1708017, GW190425 and NICER data and constrain DM couplings and mass.</description>

Abstract: We explore the action principle for the holographic $T\bar{T}$-deformation. We develop a scheme in which one can holographically reproduce the action of the Liouville theory deformed by $T\bar{T}$-insertion. This scheme necessitates considering the bending energy of the finite cut-off surface. Following our proposal, one observes a perfect match between the actions of deformed theory on the field theory and gravity sides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study scalar-tensor gravitational theories using on-shell amplitude methods. We focus on theories with gravity coupled to a massless scalar via the Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons terms. In this framework, we calculate the waveforms for classical scalar radiation emitted in scattering of macroscopic objects, including spin effects. To this end, we use the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell formalism, with the 5-particle amplitude for scalar emission in matter scattering calculated at tree level using the unitarity-factorization bootstrap techniques. We also discuss in detail the dependence of that amplitude on the contact terms of the intermediate 4-particle scalar-graviton-matter amplitude. Finally, we discuss the conditions for resolvability of classical scalar radiation.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon Dark Matter and Low-Frequency Gravitational Wave Detection with Gaia-like Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometric surveys offer us a method to search for elusive cosmic signatures, such as ultralight dark photon dark matter and gravitational waves, by observing the deflection to the apparent positions of the stars. The detection capabilities of such surveys rapidly decrease at low frequencies, because the signals become hardly distinguishable from the background motion of stars. In this work, we find that the background motion can be well described by a linear model over time, based on which we propose a linear background subtraction scheme. Compared to the conventional quadratic subtraction, the advantage of linear subtraction emerges within the frequency range below $6 \times 10^{-9}~{\rm Hz}$. Taking dark photons with purely gravitational interactions, dark photons with additional $U(1)_{B}$ or $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge interactions, and low-frequency gravitational waves as examples, we illustrate that the linear subtraction scheme can result in an enhancement of more than one order of magnitude in the exclusion limits of Gaia-like experiments in the low-frequency range.</description>

Abstract: We study the emergent dynamics of an anisotropic universe in the context of Group Field Theory condensate cosmology, with a scalar field playing the role of a relational clock. According to different definitions of ``isotropy'', two anisotropic condensate states are considered and the Bianchi-like dynamics of cosmological anisotropic observables, as well as their quantum fluctuations, are analysed. We find that both anisotropic states become isotropic at late time, reproducing an effective Friedmann dynamics, while anisotropies give small but non-negligible contributions at earlier times, closer to the cosmic bounce.</description>

      <title>GLANCE -- Gravitational Lensing Authenticator using Non-Modelled Cross-Correlation Exploration of Gravitational Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is the phenomenon where the presence of matter (called a lens) bends the path of light-like trajectories travelling nearby. Similar to the geometric optics limit of electromagnetic waves, gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) can occur in geometric optics condition when GW wavelength is much smaller than the Schwarzschild radius of the lens i.e. $\lambda_{GW} \ll$ R$^{\rm s}_{\rm lens}$. This is known as the strong-lensing regime for which a multiple-image system with different magnifications and phase-shifts is formed. We developed $\texttt{GLANCE}$, Gravitational Lensing Authenticator using Non-modelled Cross-correlation Exploration, a novel technique to detect strongly lensed GW signals. We demonstrate that cross-correlation between two noisy reconstruction of polarized GW signals shows a non-zero value when the signals are lensed counterparts. The relative strength between the signal cross-correlation and noise cross-correlation can quantify the significance of the event(s) being lensed. Since lensing biases the inference of source parameters, primarily the luminosity distance, a joint parameter estimation of the source and lens-induced parameters is incorporated using a Bayesian framework. We applied $\texttt{GLANCE}$ to synthetic strong lensing data and showed that it can detect lensed GW signals and correctly constrain the injected source and lens parameters, even when one of the signals is below match-filtered threshold signal-to-noise ratio. This demonstrates $\texttt{GLANCE}'$s capability as a robust detection technique for strongly lensed GW signals and can distinguish between lensed and unlensed events.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in metric teleparallel gravity with the Nieh-Yan (NY) term, which results in parity violation during the radiation-dominated era. By solving the equations of motion of linear scalar perturbations from both the metric and the tetrad fields, we obtain the corresponding analytic expressions. Then, we calculate the SIGWs in metric teleparallel gravity with the NY term and evaluate the energy density of SIGWs with a monochromatic power spectrum numerically. We find that the spectrum of the energy density of SIGWs in metric teleparallel gravity with the NY term is significantly different from that in general relativity (GR), which makes metric teleparallel gravity distinguishable from GR.</description>

      <title>Well behaved class of Heintzmann's solution within $f(R,\,T)$ framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to develop a well-behaved class of Heintzmann IIa [{\em H. Heintzmann, Z. Physik 228, 489-493 (1969)}] solution in the context of $f(R,\, T)$ gravity. In the $f(R, T)$ framework, the gravitational action includes both the Ricci scalar ($R$) and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor ($T$). We chose a particular $f(R,\,T)$ model s.t. $f(R,\,T) = R+2 \chi T$, where $\chi$ is known as the coupling parameter. This solution describes a novel isotropic compact fluid sphere with positively finite central pressure and density in this extended theory of gravity. The results obtained analytically are better described by graphical representations of the physical parameters for various values of the coupling parameter $\chi$. The solution for a specific compact object, Vela X-1, with radius $\mathfrak{R} = 9.56_{-0.08}^{+0.08}$ km and mass $\mathcal{M} = 1.77 \pm 0.08~\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$ [{\em M. L. Rawls et al. ApJ, 730, 25 (2011)}], is shown here. We analyze the fundamental physical attributes of the star, which reveals the influence of the coupling parameter $\chi$ on the values of substance parameters. This helps us to make a fruitful comparison of this modified $f(R,\, T)$ gravity with the standard GR and notice that it holds good for stable compact objects. In this framework, the star under our consideration exhibits a stable structure consistent with the Heintzmann IIa {\em ansatz}. From all of our obtained graphical and numerical results, we can ultimately conclude that our reported model is physically admissible and satisfies all the physical criteria for an acceptable model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathur and Mehta won the third prize in the 2023 Gravity Research Foundation Essay Competition for proving the universality of black hole (BH) thermodynamics. Specifically, they demonstrated that any Extremely Compact Object (ECO) must have the same BH thermodynamic properties regardless of whether or not the ECO possesses an event horizon. The result is remarkable, but it was obtained under the approximation according to which the BH emission spectrum has an exactly thermal character. In fact, strong arguments based on energy conservation and BH back reaction imply that the spectrum of the Hawking radiation cannot be exactly thermal. In this work the result of Mathur and Mehta will be extended to the case where the radiation spectrum is not exactly thermal using the concept of BH dynamical state.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we consider the $4+n$ dimensional spacetimes among which one is the four dimensional physical Universe and the other is an n-dimensional sphere with constant radius in the framework of Lanczos-Lovelock gravity. We find that the curvature of extra dimensional sphere contributes a huge but negative energy density provided that its radius is sufficiently small, such as the scale of Planck length. Therefore, the huge positive vacuum energy, i.e. the large positive cosmological constant is exactly cancelled out by the curvature of extra sphere. In the mean time the higher order of Lanczos-Lovelock term contributes an observations-allowed small cosmological constant if the number of extra dimensions is sufficiently large, such as $n\approx{69}$.</description>

Abstract: The production of quantum field excitations or particles in cosmological spacetimes is a hallmark prediction of curved quantum field theory. The generation of cosmological perturbations from quantum fluctuations in the early universe constitutes an important application. The problem can be quantum-simulated in terms of structure formation in an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with time-dependent s-wave scattering length. Here, we explore a mapping between cosmological particle production in general (D+1)-dimensional spacetimes and scattering problems described by the non-relativistic stationary Schr\"odinger equation in one dimension. Through this mapping, intuitive explanations for emergent spatial structures in both the BEC and the cosmological system can be obtained for a large class of analogue cosmological scenarios, ranging from power-law expansions to periodic modulations. The investigated cosmologies and their scattering analogues are tuned to be implemented in a (2+1)-dimensional quantum field simulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify an anisotropic divergence-free conformal Killing tensor $K_{jl}$ for static spherically symmetric spacetimes, and write the conformal Killing gravity equations as Einstein equations augmented by this tensor. The field equations are of second order: this fact allows for analytic solutions and considerably simplifies the derivation of results of previous studies based on the original Harada equations. In particular, we prove the equivalence of the known third order field equations, with the second order ones obtained by us in the conformal Killing parametrization. The structure of the Ricci tensor and of the conformal Killing tensor are compatible with both anisotropic fluid sources and (non)-linear electrodynamics. We reobtain covariantly and in simple steps the general static spherical solutions for vacuum and linear electrodynamics. Moreover we recover the purely magnetic Lagrangian functions that induce metrics of interest for black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relaxation of holographic superfluids after quenches, when the end state is either tuned to be exactly at the critical point, or very close to it. By solving the bulk equations of motion numerically, we demonstrate that in the former case the system exhibits a power law falloff as well as an emergent discrete scale invariance. The later case is in the regime dominated by critical slowing down, and we show that there is an intermediate time-range before the onset of late time exponential falloff, where the system behaves similarly to the critical point with its power law falloff. We further postulate a phenomenological Gross-Pitaevskii-like equation that is able to make quantitative predictions for the behavior of the holographic superfluid after near-critical quenches. Intriguingly, all parameters of our phenomenological equation which describes the non-linear time evolution may be fixed with information from the static equilibrium solutions and linear response theory.</description>

Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence, or holography, has provided numerous important insights into the behavior of strongly-coupled many-body systems. Crucially, it has provided a testing ground for the construction of new effective field theories, especially those in the low frequency, long wavelength limit known as hydrodynamics. We review the study of strongly-coupled rotating fluids using holography, and we examine the hydrodynamics emerging from the study of rotating Myers-Perry black holes. We discuss three regimes in which holographic rotating fluids display either (1) hydrodynamic behavior of a boosted fluid, (2) hydrodynamic behavior distinct from a boosted fluid, or (3) no obvious hydrodynamic behavior. We describe techniques to obtain hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic modes, and we compute the radius of convergence for the hydrodynamic regimes. The limitations of hydrodynamics under rotation are discussed alongside our findings.</description>

Abstract: The conformal flatness approximation to the Einstein equations has been successfully used in many astrophysical applications such as initial data constructions and dynamical simulations. Although it has been shown that full general relativistic strongly differentially rotating equilibrium models deviate by at most a few percent from their conformally flat counterparts, whether those conformally flat solutions remain stable has not been fully addressed. To further understand the limitations of the conformal flatness approximation, in this work, we construct spatially-conformally-flat hot hypermassive neutron stars with post-merger-like rotation laws, and perform conformally flat evolutions and analysis over dynamical timescales. We find that enforcing conformally-flat spacetime could change the equilibrium of quasi-toroidal models with high angular momentum for $J \gtrsim 9 ~G M_{\odot}^2 / c$ compared to fully general relativistic cases. In contrast, all the quasi-spherical models considered in this work remain stable even with high angular momentum $J=9~G M_{\odot}^2 / c$. Our investigation suggests that the quasi-spherical models are suitable initial data for long-lived hypermassive neutron star modeling in conformally flat spacetime.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing bounce and inflation via quantum signatures from cosmic microwave background</title>

Abstract: Cosmological inflation is a popular paradigm for understanding Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR); however, it faces many conceptual challenges. An alternative mechanism to inflation for generating an almost scale-invariant spectrum of perturbations is a \emph{bouncing cosmology} with an initial matter-dominated contraction phase, during which the modes corresponding to currently observed scales exited the Hubble radius. Bouncing cosmology avoids the initial singularity but has fine-tuning problems. Taking an \emph{agnostic view} of the two early-universe paradigms, we propose a quantum measure -- Dynamical Fidelity Susceptibility (DFS) of CMBR -- that distinguishes the two scenarios. Taking two simple models with the same power-spectrum, we explicitly show that DFS behaves differently for the two scenarios. We discuss the possibility of using DFS as a distinguisher in the upcoming space missions.</description>

      <title>A new observable for holographic cosmology</title>

Abstract: The double-cone geometry is a saddle of the gravitational path integral, which explains the chaotic statistics of the spectrum of black hole microstates. This geometry is the usual AdS-Schwarzschild black hole, but with a periodic identification of the time coordinate; the resulting singularity at the black hole horizon is regulated by making the geometry slightly complex. Here, we consider generalizations of the double-cone geometry which include the Lorentzian cosmology that sits between the event horizon and the black hole singularity. We analyze this in two and three dimensions, where the cosmology has compact spatial sections and big bang/crunch singularities. These singularities are regulated in the same way by slightly complexifying the metric. We show that this is possible while satisfying the Kontsevich-Segal criterion, implying that these geometries can be interpreted as perturbatively stable saddle points in general relativity. This procedure leads to a novel description of the cosmology in terms of standard observables in the dual boundary CFT. In three dimensions, the cosmological solution gives a new contribution to the two-point function of the density of states in the boundary CFT. Unlike the usual double cone, it describes correlations between black hole microstates with different masses, and in a limit describes correlations between the statistics of heavy states and states near the BTZ threshold.</description>
