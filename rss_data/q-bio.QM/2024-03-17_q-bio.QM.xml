      <title>An Improved Metric and Benchmark for Assessing the Performance of Virtual Screening Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is a key workflow in computational drug discovery. SBVS models are assessed by measuring the enrichment of known active molecules over decoys in retrospective screens. However, the standard formula for enrichment cannot estimate model performance on very large libraries. Additionally, current screening benchmarks cannot easily be used with machine learning (ML) models due to data leakage. We propose an improved formula for calculating VS enrichment and introduce the BayesBind benchmarking set composed of protein targets that are structurally dissimilar to those in the BigBind training set. We assess current models on this benchmark and find that none perform appreciably better than a KNN baseline.</description>

      <title>AdaNovo: Adaptive \emph{De Novo} Peptide Sequencing with Conditional Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tandem mass spectrometry has played a pivotal role in advancing proteomics, enabling the analysis of protein composition in biological samples. Despite the development of various deep learning methods for identifying amino acid sequences (peptides) responsible for observed spectra, challenges persist in \emph{de novo} peptide sequencing. Firstly, prior methods struggle to identify amino acids with post-translational modifications (PTMs) due to their lower frequency in training data compared to canonical amino acids, further resulting in decreased peptide-level identification precision. Secondly, diverse types of noise and missing peaks in mass spectra reduce the reliability of training data (peptide-spectrum matches, PSMs). To address these challenges, we propose AdaNovo, a novel framework that calculates conditional mutual information (CMI) between the spectrum and each amino acid/peptide, using CMI for adaptive model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate AdaNovo's state-of-the-art performance on a 9-species benchmark, where the peptides in the training set are almost completely disjoint from the peptides of the test sets. Moreover, AdaNovo excels in identifying amino acids with PTMs and exhibits robustness against data noise. The supplementary materials contain the official code.</description>

      <title>Overcompensation of transient and permanent death rate increases in age-structured models with cannibalistic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been renewed interest in understanding the mathematical structure of ecological population models that lead to overcompensation, the process by which a population recovers to a higher level after suffering a permanent increase in predation or harvesting. Here, we apply a recently formulated kinetic population theory to formally construct an age-structured single-species population model that includes a cannibalistic interaction in which older individuals prey on younger ones. Depending on the age-dependent structure of this interaction, our model can exhibit transient or steady-state overcompensation of an increased death rate as well as oscillations of the total population, both phenomena that have been observed in ecological systems. Analytic and numerical analysis of our model reveals sufficient conditions for overcompensation and oscillations. We also show how our structured population partial integrodifferential equation (PIDE) model can be reduced to coupled ODE models representing piecewise constant parameter domains, providing additional mathematical insight into the emergence of overcompensation.</description>

      <title>Detecting Brain Tumors through Multimodal Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tumors can manifest in various forms and in different areas of the human body. Brain tumors are specifically hard to diagnose and treat because of the complexity of the organ in which they develop. Detecting them in time can lower the chances of death and facilitate the therapy process for patients. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, more specifically, deep learning, has the potential to significantly reduce costs in terms of time and resources for the discovery and identification of tumors from images obtained through imaging techniques. This research work aims to assess the performance of a multimodal model for the classification of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans processed as grayscale images. The results are promising, and in line with similar works, as the model reaches an accuracy of around 98\%. We also highlight the need for explainability and transparency to ensure human control and safety.</description>
