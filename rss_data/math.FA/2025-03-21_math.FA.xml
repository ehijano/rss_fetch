      <title>Generalized Double Operator Integrals: Finite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Double Operator Integral (DOI) framework provides a powerful tool for analyzing perturbations and interactions between self-adjoint operators in functional analysis and spectral theory. However, most existing DOI formulations rely on self-adjointness (Hermitian) or unitary assumptions, limiting their applicability to non-Hermitian settings. Motivated by advancements in non-Hermitian physics and operator theory, this paper introduces Generalized Double Operator Integrals (GDOIs), extending DOI theory to arbitrary non-Hermitian and non-normal matrices. We establish key algebraic properties of GDOIs, derive norm estimations, and develop a perturbation formula that leads to Lipschitz continuity estimates for operator functions. Additionally, we prove the continuity of GDOIs and explore applications in random matrix theory and functional analysis, including tail bounds and H\"older-type estimations. These results provide a unified and flexible integral framework for non-Hermitian spectral analysis, broadening the impact of DOI techniques in non-commutative analysis and mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>Advanced Wigner Distribution and Ambiguity Function in the Quadratic-phase Fourier Transform Domain: Mathematical Foundations and Practical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-stationary signal processing, prior work has incorporated the quadratic-phase Fourier transform (QPFT) into the ambiguity function (AF) and Wigner distribution (WD) to enhance their performance. This paper introduces an advanced Wigner distribution and ambiguity function in the quadratic-phase Fourier transform domain (AWDQ/AAFQ), extending classical WD/AF formulations. Key properties, including the Moyal formula, anti-derivative property, shift, conjugation symmetry, and marginal properties, are established. Furthermore, the proposed distributions demonstrate improved effectiveness in linear frequency-modulated (LFM) signal detection. Simulation results confirm that AWDQ/AAFQ outperforms both traditional WD/AF and existing QPFT-based WD/AF methods in detection accuracy and overall performance.</description>

      <title>An algebraic characterization of linearity for additive maps preserving orthogonality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study when an additive mapping preserving orthogonality between two complex inner product spaces is automatically complex-linear or conjugate-linear. Concretely, let $H$ and $K$ be complex inner product spaces with dim$(H)\geq 2$, and let $A: H\to K$ be an additive map preserving orthogonality. We obtain that $A$ is zero or a positive scalar multiple of a real-linear isometry from $H$ into $K$. We further prove that the following statements are equivalent:
  $(a)$ $A$ is complex-linear or conjugate-linear.
  $(b)$ For every $z\in H$ we have $A(i z) \in \{\pm i A(z)\}$.
  $(c)$ There exists a non-zero point $z\in H$ such that $A(i z) \in \{\pm i A(z)\}$.
  $(d)$ There exists a non-zero point $z\in H$ such that $i A(z) \in A(H)$.
  The mapping $A$ neither is complex-linear nor conjugate-linear if, and only if, there exists a non-zero $x\in H$ such that $i A(x)\notin A(H)$ (equivalently, for every non-zero $x\in H$, $i A(x)\notin A(H)$).
  Among the consequences we show that, under the hypothesis above, the mapping $A$ is automatically complex-linear or conjugate-linear if $A$ has dense range, or if $H$ and $K$ are finite dimensional with dim$(K)&lt; 2\hbox{dim}(H)$.</description>

      <title>Hypercyclicity of Weighted shifts on weighted Bergman and Dirichlet spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $B_w$ and $F_w$ denote, respectively, the weighted backward and forward shift operators defined on the weighted Bergman space $A^p_{\phi}$, or the weighted Dirichlet space ${D}^p_{\phi}$ of the unit disc, where the weight function $\phi(z)$ is mostly radial. We first obtain sufficient conditions for $B_w$ and $F_w$ to be continuous on these spaces. For radial weights, we derive norm estimates for coefficient functionals on $A^p_{\phi}$ and $D^p_{\phi}$, and using those estimates we infer when the weighted shifts or their adjoints are hypercyclic. We also deal with a non-radial case.</description>

      <title>Closed BV-extension and $W^{1,1}$-extension sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the relations between extendability of different classes of Sobolev $W^{1,1}$ and $BV$ functions from closed sets in general metric measure spaces. Under the assumption that the metric measure space satisfies a weak $(1,1)$-Poincar\'e inequality and measure doubling, we prove further properties for the extension sets. In the case of the Euclidean plane, we show that compact finitely connected $BV$-extension sets are always also $W^{1,1}$-extension sets. This is shown via a local quasiconvexity result for the complement of the extension set.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of Fourier interpolation formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By applying new functional analysis tools in the framework of Fourier interpolation formulas, such as sc-Fredholm operators and Schauder frames, we are able to improve and refine several properties of these aforementioned formulas on the real line.
  As two examples of our main contributions, we highlight: (i) that we may upgrade perturbed interpolation bases all the way to the Schwartz space, which shows that even the perturbed interpolation formulas are as regular as the Radchenko-Viazovska case; (ii) that a certain subset of the interpolation formulae considered by Kulikov-Nazarov-Sodin may actually be upgraded to be convergent in the Schwartz class, giving a first partial answer to a question posed by those authors.
  As a final contribution of this work, we also show that, if the perturbations are sufficiently small, then even analyticity properties of the basis functions are preserved. This shows, in particular, that any function that vanishes on all but finitely many of the (perturbed) nodes is automatically analytic, a feature previously only known to hold in supercritical contexts besides the Radchenko-Viazovska case.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Stability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems Under Monotone Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the well-posedness and stability of an impedance passive infinite-dimensional linear system under nonlinear feedback of the form $u(t)=\phi(v(t)-y(t))$, where $\phi$ is a monotone function. Our first main result introduces conditions guaranteeing the existence of classical and generalised solutions in a situation where the original linear system is well-posed. In the absence of the external input $v$ we establish the existence of strong and generalised solutions under strictly weaker conditions. Finally, we introduce conditions guaranteeing that the origin is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point of the closed-loop system. Motivated by the analysis of partial differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions, we use our results to investigate the well-posedness and stablility of abstract boundary control systems, port-Hamiltonian systems, a Timoshenko beam model, and a two-dimensional boundary controlled heat equation.</description>

      <title>The Extreme Points of the Unit Ball of the James space $J$ and its dual spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of S. Bellenot's characterization of the extreme points of the unit ball $B_J$ of James quasi-reflexive space $J$. We also provide an explicit description of the norm of $J^{**}$ which yields an analogous characterization for the extreme points of $B_{J^{**}}$. In the last part of the paper we describe the set of all extreme points of $B_{J^*}$ and its norm closure. It is remarkable that the descriptions of the extreme points of $B_J$ and $B_{J^*}$ are closely connected.</description>

      <title>Constrained differential operators, Sobolev inequalities, and Riesz potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inequalities for Riesz potentials are well-known to be equivalent to Sobolev inequalities of the same order for domain norms "far" from $L^1$, but to be weaker otherwise. Recent contributions by Van Schaftingen, by Hernandez, Rai\c{t}\u{a} and Spector, and by Stolyarov proved that this gap can be filled in Riesz potential inequalities for vector-valued functions in $L^1$ fulfilling a co-canceling differential condition. This work demonstrates that such a property is not just peculiar to the space $L^1$. Indeed, under the same differential constraint, a Riesz potential inequality is shown to hold for any domain and target rearrangement-invariant norms that render a Sobolev inequality of the same order true. This is based on a new interpolation inequality, which, via a kind of duality argument, yields a parallel property of Sobolev inequalities for any linear homogeneous elliptic canceling differential operator. Specifically, Sobolev inequalities involving the full gradient of a certain order share the same rearrangement-invariant domain and target spaces as their analogs for any other homogeneous elliptic canceling differential operator of equal order. As a consequence, Riesz potential inequalities under the co-canceling constraint and Sobolev inequalities for homogeneous elliptic canceling differential operators are offered for general families of rearrangement-invariant spaces, such as the Orlicz spaces and the Lorentz-Zygmund spaces. Especially relevant instances of inequalities for domain spaces neighboring $L^1$ are singled out.</description>

      <title>Langevin Monte-Carlo Provably Learns Depth Two Neural Nets at Any Size and Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we will establish that the Langevin Monte-Carlo algorithm can learn depth-2 neural nets of any size and for any data and we give non-asymptotic convergence rates for it. We achieve this via showing that under Total Variation distance and q-Renyi divergence, the iterates of Langevin Monte Carlo converge to the Gibbs distribution of Frobenius norm regularized losses for any of these nets, when using smooth activations and in both classification and regression settings. Most critically, the amount of regularization needed for our results is independent of the size of the net. This result combines several recent observations, like our previous papers showing that two-layer neural loss functions can always be regularized by a certain constant amount such that they satisfy the Villani conditions, and thus their Gibbs measures satisfy a Poincare inequality.</description>
