      <title>Differential topology and micro-structure of black hole in Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg spacetimes with exponential entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact black holes in the Einstein Euler-Heisenberg theory are explored with an exponential entropy framework by using the topological current $\Psi$-mapping theory. The topology classes are investigated through the canonical, mixed, and grand canonical ensembles. In particular, the magnetic charge is fixed for the canonical ensemble, whereas the magnetic potential is included for the mixed ensemble and the grand canonical ensemble with maintaining its consistency through the magnetic potential. The topological charges are analyzed for each ensemble through critical points. As a result, it is found that the canonical, mixed, and grand canonical ensembles lead to either $1$, $-1$, or no generation/annihilation points. Moreover, it is shown how temperature and heat capacity depend on the horizon radius in order to verify the stability of a black hole. Furthermore, the behavior of the thermodynamic curvatures of a black hole is investigated through the geometric methods.</description>

      <title>Generalized Second Law and Thermodynamical Aspects of $f(Q,\mathcal{T})$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Late-time cosmic acceleration has motivated the exploration of various extensions of general relativity, among which $f(Q,\mathcal{T})$ gravity, based on the non-metricity scalar $Q$ and the trace of the energy--momentum tensor $\mathcal{T}$, has gained increasing attention. In this study, we explore the thermodynamic aspects of $f(Q,\mathcal{T})$ gravity by establishing the first law and generalized second law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon of a flat FLRW universe. By applying the Gibbs relation, we determined the rate of change of the total entropy and assessed the conditions under which the generalized second law remains valid for various choices of $f(Q,\mathcal{T})$. Our analysis focuses on linear, power-law, quadratic trace, exponential, and cross-coupling models, inspired by frameworks such as $f(R,\mathcal{T})$, $f(T)$, and modifications motivated by string theory. Our analysis showed that linear and mildly nonlinear models are generally thermodynamically consistent, whereas strongly nonlinear or interaction-type models require fine-tuned parameters for the generalized second law to hold. The present analysis underscores that thermodynamic considerations serve as effective criteria for assessing the viability of modified gravity models and their relevance to cosmological dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the maximum compactness of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar compactness, that is, the dimensionless ratio between the mass and radius of a compact star, $\mathcal{C} := M/R$, plays a fundamental role in characterising the gravitational and nuclear-physics aspects of neutron stars. Yet, because the compactness depends sensitively on the unknown equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter, the simple question: ``how compact can a neutron star be?'' remains unanswered. To address this question, we adopt a statistical approach and consider a large number of parameterised EOSs that satisfy all known constraints from nuclear theory, perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and astrophysical observations. Next, we conjecture that, for any given EOS, the maximum compactness is attained by the star with the maximum mass of the sequence of nonrotating configurations. While we can prove this conjecture for a rather large class of solutions, its general proof is still lacking. However, the evidence from all of the EOSs considered strongly indicates that it is true in general. Exploiting the conjecture, we can concentrate on the compactness of the maximum-mass stars and show that an upper limit appears for the maximum compactness and is given by $\mathcal{C}_{\rm max} = 1/3$. Importantly, this upper limit is essentially independent of the stellar mass and a direct consequence of perturbative-QCD constraints.</description>

      <title>Bumblebee Gravity - Lessons from Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These proceedings summarize some recent efforts in understanding a class of vector-tensor theories known as {\it bumblebee} models, which spontaneously break local Lorentz and diffeomorphism invariance. Using cosmological perturbation theory on an exact dS background, we find that for non-minimal coupling to gravity, the theory contains a ghost mode unless a degeneracy condition is imposed, after which the model becomes a subset of generalized Proca theory. We go further to show that scalar perturbations become strongly coupled in the minimal-coupling limit, which shows the necessity of the non-minimal coupling. Moreover, we find a constraint on the bumblebee field from the speed of tensor modes on the order of $10^{-15}$.</description>

      <title>Entropic uncertainty and coherence in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate tripartite quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertain and quantum coherence for GHZ and W states of a fermionic field in the background of a spherically symmetric black hole of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity. Two distinct scenarios are analyzed: (i) the quantum memories (held by Bob and Charlie) are near the horizon while the measured particle (Alice) remains in the flat region, and (ii) the reverse configuration. Dimensional dependence is observed: in $d&gt;5$ dimensions, the measurement uncertainty decreases monotonically with increasing horizon radius, while coherence increases; in $d=5$, both quantities exhibit non-monotonic behavior due to distinctive thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, comparative analysis reveals that the W state exhibits higher robustness in preserving coherence, whereas the GHZ state shows greater resistance to measurement uncertainty increase induced by Hawking radiation. Notably, the two scenarios yield qualitatively distinct behaviors: quantum coherence is consistently lower in Scenario 1 (quantum memory near horizon) than in Scenario 2 (measured particle near horizon), irrespective of the quantum state. For measurement uncertainty, the W state displays lower uncertainty in Scenario 1, while the GHZ state exhibits the opposite trend, with higher measurement uncertainty in Scenario 1. These results indicate that the characteristics of different quantum resources provide important insights into the selection and optimization of quantum states for information processing in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Singularity avoidance in black hole interiors by quantum gravity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum nature of the Schwarzschild black hole interior is investigated through the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation. The interior of a static, spherically symmetric black hole is described by the Kantowski-Sachs (KS) metric, which represents a homogeneous but anisotropic cosmology. We derive the Hamiltonian for the gravitational system corresponding to the black hole interior and obtain the associated WDW equation. By varying the gravitational constant as a parameter controlling quantum effects, we examine how the solutions of the WDW equation change with respect to this parameter. In the parameter regime where quantum effects are negligible, we find that the wave packet solutions closely follow the classical trajectory of the black hole interior. On the other hand, as quantum effects are enhanced, the wave packet deviates from the classical trajectory and exhibits behavior suggestive of singularity avoidance. To quantify this behavior, we introduce an appropriate "clock" inside the black hole and compute the time to singularity formation with respect to this clock. The results show that stronger quantum effects lead to a longer formation time, suggesting a tendency toward the avoidance of singularity formation due to quantum gravity effects.</description>

      <title>Particle production in a bouncing universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In massless scalar field cosmology, imposing the universe's physical volume as fundamentally discrete resolves the big bang singularity via a big bounce. We use quantum field theory on curved background to numerically track the number of particles created in the vacuum of a quantum field that propagates through the cosmological bounce. We find that due to geometry's evolution, particle production in all modes initially rises, sharply peaks at the bounce, and varies slowly afterwards. Further, by comparing with the case of a quantum field propagating on an expanding universe, we discover that the bouncing universe's imprints on quantum matter are distinct: notably, the late time particle production across modes resembles a thermal spectrum. We then use semiclassical gravity and find similar qualitative results. Here, we also determine how particle production affects geometry's evolution. Our study adds to existing literature on gravity-matter interactions in the context of a bouncing universe, contributes to searches of a bouncing universe's signatures, and strengthens the link between gravity and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Probing thermodynamic phase transitions by dynamics of timelike particle around a magnetic AdS black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phase structure of a nonminimal coupled magnetic AdS black hole by connecting its thermodynamic properties with the dynamical behavior of orbiting particles, within the framework of Lyapunov exponent and quasi-periodic oscillation. The analysis of the free energy as a function of the Hawking temperature reveals a Van der Waals-like phase transition, characterized by the coexistence of small, intermediate, and large black hole phases. By examining timelike geodesics corresponding to unstable circular orbits, we evaluate the Lyapunov exponent of the test particles crossing the phase transition and explore its role as dynamical indicator of stability. Furthermore, by perturbing the unstable circular orbit and employing the relativistic precession model, we explore the associated upper and lower quasi-periodic oscillation frequencies. Our findings show that the occurrence of thermodynamic phase transitions induces marked changes in both Lyapunov exponent and quasi-periodic oscillation spectra, indicating that these dynamical quantities can serve as sensitive probes of the underlying thermodynamic phase structure of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Orbital dynamics and precession in magnetized Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the orbital structure and precession dynamics of neutral test particles in the magnetized Kerr black hole (MKBH) spacetime-an exact electrovacuum solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations that self-consistently incorporates the curvature effects of an external magnetic field. This geometry allows a unified treatment of gravitational and magnetic influences across weak to ultra-strong regimes. The analysis reveals a critical magnetic field strength above which no circular geodesics, timelike or null, can exist, establishing an upper magnetic bound for orbital motion. For subcritical fields, the photon circular orbit admits two real roots, the outer of which defines an outermost stable circular orbit (OSCO), complementing the conventional innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and confining stable motion within a finite radial domain. Exact expressions for the orbital, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies, and their associated precession rates, show substantial deviations from Kerr behavior, including a magnetically induced reversal of periastron precession within a finite radial range. For astrophysically relevant magnetic field strengths, the retrograde precession could be observable at large radii around astrophysical BHs, offering a potential diagnostic of large-scale magnetization. These findings highlight the geometric influence of magnetic curvature on strong-field dynamics, providing a self-consistent framework to interpret quasi-periodic oscillation phenomenology and potential magnetic imprints in precision timing observations of compact objects.</description>

      <title>Mass and spin coevolution of black holes inspiralling through dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In extreme/intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (E/IMRIs) embedded in dark-matter (DM) spikes, the secondary black hole can accrete collisionless particles from the surrounding halo. We study how the companion's spin controls this process, and the ensuing back-reaction on the magnitude and direction of the companion's spin vector. We find that higher spin suppresses the mass accretion rate but enhances the accretion-induced torques, driving spin-down and secular alignment of the companion's spin with the orbital plane. Collisionless DM accretion generically imprints a near-universal mass-spin correlation characterized by a spin-evolution parameter $s \simeq 2.8$, much larger than is the case for typical astrophysical environments, and largely independent of the local DM density and the spike slope. The associated spin-down proceeds on astrophysically relevant timescales, thus observations of rapidly spinning IMRI companions would disfavor the presence of dense DM environments, providing constraints complementary to those arising from dynamical friction.</description>

      <title>APRIL: Auxiliary Physically-Redundant Information in Loss - A physics-informed framework for parameter estimation with a gravitational-wave case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the system under study directly into the training of Neural Networks, ensuring solutions that respect physical laws. While effective for single-system problems, standard PINNs scale poorly to datasets containing many realizations of the same underlying physics with varying parameters. To address this limitation, we present a complementary approach by including auxiliary physically-redundant information in loss (APRIL), i.e. augment the standard supervised output-target loss with auxiliary terms which exploit exact physical redundancy relations among outputs. We mathematically demonstrate that these terms preserve the true physical minimum while reshaping the loss landscape, improving convergence toward physically consistent solutions. As a proof-of-concept, we benchmark APRIL on a fully-connected neural network for gravitational wave (GW) parameter estimation (PE). We use simulated, noise-free compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals, focusing on inspiral-frequency waveforms to recover the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$, the total mass $M_\mathrm{tot}$, and symmetric mass ratio $\eta$ of the binary. In this controlled setting, we show that APRIL achieves up to an order-of-magnitude improvement in test accuracy, especially for parameters that are otherwise difficult to learn. This method provides physically consistent learning for large multi-system datasets and is well suited for future GW analyses involving realistic noise and broader parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>Dirac Quasinormal Modes in Noncommutative Reissner-Nordstr\"om Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncommutative (NC) geometry provides a novel approach to probe quantum gravity effects in black hole spacetimes. This work explores Dirac quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a deformed Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, where noncommutativity induces an effective metric with an additional ($ r-\varphi$) component. Employing a semiclassical model equivalent to a NC gauge theory, we investigate the dynamics of massless Dirac fields and calculate their QNM frequencies using the continued fraction method, enhanced by Gauss elimination to address the six-term recurrence relations. Our results demonstrate notable shifts in oscillation frequencies and damping rates relative to the commutative Reissner-Nordstr\"om case, exhibiting a distinctive Zeeman-like splitting in the QNM spectrum driven by the NC parameter.</description>

      <title>Primordial magnetogenesis in loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) are magnetic fields generated during the early universe. These fields are thought to be the seeds of extragalactic magnetic fields. The origin of PMFs is not well known. Further, if they are indeed sources of extragalactic fields, then there is a possibility that observations of extragalactic magnetic fields could provide insights into the primordial physics. With this motivation, we study the generation of the primordial magnetic field in the context of loop quantum cosmology (LQC). In LQC, inflation is preceded by a quantum bounce. In this work, we consider an electromagnetic field coupled to the background as a test field and study its evolution through the bounce and through the subsequent inflationary phase. We investigate the power spectra generated in LQC and show that it is scale-dependent. We study the power spectra with different initial conditions, discuss equivalent forms of coupling functions, investigate backreaction, and compute the amount of primordial magnetic field which can be measured today. We conclude the article with a summary and discussion of the results.</description>

      <title>Revealing evolution of Dark Energy density from observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model--independent reconstruction of the normalized dark energy density function, $X(z) \equiv \rho_{\mathrm{de}}(z)/\rho_{\mathrm{de}}(0)$, derived directly from the DES-SN5YR Type~Ia supernova sample. The analysis employs an inversion formalism that relates the derivative of the distance modulus, $\mu^{\prime}(z)$, to the expansion history, allowing the data to determine the shape of $X(z)$ without assuming a specific equation--of--state or dark energy density parameterization.
  A statistically optimized binning of the supernova sample (using 17 intervals following the Freedman--Diaconis criterion and 34 following Scott's rule) ensures a stable estimation of $\mu^{\prime}(z)$ and a controlled propagation of uncertainties throughout the inversion process.
  The resulting $X(z)$ remains statistically consistent with a constant value within one standard deviation across the entire redshift range, showing no significant evidence for an evolving dark energy component at present. In a direct comparison among $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and the quadratic $X^2(z)$ parameterization -- where CPL and $X^2(z)$ each introduce two additional free parameters relative to $\Lambda$CDM -- the CPL model attains the best statistical agreement with the data, albeit only marginally and strictly within this restricted model set.
  These outcomes indicate that current observations are compatible with an almost constant dark energy density ($w \simeq -1$), while the inversion framework remains sensitive to subtle departures that forthcoming high--precision surveys could resolve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism where the dynamical generation of the Planck mass in scale invariant gravity leads to Einstein gravity, successful inflation and an explanation of the hierarchy problem of the Standard Model. We will discuss in detail the scale generation by dynamical symmetry breaking and phenomenological consequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review work in areas ranging from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity, with the following interconnected questions in mind: (i) what is the nature of the vacuum in condensed matter systems, in quantum field theory, and in classical and quantum gravity; (ii) how do analogies between these systems work, how well do they work, and how useful are they; (iii) what modifications can we make to quantum mechanics to deal with quantum gravity, and (iv) how and why low-energy theories of quantum gravity are, in our view, the right way to make progress in this field. We use many different examples to illustrate our arguments.</description>

      <title>When Tiny Halos Stir Spacetime: Gravitational Waves from Fifth-Force Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter fermions interacting via attractive fifth forces mediated by a light mediator can form dark matter halos in the very early universe. We show that bound systems composed of these halos are capable of generating gravitational wave (GW) signals detectable today, even when the individual halos are very light. The Yukawa force dominates the dynamics of these halo binaries, rather than gravity. As a result, large GW signals can be produced at initially extremely high frequencies, which are then redshifted to frequency bands accessible to current or future GW observatories. In addition, the resulting GW signals carry distinctive features that enable future observations to distinguish them from conventional ones. Notably, even if only a tiny fraction of dark matter experiences strong fifth-force interactions, such effects provide a new avenue to discover self-interacting dark matter through GW observations.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the adiabatic elimination of fast variables in relativistic stochastic mechanics, which is analyzed in the equation of motion and in the distribution function, with relativistic corrections explicitly derived. A new dimensionless parameter is introduced to characterize the timescale. The adiabatic elimination is also compared with the path integral coarse graining, which is more general yet computationally demanding.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Signatures of Highly Eccentric Stellar-Mass Binary Black Holes in Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant fraction of compact-object mergers in galactic nuclei are expected to be eccentric in the Laser-Interferometer-Space-Antenna (LISA) frequency sensitivity range, $10^{-4} - 10^{-1}\ \rm Hz$. Several compact binaries detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration may retain hints of residual eccentricity at $10$~Hz, suggesting dynamical or triple origins for a significant fraction of the gravitational-wave-observable population. In triple systems, von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations perturb both the eccentricity and the argument of pericentre, $\omega$, of the inner black hole binary. The latter could be fully \textit{circulating}, where $\omega$ cycles through $2\pi$, or may \textit{librate}, with $\omega$ ranges about a fixed value with small or large variation. We use \texttt{TSUNAMI}, a regularised N-body code with up to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) term corrections, to identify four different families of orbits: (i) circulating, (ii) small and (iii) large amplitude librating, and (iv) merging orbits. We develop and demonstrate a new method to construct gravitational waveforms using the quadrupole formula utilising the instantaneous {\it total} acceleration of each binary component in \texttt{TSUNAMI}. We show that the four orbital families have distinct waveform phenomenologies, enabling them to be distinguished if observed in LISA. The orbits are also distinguishable from an isolated binary or from a binary perturbed by a different tertiary orbit, even if the secular timescale is the same. Future burst timing models will be able to distinguish the different orbital configurations. For efficient binary formation, about $\sim 50$ binaries can have librating orbits in the Galactic Centre.</description>

Abstract: We study minimal massive gravity with cubic and quartic terms in Compere, Song, and Strominger (CSS) boundary conditions. By employing a semi-product of a Virasoro and a $U(1)$ Kac-Moody current algebra as the asymptotic symmetry algebra, we calculate the entropy of BTZ black holes via the degeneracy of states belonging to a Warped-CFT. Then, we compute the linearized energy excitations using the representations of the algebra $U(1)\times SL(2, R)_{R}$ and demonstrate that the energies of excitations are non-negative at two chiral points in the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Corrections to Thermodynamics of Accelerating Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As pointed out in recent research, the near extremal black hole entropy with one-loop effect exhibits universal $\log T$ behaviour at sufficiently low temperature. In this paper, we discuss the low temperature quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of four dimensional accelerating black holes with rotation and charges by using the method of Euclidean path integral. The one-loop path integral for the black hole thermal partition function near extremality is dominated by zero modes defined with respect to the extremal background. For the accelerating black holes without rotation, the near horizon extremal geometry is a direct product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ with warping factors, and the gravitational zero modes contain both tensor and vector types, with the respective contributions to the near extremal black hole entropy being $(3/2)\log T$ and $(1/2)\log T$. While in the presence of rotation, the near horizon extremal geometry is a twist product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ and the gravitational vector modes are absent. For the accelerating black holes with charges, we also consider the one-loop path integral of the gauge field, where the photon zero modes are found to contribute an additional $(1/2)\log T$ term to the near extremal black hole entropy.</description>

      <title>Four-charge static non-extremal black holes in the five-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$, $STU-W^2U$ supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct, for the first time, new static non-extremal five-dimensional black hole solutions (without or with squashed horizons) endowing with four different electric charge parameters in the $D = 5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity coupled to \emph{three} vector multiplets with a specific pre-potential $\mathcal{V} = STU -W^2U \equiv 1$. When the fourth charge parameter disappears, the solution simplify reduces to the three-charge static black hole solution previously presented in ref. [1], which belongs to the solution to the $D = 5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity coupled to \emph{two} vector multiplets (also notably known as the $STU$ model). We parameterize the model in such a simple fashion that not only can one easily recover the static three-charge solution but also it is very convenient to study their thermodynamical properties of the obtained black hole solutions in the case without a squashing horizon. We then show that the thermodynamical quantities perfectly obey both the differential first law and integral Smarr formula of thermodynamics. Finally, we also extend to present its generalizations with squashed horizons or including a nonzero cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Quantumness near the Schwarzschild black hole based on W-state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate certain quantumness in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild black hole by utilizing the W state. We explore the influence of the Hawking effect on the l_1-norm of quantum coherence, the first-order coherence (FOC), the concurrence-fill (CF) and the global concurrence (GC) in Schwarzschild black hole, for systems with one, two and three physically accessible modes. We conclude that the Hawking effect of the black hole not only disrupts but also enhance the quantum entanglement, while destroying the quantum coherence for systems with three physically accessible modes. For systems with one or two physically accessible modes, the Hawking effect exerts a positive influence on quantum coherence and quantum entanglement. Moreover, we study the influence of both the Hawking effect and environmental noise (AD channels) on l_1-norm of quantum coherence, FOC, CF and GC. It is demonstrated that for systems with three physically accessible modes, the Hawking effect of the black hole disrupts quantum coherence but exerts a positive influence on quantum entanglement under the AD channels.</description>

      <title>On the Imaginary Part of the Effective Action in de Sitter Spacetime with Different Regularization Schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The imaginary part of the effective action encodes vacuum instability and particle production in the background field. Two standard approaches are commonly used to derive it: the Bogoliubov method and the Green's function method, which are usually expected to agree. However, in de Sitter spacetime they yield different results. We revisit this problem by introducing explicit time and momentum cutoffs in the Green's function representation of the effective action. The apparent discrepancy is found to be due to the different limiting procedures in regularization, which reproduces the Bogoliubov result and the Green's function result respectively. Therefore, the two approaches are understood to be different regularization limits of the same expression, which clarifies the origin of their disagreement.</description>

Abstract: The black hole information paradox remains a profound challenge in theoretical physics. Among the proposed resolutions, the soft-hair approach stands out for its independence from any specific quantum gravity model. In this paper, we investigate how the inclusion of soft degrees of freedom in the unitary evolution of quantum electrodynamics, within a spacetime collapsing into a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, leads to information scrambling. By evaluating the tripartite mutual information of this unitary evolution, we estimate the degree of information scrambling in the corresponding quantum channel. Our results show that the presence of soft degrees of freedom induces scrambling of information initially encoded in hard degrees of freedom, driven by quantum electrodynamics interactions and the nontrivial transformations arising from the non-uniqueness of the vacuum in the collapsing spacetime. This lays the groundwork for a deeper understanding of the black hole information paradox, particularly the mechanisms behind information scrambling.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the singularity structure of FLRW spacetimes without particle horizons at the $C^0$-level of the metric. We show that in the case of constant spatial curvature $K=+1$, and without any further assumptions on the scale factor, the big bang singularity is sufficiently strong to exclude continuous spacetime extensions to the past. On the other hand it is known that in the case of constant spatial curvature $K=-1$ continuous spacetime extensions through the big-bang exist for certain choices of scale factor [4], giving rise to Milne-like cosmologies. Complementing these results we exhibit a geometric obstruction to continuous spacetime extensions which is present for a large range of scale factors in the case $K=-1$.</description>

      <title>Impact of correlated magnetic noise on directional stochastic gravitational-wave background searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One potential factor that could impede searches for the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), arising from the incoherent superposition of a multitude of weak and unresolvable gravitational-wave signals in the Universe, is correlated magnetic noise at Earth-scale distances, such as the Schumann resonances. As the sensitivity of terrestrial detectors to SGWBs increases, these effects are expected to become even more pronounced, emphasizing the importance of considering correlated noise sources in SGWB searches. In this study, we explore for the first time the impact of this class of noise on anisotropic SGWB searches. We focus on the low-frequency range of 20-200 Hz with a resolution of 1/32 Hz, using data from the LEMI-120 and Metronix MFS-06e magnetometers, located at the sites of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo interferometers, respectively, during the third observing run. These measurements were then compared with the directional upper limit derived from gravitational-wave data collected during the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. The results indicate that the magnetic noise correlations are below the interferometers' sensitivity level during the O3 observing run. The potential impact of magnetic correlations on the Advanced LIGO detectors has also been investigated at the A+ design sensitivity level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement of gravitational waves can provide precision tests of the nature of black holes and compact objects. In this work, we test Giddings' non-violent non-locality proposal, which posits that quantum information is transferred via a nonlocal interaction that generates metric perturbations around black holes. In contrast to firewalls, these quantum fluctuations would be spread out over a larger distance range -- up to a Schwarzschild radius away. In this letter, we model the modification to the gravitational waveform from non-violent non-locality. We modify the nonspinning EOBNRv2 effective one body waveform to include metric perturbations that are due to a random Gaussian process. We find that the waveform exhibits random deviations which are particularly important in the late inspiral-plunge phase. We find an optimal dephasing parameter for detecting this effect with a principal component analysis. This is particularly intriguing because it predicts random phase deviations across different gravitational wave events, providing theoretical support for hierarchical tests of general relativity. We estimate the constraint on the perturbations in non-violent non-locality with events for the LIGO-Virgo network and for a third-generation network.</description>

      <title>Rapid inference for individual binaries and a stochastic background with pulsar timing array data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of pulsar timing array data has provided evidence for a gravitational wave background in the nanohertz band. This raises the question of what is the source of the signal, is it astrophysical or cosmological in origin? If the signal originates from a population of supermassive black hole binaries, as is generally assumed, we can expect to see evidence for both anisotropy and to be able to resolve signals from individual binaries as more data are collected. The anisotropy and resolvable systems are caused by a small number of loud signals that stand out from the crowd. Here we focus on the joint detection of individual signals and a stochastic background. While methods have previously been developed to perform such an analysis, they are currently held back by the cost of computing the joint likelihood function. Each individual source is described by $N=8+2N_p$ parameters, where $N_p$ are the number of pulsars in the array. With the latest combined datasets having over one hundred pulsars, the parameter space is very large, and consequently, it takes a large number of likelihood evaluations to explore these models. Here we present a new approach that extends the Fourier basis method, previously introduced to accelerate analyses for stochastic signals, to also include deterministic signals. Key elements of the method are that the likelihood evaluations are per-pulsar, avoiding expensive operations on large matrices, and the templates for individual binaries can be computed analytically or using fast Fourier methods on a sparsely sampled grid of time samples. This analysis method scales better than quadratically with the size of the dataset, while the approach currently being used in most analyses scales quartically or worse with the number of data points. As datasets grow with more observations, this analysis will be orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Looking To The Horizon: Probing Evolution in the Black Hole Spectrum With Gravitational Wave Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The population of black holes observed via gravitational waves currently covers the local universe up to a redshift $z\lesssim 1$, for the most massive merging binaries, or $z\lesssim 0.25$ for low-mass BH binaries (BBH). Evolution of the BBH mass spectrum over cosmic time will be a significant probe of formation channels and environments. We demonstrate a reconstruction of the BBH merger rate, allowing for general dependence on binary masses and luminosity distance or redshift and accounting for selection effects, via iterative kernel density estimation (KDE) with optimized multidimensional bandwidths. Performing such reconstructions under a range of detailed assumptions, we see no significant evidence for the evolution of BBH masses with redshift, over the range where detected events are available. At most, possible trends towards increasing merger rate with redshift for primary masses $m_1\gtrsim 50\,M_\odot$, or towards decreasing merger rate with redshift for primary masses $m_1 \lesssim 40 M\odot$ may be supported. We compare these findings with previous investigations and caution against over-interpreting the current, sparse, data. Significantly upgraded detectors and/or facilities, and longer observing times, are required to harness any correlations of the BBH mass distribution with redshift.</description>

Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of black holes, taking into account the non-extensive character of their entropy at the thermodynamic and statistical level. To this end, we assume that the R\'enyi entropy determines the fundamental thermodynamic equation of black holes and is represented by a quasi-homogeneous function. As a consequence, the R\'enyi parameter turns out to be an independent thermodynamic variable, which must be treated in the framework of extended thermodynamics. As a particular example, we use the formalism of geometrothermodynamics to show that the Schwarzschild black hole can become stable for certain values of the R\'enyi parameter.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory of Perturbations on Arbitrary Black Hole Backgrounds with Spacelike Scalar Profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the effective field theory (EFT) of perturbations in the context of scalar-tensor theories with a spacelike scalar profile on arbitrary black hole backgrounds. Our construction of the EFT is based on the fact that in the unitary gauge, where the scalar field is chosen as one of the spatial coordinates, the background scalar field spontaneously breaks the diffeomorphism invariance along the direction of its gradient. The residual symmetry on a timelike hypersurface of constant scalar field is referred to as the $(2+1)$d diffeomorphism invariance. We then derive a set of consistency relations, imposed on the EFT parameters, by requiring that the EFT action in the unitary gauge be invariant under the $(2+1)$d diffeomorphisms. For concreteness, we apply the EFT to study the background dynamics of a class of non-static and spherically symmetric solutions, focusing in particular on a black hole solution with a time-varying mass. We emphasize that our EFT framework is broadly applicable to any black hole background as long as the scalar field remains spacelike throughout the spacetime region of interest. This formulation provides a model-independent approach for testing scalar-tensor theories as gravity beyond general relativity in the strong-gravity regime.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime in regular coordinates with cosmological time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the Einstein equations in Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime and imposing Friedmann-Robertson-Walker coordinates at large distances, we find two coordinate systems with time-dependent metrics that are smooth across both the black hole and cosmological horizons. These coordinates require a positive cosmological constant for regularity, and thus they are not de Sitter extensions of the Kruskal-Szekeres or Israel coordinates. One of the coordinate systems was only found in 1999 (Abbassi coordinates), and it has led to conflicting interpretations in the literature, while the other was briefly commented on and promptly dismissed as unphysical or incompatible with SdS. We derive that the second solution is equivalent to the first one, and that both are indeed equivalent descriptions of SdS spacetime. We also derive explicit coordinate transformations linking these coordinate systems to the Kottler coordinates and the maximally extended Lake-Israel coordinates. Among other applications, these results, which extend the largely used cosmological and local coordinates, should be useful for further developments in understanding the exact interplay between black holes and the cosmological background, which has been the focus of a number of recent works.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and particle production from cosmological perturbations: a quantum optical simulation approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a computational framework based on the Gaussian formalism and symplectic circuit representation to explore cosmological perturbations during inflation. These tools offer an efficient means to study entanglement generation and particle production, particularly when analytical methods become insufficient and numerical simulations are essential. By evolving an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum through a two-mode squeezer, we simulate the behavior of the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity across a wide range of cosmological backgrounds, each characterized by a distinct equation of state. The von Neumann entropy obtained via QuGIT simulations is compared with analytic R\'enyi entropy bounds, thereby validating the accuracy of our circuit implementation of the cosmological squeezing Hamiltonian in both accelerating and decelerating scenarios. We further investigate the role of thermal noise and demonstrate how the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity are affected by its presence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08006v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The event horizon is a source of irreversibility, analogous to statistical irreversibility. This is why for systems with an event horizon there is no difference between quantum and thermal fluctuations. Quantum processes of quantum tunneling determine the thermodynamics of these systems, their temperatures, entropies and fluctuations. We considered three examples of entropy variance that support this point of view: (i) the variance of the area of the black hole horizon, obtained by consideration of quantum fluctuations; (ii) the variance of the entropy of the Hubble volume in the de Sitter state, obtained by consideration of thermal fluctuations; and (iii) the variance of entropy in integers in the Planckon model, determined by the Poisson distribution.</description>

      <title>Is the $\Lambda$CDM Model in Crisis?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present strong evidence for dynamical dark energy challenging the $\Lambda$CDM model. Several dark energy models are explored, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, and BA, along with non-flat cosmologies accounting for potential spatial curvature. Our analysis supports a flat Universe ($\Omega_k \approx 0$). Using the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm, we analyze data from BAO of DESI DR2, Type Ia Supernovae, and CMB to constrain model parameters. We find strong evidence that $\omega \neq -1$, with deviations from $\Lambda$CDM favoring dynamical dark energy consistent with the Quintom-B scenario ($\omega_0 &gt; -1$, $\omega_a &lt; 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a &lt; -1$). We also derive upper bounds on $\sum m_\nu$ from CMB + DESI DR2. For $\Lambda$CDM we find $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.066~\text{eV}$, while for $\omega$CDM it is $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.075~\text{eV}$. In o$\Lambda$CDM and o$\omega$CDM the limits are $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.263~\text{eV}$ and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.520~\text{eV}$, respectively. For other models, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, Logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE, the upper limits range from $&lt; 0.043~\text{eV}$ to $&lt; 0.127~\text{eV}$. Constraints on the effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\text{eff}}$, remain consistent with the standard value $N_{\text{eff}} = 3.044$ for all models. Bayesian evidence shows that combining DES-SN5Y and Union3 SNe Ia with CMB + DESI DR2 reveals deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, while no model reaches the $5\sigma$ threshold, some show $&gt; 3\sigma$ tensions with DES-SN5YR or Union3, hinting at cracks in the cosmological constant $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Observational features of the Bardeen-boson star with thin disk accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we construct spherically symmetric solutions of Bardeen--boson stars within the framework of the Einstein--Klein--Gordon theory coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics by employing numerical methods. Considering a thin accretion disk in the equatorial plane as the light source, we systematically investigate the optical appearance of boson stars using the ray-tracing method and the stereographic projection technique. Particular attention is paid to the influence of the initial scalar field $\phi_0$, the magnetic charge $\mathcal{G}$, and the observation angle $\theta_o$, on the image structure. As compact horizonless objects, boson stars produce optical images dominated by direct emission, while their morphology undergoes significant distortions as $\theta_o$ increases. Higher values of $\phi_0$ and $\theta_o$ can give rise to lensing images. For all the parameters, the image center exhibits a brightness depression similar to the inner shadow of black holes, which poses challenges for distinguishing between boson stars and black holes. To address this, we propose two possible approaches: (i) combining the analysis of lensing bands with the effective potential to determine the existence of photon rings; and (ii) examining the polarization effects under synchrotron emission mechanisms. These results provide theoretical support for future high-resolution imaging efforts aimed at discriminating boson stars from black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate electromagnetic and Dirac field axial-perturbations of a charged regular black hole arising from quantum gravity effects, commonly referred to as the Frolov black hole, a regular (nonsingular) black hole solution. We derive the master wave equations for massless electromagnetic and Dirac perturbations and solve them using the standard Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method along with Pad\'e approximation. From these solutions, we extract the dominant and overtone quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies along with the associated grey-body factors, highlighting the deviations introduced by quantum gravity corrections compared to the classical case of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. Furthermore, we analyze the Unruh-Verlinde temperature of this spacetime, providing quantitative estimates of how quantum gravity effects influence both quasinormal ringing and particle emission in nonsingular black hole models.</description>

      <title>Inferring the spins of merging black holes in the presence of data-quality issues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from black hole binary mergers carry information about the component spins, but inference is sensitive to analysis assumptions, which may be broken by terrestrial noise transients known as glitches. Using a variety of simulated glitches and gravitational wave signals, we study the conditions under which glitches can bias spin measurements. We confirm the theoretical expectation that inference and subtraction of glitches invariably leaves behind residual power due to statistical uncertainty, no matter the strength (signal-to-noise ratio; SNR) of the original glitch. Next we show that low-SNR glitches - including those below the threshold for flagging data-quality issues - can still significantly bias spin inference. Such biases occur for a range of glitch morphologies, even in cases where glitches and signals are not precisely aligned in phase. Furthermore, we find that residuals of glitch subtraction can result in biases as well. Our results suggest that joint inference of the glitch and gravitational wave parameters, with appropriate models and priors, is required to address these uncertainties inherent in glitch mitigation via subtraction.</description>

      <title>Particles with precessing spin in Kerr spacetime: analytic solutions for eccentric orbits and homoclinic motion near the equatorial plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a family of analytic solutions for the nearly-equatorial motion of a test particle with precessing spin in Kerr spacetime. We solve the equations of motion up to linear order in the small body's spin for periodic and homoclinic orbits. At zero order, the particle moves along equatorial geodesics. The spin-curvature force introduces post-geodesic corrections which, for generic spin orientations, cause the precession of the orbital plane. We derive the solutions for eccentric orbits in terms of Legendre elliptic integrals and Jacobi elliptic functions for generic referential geodesics (known as ``spin gauges"). Our analytical solutions perfectly match the numerical trajectories obtained by Drummond and Hughes in Phys. Rev. D 105, 124041 (2022), and Piovano et al. in Phys. Rev. D 111, 044009 (2025). Furthermore, we present, for the first time, the solutions for homoclinic orbits for a spinning particle in Kerr spacetime, and the spin-corrections to the location of the separatrix. The homoclinic trajectories are described in closed form using elementary functions. Finally, we introduce a novel parametrization for the motion of a spinning particle, called ``fixed eccentricity spin gauge". This is the only spin gauge in which the corrections to periodic orbits are finite at the geodesic separatrix, and continuously reduce to the last stable orbits under appropriate limits. Our results will be useful for modeling the inspiral and transition-to-plunge phases of asymmetric mass binaries within the two-time-scale framework.</description>

      <title>False Alarm Rates in Detecting Gravitational Wave Lensing from Astrophysical Coincidences: Insights with Model-Independent Technique GLANCE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strong lensing gravitational waves (GWs) due to intervening massive astrophysical systems between the source and an observer are an inevitable consequence of the general theory of relativity, which can produce multiple GW events in overlapping sky localization error. However, the confirmed detection of such a unique astrophysical phenomenon is challenging due to several sources of contamination, arising from detector noise to astrophysical uncertainties. Robust model-independent search techniques that can mitigate noise contamination were developed in the past. In this study, we explore the astrophysical uncertainty associated with incorrectly classifying a pair of unlensed GW events as a lensed event, and the associated False Alarm Rate (FAR) depending on the GW source properties. To understand the effect of unlensed astrophysical GW sources in producing false lensing detections, we have performed a model-independent test using the pipeline GLANCE on a simulated population of merging binary-black holes (BBHs). We find that $\sim$ 0.01\% of the event pairs can be falsely classified as lensed with a lensing threshold signal-to-noise ratio of 1.5, appearing at a time delay between the event pairs of $\sim$ 1000 days or more. We show the FAR distribution for the parameter space of GW source masses, delay time, and lensing magnification parameter over which the model-independent technique GLANCE can confidently detect lensed GW pair with the current LIGO detector sensitivity. In the future, this technique will be useful for understanding the FAR of the upcoming next-generation GW detectors, which can observe many more GW sources.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of causally-null-compactifiable space-times which can be canonically converted into a compact timed-metric-spaces using the cosmological time of Andersson-Howard-Galloway and the null distance of Sormani-Vega. We produce a large class of such space-times including future developments of compact initial data sets and regions which exhaust asymptotically flat space-times. We then present various notions of intrinsic distances between these space-times (introducing the timed-Hausdorff distance) and prove some of these notions of distance are definite in the sense that they equal zero iff there is a time-oriented Lorentzian isometry between the space-times. These definite distances enable us to define various notions of convergence of space-times to limit space-times which are not necessarily smooth. Many open questions and conjectures are included throughout.</description>

      <title>Spin oscillations of neutrinos scattered by the supermassive black hole in the galactic center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the propagation and spin oscillations of neutrinos in their scattering by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) surrounded by a realistic accretion disk. We review various descriptions of the fermion spin evolution in a curved spacetime under the influence of external fields. The overview of the test particle motion in the gravitational field of a rotating SMBH is also present. The external fields which a neutrino spin interacts with are the electroweak forces in plasma and the toroidal magnetic field in the accretion disk surrounding SMBH. Spin precession of neutrinos, which are supposed to be Dirac particles, is caused by the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with the magnetic field in the disk. We use a semi-analytical model of a thick accretion disk and review its characteristics. The cases of co-rotating and counter-rotating disks with respect to BH are discussed. We consider the incoming flux of neutrinos having an arbitrary angle with respect to the BH spin since the recent results of the Event Horizon Telescope indicate that the BH spin in the galactic center is not always perpendicular to the galactic plane. For our study, we consider a large number of incoming test neutrinos. We briefly discuss our results and their applications in the observations of astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Leading soft theorems on plane wave backgrounds</title>

Abstract: The infrared singularities of scattering amplitudes have historically contributed to much development in understanding fundamental structures in physics. However, the fate of the leading soft singularities of amplitudes in non-trivial background fields has remained largely unknown. In this paper, we derive the leading soft theorems for photons, gluons and gravitons on generic plane wave backgrounds in gauge theory and gravity. The results differ from the flat space results through dependence on the initial conditions of the soft mediator. We also consider the special case of self-dual plane wave backgrounds, and match onto the flat space results when the background is treated perturbatively.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of dark energy and late-time cosmic expansion using the Weighted Function Regression method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent data from multiple supernova catalogs and DESI, when combined with CMB, suggest a non-trivial evolution of dark energy (DE) at the $2.5-4\sigma$ CL. This evidence is typically quantified using the CPL parametrization of the DE equation-of-state parameter which corresponds to a first-order Taylor expansion around $a = 1$. However, this truncation is to some extent arbitrary and may bias our interpretation of the data, potentially leading us to mistake spurious features of the best-fit CPL model for genuine physical properties of DE. In this work, we apply the Weighted Function Regression (WFR) method to eliminate the subjectivity associated with the choice of truncation order. We assign Bayesian weights to the various orders and compute weighted posterior distributions of the quantities of interest. Using this model-agnostic approach, we reconstruct some of the most relevant background quantities, examining the robustness of our results against variations in the CMB and SNIa likelihoods. Furthermore, we extend our analysis by allowing for negative DE. Our results corroborate previous indications of dynamical DE, now confirmed for the first time using the WFR method. The combined analysis of CMB, BAO, and SNIa data favors a DE component that transitions from phantom to quintessence at redshift $z_{\rm cross}\sim 0.4$. The probability of phantom crossing lies between 96.21% and 99.97%, depending on the SNIa data set used, and hence a simple monotonic evolution of the DE density is excluded at the $\sim 2-4\sigma$ CL. Moreover, we find no significant evidence for a negative dark energy density below $z\sim 2.5-3$. Our reconstructions do not address the Hubble tension, yielding values of $H_0$ consistent with the Planck/$\Lambda$CDM range. If SH0ES measurements are not affected by systematic biases, the evidence for dynamical dark energy may need to be reassessed. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy from LRG1-2 and Low-$z$ SNe Ia Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10514v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present observational evidences indicating that dark energy may be evolving with time, thereby challenging the core assumptions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our investigation extends beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by exploring a range of dynamical dark energy models. Our analysis reveals that the predicted value of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ by the DESI DR2 LRG1 and LRG3+ELG1 datapoints deviates from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction and from different supernova compilations. We find that analyzing the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers strongly affects the model predictions especially $\omega_0$, which shifts from $-1$ to slightly higher values. This suggests that the evidence of evolving dark energy in the DESI DR2 data is driven by the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers. When we exclude low-redshift supernovae data, particularly from the DES-SN5YR compilation, the model predictions are restored to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. This effect is particularly evident in the GEDE model, where removing low-redshift supernovae data leads to $\Delta = 0$, effectively recovering $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy is substantial, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$). The reconstruction of $\omega(z)$ and $f_{DE}(z)$, using a combination of DESI DR2 BAO measurements, CMB distance priors, and supernovae datasets, further supports the evolving nature dark energy. These results favor a dynamical dark-energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0&gt;-1$, $\omega_a&lt;0$, and $\omega_0+\omega_a&lt;-1$ (Quintom-B). Bayesian analysis of model evidence reveals that the inclusion of low-redshift supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-redshift data are excluded.</description>

      <title>Extra-natural production of superheavy Kaluza-Klein particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge fields in extra compact dimensions can drive inflation in the four-dimensional (4D) non-compact spacetime, a scenario known as extra-natural inflation. A time-dependent gauge field configuration generates the electric field along the compact dimension, enabling the production of Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles charged under the field via the Schwinger effect. We construct the extra-natural inflation model within a five-dimensional (5D) quantum electrodynamics (QED) framework coupled to gravity including matter fields that generate the inflationary one-loop effective potential. In general, multiple charged fields can exist, and we show that KK particle production occurs under these conditions. Since KK momentum is conserved, the produced KK particles may become superheavy dark matter or dominate the universe, depending on the model parameters. Furthermore, we show that even when the gauge field acts not as the inflaton but as a spectator field, its post-inflationary oscillations, initiated when the Hubble friction becomes negligible, can also generate superheavy KK modes. This suggests that KK particle production is a generic outcome when gauge potentials along compact dimensions are light.</description>

      <title>Limits of Symmetry in Schwarzschild: CKVs and BRST Triviality in the Kerr-Schild Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25801v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We complete our investigation into the residual symmetries of the Kerr-Schild double copy for the Schwarzschild solution. In the first paper in this series, we showed that the infinite-dimensional residual gauge algebra collapses to the finite-dimensional global isometries when restricted to Killing vectors. Here, we extend the analysis to proper conformal Killing vectors (CKVs), solving the field equations via the method of characteristics to obtain explicit conformal solutions. While asymptotic flatness and horizon regularity remove divergent contributions, the surviving components form a non-trivial infinite-dimensional algebra, revealing a structural mismatch with the canonical Schwarzschild solution. We resolve this by constructing a unified, Weyl-compensated BRST complex, showing that the infinite-dimensional modes are BRST-exact and do not correspond to physical degrees of freedom. This demonstrates the quantum consistency of the Kerr-Schild double copy, confirming that the physical spectrum is restricted to global isometries.</description>
