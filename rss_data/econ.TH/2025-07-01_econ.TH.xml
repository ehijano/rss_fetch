      <title>Endogenous Network Structures with Precision and Dimension Choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a social learning model where the network structure is endogenously determined by signal precision and dimension choices. Agents not only choose the precision of their signals and what dimension of the state to learn about, but these decisions directly determine the underlying network structure on which social learning occurs. We show that under a fixed network structure, the optimal precision choice is sublinear in the agent's stationary influence in the network, and this individually optimal choice is worse than the socially optimal choice by a factor of $n^{1/3}$. Under a dynamic network structure, we specify the network by defining a kernel distance between agents, which then determines how much weight agents place on one another. Agents choose dimensions to learn about such that their choice minimizes the squared sum of influences of all agents: a network with equally distributed influence across agents is ideal.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguring Digital Accountability: AI-Powered Innovations and Transnational Governance in a Postnational Accounting Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores how AI-powered digital innovations are reshaping organisational accountability in a transnational governance context. As AI systems increasingly mediate decision-making in domains such as auditing and financial reporting, traditional mechanisms of accountability, based on control, transparency, and auditability, are being destabilised. We integrate the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Actor-Network Theory (ANT), and institutional theory to examine how organisations adopt AI technologies in response to regulatory, ethical, and cultural pressures that transcend national boundaries. We argue that accountability is co-constructed within global socio-technical networks, shaped not only by user perceptions but also by governance logics and normative expectations. Extending TAM, we incorporate compliance and legitimacy as key factors in perceived usefulness and usability. Drawing on ANT, we reconceptualise accountability as a relational and emergent property of networked assemblages. We propose two organisational strategies including internal governance reconfiguration and external actor-network engagement to foster responsible, legitimate, and globally accepted AI adoption in the accounting domain.</description>

      <title>Dynamic SINR-Guided Iterative Interference Cancellation for ODDM Systems in Doubly Dispersive Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation has recently gained significant attention as a promising candidate to promote the communication reliability in high-mobility environments. Low complexity signal detection is one of the most significant challenges for ODDM over general physical channels, due to the large channel spreading caused by the fractional delay and Doppler shifts. In this paper, we investigate the low-complexity data detection for ODDM system by utilizing iterative interference cancellation. Based on the theoretical analysis of signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) during the iteration, a dynamic SINR-guided approach is proposed to provide a better initialization result. Specifically, we analyze the SINR of each time domain sample before initial estimate with consideration of off-grid delay and Doppler shifts. The iteration is then started from the multi-carrier symbol index which has the best SINR. The corresponding interference is then eliminated for other time domain samples while the SINR for symbol awaiting detection is also updated. Based on the updated SINR, the next multi-carrier symbol index is selected for the same processing until all data symbols have been initialized. Finally, we update the SINR synchronously until the end of the initialization. Simulation experiments indicate that our proposed algorithms demonstrate satisfying convergence and error performance while avoiding the huge complexity introduced by full linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) initialization.</description>

      <title>Local Strategy-Proofness and Dictatorship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate preference domains where every unanimous and locally strategy-proof social choice function (scf) satisfies dictatorship. We identify a condition on domains called connected with two distinct neighbours which is necessary for unanimous and locally strategy-proof scfs to satisfy dictatorship. Further, we show that this condition is sufficient within the class of domains where every unanimous and locally strategy-proof scf satisfies tops-onlyness. While a complete characterization remains open, we make significant progress by showing that on connected with two distinct neighbours domains, unanimity and strategy-proofness (a stronger requirement) guarantee dictatorship.</description>

      <title>Reducing Profile-Based Matching to the Maximum Weight Matching Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The profile-based matching problem is the problem of finding a matching that optimizes profile from an instance $(G, r, \langle u_1, \dots, u_r \rangle)$, where $G$ is a bipartite graph $(A \cup B, E)$, $r$ is the number of utility functions, and $u_i: E \to \{ 0, 1, \dots, U_i \}$ is utility functions for $1 \le i \le r$. A matching is optimal if the matching maximizes the sum of the 1st utility, subject to this, maximizes the sum of the 2nd utility, and so on. The profile-based matching can express rank-maximal matching \cite{irving2006rank}, fair matching \cite{huang2016fair}, and weight-maximal matching \cite{huang2012weight}. These problems can be reduced to maximum weight matching problems, but the reduction is known to be inefficient due to the huge weights.
  This paper presents the condition for a weight function to find an optimal matching by reducing profile-based matching to the maximum weight matching problem. It is shown that a weight function which represents utilities as a mixed-radix numeric system with base-$(2U_i+1)$ can be used, so the complexity of the problem is $O(m\sqrt{n}(\log{n} + \sum_{i=1}^{r}\log{U_i}))$ for $n = |V|$, $m = |E|$. In addition, it is demonstrated that the weight lower bound for rank-maximal/fair/weight-maximal matching, better computational complexity for fair/weight-maximal matching, and an algorithm to verify a maximum weight matching can be reduced to rank-maximal matching. Finally, the effectiveness of the profile-based algorithm is evaluated with real data for school choice lottery.</description>

      <title>Risk Sharing Among Many: Implementing a Subgame Perfect and Optimal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can a welfare-maximising risk-sharing rule be implemented in a large, decentralised community? We revisit the price and choice (P\&amp;C) mechanism of Echenique and N\'u\~nez (2025), in which players post price schedules sequentially, and the final player selects an allocation. While P\&amp;C implements every Pareto-optimal allocation when the choice set is finite, realistic risk-sharing problems involve an infinite continuum of feasible allocations. We extend P\&amp;C to such infinite menus, modelling each allocation as a probability distribution that redistributes an aggregate loss $X=\sum_i X_i$. Every feasible allocation is comonotone, yet comonotonicity alone is not efficient when agents maximise monetary utility. We prove that our extended mechanism still implements the allocation that maximises aggregate utility, even when players entertain heterogeneous, uniformly tight credal sets over the distribution of $X$. Finally, we pair $P\&amp;C$ with a simple auction introduced by Echenique and N\'u\~nez (2025) that chooses the first mover, equalising surplus among participants. The result is a decentralised, enforcement-free procedure that achieves both optimal and fair risk sharing under distributional uncertainty.</description>
