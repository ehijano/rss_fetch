      <title>Detecting and characterising the magnetic field of exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields play a crucial role in planetary evolution and habitability. While the intrinsic magnetic fields of solar system planets are relatively well understood, the magnetic properties of exoplanets remain largely unconstrained, despite their potential ubiquity. Detecting exoplanetary magnetic fields is essential to advancing our understanding of planetary habitability beyond the solar system. This paper focuses on two promising spectropolarimetric techniques for detecting magnetic fields in hot exoplanets: direct detection through polarization signatures in the He I 1083 nm triplet and indirect detection via star-planet magnetic interactions manifesting as stellar hot spots. The direct method is particularly suited to close-in gas giants, leveraging the Hanle and Zeeman effects to detect low-amplitude magnetic fields. The indirect method can apply to both giant and low-mass planets by identifying magnetic connectivity-induced features in the stellar atmosphere. Although the interpretation of current detections remain tentative, upcoming high-resolution spectropolarimetric capabilities in the UV and near-infrared, particularly with future missions like HWO, promise to enable definitive measurements of exoplanetary magnetic fields. These advancements will open new avenues for probing the magnetic environments of exoplanets and their implications for atmospheric retention and habitability.</description>

      <title>Natural experiments from Earth Hour reveal urban night sky being drastically lit up by few decorative buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light pollution, a typically underrecognized environmental issue, has gained attention in recent years. While controlling light pollution requires sustained efforts, Earth Hour offers a unique natural experimental setting to assess temporary lights-out measures. Using photometric and spectroscopic sensors, we observed up to 50% night sky darkening during Earth Hour from 2011 to 2024 in Hong Kong, primarily as a result of a small but critical number of lights-out instances in central business districts, as evidenced by crowd-sourced photography records. Weekend lighting pattern in the city during Earth Hour remained unaffected. The emission reductions mostly occurred in the 445-500, 500-540, and 615-650 nm spectral ranges-corresponding to peak emissions from LED billboard screens- and in the 585-595 nm range, associated with metal halide floodlights used for facades and billboards. Our study identifies these sources as major contributors to urban light pollution. By combining multimodal observations, we offer a comprehensive assessment of light pollution sources and the potential benefits of sustainable lighting practices in urban environments. This research highlights the importance of targeted light pollution mitigation efforts and provides critical insights for policymakers to enhance urban sustainability and human well-being.</description>

      <title>Image Marker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of scientific imaging datasets benefit from human inspection for purposes ranging from prosaic-such as fault identification and quality inspection-to profound, enabling the discovery of new phenomena. As such, these datasets come in a wide variety of forms, with diverse inspection needs. In this paper we present a software package, Image Marker, designed to help facilitate human categorization of images. The software allows for quick seeking through images and enables flexible marking and logging of up to 9 different classes of features and their locations in files of FITS, TIFF, PNG, and JPEG format. Additional tools are provided to add text-based comments to the marking logs and for displaying external mark datasets on images during the classification process. As our primary use case will be the identification of features in astronomical survey data, Image Marker will also utilize standard world coordinate system (WCS) headers embedded in FITS headers and TIFF metadata when available. The lightweight software, based on the Qt Framework to build the GUI application, enables efficient marking of thousands of images on personal-scale computers. We provide Image Marker as a Python package, and as Mac and Windows 11 executables. It is available on GitHub or via pip installation.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Ionizing Photon Luminosity Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting the number and brightness of ionizing radiation sources out to a redshift of z ~ 1.2 will revolutionize our understanding of how the ionizing background is created and sustained by the embedded growth of meta-galactic structures. The shear number of sparsely separated targets required to efficiently construct redshift binned luminosity functions is industrial in scale, driving the need for low spectral resolution multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) with a short wavelength cut-off ~ 1000 {\AA}, a sensitivity in the far-UV to better than 30 abmag, and an instantaneous field-of-view ~ (2')$^2$. A MOS on Habitable Worlds Observatory is the only instrument that could conceivably carry out such an ambitious observing program.</description>

      <title>exoatlas: friendly Python code for exoplanet populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets are complicated. Understanding how they work requires connecting individual objects to the context of broader populations. Exoplanets are easier to picture next to their closest Solar System archetypes, and planets in the Solar System are richer when seen alongside a growing community of known exoplanets in the Milky Way. The `exoatlas` toolkit provides a friendly Python interface for retrieving and working with populations of planets, aiming to simplify the process of placing worlds in context.</description>

      <title>A Kalman-smoother based data imputation strategy to data gaps in spaceborne gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) and other sources within the frequency band of spaceborne gravitational wave observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), Taiji and Tianqin pose unique challenges, as gaps and glitches during the years-long observation lead to both loss of information and spectral leakage. We propose a novel data imputation strategy based on Kalman filter and smoother to mitigate gap-induced biases in parameter estimation. Applied to a scenario where traditional windowing and smoothing technique introduce significant biases, our method mitigates the biases and demonstrates lower computational cost compared to existing data augmentation techniques such as noise inpainting. This framework presents a new gap treatment approach that balances robustness and efficiency for space-based gravitational wave data analysis.</description>

      <title>Fluid dynamics of a liquid mirror space telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large aperture telescopes are pivotal for exploring the universe, yet even with state-of-the-art manufacturing and launch technology, their size is limited to several meters. As we aim to build larger telescopes - extending tens of meters - designs in which the main mirror is based on liquid deployment in space are emerging as promising candidates. However, alongside their enormous potential advantages, liquid-based surfaces present new challenges in material science, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. One of the fundamental questions is whether it is possible for such surfaces to maintain their precise optical shape over long durations, and in particular under the forces induced by the telescope's accelerations. In this paper, we present a model and a closed-form analytical solution for the non-self-adjoint problem of the dynamics of a thin liquid film pinned within a finite circular domain. We use the 50-meter Fluidic Telescope (FLUTE) concept as the case study, and examine the liquid dynamics of the telescope under both slewing actuation and relaxation regimes, elucidating the role of geometrical parameters and liquid properties. The solutions reveal a maneuvering 'budget' wherein the degradation of the mirror surface is directly linked to the choice of maneuvers and their sequence. By simulating ten years of typical operation, we show that, while the maximal deformation might reach several microns, the spatial distribution of the deformation and their propagation rate allows the telescope to maintain its optical functionality for years, with at least a substantial portion of the aperture remaining suitable for astronomical observations. The model provides valuable insights and guidelines into the performance of liquid-film space telescopes, marking a crucial step toward realizing the potential of this innovative concept.</description>

      <title>Uniform Reanalysis of JWST MIRI 15{\mu}m Exoplanet Eclipse Observations using Frame-Normalized Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST MIRI 15 micron time-series eclipse photometry presents a powerful way to probe for the presence of atmospheres on low-temperature rocky exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. Here, we introduce a novel technique, frame-normalized principal component analysis (FN-PCA) to analyze and detrend these MIRI time-series observations. Using the FN-PCA technique, we perform a uniform reanalysis of the published MIRI 15 micron observations of LHS 1478 b, TOI-1468 b, LHS 1140 c, TRAPPIST-1 b, and TRAPPIST-1 c using our new data reduction pipeline (Erebus) and compare them to different potential atmospheric and surface compositions. We also investigate additional public data sets with the sole purpose of understanding the instrument systematics affecting MIRI. We identify and categorize important detector-level systematics in the observations that are generally present across all 17 analyzed eclipse observations, which we illustrate as eigenimage/eigenvalue pairs in the FN-PCA. One of these eigenimage/eigenvalue pairs corresponds to the prominent ramp effect at the beginning of the time-series observations which has widely been reported for JWST and Spitzer photometry. For JWST/MIRI, we show that the detector settling time scales exponentially with the apparent magnitude of the target star $T_\mathrm{set} \mathrm{[hours]} = 0.063\exp^{0.427\cdot m_K} -0.657$. This uniform reanalysis and investigation of JWST/MIRI systematics is done in preparation for the 500 hour Rocky Worlds DDT survey, to demonstrate a data-driven systematic model usable across all MIRI 15 micron datasets.</description>

      <title>Envisioning the Distance Ladder in the Era of the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current state-of-the-art cosmic distance ladder requires three rungs--geometric distances, primary indicators, and Type Ia Supernovae--to achieve a 1% measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$. The Habitable Worlds Observatory will have the sensitivity and resolution to reduce this to a two-step measurement, eliminating the third rung entirely and reaching into the Hubble flow with stellar distance indicators such as Cepheid variables and the tip of the red giant branch alone. We discuss the requirements for a program to measure $H_0$ to 1% with HWO here, including telescope and instrument design considerations. We also comment on the potential of HWO to measure distances to low-mass dwarf galaxies via their RR Lyrae stars.</description>

      <title>The 3D Cosmic Shoreline for Nurturing Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various ``cosmic shorelines" have been proposed to delineate which planets have atmospheres. The fates of individual planet atmospheres may be set by a complex sea of growth and loss processes, driven by unmeasurable environmental factors or unknown historical events. Yet, defining population-level boundaries helps illuminate which processes matter and identify high-priority targets for future atmospheric searches. Here, we provide a statistical framework for inferring the position, shape, and fuzziness of an instellation-based cosmic shoreline, defined in the three-dimensional space of planet escape velocity, planet bolometric flux received, and host star luminosity; explicitly including luminosity partially circumvents the need to estimate host stars' historical X-ray and extreme ultraviolet fluences. Using Solar System and exoplanet atmospheric constraints, under the restrictive assumption that one planar boundary applies across a wide parameter space, we find the critical flux threshold for atmospheres scales with escape velocity with a power-law index of $p=6.08^{+0.69}_{-0.48}$, steeper than the canonical literature slope of $p=4$, and scales with stellar luminosity with a power-law index of $q=1.25^{+0.31}_{-0.22}$, steep enough to disfavor atmospheres on Earth-sized planets out to the habitable zone for stars less luminous than $\log_{10} (L_\star/L_\odot) = -2.22 \pm 0.21$ (roughly spectral type M4.5V). If we relax the assumption that one power law must stretch from the hottest exoplanets to the coolest Solar System worlds, the narrower question of ``Which warm planets have thick CO$_2$ secondary atmospheres?" is still poorly constrained by data but should improve significantly with planned JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Milliarcsecond astrometric oscillations in AGN as a precursor of multi-messaging gravitational wave events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) is predicted by various cosmological and evolutionary scenarios for active galactic nuclei. These objects are considered as contributors into the gravitational wave (GW) background and emitters of discrete GW bursts. Yet, SMBHBs remain a rather elusive class of extragalactic objects. Previously we have identified the quasar J2102+6015 as potential SMBHB system based on its oscillating astrometric pattern. We analysed the available VLBI astrometry data and identified another case of astrometric oscillations in the source J0204+1514. We assume these oscillations as manifestations of orbital motion in a binary systems. We estimated parameters of the suspected SMBHB in this source and applied basic theoretical models for projecting its evolution toward coalescence. We also develop a toy model of SMBHB consistent with the discovered astrometric oscillations and give quantitative predictions of GW emission of such the source using the case of J0204+1514 as an example. As an ad hoc result, we also provide a re-assessed estimate of the redshift of J2102+6015, z=1.42. A toy model of the object containing SMBHB with parameters consistent with the observed astrometric oscillations of the source J0204+1514 enabled us to consider GW emission as the cause of the system's orbital evolution. Astrometric VLBI monitoring has an appreciable potential for future detections of SMBHBs as multi-messenger targets for both electromagnetic (in radio domain) and gravitational wave astronomy. To outline the contours of a future physical model connecting SMBHB with detectable GW manifestations, we apply the toy model to the source J0204+1514. We also provide justification for aiming future space-borne VLBI missions toward direct imaging of SMBHBs as a synergistic contribution into future multi-messenger studies involving prospective GW facilities.</description>

      <title>Dangerous Questions in Astronomy Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As astronomy enters an era defined by global telescope networks, petabyte-scale surveys, and powerful computational tools, the longstanding goals of astronomy education, particularly introductory ``ASTRO101'', but equally encompassing both higher and lower level courses, warrant fresh examination. In June 2024, the AstroEdUNC meeting at UNC--Chapel Hill convened 100 astronomers, education researchers, and practitioners to synthesise community perspectives on the purpose, content, and delivery of astronomy education. Beginning with historical vignettes, the meeting's deliberations were organised into six interrelated themes: (1) Context, highlighting astronomy's evolution from classical charting to multi-messenger discovery and its role as a connective thread across STEM and the humanities; (2) Content, exploring how curricula can balance essential concepts with authentic investigations and leverage open-source and AI-augmented resources; (3) Skills, arguing that astronomy should foreground scientific literacy, computational fluency, and communication through genuine data-driven inquiry; (4) Engagement, advocating for active-learning strategies, formative assessment, and culturally inclusive narratives; (5) Beyond the Classroom, emphasising scaffolding, universal-design practices, and K--12/community partnerships; and (6) Astronomy Education Research, outlining priority areas for assessing knowledge, attitudes, and long-term outcomes. We provide concrete recommendations for future astronomy education research development, underscoring the need for approaches to education that are authentic while meeting the learning and life goal needs of the students, a vibrant community of practice and robust researcher--practitioner partnerships to ensure that introductory astronomy is pertinent, applicable and inspiring to a broad student population.</description>

      <title>A general polynomial emulator for cosmology via moment projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MomentEmu, a general-purpose polynomial emulator for fast and interpretable mappings between theoretical parameters and observational features. The method constructs moment matrices to project simulation data onto polynomial bases, yielding symbolic expressions that approximate the target mapping. Compared to neural-network-based emulators, MomentEmu offers negligible training cost, millisecond-level evaluation, and transparent functional forms. As a demonstration, we develop two emulators: PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$, which maps six cosmological parameters to the CMB temperature power spectrum, and PolyCAMB-peak, which enables bidirectional mapping between parameters and acoustic peak features. PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$ achieves an accuracy of $0.03\%$over $\ell \leq 2510$, while PolyCAMB-peak also reaches sub-percent accuracy and produces symbolic forms consistent with known analytical approximations. The method is well suited for forward modelling, parameter inference, and uncertainty propagation, particularly when the parameter space is moderate in dimensionality and the mapping is smooth. MomentEmu offers a lightweight and portable alternative to regression-based or black-box emulators in cosmological analysis.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of the clock asynchrony model in space-borne gravitational wave detection</title>

Abstract: Space-borne gravitational wave detection will open the observation window in the 0.1 mHz$-$1 Hz bandwidth, playing a crucial role in the development of cosmology and physics. Precise clock synchronization among satellites is essential for the accurate detection of gravitational wave signals. However, the independent clock counting mechanisms of each satellite pose a significant challenge. This work reports the mathematical model of clock asynchrony, which is mainly dominated by the constant term factor and the linear term factor. Moreover, it experimentally verifies the clock asynchronization technique based on a dual-phasemeter system. Through experimentation, the impacts of these two aspects of clock asynchrony were confirmed, and post-processing techniques were employed to reduce these impacts to as low as $\rm 2\pi \times 10^{-6} rad/Hz^{1/2}@ 3mHz$. Specifically, the constant term factor is measured by Time-delay Interferometry Ranging (TDIR), while the linear term factor can be gauged by clock transmission link. This study provides a reference for understanding the clock asynchrony mechanism and processing clock synchronization issues. Additionally, a low additional noise clock synchronization test system is introduced to support such measurements.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of amplification and gas mixture for directional Dark Matter searches with the CYGNO/INITIUM project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical and cosmological observations suggest the existence of beyond standard model ingredient known as dark matter (DM). One of the most supported class of theories suggests that DM is composed of weakly interactive massive particles (WIMPs), possibly detectable via weak interaction with standard matter resulting in the recoil of the latter. The motion of the Sun and Earth with respect to the Galactic Centre is expected to induce a strong directional dependence in the recoil spectrum. Direct detection experiments capable of measuring the angular features of the recoils gain access to a wide range of advantages such as the possibility to positively claim a discovery of DM. The CYGNO project sets into this context, with the aim of deploying a large directional detector for rare event searches as DM. It exploits a gaseous time projection chamber filled with a He:CF4 gas mixture with a segmented amplification stage and granular optical readout. In this thesis, it is presented the work carried out with small CYGNO prototypes to maximise the light yield without degrading spatial and energy resolution, the addition of highly electronegative gases to induce a reduction of the electron cloud diffusion while drifting towards the amplification stage, very relevant to precisely measure the topological information of the recoil tracks. Moreover, the potential performances of directional detectors in the context of a direct DM search are analysed with the use of rigorous statistical tools both in the improvement in setting limits in the WIMP to nucleon sensitivity and in the capability of discerning two different DM models exploiting a directional detector.</description>

      <title>Measuring the muon content of inclined air showers using AERA and the water-Cherenkov detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for assessing the muon content of air showers with large zenith angles on a combined analysis of their radio emission and particle footprint. We use the radiation energy reconstructed by the Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) as an energy estimator and determine the muon number independently with the water-Cherenkov detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory, deployed on a 1500 m grid. We focus our analysis on air showers with primary energy above 4 EeV to ensure full detection efficiency. Over approximately ten years of accumulated data, we identify a set of 40 high-quality events that are used in the analysis. The estimated muon contents in data are compatible with those for iron primaries as predicted by current-generation hadronic interaction models. This result can be interpreted as a deficit of muons in simulations as a lighter mass composition has been established from Xmax measurements. This muon deficit was already observed in previous analyses of the Auger Collaboration and is confirmed using hybrid events that include radio measurements for the first time.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Preliminary Characterization of a Third Interstellar Object: 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report initial observations aimed at the characterization of a third interstellar object candidate. This object, 3I/ATLAS -- also C/2025 N1 (ATLAS) -- , was discovered on 2025 July 1 UT and has an orbital eccentricity of $e\sim6.2$, perihelion of $q\sim 1.35$ au, inclination of $\sim175^\circ$, and hyperbolic velocity of $V_\infty\sim 60$ km s$^{-1}$. 3I/ATLAS has an absolute magnitude of $H_V\sim12$, which corresponds to a nuclear radius of $\sim10\text{ km}$, assuming an asteroid-like albedo of $p\sim0.05$. The discovery of this object implies a spatial number density of $n_0\sim10^{-3}$ au$^{-3}$ for objects with radii greater than or equal to that of 3I/ATLAS. We report deep stacked images obtained using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope that display faint activity. Using images obtained from the Las Cumbres Observatory 0.36 m telescopes at Haleakala and the 2.0 m Faulkes Telescope North, we find a small light curve variation of less than 0.2 mag for the object over a $\sim29$ h time span. The visible/near-infrared spectral slope of the object is red, comparable to 1I/`Oumuamua. The object will be observable until September 2025, unobservable near perihelion due to low solar elongation, and observable again in November. This limitation unfortunately prohibits detailed observations at perihelion when the activity of 3I/ATLAS is likely to peak. Based on the experience of 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, we ask the community to maintain a constant observational presence while possible with photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric methods. Such observational data would constrain the (i) light curve, (ii) onset and variation of activity, and (iii) nongravitational effects. It is essential that the community collaborate to rapidly and comprehensively characterize these properties of 3I/ATLAS.</description>

      <title>Optimal Follow-Up of Gravitational-Wave Events with the UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX) is a wide-field ultraviolet space telescope selected as a NASA Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) mission for launch in 2030. UVEX will undertake deep, cadenced surveys of the entire sky to probe low mass galaxies and explore the ultraviolet (UV) time-domain sky, and it will carry the first rapidly deployable UV spectroscopic capability for a broad range of science applications. One of UVEX's prime objectives is to follow up gravitational wave (GW) binary neutron star mergers as targets of opportunity (ToOs), rapidly scanning across their localization regions to search for their kilonova (KN) counterparts. Early-time multiband ultraviolet light curves of KNe are key to explaining the interplay between jet and ejecta in binary neutron star mergers. Owing to high Galactic extinction in the ultraviolet and the variation of GW distance estimates over the sky, the sensitivity to kilonovae can vary significantly across the GW localization and even across the footprint of a single image given UVEX's large field of view. Good ToO observing strategies to trade off between area and depth are neither simple nor obvious. We present an optimal strategy for GW follow-up with UVEX in which exposure time is adjusted dynamically for each field individually to maximize the overall probability of detection. We model the scheduling problem using the expressive and powerful mathematical framework of mixed integer linear programming (MILP), and employ a state-of-the-art MILP solver to automatically generate observing plan timelines that achieve high probabilities of kilonova detection. We have implemented this strategy in an open-source astronomical scheduling software package called the Multi-Mission Multi-Messenger Observation Planning Toolkit, on GitHub at https://github.com/m4opt/m4opt.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave approximants are essential for gravitational-wave astronomy, allowing the coverage binary black hole parameter space for inference or match filtering without costly numerical relativity (NR) simulations, but generally trading some accuracy for computational efficiency. To reduce this trade-off, NR surrogate models can be constructed using interpolation within NR waveform space. We present a 2-stage training approach for neural network-based NR surrogate models. Initially trained on approximant-generated waveforms and then fine-tuned with NR data, these dual-stage artificial neural surrogate (\texttt{DANSur}) models offer rapid and competitively accurate waveform generation, generating millions in under 20ms on a GPU while keeping mean mismatches with NR around $10^{-4}$. Implemented in the \textsc{bilby} framework, we show they can be used for parameter estimation tasks.</description>

      <title>SPACE-SUIT: An Artificial Intelligence Based Chromospheric Feature Extractor and Classifier for SUIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope(SUIT) onboard Aditya-L1 is an imager that observes the solar photosphere and chromosphere through observations in the wavelength range of 200-400 nm. A comprehensive understanding of the plasma and thermodynamic properties of chromospheric and photospheric morphological structures requires a large sample statistical study, necessitating the development of automatic feature detection methods. To this end, we develop the feature detection algorithm SPACE-SUIT: Solar Phenomena Analysis and Classification using Enhanced vision techniques for SUIT, to detect and classify the solar chromospheric features to be observed from SUIT's Mg II k filter. Specifically, we target plage regions, sunspots, filaments, and off-limb structures. SPACE uses YOLO, a neural network-based model to identify regions of interest. We train and validate SPACE using mock-SUIT images developed from Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer(IRIS) full-disk mosaic images in Mg II k line, while we also perform detection on Level-1 SUIT data. SPACE achieves an approximate precision of 0.788, recall 0.863 and MAP of 0.874 on the validation mock SUIT FITS dataset. Given the manual labeling of our dataset, we perform "self-validation" by applying statistical measures and Tamura features on the ground truth and predicted bounding boxes. We find the distributions of entropy, contrast, dissimilarity, and energy to show differences in the features. These differences are qualitatively captured by the detected regions predicted by SPACE and validated with the observed SUIT images, even in the absence of labeled ground truth. This work not only develops a chromospheric feature extractor but also demonstrates the effectiveness of statistical metrics and Tamura features for distinguishing chromospheric features, offering independent validation for future detection schemes.</description>

      <title>A Compact Low-level RF Control System for Advanced Concept Compact Electron Linear Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A compact low-level RF (LLRF) control system based on RF system-on-chip (RFSoC) technology has been designed for the Advanced Concept Compact Electron Linear-accelerator (ACCEL) program, which has challenging requirements in both RF performance and size, weight and power consumption (SWaP). The compact LLRF solution employs the direct RF sampling technique of RFSoC, which samples the RF signals directly without any analogue up and down conversion. Compared with the conventional heterodyne based architecture used for LLRF system of linear accelerator (LINAC), the elimination of analogue mixers can significantly reduce the size and weight of the system, especially with LINAC requires a larger number of RF channels. Based on the requirements of ACCEL, a prototype LLRF platform has been developed, and the control schemes have been proposed. The prototype LLRF system demonstrated magnitude and phase fluctuation levels below 1% and 1 degree, on the flat top of a 2 microseconds RF pulse. The LLRF control schemes proposed for ACCEL are implemented with a prototype hardware platform. This paper will introduce the new compact LLRF solution and summarize a selection of experimental test results of the prototype itself and with the accelerating structure cavities designed for ACCEL.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the impact of an imperfect knowledge of the instrument bandpasses on the estimate of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in the context of the next-generation LiteBIRD satellite. We develop a pipeline to include bandpass integration in both the time-ordered data (TOD) and the map-making processing steps. We introduce the systematic effect by having a mismatch between the ``real'', high resolution bandpass $\tau$, entering the TOD, and the estimated one $\tau_s$, used in the map-making. We focus on two aspects: the effect of degrading the $\tau_s$ resolution, and the addition of a Gaussian error $\sigma$ to $\tau_s$. To reduce the computational load of the analysis, the two effects are explored separately, for three representative LiteBIRD channels (40 GHz, 140 GHz and 402 GHz) and for three bandpass shapes. Computing the amount of bias on $r$, $\Delta r$, caused by these effects on a single channel, we find that a resolution $\lesssim 1.5$ GHz and $\sigma \lesssim 0.0089$ do not exceed the LiteBIRD budget allocation per systematic effect, $\Delta r &lt; 6.5 \times 10^{-6}$. We then check that propagating separately the uncertainties due to a resolution of 1 GHz and a measurement error with $\sigma = 0.0089$ in all LiteBIRD frequency channels, for the most pessimistic bandpass shape of the three considered, still produces a $\Delta r &lt; 6.5 \times 10^{-6}$. This is done both with the simple deprojection approach and with a blind component separation technique, the Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC). Due to the effectiveness of NILC in cleaning the systematic residuals, we have tested that the requirement on $\sigma$ can be relaxed to $\sigma \lesssim 0.05$. (Abridged)</description>
