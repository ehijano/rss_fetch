      <title>A trial to understand the supersymmetry relations through extension of the second quantized fermion and boson fields, either to strings or to odd dimensional spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article studies the extension of the internal spaces of fermion and boson second quantized fields, described by the superposition of odd (for fermions) and even (for bosons) products of the operators $\gamma^ {a}$, to strings and odd dimensional spaces.\\ For any symmetry $SO(d-1,1)$ of the internal spaces, it is the number of fermion fields (they appear in families and have their Hermitian conjugated partners in a separate group) equal to the number of boson fields (they appear in two orthogonal groups), manifesting a kind of supersymmetry, which differs from the usual supersymmetry.\\ The article searches for the supersymmetry arising from extending the ``basis vectors'' of second quantized fermion and boson fields described in $d=2(2n+1)$ (in particular $d=(13+1)$) either to strings or to odd-dimensional spaces ($d=2(2n+1)+1$).</description>

      <title>Canonical quantization of the complex scalar field without making use of its real and imaginary parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proceed to the canonical quantization of the complex scalar field without making use of its real and imaginary parts. Our motivation is to formally connect, as tightly as possible, the quantum-field notions of particle and antiparticle - most prominently represented, formally, by the creation and annihilation operators - to the initial classical field theory - whose main formal object is the field amplitude at a given spacetime point. Our point of view is that doing this via the use of the real and imaginary parts of the field is not satisfying. The derivation demands to consider, just before quantization, the field and its complex conjugate as independent fields, which yields a system of two copies of independent complex scalar fields. One then proceeds to quantization with these two copies, which leads to the introduction of two families of creation and annihilation operators, corresponding to particles on the one hand, and antiparticles on the other hand. One realizes that having two such families is the only hope for being able to "invert" the definitions of the creation and annihilation in terms of the Fourier quantized fields, so as to obtain an expression of the direct-space fields in terms of these creation and annihilation operators, because the real-field condition used in the case of a real scalar field does not hold for a complex scalar field. This hope is then met by introducing the complex-conjugate constraint at the quantum level, that is, that the second independent field copy is actually the complex conjugate of the first. All standard results are then recovered in a rigorous and purely deductive way. While we reckon our derivation exists in the literature, we have not found it.</description>
