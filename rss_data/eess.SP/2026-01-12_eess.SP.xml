      <title>Channel Selected Stratified Nested Cross Validation for Clinically Relevant EEG Based Parkinsons Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early detection of Parkinsons disease remains a critical challenge in clinical neuroscience, with electroencephalography offering a noninvasive and scalable pathway toward population level screening. While machine learning has shown promise in this domain, many reported results suffer from methodological flaws, most notably patient level data leakage, inflating performance estimates and limiting clinical translation. To address these modeling pitfalls, we propose a unified evaluation framework grounded in nested cross validation and incorporating three complementary safeguards: (i) patient level stratification to eliminate subject overlap and ensure unbiased generalization, (ii) multi layered windowing to harmonize heterogeneous EEG recordings while preserving temporal dynamics, and (iii) inner loop channel selection to enable principled feature reduction without information leakage. Applied across three independent datasets with a heterogeneous number of channels, a convolutional neural network trained under this framework achieved 80.6% accuracy and demonstrated state of the art performance under held out population block testing, comparable to other methods in the literature. This performance underscores the necessity of nested cross validation as a safeguard against bias and as a principled means of selecting the most relevant information for patient level decisions, providing a reproducible foundation that can extend to other biomedical signal analysis domains.</description>

      <title>Discrete Mode Decomposition Meets Shapley Value: Robust Signal Prediction in Tactile Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tactile Internet (TI) requires ultra-low latency and high reliability to ensure stability and transparency in touch-enabled teleoperation. However, variable delays and packet loss present significant challenges to maintaining immersive haptic communication. To address this, we propose a predictive framework that integrates Discrete Mode Decomposition (DMD) with Shapley Mode Value (SMV) for accurate and timely haptic signal prediction. DMD decomposes haptic signals into interpretable intrinsic modes, while SMV evaluates each mode's contribution to prediction accuracy, which is well-aligned with the goal-oriented semantic communication. Integrating SMV with DMD further accelerates inference, enabling efficient communication and smooth teleoperation even under adverse network conditions.
  Extensive experiments show that DMD+SMV, combined with a Transformer architecture, outperforms baseline methods significantly. It achieves 98.9% accuracy for 1-sample prediction and 92.5% for 100-sample prediction, as well as extremely low inference latency: 0.056 ms and 2 ms, respectively. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework has strong potential to ease the stringent latency and reliability requirements of TI without compromising performance, highlighting its feasibility for real-world deployment in TI systems.</description>

      <title>SPARK: Sparse Parametric Antenna Representation using Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) acquisition and feedback overhead grows with the number of antennas, users, and reported subbands. This growth becomes a bottleneck for many antenna and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) systems as arrays and user densities scale. Practical CSI feedback and beam management rely on codebooks, where beams are selected via indices rather than explicitly transmitting radiation patterns. Hardware-aware operation requires an explicit representation of the measured antenna/RIS response, yet high-fidelity measured patterns are high-dimensional and costly to handle. We present SPARK (Sparse Parametric Antenna Representation using Kernels), a training-free compression model that decomposes patterns into a smooth global base and sparse localized lobes. For 3D patterns, SPARK uses low-order spherical harmonics for global directivity and anisotropic Gaussian kernels for localized features. For RIS 1D azimuth cuts, it uses a Fourier-series base with 1D Gaussians. On patterns from the AERPAW testbed and a public RIS dataset, SPARK achieves up to 2.8$\times$ and 10.4$\times$ reductions in reconstruction MSE over baselines, respectively. Simulation shows that amortizing a compact pattern description and reporting sparse path descriptors can produce 12.65% mean uplink goodput gain under a fixed uplink budget. Overall, SPARK turns dense patterns into compact, parametric models for scalable, hardware-aware beam management.</description>

      <title>Deformation-Aware Observation Modeling for Radar-Based Human Sensing via 3D Scan-Depth Sequence Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-contact radar-based human sensing is often interpreted using simplified motion assumptions. However, respiration induces non-rigid surface deformation of the human body that impacts electromagnetic wave scattering and can degrade the robustness of measurements. To address this, we propose a surface-deformation-aware observation model for radar-based human sensing that fuses static high-resolution three-dimensional scanner measurements with temporal depth camera data to represent time-varying human surface geometry. Non-rigid registration using the coherent point drift algorithm is employed to align a static template with dynamic depth frames. Frame-wise electromagnetic scattering is subsequently computed using the physical optics approximation, allowing the reconstruction of intermediate-frequency radar signals that emulate radar observations. Validation against experimental radar data demonstrated that the proposed model exhibited greater robustness than a depth-sequence-only model under low-signal-quality conditions involving complex surface dynamics and multiple reflective sites. For two participants, the proposed model achieved higher Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.943 and 0.887 between model-derived and experimentally measured displacement waveforms, compared with 0.868 and 0.796 for the depth-sequence-only model. Furthermore, in a favorable case characterized by a single relatively-stationary reflective site, the proposed method achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.789 between model-derived and experimentally measured in-phase-quadrature magnitude variations. These results suggest that our sensor-fusion-based deformation-aware observation modeling can realistically reproduce radar observations and provide physically grounded insights into the interpretation of radar measurement variations.</description>

      <title>A Novel Deep Learning-Based Coarse-to-Fine Frame Synchronization Method for OTFS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a robust candidate waveform for future wireless systems, particularly in high-mobility scenarios, as it effectively mitigates the impact of rapidly time-varying channels by mapping symbols in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. However, accurate frame synchronization in OTFS systems remains a challenge due to the performance limitations of conventional algorithms. To address this, we propose a low-complexity synchronization method based on a coarse-to-fine deep residual network (ResNet) architecture. Unlike traditional approaches relying on high-overhead preamble structures, our method exploits the intrinsic periodic features of OTFS pilots in the delay-time (DT) domain to formulate synchronization as a hierarchical classification problem. Specifically, the proposed architecture employs a two-stage strategy to first narrow the search space and then pinpoint the precise symbol timing offset (STO), thereby significantly reducing computational complexity while maintaining high estimation accuracy. We construct a comprehensive simulation dataset incorporating diverse channel models and randomized STO to validate the method. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves robust signal start detection and superior accuracy compared to conventional benchmarks, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes and high-mobility scenarios.</description>

      <title>Cedalion Tutorial: A Python-based framework for comprehensive analysis of multimodal fNIRS &amp; DOT from the lab to the everyday world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and diffuse optical tomography (DOT) are rapidly evolving toward wearable, multimodal, and data-driven, AI-supported neuroimaging in the everyday world. However, current analytical tools are fragmented across platforms, limiting reproducibility, interoperability, and integration with modern machine learning (ML) workflows. Cedalion is a Python-based open-source framework designed to unify advanced model-based and data-driven analysis of multimodal fNIRS and DOT data within a reproducible, extensible, and community-driven environment. Cedalion integrates forward modelling, photogrammetric optode co-registration, signal processing, GLM Analysis, DOT image reconstruction, and ML-based data-driven methods within a single standardized architecture based on the Python ecosystem. It adheres to SNIRF and BIDS standards, supports cloud-executable Jupyter notebooks, and provides containerized workflows for scalable, fully reproducible analysis pipelines that can be provided alongside original research publications. Cedalion connects established optical-neuroimaging pipelines with ML frameworks such as scikit-learn and PyTorch, enabling seamless multimodal fusion with EEG, MEG, and physiological data. It implements validated algorithms for signal-quality assessment, motion correction, GLM modelling, and DOT reconstruction, complemented by modules for simulation, data augmentation, and multimodal physiology analysis. Automated documentation links each method to its source publication, and continuous-integration testing ensures robustness. This tutorial paper provides seven fully executable notebooks that demonstrate core features. Cedalion offers an open, transparent, and community extensible foundation that supports reproducible, scalable, cloud- and ML-ready fNIRS/DOT workflows for laboratory-based and real-world neuroimaging.</description>

      <title>Curving Beam Reflections: Model and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curving beams are a promising new method for bypassing obstacles in future millimeter-wave to sub-terahertz (sub-THz) networks but lack a general predictive model for their reflections from arbitrary surfaces. We show that, unfortunately, attempting to "mirror" the incident beam trajectory across the normal of the reflector, as in ray optics, fails in general. Thus, we introduce the first geometric framework capable of modeling the reflections of arbitrary convex sub-THz curving beams from general reflectors with experimental verification. Rather than "mirroring" the trajectory, we decompose the beam into a family of tangents and demonstrate that this process is equivalent to the Legendre transform. This approach allows us to accurately account for reflectors of any shape, size, and position while preserving the underlying physics of wave propagation. Our model is validated through finite element method simulations and over-the-air experiments, demonstrating millimeter-scale accuracy in predicting reflections. Our model provides a foundation for future curving beam communication and sensing systems, enabling the design of reflected curved links and curving radar paths.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Differential GNSS Positioning: Estimators and Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Differential GNSS (DGNSS) positioning, differencing measurements between a user and a reference station suppresses common-mode errors but also introduces reference-station noise, which fundamentally limits accuracy. This limitation is minor for high-grade stations but becomes significant when using reference infrastructure of mixed quality. This paper investigates how large-scale user cooperation can mitigate the impact of reference-station noise in conventional (non-cooperative) DGNSS systems. We develop a unified estimation framework for cooperative DGNSS (C-DGNSS) and cooperative real-time kinematic (C-RTK) positioning, and derive parameterized expressions for their Fisher information matrices as functions of network size, satellite geometry, and reference-station noise. This formulation enables theoretical analysis of estimation performance, identifying regimes where cooperation asymptotically restores the accuracy of DGNSS with an ideal (noise-free) reference. Simulations validate these theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>SIaD-Tool: A Comprehensive Frequency-Domain Tool for Small-Signal Stability and Interaction Assessment in Modern Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents SIaD-Tool, an open-source frequency-domain (FD) scanning solution for stability and interaction assessment in modern power systems. The tool enables multi-sequence identification in the abc, dq0, and 0pn frames and supports both series voltage and parallel current perturbation strategies. A novel perturbation scheme allows direct scanning in the target frame, simplifying the analysis of coupling effects and mirrored frequencies. SIaD-Tool is implemented on a multi-platform architecture, including MATLAB/Simulink and Python-PSCAD/EMTDC. Beyond system identification, it integrates automated stability evaluation through four standardized methods: Generalized Nyquist Criterion (GNC), modal impedance analysis, phase margin assessment, and passivity checks. Validation is carried out via extensive case studies involving passive elements, grid-following and grid-forming converters, offshore wind power plants, and the IEEE 9-bus system. Results confirm high accuracy, scalability, and robustness in detecting critical modes, interaction frequencies, oscillatory behavior, and stability margins.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Electromagnetic Far-Field Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern wireless systems are envisioned to employ antenna architectures that not only transmit and receive electromagnetic (EM) waves, but also intentionally reflect and possibly transform incident EM waves. In this paper, we propose a mathematically rigorous framework grounded in Maxwell's equations for analyzing the complexity of EM far-field modeling of general antenna architectures. We show that-under physically meaningful assumptions-such antenna architectures exhibit limited complexity, i.e., can be modeled by finite-rank operators using finitely many parameters. Furthermore, we construct a sequence of finite-rank operators whose approximation error decays super-exponentially once the operator rank exceeds an effective bandwidth associated with the antenna architecture and the analysis frequency. These results constitute a fundamental prerequisite for the efficient and accurate modeling of general antenna architectures on digital computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Secure Multiuser Beamforming With Movable Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A movable antennas (MAs)-enabled secure multiuser transmission framework is developed to enhance physical-layer security. Novel expressions are derived to characterize the achievable sum secrecy rate based on the secure channel coding theorem. On this basis, a joint optimization algorithm for digital beamforming and MA placement is proposed to maximize the sum secrecy rate via fractional programming and block coordinate descent. In each iteration, every variable admits either a closed-form update or a low-complexity one-dimensional or bisection search, which yields an efficient implementation. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that the MA-enabled design achieves higher secrecy rates than conventional fixed-position antenna arrays.</description>

      <title>Age of Gossip With Cellular Drone Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a cellular network containing $n$ nodes where nodes within a cell gossip with each other in a fully-connected fashion and a source shares updates with these nodes via a mobile drone. The mobile drone receives updates directly from the source and shares them with nodes in the cell where it currently resides. The drone moves between cells according to an underlying continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this work, we evaluate the impact of the number of cells $f(n)$, drone speed $\lambda_m(n)$ and drone dissemination rate $\lambda_d(n)$ on the freshness of information of nodes in the network. We utilize the version age of information metric to quantify the freshness of information. We observe that the expected duration between two drone-to-cell service times depends on the stationary distribution of the underlying CTMC and $\lambda_d(n)$, but not on $\lambda_m(n)$. However, the version age instability in slow moving CTMCs makes high probability analysis for a general underlying CTMC difficult. Therefore, next we focus on the fully-connected drone mobility model. Under this model, we uncover a dual-bottleneck between drone mobility and drone dissemination speed: the version age is constrained by the slower of these two processes. If $\lambda_d(n) \gg \lambda_m(n)$, then the version age scaling of nodes is dominated by the inverse of $\lambda_m(n)$ and is independent of $\lambda_d(n)$. If $\lambda_m(n) \gg \lambda_d(n)$, then the version age scaling of nodes is dominated by the inverse of $\lambda_d(n)$ and is independent of $\lambda_m(n)$.</description>

      <title>Detecting Stochasticity in Discrete Signals via Nonparametric Excursion Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a practical framework for distinguishing diffusive stochastic processes from deterministic signals using only a single discrete time series. Our approach is based on classical excursion and crossing theorems for continuous semimartingales, which correlates number $N_\varepsilon$ of excursions of magnitude at least $\varepsilon$ with the quadratic variation $[X]_T$ of the process. The scaling law holds universally for all continuous semimartingales with finite quadratic variation, including general Ito diffusions with nonlinear or state-dependent volatility, but fails sharply for deterministic systems -- thereby providing a theoretically-certfied method of distinguishing between these dynamics, as opposed to the subjective entropy or recurrence based state of the art methods. We construct a robust data-driven diffusion test. The method compares the empirical excursion counts against the theoretical expectation. The resulting ratio $K(\varepsilon)=N_{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{emp}}/N_{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{theory}}$ is then summarized by a log-log slope deviation measuring the $\varepsilon^{-2}$ law that provides a classification into diffusion-like or not. We demonstrate the method on canonical stochastic systems, some periodic and chaotic maps and systems with additive white noise, as well as the stochastic Duffing system. The approach is nonparametric, model-free, and relies only on the universal small-scale structure of continuous semimartingales.</description>

      <title>AsyMov: Integrated Sensing and Communications with Asynchronous Moving Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10387v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the Doppler frequency shift caused by moving targets is one of the key objectives of Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) systems, as it enables applications such as target classification, human activity recognition, and gait analysis. In practical scenarios, Doppler estimation is hindered by the movement of transmitter and receiver devices, and by the phase offsets caused by their clock asynchrony. Existing approaches have separately addressed these two aspects, either assuming clock-synchronous moving devices or asynchronous static ones. In fact, jointly tackling device motion and clock asynchrony is extremely challenging, as the Doppler shift from device movement differs for each propagation path and the phase offsets are time-varying. In this work, we present AsyMov, a method to estimate the bistatic Doppler frequency of a target and its velocity in ISAC setups featuring mobile and asynchronous devices. It leverages the channel impulse response at the receiver, by originally exploiting the invariance of phase offsets across propagation paths and the bistatic geometry, where the target Doppler and the device velocity are jointly estimated by a newly proposed alternating minimization algorithm. Moreover, it can be seamlessly integrated with device velocity measurements obtained from onboard sensors (if available), for enhanced reliability. Here, AsyMov is thoroughly characterized by way of theory (Cram\'er-Rao bound), simulation, and experiments, implementing it on an IEEE 802.11ay testbed and testing it on multiple setups in the 60 GHz and 28 GHz bands, including moving human subjects. Numerical and experimental results show superior performance against state-of-the-art methods and are on par with scenarios featuring static ISAC devices.</description>

      <title>TransDOA: Calibrating Array Imperfections via Transformer-based Transfer Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13394v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In practical scenarios, processes such as sensor design, manufacturing, and installation will introduce certain errors. Furthermore, mutual interference occurs when the sensors receive signals. These defects in array systems are referred to as array imperfections, which can significantly degrade the performance of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation. In this study, we propose a deep-learning based transfer learning approach, which effectively mitigates the degradation of deep-learning based DOA estimation performance caused by array imperfections.
  In the proposed approach, we highlight three major contributions. First, we propose a Vision Transformer (ViT) based method for DOA estimation, which achieves excellent performance in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and limited snapshots. Second, we introduce a transfer learning framework that extends deep learning models from ideal simulation scenarios to complex real-world scenarios with array imperfections. By leveraging prior knowledge from ideal simulation data, the proposed transfer learning framework significantly improves deep learning-based DOA estimation performance in the presence of array imperfections, without the need for extensive real-world data. Finally, we incorporate visualization and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of DOA estimation algorithms, which allow for a more thorough evaluation of algorithms and further validate the proposed method.

      <title>Intelligent Multimodal Multi-Sensor Fusion-Based UAV Identification, Localization, and Countermeasures for Safeguarding Low-Altitude Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of the low-altitude economy has led to a growing prominence of uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) safety management issues. Therefore, accurate identification, real-time localization, and effective countermeasures have become core challenges in airspace security assurance. This paper introduces an integrated UAV management and control system based on deep learning, which integrates multimodal multi-sensor fusion perception, precise positioning, and collaborative countermeasures. By incorporating deep learning methods, the system combines radio frequency (RF) spectral feature analysis, radar detection, electro-optical identification, and other methods at the detection level to achieve the identification and classification of UAVs. At the localization level, the system relies on multi-sensor data fusion and the air-space-ground integrated communication network to conduct real-time tracking and prediction of UAV flight status, providing support for early warning and decision-making. At the countermeasure level, it adopts comprehensive measures that integrate ``soft kill'' and ``hard kill'', including technologies such as electromagnetic signal jamming, navigation spoofing, and physical interception, to form a closed-loop management and control process from early warning to final disposal, which significantly enhances the response efficiency and disposal accuracy of low-altitude UAV management.</description>

      <title>Invisible Walls: Privacy-Preserving ISAC Empowered by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The environmental and target-related information inherently carried in wireless signals, such as channel state information (CSI), has brought increasing attention to integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, it also raises pressing concerns about privacy leakage through eavesdropping. While existing efforts have attempted to mitigate this issue, they either fail to account for the needs of legitimate communication and sensing users or rely on hardware with high complexity and cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose PrivISAC, a plug-and-play, low-cost solution that leverages RIS to protect user privacy while preserving ISAC performance. At the core of PrivISAC is a novel strategy in which each RIS row is assigned two distinct beamforming vectors, from which we deliberately construct a limited set of RIS configurations. During operation, exactly one configuration is randomly activated at each time slot to introduce additional perturbations, effectively masking sensitive sensing information from unauthorized eavesdroppers. To jointly ensure privacy protection and communication performance, we design the two vectors such that their responses remain nearly identical in the communication direction, thereby preserving stable, high-throughput transmission, while exhibiting pronounced differences in the sensing direction, which introduces sufficient perturbations to thwart eavesdroppers. Additionally, to enable legitimate sensing under such randomized configurations, we introduce a time-domain masking and demasking method that allows the authorized receiver to associate each CSI sample with its underlying configuration and eliminate configuration-induced discrepancies, thereby recovering valid CSI. We implement PrivISAC on commodity wireless devices and experiment results show that PrivISAC provides strong privacy protection while preserving high-quality legitimate ISAC.</description>

      <title>Enabling Training-Free Semantic Communication Systems with Generative Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation wireless systems. Empowered by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, SemCom has achieved significant improvements in transmission quality and efficiency. However, existing SemCom systems either rely on training over large datasets and specific channel conditions or suffer from performance degradation under channel noise when operating in a training-free manner. To address these issues, we explore the use of generative diffusion models (GDMs) as training-free SemCom systems. Specifically, we design a semantic encoding and decoding method based on the inversion and sampling process of the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM), which introduces a two-stage forward diffusion process, split between the transmitter and receiver to enhance robustness against channel noise. Moreover, we optimize sampling steps to compensate for the increased noise level caused by channel noise. We also conduct a brief analysis to provide insights about this design. Simulations on the Kodak dataset validate that the proposed system outperforms the existing baseline SemCom systems across various metrics.</description>

Abstract: Rydberg atom-based RF sensors offer distinct advantages over conventional dipole antennas for electric field detection. This paper presents a system model and performance analysis of a Rydberg atom-based quantum radar, which employs optical readout via lasers and photon detectors instead of circuit-based receivers. We derive the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), compare it with classical radar, and estimate Doppler frequency using an invariant function-based method. Simulations show that the quantum radar achieves higher SNR and lower RMSE in velocity estimation than conventional radar.</description>

      <title>Selection-Induced Contraction of Innovation Statistics in Gated Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Validation gating is a fundamental component of classical Kalman-based tracking systems. Only measurements whose normalized innovation squared (NIS) falls below a prescribed threshold are considered for state update. While this procedure is statistically motivated by the chi-square distribution, it implicitly replaces the unconditional innovation process with a conditionally observed one, restricted to the validation event. This paper shows that innovation statistics computed after gating converge to gate-conditioned rather than nominal quantities. Under classical linear--Gaussian assumptions, we derive exact expressions for the first- and second-order moments of the innovation conditioned on ellipsoidal gating, and show that gating induces a deterministic, dimension-dependent contraction of the innovation covariance. The analysis is extended to NN association, which is shown to act as an additional statistical selection operator. We prove that selecting the minimum-norm innovation among multiple in-gate measurements introduces an unavoidable energy contraction, implying that nominal innovation statistics cannot be preserved under nontrivial gating and association. Closed-form results in the two-dimensional case quantify the combined effects and illustrate their practical significance.</description>
