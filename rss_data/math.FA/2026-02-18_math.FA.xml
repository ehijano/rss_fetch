      <title>Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces on Banach Completions of Virtual Persistence Diagram Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent homology maps a simplicial complex filtered by elements in $\mathbb R$ to finite formal sums of elements of $\mathbb R_{\leq}^{2} = \{ (b,d) \in \mathbb R^2 \cup \{ \infty \} \mid b &lt; d \}$ called (finite) persistence diagrams. This map is stable with respect to the $p$--Wasserstein distance for all $p \in \left[1, + \infty \right]$. Bubenik and Elchesen extend the free translation-invariant commutative Lipschitz monoid of finite persistence diagrams $D(X,A) = D(X)/D(A)$ on arbitrary metric pairs $(X,d,A)$ with $A \subset X$ onto the free translation-invariant abelian Lipschitz group of virtual persistence diagrams $K(X,A) = K(X)/K(A)$ as an isometric embedding $D(X,A) \hookrightarrow K(X,A)$ via the Grothendieck group completion. They prove that the $p$-Wasserstein distance is translation invariant on $D(X,A)$ if and only if $p=1$ and define the unique translation-invariant embedding of $W_1[d]$ into $K(X,A)$ as $\rho.$ When $K(X,A)$ is locally compact abelian, translation-invariant kernels can be constructed via positive-definite functions and Bochner's theorem on the Pontryagin dual. We prove that, for the metric topology induced by $\rho$, the group $(K(X,A),\rho)$ is locally compact if and only if it is discrete, equivalently when the pointed metric space $(X/A,d_1,[A])$ is uniformly discrete, and hence this approach fails outside that case. Assuming instead that $(X/A,d_1,[A])$ is separable and not uniformly discrete, we develop a translation-invariant kernel theory for non--locally compact virtual persistence diagram groups. The group $K(X,A)$ embeds isometrically into its canonical Banach-space linearization $B=\widehat V(X,A)\cong\mathcal F(X/A,d_1)$, and each bounded symmetric positive operator $Q\colon B\to B^\ast$ determines a translation-invariant Gaussian kernel $k(x,y)=\exp\!\left(-\tfrac12\,\langle Q(x-y),x-y\rangle_{B,B^\ast}\right).$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Clifford spectrum associated to three 2 by 2 matrices is nonempty. The structure of Clifford is described in terms "moving" level curves. We discuss some implication of a conjecture formulated for arbitrary size n by n of three matrices and give an example in the case of three self-adjoint operators in the infinite dimensional Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Dolbeault-Dirac operators on compact K\"ahler manifolds in Banach noncommutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an $\mathrm{L}^p$-theory for Dolbeault-Dirac operators on compact K\"ahler manifolds with coefficients in a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle $E$. For each $p \in (1,\infty)$ we consider the closed $\mathrm{L}^p$-realization $\mathcal{D}_{E,p}$ of the Dolbeault-Dirac operator $\mathcal{D}_{E}$ on the Banach space $\mathrm{L}^p(\Omega^{0,\bullet}(M,E))$. We prove that $\mathcal{D}_{E,p}$ is bisectorial and admits a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty$ functional calculus. We establish a Gaffney-type estimate controlling covariant derivatives in $\mathrm{L}^p$, and also obtain $\mathrm{L}^p$-Hodge decompositions. As an application, we show that the closed operator $\mathcal{D}_{E,p}$ yields a compact Banach spectral triple, and we identify the index of the associated Fredholm operator with the holomorphic Euler characteristic, proving in particular that it is independent of $p$. This work initiates a connection between complex geometry, $\mathrm{L}^p$-analysis and Banach noncommutative geometry, beyond the Hilbert space setting.</description>

      <title>On the minimum modulus of dual truncated Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a systematic investigation of the minimum modulus of dual truncated Toeplitz operators (DTTOs) $D_{\varphi}$ acting on the orthogonal complement of the model space $\mathcal{K}_u^{\perp}$, where $u$ is a nonconstant inner function and $\varphi \in L^\infty(\T)$. We first establish an explicit formula for the minimum modulus of the compressed shift $S_u$ and its dual $D_u$ in terms of $|u(0)|$, and prove that the minimum is always attained. For normal DTTOs, we derive sharp spectral bounds utilizing the essential range of the symbol and characterize the conditions under which $m(D_{\varphi})$ coincides with the essential infimum of $|\varphi|$. In the general setting, for unimodular $\vp$, we obtain exact formulas and two sided estimates for $m(D_{\varphi})$ by analyzing the norms of associated Toeplitz and Hankel operators restricted to the model space. Finally, we provide several concrete examples to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Mazur-Ulam Theorem With Gromov-Hausdorff Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that two Banach spaces are linearly isometric if and only if the Gromov--Hausdorff distance between them is finite, in particular, zero. The proof is compilative and relies on results obtained by many researchers on the approximability of almost-surjective almost-isometries by linear surjective isometries. In the finite-dimensional case, previously obtained by I.~Mikhailov, a simpler proof under weaker assumptions is given. In the finite-dimensional case, a criterion for isometry in terms of finite (compact) subsets is also given.</description>

      <title>The topology of finite and infinite-dimensional Stiefel manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11800v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stiefel manifolds arise naturally as spaces of linear monomorphisms and as total spaces of universal frame bundles over Grassmannians. While their finite-dimensional topology is governed by Bott periodicity and nontrivial characteristic classes, the infinite-dimensional theory exhibits a striking collapse phenomenon stemming from Kuiper's contractibility theorem. In this expository article, we present a unified treatment of finite and infinite-dimensional Stiefel manifolds over real and complex Hilbert spaces, emphasizing three structural principles: \\ (i) the interpretation of Stiefel manifolds as spaces of injective operators, \\ (ii) the polar decomposition as a canonical factorization yielding both homotopy decompositions and principal bundle structures, and \\ (iii) the role of Grassmannians as classifying spaces in the stable limit. \\ We show that the polar decomposition provides a global homeomorphism \[ \operatorname{St}(n,H) \cong \operatorname{St}_{\operatorname{orth}}(n,H) \times \operatorname{P}_n(\mathbb{F}) \] valid in arbitrary Hilbert dimension, and that this factorization isolates the entire difference between finite and infinite-dimensional topology. In finite dimension, Bott periodicity and characteristic classes control the nontriviality of the universal bundle; in infinite dimension, Kuiper's theorem forces the contractibility of orthonormal Stiefel manifolds while preserving the nontriviality of the finite-rank universal bundle. This perspective clarifies the precise mechanism behind the "stable" approximation of Grassmannians and highlights the structural transition between classical and Hilbertian topology.</description>

      <title>Curvature, Hodge-Dirac operators and Riesz transforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04203v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of Ricci curvature lower bound for strongly continuous semigroups of operators acting on a reflexive Banach space, endowed with a suitable pair of divergence and gradient operators. We use this notion to investigate the functional calculus of the Hodge-Dirac operator associated to the semigroup in link with the boundedness of suitable Riesz transforms. Our paper offers a unified framework that not only encapsulates existing results in some contexts but also yields new findings in others. This is demonstrated through applications in the frameworks of Riemannian manifolds, compact (quantum) groups, noncommutative tori, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup, $q$-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups and semigroups of Schur multipliers. We also provide an $\mathrm{L}^p$-Poincar\'e inequality that is applicable to all previously discussed contexts under suitable some assumptions of boundedness of functional calculus and Riesz transforms (and some uniform exponential stability). Finally, we prove the boundedness of some Riesz transforms in some contexts as compact Lie groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral Barron spaces, constituting a specialized class of function spaces that serve as an interdisciplinary bridge between mathematical analysis, partial differential equations (PDEs), and machine learning, are distinguished by the decay profiles of their Fourier transform. In this work, we shift from conventional numerical approximation frameworks to explore advanced functional analysis and PDE theoretic perspectives within these spaces. Specifically, we present a rigorous characterization of the dual space structure of spectral Barron spaces, alongside continuous embedding in H\"older spaces established through real interpolation theory. Furthermore, we investigate applications to boundary value problems governed by the Schr\"odinger equation, including spectral analysis of associated linear operators. These contributions elucidate the analytical foundations of spectral Barron spaces while underscoring their potential to unify approximation theory, functional analysis, and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Maximum principles for matrix-valued regular functions of a quaternionic variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quaternionic matrix-valued regular function is a map $F: \Omega \rightarrow M_n(\mathbb{H})$ whose entries are (left) regular functions of a quaternion variable, where $\Omega$ is a domain in $\mathbb{H}$. Our aim is to bring out some maximum norm principles for such functions. We derive an SVD type decomposition theorem for such functions, using the notion of maximizing vectors. Some maximum principles for singular values of matrix-valued regular function are brought out next. We then proceed to prove a Fisher type approximation theorem for regular functions $f: \mathbb{B} \rightarrow \overline{\mathbb{B}}$ that are continuous on $\partial \mathbb{B}$, in terms of convex combinations of finite Blaschke products over $\mathbb{H}$ ($\mathbb{B}$ being the quaternionic unit ball). This in turn yields a Fisher type approximation theorem for an $n \times n$ matrix-valued regular function on the quaternionic unit ball, where each entry of the matrix satisfies the same condition as above.</description>

      <title>Quantum Talagrand-type Inequalities via Variance Decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish dimension-free quantum Talagrand-type inequalities with explicit constants on the quantum Boolean cube, via a unified variance-decay perspective. For individual observables, short-time variance decay along the depolarizing semigroup, with rates estimated through hypercontractivity, naturally yields Talagrand-type bounds. Within this framework, we derive Talagrand-type energy--variance and high-order influence--variance inequalities. From the former, we obtain quantum analogues of Talagrand's isoperimetric inequality, the Eldan--Gross inequality, and the Cordero-Erausquin--Eskenazis inequality; from the latter, we derive high-order quantum Talagrand--KKL-type and partial isoperimetric bounds. Altogether, our work provides a variance-decay framework of broad applicability, unifying first-order and high-order Talagrand-type phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00721v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the noncommutative Lorentz norm (associated to a semifinite von Neumann algebra) of a propagator of the form $\varphi(|\mathscr{L}|)$ can be estimated if the modulus of the Borel function $\varphi$ is bounded by a continuous positive monotonically decreasing function that vanishes at infinity $\psi$. As a consequence, we obtain the $L^p-L^q$ $(1&lt;p\leqslant 2\leqslant q&lt;+\infty)$ norm estimates for the solutions of heat, wave, and Schr\"odinger type equations (new in this setting) on a locally compact separable unimodular group $G$ by using a non-local integro-differential operator in time and any positive left invariant operator (maybe unbounded and with discrete or continuous spectrum) on $G$. We also provide asymptotic estimates (large-time behavior) for the solutions, which in some cases can be claimed to be sharp. Illustrative examples are given for several groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09054v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a Fourier integral operator of order $-(n-1)/2$ associated with a canonical relation locally parametrised by a real-phase function. A fundamental result due to Seeger, Sogge, and Stein proved in the 90's, gives the boundedness of $T$ from the Hardy space $H^1$ into $L^1.$ Additionally, it was shown by T. Tao the weak (1,1) type of $T$. In this work, we establish the weak (1,1) boundedness of a Fourier integral operator $T$ of order $-(n-1)/2$ when it has associated a canonical relation parametrised by a complex phase function. This result in the complex-valued setting, cannot be derived from its counterpart in the real-valued case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove existence results for optimization problems for the $k$th Laplace eigenvalue on closed Riemannian manifolds of dimension $m \geq 3$, depending on the choice of normalization. One such normalization leads to eigenvalue optimization within a conformal class, for which existence of maximizers was previously known only in dimension two. We also prove that all absolutely continuous maximizers of the normalized eigenvalue functionals are always induced by $p$-harmonic maps into spheres, where $p \in [2,m]$. For $p$ sufficiently close to $m$, the maximizers are always H\"older-continuous, whereas for $p&lt;m$ no bubbling occurs. A key tool in our analysis is the application of techniques from the theory of topological tensor products, which appear to be well suited for studying eigenvalue-related optimization problems.</description>

      <title>The metaplectic semigroup and its applications to time-frequency analysis and evolution operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic analysis of the metaplectic semigroup $\mathrm{Mp}_+(d,\mathbb{C})$ associated with positive complex symplectic matrices, a notion introduced almost simultaneously and independently by H\"ormander, Brunet, Kramer, and Howe, thereby extending the classical metaplectic theory beyond the unitary setting.
  While the existing literature has largely focused on propagators of quadratic evolution equations, for which results are typically obtained via Mehler formulas, our approach is operator-theoretic and symplectic in spirit and adapts techniques from the standard metaplectic group $\mathrm{Mp}(d,\mathbb{R})$ to a substantially broader framework that is not driven by differential problems or particular propagators.
  This point of view provides deeper insight into the structure of the metaplectic semigroup, and allows us to investigate its generators, polar decomposition, and intertwining relations with complex conjugation and with the Wigner distribution. We then exploit these structural results to characterize, from a metaplectic perspective, classes of time-frequency representations satisfying prescribed structural properties. Finally, we discuss further implications for parabolic equations with complex quadratic Hamiltonians, we study the boundedness of their propagators on modulation spaces, we obtain estimates in time of their operator norms. Finally, we apply our theory to the study of propagation of Wigner singularities.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a semifinite von Neumann algebra equipped with a normal faithful semifinite trace $\tau$, and let $L_p(\mathcal{M})$ denote the associated noncommutative $L_p$-space for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and let $a, b$ be $\tau$-measurable self-adjoint operators such that $b\in L_p(\mathcal{M})\cap L_{np}(\mathcal{M})$. For a function $f\in C^n(\mathbb{R})$ whose derivatives $f^{(k)}$ are bounded for $1\le k\le n$, we prove that the map $\phi:t\in\mathbb{R}\mapsto f(a+tb)-f(a)$ is $n$-times differentiable in the $\|\cdot\|_{L_p}$-norm. This strengthens the corresponding result of de Pagter and Sukochev for $p\neq 2$ and extends it to higher-order derivatives. In addition, if $f^{(n)}\in C_0(\mathbb{R})$ or $b\in \mathcal{M}$, then $\phi^{(n)}$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$. Consequently, we extend the Potapov--Skripka--Sukochev higher-order trace formula from bounded $L_n$-perturbations to not necessarily bounded perturbations in $L_n(\mathcal{M})\cap L_{n^{2}}(\mathcal{M})$. Moreover, we show that this trace formula holds for a broader class of admissible functions than the classes previously considered in the literature.</description>
