      <title>Local Ridge Formation and Domain Delimitation in Aggregation-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the carapace of turtles such as Mauremys japonica, raised linear structures called keels form along the midline during embryonic development. This study investigates the underlying mechanisms of keel formation and domain delimitation on the carapace using a theoretical framework based on aggregation-diffusion equations. In this model, outward tissue growth is represented by density-dependent diffusion, while local ridge formation is modeled as distance-dependent aggregation potentially driven by haptotaxis. Analytical and numerical investigations reveal that distance sensitivity in aggregation plays a critical role in shaping ridge patterns and domain boundaries: low sensitivity promotes uniform density, whereas high sensitivity leads to localized high-density regions. The model may reproduce species-specific variations in keel formation, including the emergence of single or multiple keels, and accounts for the consistent appearance of the midline keel across diverse turtle species. Furthermore, the emergence of multiple high-density regions is shown to occur at points where the aggregation flux changes sign. These findings imply that cellular responses to structural gradients may underlie both ridge formation and boundary determination. This study helps possibly providing new insight into morphogenetic patterning on the turtle carapace and highlighting the role of distance-dependent cell aggregation in shaping complex biological structures.</description>

      <title>Geodesic learning</title>

Abstract: Learning is a fundamental characteristic of living systems, enabling them to comprehend their environments and make informed decisions. These decision-making processes are inherently influenced by available information about their surroundings and specific objectives. There is an intriguing perspective is that each process is highly efficient under a given set of conditions. A key question, then, is how close to optimality it is or how efficient it is under given conditions. Here, the concept of "geodesic learning" as the optimal reference process, with which each process can be compared, is introduced and formulated on the basis of geometry. The probability distribution describing the state of the composite system consisting of the environment, termed the "information bath", and a decision-maker is characterized by use of the entropic quantities. This enables one to study the system in analogy with thermodynamics. Learning processes are expressed as the changes of parameters contained in the distribution. For a geometric interpretation of the processes, the manifold endowed with the Fisher-Rao metric as the Riemannian metric is considered. This framework allows one to conceptualize the optimality of each process as a state change along a geodesic curve on the manifold, which gives rise to geodesic learning. Then, the bivariate Gaussian model is presented, and the processes of geodesic learning and adaptation are analyzed for illustrating this approach.</description>
