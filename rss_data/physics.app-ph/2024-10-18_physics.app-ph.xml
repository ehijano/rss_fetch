      <title>Kapitza-Inspired Stabilization of Non-Foster Circuits via Time Modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With his formal analysis in 1951, the physicist Pyotr Kapitza demonstrated that an inverted pendulum with an externally vibrating base can be stable in its upper position, thus overcoming the force of gravity. Kapitza's work is an example that an originally unstable system can become stable after a minor perturbation of its properties or initial conditions is applied. Inspired by his ideas, we show how non-Foster circuits can be stabilized with the application of external \textit{electrical vibration}, i.e., time modulations. Non-Foster circuits are highly appreciated in the engineering community since their bandwidth characteristics are not limited by passive-circuits bounds. Unfortunately, non-Foster circuits are usually unstable and they must be stabilized prior to operation. Here, we focus on the study of non-Foster $L(t)C$ circuits with time-varying inductors and time-invariant negative capacitors. We find an intrinsic connection between Kapitza's inverted pendulum and non-Foster $L(t)C$ resonators. Moreover, we show how positive time-varying modulations of $L(t)&gt;0$ can overcome and stabilize non-Foster negative capacitances $C&lt;0$. These findings open up an alternative manner of stabilizing electric circuits with the use of time modulations, and lay the groundwork for application of, what we coin \textit{Vibrational Electromagnetics}, in more complex media.</description>

      <title>The ESRF dark-field x-ray microscope at ID03</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) is a full-field imaging technique for non-destructive 3D mapping of orientation and strain in crystalline elements. The new DFXM beamline at ID03, developed as part of the ESRF Phase II Upgrade Project (EBSL2), was designed to provide cutting-edge capabilities for studying embedded microstructures. The project relocated and upgraded the end station from ID06-HXM to ID03, integrating new X-ray optics, radiation hutches, and a source device optimized for this advanced technique. Notable improvements include a near-field camera, a new goniometer, and a high-resolution far-field camera. The conceptual design was completed in September 2019, followed by the technical design in March 2021, with first users welcomed in April 2024. Building on the success of the original instrument, the ID03 beamline offers enhanced multi-scale and multi-modal mapping of microstructures with high resolution, enabling in-situ exploration of complex phenomena. Applications range from strain and orientation mapping in metals to studies of functional materials, semiconductors, biominerals, and energy systems.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of functional 3D nanoarchitectures via atomic layer deposition on DNA origami crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While DNA origami is a powerful bottom-up fabrication technique, the physical and chemical stability of DNA nanostructures is generally limited to aqueous buffer conditions. Wet chemical silicification can stabilise these structures but does not add further functionality. Here, we demonstrate a versatile 3D nanofabrication technique to conformally coat micrometre-sized DNA origami crystals with functional metal oxides via atomic layer deposition (ALD). In addition to depositing homogenous and conformal nanometre-thin ZnO, TiO2, and IrO2 (multi)layers inside SiO2-stablised crystals, we establish a method to directly coat bare DNA crystals with ALD layers while maintaining the crystal integrity, enabled by critical point drying and low ALD process temperatures. As a proof-of-concept application, we demonstrate electrocatalytic water oxidation using ALD IrO2-coated DNA origami crystals, resulting in improved performance relative to planar films. Overall, our coating strategy establishes a tool set for designing custom-made 3D nanomaterials with precisely defined topologies and material compositions, combining the unique advantages of DNA origami and atomically controlled deposition of functional inorganic materials.</description>

      <title>Geometry-influenced cooling performance of lithium-ion battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery geometry (shape and size) is one of the important parameters which governs the battery capacity and thermal behavior. In the dynamic conditions or during the operation, the performance of batteries become much more complex. Herein, the changes in thermal behavior of lithium-ion battery (LIB)by altering the geometry i.e., length to diameter ratio (l/d), is investigated. The geometries considered are named as large geometry (LG), datum geometry (DG) and small geometry (SG) with the l/d ratio of 5.25, 3.61, and 2.38, respectively. A three-dimensional (3D) multi-partition thermal model is adopted, and the numerical results are validated by the published experimental data. For three different cooling approaches such as radial, both-tab and mixed cooling, the average battery temperature and temperature heterogeneity are thoroughly examined considering the heat transfer coefficients (h) of50 and 100 W/m2K at discharge rates of 1, 2 and 3C. Amongst, the minimum average battery temperature is exhibited by DG, the minimum radial temperature heterogeneity is obtained from LG, and substantial outperformance in terms of faster cooling rate is identified for SG, irrespective of the cooling approach employed</description>

      <title>Aluminum goalpost nano-mechanical devices at low temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical objects have been widely used at low temperatures for decades, for various applications; from quantum fluids sensing with vibrating wires or tuning forks, to torsional oscillators for the study of mechanical properties of glasses, and finally micro and nano-mechanical objects with the advent of clean room technologies. These small structures opened up new possibilities to experimentalists, thanks to their small size. We report on the characterization of purely metallic goalpost nano-mechanical structures, which are employed today for both quantum fluids studies (especially quantum turbulence in $^4$He, $^3$He) and intrinsic friction studies (Two-Level-Systems unraveling). Extending existing literature, we demonstrate the analytic modeling of the resonances, in good agreement with numerical simulations, for both first and second mechanical modes. Especially, the impact of the curvature of the whole structure (and therefore, in-built surface stress) is analyzed, together with nonlinear properties. We demonstrate that these are of geometrical origin, and device-dependent. Motion and forces are expressed in meters and Newtons experienced at the level of the goalpost's paddle, for any magnitude or curvature, which is of particular importance for quantum fluids and solids studies.</description>

      <title>High-order exceptional points and stochastic resonance in pseudo-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points, a remarkable phenomenon in physical systems, have been exploited for sensing applications. It has been demonstrated recently that it can also utilize as sensory threshold in which the interplay between exceptional-point dynamics and noise can lead to enhanced performance. Most existing works focused on second-order exceptional points. We investigate the stochastic dynamics associated with high-order exceptional points with a particular eye towards optimizing sensing performance by developing a theoretical framework based on pseudo-Hermiticity. Our analysis reveals three distinct types of frequency responses to external perturbations. A broad type of stochastic resonance is uncovered where, as the noise amplitude increases, the signal-to-noise ratio reaches a global maximum rapidly but with a slow decaying process afterwards, indicating achievable high performance in a wide range of the noise level. These results suggest that stochastic high-order exceptional-point dynamics can be exploited for applications in signal processing and sensor technologies.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Thermally Interplayed Spin-Orbit Torque Driven Antiferromagnetic Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current-induced antiferromagnetic (AFM) switching remains critical in spintronics, yet the interplay between thermal effects and spin torques still lacks clear clarification. Here we experimentally investigate the thermally interplayed spin-orbit torque induced AFM switching in magnetic tunnel junctions via pulse-width dependent reversal and time-resolved measurements. By introducing the Langevin random field into the AFM precession equation, we establish a novel AFM switching model that anatomically explains the experimental observations. Our findings elucidate the currentinduced AFM switching mechanism and offer significant promise for advancements in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Chip-scale monolithic optoelectronic voltage boost conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voltage conversion is a fundamental electronic process critical to engineered systems across a wide spectrum of applications and spanning many orders of magnitude in scale. Conventional approaches like transformers and charge pumps perform well in specific contexts but face fundamental limitations to miniaturization, electromagnetic interference, and voltage range. Here we present a chip-scale, fully integrated monolithic, non-switching optoelectronic voltage conversion platform capable of high gain, bootstrap-free boost-mode operation across several orders of magnitude in power density and voltage scale. Using the bidirectional coupling between LEDs and PV cells with identical active layer materials, our chip-scale, single-die strategy eliminates Stokes losses while improving key parameters like physical footprint, series resistance, and photon leakage by orders of magnitude over implementations using multiple packaged, discrete components. Moreover, by exploiting the large \'etendue of NIR-transparent semi-insulating InP substrates and the atomically smooth, void-free interface of lattice-matched epitaxial growth, simulations indicate that our InGaAsP architecture's photon transport simultaneously provides a &gt; 60x increase in current density and &gt; 50x reduction in non-radiative recombination losses compared with a multiple-die solution while simultaneously reducing fabrication complexity and improving mechanical robustness. We experimentally demonstrate a boost gain of 3.8x in an 8x8 mm$^2$ InGaAs-on-InP chip while validating key aspects of the voltage conversion platform.</description>

      <title>Curling morphology of knitted fabrics: Structure and Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knitted fabrics are two-dimensional-like structures formed by stitching one-dimensional yarn into three-dimensional curves. Plain stitch or stockinette stitch, one of the most fundamental knitting stitches, consists of periodic lattices of bent yarns, where three-dimensional (3D) curling behavior naturally emerges at the edges. The elasticity and geometry of knitted fabrics have been studied in previous studies, primarily based on 2D modeling. Still, the relation between 3D geometry and the mechanics of knitted fabrics has not been clarified so far. The curling behavior of knits is intricately related to the forces and moments acting on the yarns, geometry of the unit knitted loops, mechanical properties, and contacts, hence requiring a 3D analysis. Here, we show that the curling of plain knits emerges through the elasticity and geometry of the knitted loops, combining desktop-scale experiments and reduced elasticity-based simulations. We find that by changing the horizontal and vertical knitting numbers, three types of curl shapes emerge: side curl and top/bottom curl shapes, which are curled only horizontally and vertically, and double curl shape, in which both curl shapes appear together. The fundamental mechanism of intricate shape deformation is clarified through the force and moment balance along yarn whose centerline shape is discretized through the B-spline curves where elastic stretching, bending, and contact mechanics are taken into account. We reveal that the 3D structure of the single-knitted loop plays a critical role in the curling behavior. Our results imply that the change in shape per a single knitted loop has the potential to control the 3D natural overall shape of knitted fabrics, and could be applied in predicting or designing more complex 3D shapes made of knitted fabrics.</description>

      <title>On the new and accurate (Goudsmit-Saunderson) model for describing e-/e+ multiple Coulomb scattering (Geant4 Technical Note)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new model, for the accurate simulation of multiple Coulomb scattering (MSC) of e-/e+, has been implemented in Geant4 recently and made available with version Geant4-10.4. The model is based on Goudsmit-Saunderson (GS) angular distributions computed by utilising the screen Rutherford (SR) DCS and follows very closely the formulation developed by Kawrakow [1, 2] and utilised in the EGSnrc toolkit [3]. Corrections, for taking into accountenergy loss [2] neglected by the GS theory, spin-relativistic effects [3] not included in the SR but might be accounted on the basis of Mott DCS as well as the so-called scattering power correction [4], i.e. appropriately incorporating deflections due to sub-threshold delta ray productions, are all included similarly to the EGSnrc model [3]. Furthermore, an accurate electron-step algorithm [5, 6, 2] is utilised for path length correction, i.e. for calculating the post-step position in each condensed history simulation steps such that the corresponding single-scattering longitudinal and lateral (post step point) distributions are very well reproduced. An e-/e+ stepping algorithm, including the simulation step-limit due to the MSC and boundary crossing [2]), free from step-size artefacts, makes the model complete. Details on this new model, including all the above-mentioned components and corrections, are provided in this Geant4 technical note.
  It must be noted, that a Goudsmit-Saunderson model for MSC was available before Geant4-10.4., documented in [7], that has been completely replaced by the model described in this technical note (keeping only the G4GoudsmitSaundersonMscModel name of the C++ class from that previous version)</description>

      <title>Measuring kinetic inductance and superfluid stiffness of two-dimensional superconductors using high-quality transmission-line resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of van der Waals superconductors in recent years has generated a lot of excitement for their potentially novel pairing mechanisms. However, their typical atomic-scale thickness and micrometer-scale lateral dimensions impose severe challenges to investigations of pairing symmetry by conventional methods. In this report we demonstrate a new technique that employs high-quality-factor superconducting resonators to measure the kinetic inductance -- up to a part per million -- and loss of a van der Waals superconductor. We analyze the equivalent circuit model to extract the kinetic inductance, superfluid stiffness, penetration depth, and ratio of imaginary and real parts of the complex conductivity. We validate the technique by measuring aluminum and finding excellent agreement in both the zero-temperature superconducting gap as well as the complex conductivity data when compared with BCS theory. We then demonstrate the utility of the technique by measuring the kinetic inductance of multi-layered niobium diselenide and discuss the limits to the accuracy of our technique when the transition temperature of the sample, NbSe$_2$ at 7.06 K, approaches our Nb probe resonator at 8.59 K. Our method will be useful for practitioners in the growing fields of superconducting physics, materials science, and quantum sensing, as a means of characterizing superconducting circuit components and studying pairing mechanisms of the novel superconducting states which arise in layered 2D materials and heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Boosted Entropy-Engineered Synthesis of CuCo Nanometric Solid Solution Alloys for Near-100% Nitrate-to-Ammonia Selectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanometric solid solution alloys are utilized in a broad range of fields, including catalysis, energy storage, medical application, and sensor technology. Unfortunately, the synthesis of these alloys becomes increasingly challenging as the disparity between the metal elements grows, due to differences in atomic sizes, melting points, and chemical affinities. This study utilized a data-driven approach incorporating sample balancing enhancement techniques and multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms to improve the model's ability to handle imbalanced data, significantly boosting the efficiency of experimental parameter optimization. Building on this enhanced data processing framework, we developed an entropy-engineered synthesis approach specifically designed to produce stable, nanometric copper and cobalt (CuCo) solid solution alloys. Under conditions of -0.425 V (vs. RHE), the CuCo alloy exhibited nearly 100% Faraday efficiency (FE) and a high ammonia production rate of 232.17 mg h-1 mg-1. Stability tests in a simulated industrial environment showed that the catalyst maintained over 80% FE and an ammonia production rate exceeding 170 mg h-1 mg-1 over a testing period of 120 hours, outperforming most reported catalysts. To delve deeper into the synergistic interaction mechanisms between Cu and Co, in situ Raman spectroscopy was utilized for realtime monitoring, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further substantiated our findings. These results not only highlight the exceptional catalytic performance of the CuCo alloy but also reflect the effective electronic and energy interactions between the two metals.</description>
