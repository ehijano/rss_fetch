      <title>Numerical investigation on solids settling in a non-Newtonian slurry inside a horizontal flume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slurry transportation is always crucial for many industrial processes. This study numerically investigates the settling behavior of multisize solid particles in a non-newtonian slurry inside a semicircular open channel (flume). The non-newtonian slurry is modelled using a three-dimensional (3D) unsteady Eulerian-Eulerian (E-E) model coupled with the Hershel-Bulkley (HB) rheological model. A detailed sensitivity analysis of drag models is performed to establish the solid-fluid interaction in the slurry flow. The numerical model is validated with the experimental data from the literature and shows a fair agreement. The validated model is used to simulate the settling behavior of the slurry in the flume. The mean particle diameter of the solid particles in the slurry is in the range of 75-296 $\mu$m with a median diameter of 188 $\mu$m. The effect of particle size distributions (PSDs), flume inclination, bubble size and bubble volume fraction on the particle settling inside the flume is investigated in the parametric study. The analysis of our results revealed that the settling of solids is significantly affected by PSDs in the open channel system. In particular, the increase in flume inclination progresses the settling and dissipation of fine and coarse particles, respectively. Additional simulations showed that the inception of bubbles influences the settling velocity of solids, which changes the settling behavior of multisize solids inside the flume. The presented study can be used as a valuable guideline for the optimisation of intermediate exclusion of water from thickened slurry in order to ensure the stability of tailing storage facility.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Caudal Fin Swimmers Incorporating Hydrodynamics, Kinematics, Morphology, and Scale Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many species of fish, as well as biorobotic underwater vehicles, employ body caudal fin propulsion, in which a wave-like body motion culminates in high-amplitude caudal fin oscillations to generate thrust. This study uses high fidelity simulations of a mackerel-inspired caudal fin swimmer across a wide range of Reynolds and Strouhal numbers to analyze the relationship between swimming kinematics and hydrodynamic forces. Central to this work is the derivation and use of a model for the leading edge vortex on the caudal fin. This vortex dominates the thrust production from the fin and the LEV model forms the basis for the derivation of scaling laws grounded in flow physics. Scaling laws are derived for thrust, power, efficiency, cost-of-transport, and swimming speed, and are parameterized using data from high fidelity simulations. These laws are validated against published simulation and experimental data, revealing several new kinematic and morphometric parameters that critically influence hydrodynamic performance. The results provide a mechanistic framework for understanding thrust generation, optimizing swimming performance, and assessing the effects of scale and morphology in aquatic locomotion of both fish and biorobotic underwater vehicles.</description>

      <title>Clean numerical simulation (CNS) of three-dimensional turbulent Kolmogorov flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence holds immense importance across various scientific and engineering disciplines. The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence proposed by Orszag in 1970 is a milestone in fluid mechanics, which began an era of numerical experiment for turbulence. Many researchers have reported that turbulence should be chaotic, since spatiotemporal trajectories are very sensitive to small disturbance. In 2006 E.D. Lorenz discovered that numerical noise might have a great influence on statistic characteristics of chaotic systems. The above-mentioned facts logically lead to the conclusion that numerical noises of turbulence (as a chaotic system) might have great influence on turbulent flows. This is indeed true for a two-dimensional (2D) Kolmogorov turbulent flow, as currently revealed by a much more accurate algorithm than DNS, namely the ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS). Different from DNS, CNS can greatly reduce both of truncation error and round-off error to any required small level so that artificial numerical noise can be rigorously negligible throughout a time interval long enough for calculating statistics. However, In physics, 3D turbulent flow is more important than 2D turbulence, as pointed out by Nobel Prize winner T.D. Lee. So, for the first time, we solve a 3D turbulent Kolmogorov flow by means of CNS in this paper, and compare our CNS result with that given by DNS in details. It is found that the spatial-temporal trajectories of the 3D Kolmogorov turbulent flow given by DNS are badly polluted by artificial numerical noise rather quickly, and the DNS result has huge deviations from the CNS benchmark solution not only in the flow field and the energy cascade but also even in statistics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a data-driven low-dimensional model of Rayleigh-Benard convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiscale, data-driven reduced-order framework for two-dimensional Rayleigh Benard convection in a square cell at high Rayleigh number, where the flow exhibits intermittent large-scale circulation reversals. Starting from direct numerical simulations using Nek5000, we extract a set of energy-ranked POD modes from the combined velocity and temperature fields. A Gaussian filter decomposes the temporal coefficients into low-frequency (slow) and high-frequency (fast) components, enabling a two-branch modeling strategy. Each branch is mapped into a latent representation using a nonlinear autoencoder and evolved via neural ODEs that incorporate time modulation. This strategy reduces the system from an original state space dimension of 10^5 to a compact 20-dimensional latent space while preserving the essential multiscale dynamics. Our model achieves accurate reconstruction of instantaneous flow structures, Reynolds stresses, energy autocorrelations and long-time quantities, such as angular momentum and wall observables. Furthermore, a waiting time analysis of flow reversals validates the statistical alignment of model prediction and DNS results. The explicit modeling of separate slow and fast branches yields significantly improved accuracy in both short-time flow structures and long-time reversal statistics, compared to single-branch alternatives. These results demonstrate the potential of multiscale latent models for capturing complex dynamics in turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Surfactant-laden breaking wave: regular and spilling regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of insoluble surfactants on the spatio-temporal evolution of breaking waves, focusing on both regular and spilling regimes. Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations are conducted using an interface-tracking/level-set method that incorporates surfactant-induced Marangoni stresses. The simulations reveal that surfactant gradients, through Marangoni stresses, markedly alter the wave dynamics. While regular breakers exhibit only minor modifications in the presence of surfactants, increasing surfactant-induced Marangoni stresses in spilling breakers leads to pronounced changes in the crest evolution, vorticity generation, and even a transition towards plunging-like behavior. To quantify these effects, we also extend circulation-based theoretical frameworks to account for surfactant contributions. This work demonstrates the crucial role that surfactants play in the dynamics of breaking waves, revealing that their impact is primarily driven by Marangoni stresses rather than surface tension reduction.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of controlled droplet formation surrounded by shear-thinning fluid in a co-flow microfluidic device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we used a coupled level set and volume of fluid (CLSVOF) computational method for studying the generation of microdroplets in a two dimensional circular co-flow microfluidic device. The fundamental understanding of shear thinning behavior on controlled droplet formation in a microchannel is systematically investigated. Droplet generation and dynamics are controlled by altering the operating conditions and fluid properties, such as CMC solution concentration, both fluids flow rates, and interfacial tension. The droplet length, velocity, liquid film thickness, and formation frequency are quantitatively analyzed and presented in a non-dimensional form. The droplet length decreased with the flow rate and concentration of the CMC solution. However, the length of the droplet increased with dispersed phase flow rate and interfacial tension. From the set of simulation data, the flow regime maps and scaling relations are developed over a range of operating conditions. This work provides critical insights into the uniform and controlled droplet formation in shear-thinning fluids within a circular co flow microchannel, offering guidance for future innovations in the design and optimization of microfluidic systems for specific applications.</description>

      <title>High-throughput controlled droplets generation through a flow-focusing microchannel in shear-thinning fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a three-dimensional transient computational fluid dynamics simulation of droplet generation in a flow-focusing microfluidic device using the Coupled Level Set and Volume of Fluid method for interface capturing. We systematically investigated the effects of shear-thinning non-Newtonian fluids, specifically carboxymethyl cellulose solutions, on the generation of mineral oil droplets. The rheological properties of carboxymethyl cellulose were analyzed at concentrations of 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1.0%, with the parameters K and n specified in terms of viscosity. The study examines the influence of rheological properties, continuous and dispersed phase flow rates, and interfacial tension forces on the generation and dynamics of controlled high-throughput droplets. The numerical results provide insights into droplet characteristics, including droplet length, velocity, formation frequency, liquid film thickness, pressure distribution, and flow regimes. The findings revealed that increasing the carboxymethyl cellulose concentration (0.1% to 1.0%) and continuous phase flow rate (10 {\mu}L/min to 30 {\mu}L/min) reduces droplet length by 53% and 45%, respectively. while increasing the dispersed phase flow rate (2 {\mu}L/min to 18 {\mu}L/min) and interfacial tension results in increased droplet length by 62% and 42%. At lower concentrations of carboxymethyl cellulose, plug-shaped droplets fully occupy the channel width in the squeezing regime. As concentration increases, a transition to the dripping and jetting regimes is observed. The study further explores non-dimensional parameters, expressing the Weber and modified Capillary numbers as functions of flow rate and interfacial tension. These insights impact drug delivery, material synthesis, and microfluidic technologies requiring precise droplet control.</description>

      <title>Effect of a downstream vertical wall on the rise regime of an isolated bubble: an experimental study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work experimentally investigates deformable nitrogen bubbles rising in ultrapure water and interacting with a vertical wall, focusing on how this downstream boundary alters their dynamics, an effect critical to many real-world processes. The experiments were conducted with a fixed Morton number, $Mo = 2.64 \times 10^{-11}$, with Bond, Galilei, and Reynolds numbers in the ranges $0.08 \lesssim Bo \lesssim 0.33$, $71 \lesssim Ga \lesssim 194$, and $132 \lesssim Re \lesssim 565$, respectively. The initial dimensionless horizontal distance between the wall and the bubble centroid was systematically varied, $0.3 \lesssim L \lesssim 5$, and the bubble trajectories from two orthogonal vertical planes were captured using high-speed imaging. While the bubble rising paths were stable without the wall presence for all the cases, the results reveal that wall proximity significantly affects the rising path, depending on $Bo$ (or $Ga$) and $L$. A map with four distinct interaction regimes and their transitions is obtained: (i) Rectilinear Path (RP) at low $Bo$ and large $L$, with negligible wall influence; (ii) Migration Away (MA) at higher $Bo$ and moderate-to-large $L$, with lateral deviation from the wall; (iii) Collision and Migration Away (C+MA) at high $Bo$ and small $L$, where bubbles first collide and then migrate away; and (iv) Periodic Collisions (PC) at low $Bo$, where repeated wall impacts occur due to competing forces. These findings bridge the gap between idealised simulations and practical systems, offering high-quality data to support and refine computational models of bubble-wall interactions in industrial and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>Taylors hypothesis and its impact on flux measurements in a forest clearcut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taylors hypothesis is the backbone to convert observations done over time to spatial information of the flow while carrying out turbulence measurements on a micrometeorological tower. To address its validity over a highly heterogeneous forest clearcut surface, we utilize an extensive Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and Eddy Covariance (EC) datasets. The DTS measured space-time correlation curves of temperature fluctuations are used to compute the bulk convective speeds of temperature structures in buoyant conditions at a height of 3.1 m above the clearing. These convective speeds are compared with the mean wind speed and turbulent intensities of streamwise velocities obtained from the EC system at the middle of the clearcut. Depending on if is parallel or perpendicular to the forest edge, the relationships between and are significantly different. However, irrespective of the wind direction, the convective speeds of temperature structures at inertial subrange scales behave in a power-law fashion with increasing wavenumbers. The exponent of this power-law differs from a homogeneous atmospheric surface layer flow, thereby pointing towards the effects of heterogeneity. The scale-dependent convective speeds non-linearly transform the temporal frequencies to streamwise wavenumbers, which, eventually, impacts the properties of turbulence (co) spectra. More importantly, this non-linear transformation yields a critical frequency limit, beyond which the eddy length scales derived from frequencies are smaller than the physical dimension of the sonic anemometers, and therefore, cannot be faithfully resolved. This critical limit questions the EC flux estimates beyond this frequency.</description>

      <title>Vortex to Rotons Transition in Dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental advancements enabled the creation of various systems exhibiting superfluid behavior, with one notable achievement being the development of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (dBECs). When confined along one or more spatial dimensions, these condensates exhibit a dispersion relation reminiscent of superfluid liquid helium, featuring a roton-like minimum. This study investigates the existence of two-dimensional solitary waves in dBECs characterised by topological defects (quantised vortices) and their transition to vortex-free Jones-Roberts solitons. The explicit connection between solitary waves and roton excitation is demonstrated, supporting Feynman's hypothesis regarding the nature of rotons as fading vortex excitations.</description>

      <title>Towards Variational Quantum Algorithms for generalized linear and nonlinear transport phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article proposes a Variational Quantum Algorithm to solve linear and nonlinear thermofluid dynamic transport equations. The hybrid classical-quantum framework is applied to problems governed by the heat, wave, and Burgers' equation in combination with different engineering boundary conditions. Topics covered include the encoding of band matrices, as in the consideration of non-constant material properties and upwind-biased first- and higher-order approximations, widely used in engineering Computational Fluid Dynamics, by the use of a mask function. Verification examples demonstrate high predictive agreement with classical methods. Furthermore, the scalability analysis shows a polylog scaling of the number of quantum gates with the number of qubits. Remaining challenges refer to the implicit construction of upwind schemes and the identification of an appropriate parameterization strategy of the quantum ansatz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear dynamics governing the breakup of a two-dimensional strip of active chiral fluid, finding that the strip thickness goes to zero at the pinch points as a power law in finite time. Using slender body theory combined with a scaling analysis, we predict new anomalous scaling exponents and functions characterizing the speed and shape of breakup. The scaling analysis is shown to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic equations.</description>
