      <title>Mechanism-based metamaterials with microstructurally invariant shape-change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials with low-energy floppy modes called mechanisms are a burgeoning template for shape-morphing systems and structures across scales. Here, we present a design recipe that transforms an arbitrary plane tiling into a 2D kirigami pattern with a single degree-of-freedom mechanism motion, greatly expanding the known library of mechanism-based designs. We reveal that these kirigami patterns, when deformed along their mechanism, have a bulk shape change invariant to the underlying microstructure of the pattern. Experimental observations confirm this unusual kinematic prediction in illustrative classes of designs. We also exploit this invariance to elicit different elastic responses in patterns with identical bulk shape change. Finally, we discuss generalizations to compact and non-planar kirigami, as well as 3D metamaterials, highlighting the broad applicability of our new approach to design.</description>

      <title>Spreading and absorption of silicone oil droplets on silicone elastomer films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a liquid droplet completely wets a hard substrate, its spreading dynamics follow Tanner's law, with the droplet radius growing as the one-tenth power of time. Here, we investigate how these dynamics change when silicone oil droplets spread on soft silicone elastomer and gel films supported by a rigid silicon substrate. While the droplets fully wet the elastomer surface, they also simultaneously swell the elastomer film. By varying the film thickness, we observe deviations from the classical power-law scaling, which we interpret in terms of changes to the effective stiffness and the absorption potential of the system. We describe the spreading behavior using a phenomenological model that accounts for both absorption and mechanical contributions.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion of a rod threading through a ring with fixed ring-center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Brownian motion of a rigid rod threading through a small fixed ring while the ring can freely rotate. We derive the distribution function for the sliding displacement and the unit vector along the rod both at equilibrium and non-equilibrium. The equilibrium distribution is quadratic in the sliding displacement and is controlled by the moment of inertia (mass distribution). Applying the Onsager variational principle, we derive a Smoluchowski equation in which sliding and rotational diffusion are coupled. The mean square displacement (MSD) of sliding shows a metastable plateau in a certain time range before it approaches the final equilibrium value. The longest sliding relaxation time decreases as $\alpha^{-1/2}$ as the moment of inertia increases. The rotational relaxation time obtained from the orientational correlation function is longer than that of a rod with its center fixed but faster than a rod with one end fixed. These results may be useful in understanding the dynamics of polymers connected by sliding rings.</description>

      <title>Designing topological edge states in bacterial active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology provides a unifying framework for understanding robust transport through protected edge states arising from nontrivial wavenumber topology. Extending these concepts to active matter, however, remains largely unexplored experimentally, with realizations limited to systems composed of chiral active particles. Here, we realize topological edge states in dense bacterial suspension, which represents a prototypical active matter system, using microfabricated geometrical structures with nontrivial wavenumber topology. Inspired by previous theoretical studies, we constructed a directional kagome network composed of ratchet-shaped channels that induce unidirectional bacterial flow. In this network, we found clear edge localization of bacterial density. A steady-state analysis based on the bacterial transport model and experimentally measured velocity field reveals how the characteristic collective flow generates edge localization. The model also uncovers the topological origin of the observed edge states. By tuning the geometry of the microfabricated networks, we identified directional channel design and network chirality as the key design features essential for the emergence of the edge state. Our results pave the way for establishing a control and design principle of topological transport in such active matter systems.</description>

      <title>A microscopic origin for the breakdown of the Stokes Einstein relation in ion transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion transport underlies the operation of biological ion channels and governs the performance of electrochemical energy-storage devices. A long-standing anomaly is that smaller alkali metal ions, such as Li$^+$, migrate more slowly in water than larger ions, in apparent violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation. This breakdown is conventionally attributed to dielectric friction, a collective drag force arising from electrostatic interactions between a drifting ion and its surrounding solvent. Here, combining nanopore transport measurements over electric fields spanning several orders of magnitude with molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the time-averaged electrostatic force on a migrating ion is not a drag force but a net driving force. By contrasting charged ions with neutral particles, we reveal that ionic charge introduces additional Lorentzian peaks in the frequency-dependent friction coefficient. These peaks originate predominantly from short-range Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions within the first hydration layer and represent additional channels for energy dissipation, strongest for Li$^+$ and progressively weaker for Na$^+$ and K$^+$. Our results demonstrate that electrostatic interactions primarily act to tighten the local hydration structure, thereby amplifying short-range LJ interactions rather than directly opposing ion motion. This microscopic mechanism provides a unified physical explanation for the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation in aqueous ion transport.</description>

      <title>From Lyotropic to Thermotropic Behavior: Solvent-Free Liquid Crystalline Phases in Polymer-Surfactant-Conjugated Rod-shaped Colloidal Viruses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filamentous bacteriophages fd are viral particles, highly monodisperse in size, that have been widely used as a model colloidal system for studying the self-assembly of rod-shaped particles as well as a versatile template in nanoscience. In aqueous suspensions, fd viruses exhibit lyotropic behavior, forming liquid crystalline phases as their concentration increases. Here, we report a solvent-free system displaying thermotropic phase behavior, achieved through covalent coupling of low molecular weight PEG-based polymer surfactant onto the fd virus surface. Upon lyophilization of aqueous suspensions of these polymer-grafted bacteriophages and subsequent thermal annealing, a solvent-free material is obtained, exhibiting both viscoelasticity and, notably, thermotropic liquid crystalline properties. A combination of small-angle X-ray scattering and optical microscopy experiments reveals the formation of an ordered hexagonal mesophase below 30 {\deg}C, which undergoes a melting transition into an isotropic liquid at higher temperatures. Our results demonstrate an efficient approach for converting lyotropic into thermotropic phase behavior in the columnar liquid crystalline phase of filamentous fd colloids. This approach paves the way for extending such functionalization to other technologically relevant rod-like systems, such as carbon nanotubes and cellulose nanocrystals, enabling the introduction of thermotropic properties in anhydrous colloidal materials.</description>

      <title>Beyond uniform screening: electrostatic heterogeneity dictates solution structure of complex macromolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of biomolecular interactions necessitates advanced methodologies to accurately capture their behavior in solution. In this work, we focus on monoclonal antibodies and adopt a multi-scale coarse-graining strategy for their modeling, with particular emphasis on the role of electrostatic interactions. Using scattering experiments, theoretical analysis, and large-scale computer simulations, we explicitly compare two selected case studies-markedly different in their charge distributions. Through mutually corroborating lines of evidence, we demonstrate that conventional approaches relying on electrostatic screening and implicit charge representations fail to capture the structural and thermodynamic properties of antibody solutions when strong charge heterogeneity is present, even at a moderate (amino acid) level of coarse-graining. These findings highlight the importance of a correct treatment of electrostatic interactions and ion screening for heterogeneously- and oppositely-charged colloidal and protein systems. Such considerations are essential to move beyond descriptive models towards a truly predictive framework, with direct implications for the formulation of therapeutics and the treatment of other complex soft-matter systems.</description>

      <title>The Topological Origin of Bohm Resistivity in Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta~\propto~T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the magnetized electron fluid as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the "frozen-in" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the magnetic field. By rigorously mapping the breakdown of adiabatic invariance to electron gyro axis slippage on the unit sphere, we show that the resulting resistivity naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. Numerical simulations of the $XY$ universality class confirm that the onset of this resistive state is explosive, following a logistic trigger consistent with the impulsive phase of solar flares. Furthermore, the topological defects in the condensate decay via a $t^{-0.75}$ power law, identifying magnetic island coalescence as the mechanism of anomalous transport. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</description>

      <title>Bridging Elastic and Active Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remarkably, even under negligible inertia, the addition of microstructural agents can generate chaotic flow fields. Such behavior can arise in polymer solutions, leading to elastic turbulence, or from active, self-driven particles, which generate active turbulence. Here, we demonstrate a close and hitherto unrecognized connection between these two classes of turbulence. Specifically, we reveal that their continuum descriptions are analogous at the macroscopic level, such that polymeric fluids can be interpreted as a deformable analogue of contractile active matter. Moreover, our numerical results for Kolmogorov flow demonstrate that the transition into the well-known traveling arrowhead structures in elastic turbulence is marked by the emergence of $\pm 1/2$ topological defects, long recognized as a defining feature of active turbulence, in the polymer director field. Importantly, these coherent structures originate from a transverse instability driven by activity-like gradients generated by anisotropically stretched, contractile polymers. At sufficiently strong activity, the system undergoes a transition into a flow-suppressed state characterized by weak polymer stretching and ordering, a behavior that can be explained by analogy with the spontaneous-flow transition observed in channel-confined active nematics.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Interactions Govern Self-Organized Ordering in Bacterial Colonies on Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bacterial colonies growing on surfaces are shaped by mechanical stresses transmitted through the community, governed by the balance between cell growth and steric and cell-substrate interactions. Using overdamped dynamics simulations of nonmotile, stress-responsive bacteria, we examine how purely mechanical interactions determine colony morphology and internal organization. Growth-induced extensile stresses compete with steric constraints, giving rise to the spontaneous formation of microdomains composed of highly aligned cells. We characterize this self-organization through the distribution of microdomain areas and a nematic order parameter that quantifies colony-wide alignment. Mechanosensitivity does not systematically alter domain structure, but increasing substrate friction reduces the mean domain size and broadens the diversity of orientations. Shifting the balance toward steric interactions, by lengthening the cell division size, slows the relaxation of colony shape toward isotropy and broadens the distribution of contact forces, producing a slower exponential decay. In dense colonies, strong forces are transmitted anisotropically through chains of aligned neighbors within microdomains. These findings demonstrate that colony-level morphology and stress organization can emerge from local mechanical interactions alone, even without requiring biochemical signaling. By linking microscopic force transmission to macroscopic growth dynamics, our study provides a physical framework for understanding how mechanical interactions shape the self-organization of bacterial communities under surface confinement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Swimming is ubiquitous in nature and crucial for the survival of a wide range of organisms. The physics of swimming at the viscosity-dominated microscale and inertia-dominated macroscale is well studied. However, in between lies a complicated mesoscale with swimmers affected by non-linear and time-dependent fluid mechanics. The intricate motility strategies, combined with complex and periodically changing body shapes add extra challenges for accurate meso-swimming modelling. Here, we have further developed the micropipette force sensor to directly probe the swimming forces of the meso-organism Artemia. Through deep neural network-based image analysis, we show how Artemia achieves an increased propulsive force by increasing its level of time-reversal symmetry breaking. We present a universal force-based scaling law for a wide range of micro- to meso-organisms with different body shapes, swimming strategies, and level of inertia at the mesoscale. These results capture fundamental aspects of biological meso-swimming dynamics and provide guidance for future biomimicking meso-robot designs.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of the attractive electrosolvation force between a pair of colloidal particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In solution, electrically like-charged particles can experience a strong and long-ranged attraction that leads to the formation of stable, slowly reorganizing clusters. The attractive force underpinning this spontaneous organization process has been shown to depend on both the sign of charge of the particle and the nature of the solvent medium. The origin of the attraction has been ascribed to the preferential orientation of solvent molecules at the object-electrolyte interface. Here, we use optical imaging to directly measure the spatial profile of the potential of mean force between isolated pairs of charged microspheres. Working with particles carrying a variety of surface chemistries we find that the range of the electrosolvation attraction is substantially longer than previously held. In particular we show that particles carrying strongly anionic surface coatings composed of DNA or phospholipid bilayers display long-range attraction. We further find that the length scale governing the decay of the attractive force can depend on the properties of the interacting particles. This contrasts with the canonical expectation that the screening length governing the interaction of charged particles in solution depends exclusively on the properties of the intervening electrolyte medium. The observations point to significant departures from current thinking, and the likely need for a model of interactions that accounts for the molecular nature of the solvent, its interfacial behaviour, and spatial correlations. Finally, a strong and long-ranged attraction mediated by anionic matter constituting lipid membranes and chromatin could carry far-reaching implications for biological organization and structure formation.</description>

      <title>Single-orientation Crystalline Domains of Active Brownian Particles Lead to Collective Motions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active Brownian particles, even without attractive and anisotropic inter-particle interactions, can form a high-density phase featuring structure-ordered domains as well as collective motion regions under thermal noise. However, the mechanism, particularly the relationship between the motion and structure, remains unclear. In this study, we show that the motion-correlation regions are spatially coincident with the single-orientation crystalline domains. Each domain translates or rotates as a whole due to the net active force or torque acting upon it, allowing relative motions between these crystalline domains. The particles at domain boundaries usually have the active forces pointing inward, which helps to stabilize these structure-ordered domains and their corresponding collective motion regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two ternary liquid crystalline mixtures are formulated and investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and broadband dielectric spectroscopy. Paraelectric smectic A*, ferroelectric smectic C*, and antiferroelectric smectic C$_A$* phases are detected. The glass of the smectic C$_A$* phase is formed at moderate cooling rates. Vitrification prevents the approaching transition to a hexatic smectic phase. One mixture shows a strong thermochromic effect in the smectic C$_A$* phase and selectively reflects blue light in the glassy state. Both mixtures reflect either green or red light in the smectic C* phase, depending on temperature treatment: whether the sample is cooled or heated, or at which rate the temperature changes.</description>

Abstract: Field induced assembly of reconfigurable structures with complex hierarchical configurations has recently become an area of intense research with the promise for exciting applications in programmable self-assembly and nano/microstructure fabrication. While a wide variety of structures, from crystals to glasses, to chains and oligomers have been produced by activating colloidal particles with electric and magnetic fields, a combined approach utilizing the capabilities of multiple field types offers a richer parameter space, enabling precise structural control and a higher degree of reconfigurability. Here we demonstrate the assembly of complex hierarchical colloidal superstructures using an electric field (AC) and magnetic field (DC) combination. In our chosen frequency regime, dipolar (magnetic and electric) and electrohydrodynamic interactions are comparable, leading to a rich phase space with a wide number of configurations which are tunable by relatively small changes of the field parameters. This is in contrast to the existing small number of studies on multi-field induced assembly that work in size and frequency regimes where the dominant mechanism is dipolar interaction induced assembly. We show that depending upon the direction and frequency of the applied fields, there can be three possibilities in structure formation: a) a cooperation among the fields b) a competition among the fields and c) hierarchical reorganization in which micrometer-sized particles form chains that are part of larger clusters or 'domains' spanning tens of micrometers. This versatile, easy to set up and fully reconfigurable approach of multi-field induced structure formation opens up new opportunities for bottom-up fabrication of smart materials, switchable photonic crystals, and modular microswimmers for targeted drug delivery and environmental remediation.</description>

      <title>Structure factor realizability reveals the glass-dynamics onset temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When liquids are cooled rapidly, they bypass crystallization and instead enter a supercooled state and then a glass state. Previous studies have shown that the static structure factors of high-temperature liquids, supercooled liquids, and glasses exhibit only subtle differences, leading to the conclusion that the glass transition cannot be predicted solely from structure factor changes. Our research challenges this limitation. Specifically, we studied the difficulty of generating configurations corresponding to target structure factors using stochastic gradient descent optimizations. While such optimizations easily converge when targeting the structure factors of higher temperature liquids, the difficulty significantly increases for lower temperature liquids and glasses. By quantifying this difficulty through the mean squared error achieved, we found a kink at the onset temperature of glass dynamics. Our results suggest that the onset of glass dynamics can be explained by a topological change in the realizability landscape of the structure factor, even though the structure factor itself only changes smoothly. Our results are currently based on computer simulations using original and modified Dzugutov interactions, and future work will determine whether our theory is applicable to other glass-forming systems.</description>

      <title>Mixing, segregation, and collapse transitions of interacting copolymer rings</title>

Abstract: A system of two self and mutual interacting ring polymers, close together in space, can display several competing equilibrium phases and phase transitions. Using Monte Carlo simulations and combinatorial arguments on a corresponding lattice model, we determine three equilibrium phases, two in which the rings segregate in space and are either extended (the segregated-expanded phase) or compact (the segregated-collapsed phase). The third is a mixed phase where the rings interpenetrate. The corresponding phase boundaries are located numerically and their critical nature is discussed. Finally, by looking at the topological properties of the three phases, we show that the two rings are likely to be linked in the mixed phase and knotted in the segregated-collapsed phase.</description>

      <title>A microfluidic band-pass filter for flexible fiber separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control of particle trajectories in structured microfluidic environments has significantly advanced sorting technologies, most notably through deterministic lateral displacement (DLD). While previous work has largely targeted rigid, near-spherical particles, the sorting of flexible, anisotropic objects such as fibers remains largely unexplored. Here, we combine experiments and simulations to demonstrate how tilted pillar arrays enable efficient, length-based separation of flexible fibers. We discover that these arrays act as band-pass filters, selectively inducing lateral migration in fibers whose lengths are close to the array period. Fibers significantly shorter or longer exhibit minimal lateral deviation. This migration arises from the interplay of fluid-structure interactions between fibers and the complex flow and steric interactions with the pillars. Depending on their length, fibers exhibit distinct transport regimes: short fibers zigzag in between pillars following the flow, intermediate length fibers exhibit wrapping and jumping from one pillar to another, leading to lateral displacement, and long fibers deform extensively, following mixed zigzag-jump trajectories with minimal lateral migration. We identify the mechanical tension that develops in the fiber when wrapped around the pillars as the driving mechanism of cross-streamline transport. Leveraging this band-pass effect, we designed a highly efficient separation device to collect monodisperse fiber suspensions. Our findings not only expand the functional scope of DLD-like systems but also open new avenues for understanding transport of anisotropic objects in porous media.</description>

      <title>Finite-Memory Extension of Tegmark's Decoherence Bound in Biological Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tegmark's decoherence bound is derived under the assumption of a strictly memoryless environment. We show that this result corresponds to the singular limit of a finite-memory theory. For exponentially correlated environments decoherence is generically quadratic at short times and the decoherence time scales as the square root of the bath correlation time. For the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck bath we derive the exact non-Markovian coherence equation and verify the predicted scaling using an exact pseudomode mapping. Tegmark's bound is recovered only in the vanishing-memory limit.</description>
