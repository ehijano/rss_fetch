      <title>MeerKAT L-band observations of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster. Detection of synchrotron threads and jellyfish galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations with modern radio interferometers are uncovering the intricate morphology of synchrotron sources in galaxy clusters, both those arising from the intracluster medium (ICM) and those associated with member galaxies. Moreover, in addition to the well-known radio tails from active galactic nuclei, radio continuum tails from jellyfish galaxies are being efficiently detected in nearby clusters and groups. Our goal is to investigate the radio emission from the Ophiuchus cluster, a massive, sloshing cluster in the local Universe ($z=0.0296$) that hosts a diffuse mini halo at its center. To achieve this, we analyzed a 7.25 h MeerKAT L-band observation, producing sensitive images at 1.28 GHz with multiple resolutions. A catalog of spectroscopically confirmed cluster galaxies was used to identify and study the member galaxies detected in radio. We discover thin threads of synchrotron emission embedded in the mini halo, two of which may be connected to the brightest cluster galaxy. We also report the first identification of jellyfish galaxies in Ophiuchus, detecting six galaxies with radio continuum tails, one of which extending for $\sim$64 kpc at 1.28 GHz, making it one of the longest detected at such a high frequency. Finally, we propose an alternative scenario to explain the origin of a bright amorphous radio source, previously classified as a radio phoenix, aided by the comparison with recent simulations of radio jets undergoing kink instability. In Ophiuchus thin threads have been observed within the diffuse emission; a similar result was obtained in Perseus, another nearby cluster hosting a mini halo, suggesting that these structures may be a common feature in this kind of sources. Moreover, radio continuum observations have proven effective in detecting the first jellyfish galaxies in both systems.</description>

      <title>Tracing the W3/W4/W5 and Perseus complex dynamical evolution with star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Perseus complex offers an ideal testbed to study cluster formation and early evolution as it hosts two major hierarchical structures (namely LISCA I and LISCA II) and the W3/W4/W5 (W345) region characterized by recent star formation. This work aims to provide a full characterization of the population of star clusters in the W345 region, in terms of their structural, photometric, and kinematic properties. Clusters are then used to probe the dynamical properties of the W345 region and, on a larger scale, to investigate the evolution of the Perseus complex. We used Gaia DR3 data to search for star clusters in the W345 region and characterize them in terms of their density structure, ellipticity, internal dynamical state, and ages. We identified five stellar clusters belonging to the W345 complex. The three younger clusters are still partially embedded in the gas and show evidence of expansion, while the older ones cleared the surrounding gas. We also found that YSOs trace the parent gas structure and possibly its kinematics. Thanks to the 6D information available for star clusters, we followed their orbital evolution to assess the formation conditions and evolution of the complex. When accounting for the Galactic potential, we find that the Perseus complex is not dispersing. The observed expansion might be a projection effect due to stars orbiting the Galaxy at different velocities. In addition, we find that the LISCA I and W345 systems formed some $20-30$ Myr ago just a few hundred parsecs away, while LISCA II was originally $\simeq 0.75-1$ kpc apart. Finally, we also assessed the impact of spiral arm perturbations by constructing tailored Galactic potential which matches the observed Galactic spiral arm structure. We find spiral structures drag star clusters toward higher-density regions, possibly keeping clusters closer for longer than the unperturbed, axisymmetric case.</description>

      <title>Response of the LMC's Bar to a Recent SMC Collision and Implications for the SMC's Dark Matter Profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LMC's stellar bar is offset from the outer disk center, tilted from the disk plane, and does not drive gas inflows. These properties are atypical of bars in gas-rich galaxies, yet the LMC bar's strength and radius are similar to typical barred galaxies. Using N-body hydrodynamic simulations, we show that the LMC's unusual bar is explainable if there was a recent (${\approx}$100 Myr ago) collision (impact parameter $\approx$2 kpc) between the LMC and SMC. Pre-collision, the simulated bar is centered, co-planar, and has a gaseous counterpart. Post-collision, the simulated bar is offset ($\approx$1.5 kpc), tilted ($\approx8.6^\circ$), and non-existent in gas. The simulated bar offset reduces with time, and comparing with the observed offset ($\approx0.8$ kpc) suggests the timing of the true collision to be 150-200 Myr ago. 150 Myr post-collision, the LMC's bar is centered with its dark matter halo, whereas the outer disk center is separated from the dark matter center by $\approx1$ kpc. The SMC collision produces a tilted-ring morphology for the simulated LMC, consistent with observations. Post-collision, the simulated bar's pattern speed decreases by a factor of two. Hence, observations of the LMC bar pattern speed should be interpreted with caution. We demonstrate that the SMC's torques on the LMC's bar during the collision are sufficient to explain the observed bar tilt, provided the SMC's total mass within 2 kpc was $(0.8-2.4) \times 10^9$ M$_\odot$. Therefore, the LMC bar's tilt constrains the SMC's pre-collision dark matter profile, and requires the SMC to be a dark matter-dominated galaxy.</description>

      <title>A JVLA, GMRT, and XMM study of Abell 795: Large-scale sloshing and a candidate radio phoenix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiwavelength analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 795 (z=0.1374), known for its extended (200 kpc) radio emission with a steep spectral index of unclear origin surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and for sloshing features observed by Chandra. We used new JVLA 1.5 GHz, archival GMRT 325 MHz, and XMM-Newton data to investigate the nature of the radio emission and the dynamical state of the intracluster medium. Our X-ray surface brightness analysis revealed an azimuthally asymmetric excess extending to 650 kpc from the center, possibly related to the sloshing spiral, although the existing data did not allow us to confirm the presence of a cold front. We also detected a previously unknown galaxy group located 1 Mpc northwest of the cluster. Its X-ray emission was well fitted by a $\beta$-model ($\beta$=0.52$\pm$0.17), and the spectral analysis revealed a thermal plasma temperature kT=1.08$\pm$0.08 keV and metallicity Z=0.13$\pm$0.06 Z$_{\odot}$. We investigated the possibility that this group acted as the perturber that triggered the sloshing in Abell 795, and we showed that the velocity distribution of member galaxies supports the dynamically unrelaxed nature of Abell 795. The analysis of JVLA 1.5 GHz and GMRT 325 MHz images confirmed the presence of extended radio emission with largest linear size 200 kpc, preferentially extended toward southwest and terminating in a sub-component ("SW blob"). We measured the spectral indices, finding $\alpha_{Ext}$=-2.24$\pm$0.13 for the diffuse extended emission, and $\alpha_{SWb}$=-2.10$\pm$0.13 for the SW blob. These ultra-steep spectral index values, coupled with the complex morphology and cospatiality with the radio-loud AGN present in the BCG, suggest that this emission could be classified as a radio phoenix, possibly arising from adiabatic compression of an ancient AGN radio lobe due to the presence of sloshing motions.</description>

      <title>Searching for correlations between satellite galaxy populations and the cold circumgalactic medium around TNG50 galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of satellites, a potentially important contributor towards the cold gas assembly of a halo, on the cold gas budgets of 197 TNG50 simulated halos with masses of 10$^{10.85}$ $\le$ M$_{200c}$/M$_{\odot}$ $\le$ 10$^{12.24}$ at $z$ = 0. To highlight the effect of satellites, we split the sample into three mass bins. We find that the total number of satellites, total mass of satellites, number of massive satellites and stellar mass of the most massive satellite, all correlate with the cold gas mass in halos. The total number of satellites (stellar mass of the most massive satellite) correlates most with the halo cold gas mass for low (middle) mass halos. The number of massive or observable satellites correlates with cold gas mass in similar manner as the total number of satellites. Our findings can, therefore, be used to guide future observers to focus on the link between the number of observable satellites and the amount of cold gas in a halo. Despite this correlation, we find that much of the cold gas lies far from the satellites. This leads us to conclude that satellites are unlikely to be the main supplier for cold gas in halos, however we discuss how they may act in tandem with other sources such that the satellite population correlates with the total cold gas in their host halo.</description>

      <title>Predictions for the Detectability of Milky Way Satellite Galaxies and Outer-Halo Star Clusters with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the sensitivity of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) to faint, resolved Milky Way satellite galaxies and outer-halo star clusters. We characterize the expected sensitivity using simulated LSST data from the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) Data Challenge 2 (DC2) accessed and analyzed with the Rubin Science Platform as part of the Rubin Early Science Program. We simulate resolved stellar populations of Milky Way satellite galaxies and outer-halo star clusters over a wide range of sizes, luminosities, and heliocentric distances, which are broadly consistent with expectations for the Milky Way satellite system. We inject simulated stars into the DC2 catalog with realistic photometric uncertainties and star/galaxy separation derived from the DC2 data itself. We assess the probability that each simulated system would be detected by LSST using a conventional isochrone matched-filter technique. We find that assuming perfect star/galaxy separation enables the detection of resolved stellar systems with $M_V$ = 0 mag and $r_{1/2}$ = 10 pc with &gt;50% efficiency out to a heliocentric distance of ~250 kpc. Similar detection efficiency is possible with a simple star/galaxy separation criterion based on measured quantities, although the false positive rate is higher due to leakage of background galaxies into the stellar sample. When assuming perfect star/galaxy classification and a model for the galaxy-halo connection fit to current data, we predict that 89 +/- 20 Milky Way satellite galaxies will be detectable with a simple matched-filter algorithm applied to the LSST wide-fast-deep data set. Different assumptions about the performance of star/galaxy classification efficiency can decrease this estimate by ~75-25%, which emphasizes the importance of high-quality star/galaxy separation for studies of the Milky Way satellite population with LSST.</description>

      <title>Gas-phase formation routes of dimethyl sulfide in the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Dimethyl sulfide (DMS; CH$_3$SCH$_3$) is an organosulfur compound that has been suggested as a potential biosignature in exoplanetary atmospheres. In addition to its tentative detections toward the sub-Neptune planet K2-18b, DMS has been detected in the coma of the 67/P comet and toward the galactic center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. However, its formation routes have not been characterized yet.
  Aims: In this work, we have investigated three gas-phase reactions (CH$_3$SH + CH$_3$OH$_2^+$, CH$_3$OH + CH$_3$SH$_2^+$, and the CH$_3$ + CH$_3$S radiative association), aiming at characterizing DMS formation routes in shocked molecular clouds and star-forming regions.
  Methods: We have performed dedicated quantum and kinetics calculations to evaluate the reaction rate coefficients as a function of temperature to be included in astrochemical models.
  Results: Among the investigated processes, the reaction between methanethiol (CH$_3$SH) and protonated methanol (CH$_3$OH$_2^+$)(possibly followed by a gentle proton transfer to ammonia) is a compelling candidate to explain the formation of DMS in the galactic center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. The CH$_3$ + CH$_3$S radiative association does not seem to be a very efficient process, with the exclusion of cold clouds, provided that the thiomethoxy radical (CH$_3$S) is available.
  This work does not deal directly with the possible formation of DMS in the atmosphere of exoplanets. However, it clearly indicates that there are efficient abiotic formation routes of this interesting species.</description>

      <title>Environmental Dependence of X-Ray Emission From The Least Massive Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-mass end of low-mass galaxies is largely unexplored in AGN studies, but it is essential for extending our understanding of the black hole-galaxy coevolution. We surveyed the 3D-HST catalog and collected a sample of 546 dwarf galaxies with stellar masses log(M$_*$/\(M_\odot\))$&lt;$8.7, residing in the GOODS-South deep field. We then used the unprecedented depth of Chandra available in the GOODS-South field to search for AGN. We carefully investigated the factors that could play roles in the AGN detectability, such as Chandra's point-spread function and the redshift- and off-axis-dependent detection limits. We identified 16 X-ray sources that are likely associated with AGN activity. Next, we evaluated the environment density of each galaxy by computing tidal indices. We uncovered a dramatic impact of the environment on AGN triggering as dwarfs from high-density environments showed an AGN fraction of 22.5\%, while the median stellar mass of this subset of dwarfs is only log(M$_*$/\(M_\odot\))=8.1. In contrast, the low-density environment dwarfs showed an AGN fraction of only 1.4\%, in line with typically reported values from the literature. This highlights the fact that massive central black holes are ubiquitous even at the lowest mass scales and demonstrates the importance of the environment in triggering black hole accretion, as well as the necessity for deep X-ray data and proper evaluation of the X-ray data quality. Alternatively, even if the detected X-ray sources are related to stellar mass accretors rather than AGN, the environmental dependence persists, signaling the impact of the environment on galaxy evolution and star formation processes at the lowest mass scales. Additionally, we stacked the X-ray images of non-detected galaxies from high- and low-density environments, revealing similar trends.</description>

      <title>$R_{\rm e}$. II. Understanding (IC 3475)-type galaxy, aka ultra-diffuse galaxy, structural scaling relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is explained why ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), a subset of (IC 3475)-type galaxies, do not have unexpectedly large sizes but large sizes that are in line with expectations from the curved size-luminosity relation defined by brighter early-type galaxies (ETGs). UDGs extend the faint end of the (absolute magnitude, $\mathfrak{M}$)-log(S\'ersic index, $n$) and $\mathfrak{M}$-(central surface brightness, $\mu_{\rm 0}$) relations defined by ETGs, leading to the large effective half-light radii, $R_{\rm e}$, in UDGs. It is detailed how the scatter in $\mu_{\rm 0}$, at a given $\mathfrak{M}$, relates to variations in the galaxies' values of $n$ and effective surface brightness, $\mu_{\rm e}$. These variations map into changes in $R_{\rm e}$ and produce the scatter about the $\mathfrak{M}$-$R_{\rm e}$ relation at fixed $\mathfrak{M}$. Similarly, the scatter in $\mathfrak{M}$, at fixed $\mu_{\rm 0}$ and $n$, can be mapped into changes in $R_{\rm e}$. The increased scatter about the faint end of the $\mathfrak{M}$-$R_{\rm e}$ relation and the smaller scatter about $\mathfrak{M}$-(isophotal radii, $R_{\rm iso}$) relations are explained. Artificial and potentially misleading size-luminosity relations for UDGs are also addressed. The suggestion that there may be two types of UDG appears ill-founded, arising from the scatter about the $\mathfrak{M}$-$\mu_{\rm 0}$ relation, which persists at all magnitudes. Hopefully, the understanding presented here will prove helpful for interpreting the many low surface brightness galaxies that the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will detect.</description>

      <title>Identification of quasars variable over long time scales from infrared surveys. Ensemble variability and structure function properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasars are variable and their variability can both constrain their physical properties and help to identify them. We look for ways to efficiently identify quasars exhibiting consistent variability over multi-year time-scales, based on a small number of epochs. Using infrared (IR) is desirable to avoid bias against reddened objects. We compare the apparent brightness of known quasars that have been observed with two IR surveys, covering up to a twenty-year baseline: the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS; 1997-2001) and the VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS; 2009-2017). We look at the previous studies of the selected variable quasars to see if their variable behaviour is known and when available we use multi-epoch monitoring with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to obtain a measure of optical variability of individual objects. We build a sample of ~2500 quasars that show statistically significant variability between the 2MASS and VHS. About 1500 of these come from the new Quaia sample based on Gaia spectra and about 1/3 of these have hardly been studied. The Quaia sample constitutes the main product of this work. Based on ensemble variability and structure function analysis we demonstrate that the selected objects in our sample are representative of the typical quasar population and show behaviour, consistent with other quasar samples. Our analysis strengthens previous results, for example that variability decreases with the rest-frame wavelength and that it exhibits peaks for certain absolute magnitudes of the quasars. Similarly, the structure function shows an increase in variability for rest-frame time lags below ~1500 d and a decrease for longer lags, just like in previous studies. Our selection, even though it is based on two epochs only, seems to be surprisingly robust, showing up to ~11% contamination by quasars that show stable non-variable behaviour in ZTF.</description>

      <title>The Galactic inner spiral arms revealed by the Gaia ESO Survey chemical abundances. Metallicity and [Mg/Fe] ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observational advances, such as Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec, have highlighted the potential of chemical abundances in tracing and revealing the structure of spiral arms. Building on these studies, we aim to trace the Milky Way's inner spiral arms using chemical abundance data from the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES). By mapping over-densities in [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe], we seek to identify spiral arms in both radial and vertical planes, detect substructures, and compare our results with recent Galactic chemical evolution models. We used chemical abundance data from the Gaia-ESO Survey to create spatial maps of [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe] excess across the Galactic inner disc. We compared our results with the spiral arm models proposed by Spitoni et al. (2023) and Barbillon et al. (2024). For the first time, the inner spiral arms were revealed using chemical abundance patterns. We detected [Fe/H] enhancements and [Mg/Fe] under-abundances that consistently trace the Scutum and Sagittarius arms. A connecting spur between these arms is observed in the [Mg/H] plane. The alignment between our observations and the results of our 2D chemical evolution models reinforces the significance of spiral arm transits in driving both azimuthal and radial variations in chemical abundances. Our results confirm that spiral arms can be traced using stellar chemical abundances with GES data, providing a new perspective on the structure of the inner Galaxy. The consistency between enhanced [Fe/H] and lower [Mg/Fe] ratios, as observed in previous studies, further strengthens the reliability of our findings. The observed spur, bifurcation, and vertical substructures align well with recent models and studies, indicating that chemical maps can significantly contribute to our understanding of Galactic spiral arms.</description>

      <title>The Glow of Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter: (III) The Mysteries of the Milky Way UV Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion quark nuggets (AQNs) are hypothetical objects with nuclear density that would have formed during the quark-hadron transition and could make up most of the dark matter today. These objects have a mass greater than a few grams and are sub-micrometer in size. They would also help explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry and the similarity between visible and dark components of the universe, i.e. $\Omega_{\text{DM}} \sim \Omega_{\text{visible}}$. These composite objects behave as cold dark matter, interacting with ordinary matter and producing pervasive electromagnetic radiation. This work aims to calculate the FUV electromagnetic signature in a 1 kpc region surrounding the solar system, resulting from the interaction between antimatter AQNs and baryons. To this end, we use the high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation of the Milky Way, FIRE-2 Latter suite, to select solar system-like regions. From the simulated gas and dark matter distributions in these regions, we calculate the FUV background radiation generated by the AQN model. We find that the results are consistent with the FUV excess recently confirmed by the Alice spectrograph aboard New Horizons, which corroborated the FUV excess initially discovered by GALEX a decade ago. We also discuss the potential cosmological implications of our work, which suggest the existence of a new source of FUV radiation in galaxies, linked to the interaction between dark matter and baryons.</description>

      <title>Bracketing the soliton-halo relation of ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In theories of ultralight dark matter, solitons form in the inner regions of galactic halos. The observational implications of these depend on the soliton mass. Various relations between the mass of the soliton and properties of the halo have been proposed. We analyze the implications of these relations, and test them with a suite of numerical simulations. The relation of Schive et al. 2014 is equivalent to $(E/M)_{\rm sol}=(E/M)_{\rm halo}$ where $E_{\rm sol (halo)}$ and $M_{\rm sol (halo)}$ are the energy and mass of the soliton (halo). If the halo is approximately virialized, this relation is parametrically similar to the evaporation/growth threshold of Chan et al. 2022, and it thus gives a rough lower bound on the soliton mass. A different relation has been proposed by Mocz et al. 2017, which is equivalent to $E_{\rm sol}=E_{\rm halo}$, so is an upper bound on the soliton mass provided the halo energy can be estimated reliably. Our simulations provide evidence for this picture, and are in broad consistency with the literature, in particular after accounting for ambiguities in the definition of $E_{\rm halo}$ at finite volume.</description>

      <title>Multiobjective optimization for scattering mitigation and scattering screen reconstruction in VLBI observations of the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging reconstruction of interferometric data is a hard ill-posed inverse problem. Its difficulty is increased when observing the Galactic Center, which is obscured by a scattering screen. This is because the scattering breaks the one-to-one correspondence between images and visibilities. Solving the scattering problem is one of the biggest challenges in radio imaging of the Galactic Center. In this work we present a novel strategy to mitigate its effect and constrain the screen itself using multiobjective optimization. We exploit the potential of evolutionary algorithms to describe the optimization landscape to recover the intrinsic source structure and the scattering screen affecting the data. We successfully recover both the screen and the source in a wide range of simulated cases, including the speed of a moving screen at 230 GHz. Particularly, we can recover a ring structure in scattered data at 86 GHz. Our analysis demonstrates the huge potential that recent advancements in imaging and optimization algorithms offer to recover image structures, even in weakly constrained and degenerated, possibly multi-modal settings. The successful reconstruction of the scattering screen opens the window to event horizon scale works on the Galactic Center at 86G Hz up to 116 GHz, and the study of the scattering screen itself.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Binaries in Ultralight Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight (or fuzzy) dark matter (ULDM) is an alternative to cold dark matter. A key feature of ULDM is the presence of solitonic cores at the centers of collapsed halos. These would potentially increase the drag experienced by supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, changing their merger dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave background. We perform detailed simulations of high-mass SMBH binaries in the soliton of a massive halo. We find more rapid decay than previous simulations and semi-analytic approximations. We confirm expectations that the drag depends strongly on the ULDM particle mass, finding masses greater than $10^{-21}$ eV could potentially alleviate the final parsec problem and that ULDM may even suppress gravitational wave production at lower frequencies in the pulsar timing band.</description>

      <title>MHD Simulations Preliminarily Predict The Habitability and Radio Emission of TRAPPIST-1e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the closest Earth-like exoplanet within the habitable zone of the M-dwarf star TRAPPIST-1, TRAPPIST-1e exhibits a magnetic field topology that is dependent on space weather conditions. Variations in these conditions influence its habitability and contribute to its radio emissions. Our objective is to analyze the response of different terrestrial magnetosphere structures of TRAPPIST-1e to various space weather conditions, including events analogous to coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We assess its habitability by computing the magnetopause standoff distance and predict the resulting radio emissions using scaling laws. This study provides some priors for future radio observations. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the TRAPPIST-1e system using the PLUTO code in spherical coordinates. Our analysis indicates that the predicted habitability and radio emission of TRAPPIST-1e strongly depend on the planet's magnetic field intensity and magnetic axis inclination. Within sub-Alfvenic, super-Alfvenic, and transitional stellar wind regimes, the radio emission intensity positively correlates with both planetary magnetic field strength and axial tilt, while planetary habitability, quantified by the magnetopause standoff distance, shows a positive correlation with magnetic field strength and a negative correlation with magnetic axis tilt...</description>

      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): Bayesian inference of natal kicks from inert black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The emerging population of inert black hole binaries (BHBs) provides a unique opportunity to constrain black hole (BH) formation physics. These systems are composed of a stellar-mass BH in a wide orbit around a non-degenerate star with no observed Xray emission. Inert BHBs allow for narrow constraints to be inferred on the natal kick and mass loss during BH-forming core-collapse events. Aims. In anticipation of the upcoming BLOeM survey, we aim to provide tight constraints on BH natal kicks by exploiting the full parameter space obtained from combined spectroscopic and astrometric data to characterize the orbits of inert BHBs. Multi-epoch spectroscopy from the BLOeM project will provide measurements of periods, eccentricities, and radial velocities for inert BHBs in the SMC, which complements Gaia astrometric observations of proper motions. Methods. We present a Bayesian parameter estimation framework to infer natal kicks and mass loss during core-collapse from inert BHBs, accounting for all available observables, including the systemic velocity and its orientation relative to the orbital plane. The framework further allows for circumstances when some of the observables are unavailable, such as for the distant BLOeM sources which preclude resolved orbits. Results. With our new framework, we are able to distinguish between BH formation channels, even in the absence of a resolved orbit. In cases when the pre-explosion orbit can be assumed to be circular, we precisely recover the parameters of the core-collapse, highlighting the importance of understanding the eccentricity landscape of pre-explosion binaries, both theoretically and observationally. Treating the near-circular, inert BHB, VFTS 243, as a representative of the anticipated BLOeM systems, we constrain the natal kick to less than 27 km/s and the mass loss to less than 2.9 Msun within a 90% credible interval.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Zoom: Multi-scale GRMHD Modeling of Black Hole Accretion and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a ``cyclic zoom'' method to capture the dynamics of accretion flows onto black holes across a vast range of spatial and temporal scales in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. In this method, we cyclically zoom out (derefine) and zoom in (refine) the simulation domain while using a central mask region containing a careful treatment of the coarsened fluid variables to preserve the small-scale physics, particularly the magnetic field dynamics. The method can accelerate GRMHD simulations by $\gtrsim 10^5$ times for problems with large scale separation. We demonstrate the validity of the technique using a series of tests, including spherically symmetric Bondi accretion, the Blandford-Znajek monopole, magnetized turbulent Bondi accretion, accretion of a magnetized rotating torus, and the long-term evolution of an accreting torus about both Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. As applications, we simulate Bondi and rotating torus accretion onto black holes from galactic scales, covering an extremely large dynamic range. In Bondi accretion, the accretion rate is suppressed relative to the Bondi rate by $\sim(10r_\mathrm{g}/r_\mathrm{B})^{1/2}$ with a feedback power of $\sim 0.01 \dot{M} c^2$ for vanishing spin, and $\sim 0.1 \dot{M} c^2$ for spin $a\approx0.9$. In the long-term evolution of a rotating torus, the accretion rate decreases with time as $\dot{M}\propto t^{-2}$ on timescales much longer than the viscous timescale, demonstrating that our method can capture not only quasi-steady problems but also secular evolution. Our new method likewise holds significant promise for applications to many other problems that need to cover vast spatial and temporal scales.</description>

      <title>On the age distribution of Classical Cepheids in the Galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06228v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of the positive correlation between age and Galactocentric distance seen in Galactic Classical Cepheids, which at first sight may seem counter-intuitive in the context of inside-out galaxy formation. To explain it, we use the Besan\c{c}on Galaxy Model and a simulation of star particles in the Galactic disc coupled with stellar evolutionary models. We then select Classical Cepheids from this simulation and test in qualitative terms which ingredients are necessary to find agreement with the observational data. We show that the interplay of the Galactic disc's metallicity gradient and the metallicity dependence of the Cepheids' life-time in the instability strip results in a pronounced positive age-Galactocentric distance relation. This renders a reconstruction of the recent star-formation history based on Classical Cepheids unrealistic. It also has important consequences on our interpretation of the observed scatter about the radial metallicity gradient measured with Galactic Classical Cepheids.</description>

      <title>Newly Discovered Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei from SDSS and LAMOST Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei (CL AGNs) exhibit drastic variations in broad emission lines (BELs), the mechanism of which remains unclear. Expanding the sample of CL AGNs is helpful to reveal the mechanism. This study aims to identify more CL AGNs by cross-matching spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). Our approach to identify CL AGNs is based on the automatic spectral fitting, followed by detailed visual inspections. We identify a sample of $51$ CL AGNs through this method, in which $40$ CL AGNs are newly discovered. Within this sample, $41$ CL AGNs primarily show the variability of the H$\beta$ line, nine exhibit obvious changes in both the H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ lines, and one source mainly displays variations in the H$\alpha$ line. Our findings reveal that the sequence of appearance and disappearance of the BELs aligns with the known CL sequence. In addition, we identify 31 candidates exhibiting drastic variations in BELs without accompanying significant photometric variability. We estimate the black hole mass and Eddington ratio for all sources, which range from $2.5\times 10^6$ to $8.0\times 10^8 M_\odot$ and from $0.001$ to $0.13$, respectively. Similar to other studies, we also find that the Eddington ratios of CL AGNs and candidates are lower than those of typical AGNs. Our results support the hypothesis that the CL behavior is driven by the state transitions of the accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Globular cluster ages and their relation to high-redshift stellar cluster formation times from different globular cluster models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation details of globular clusters (GCs) are still poorly understood due to their old ages and the lack of detailed observations of their formation. A large variety of models for the formation and evolution of GCs have been created to improve our understanding of their origins, based on GC properties observed at z=0. We present the first side-by-side comparison of six current GC formation models with respect to their predictions for the GC ages and formation redshifts in Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies. We find that all the models are capable of forming most of the surviving GCs at more than 10 Gyr ago, in general agreement with the observation that most GCs are old. However, the measured MW GC ages are still systematically older than those predicted in the galaxies of four of the models. Investigating the variation of modelled GC age distributions for general MW-mass galaxies, we find that some of the models predict that a significant fraction of MW-mass galaxies would entirely lack a GC population older than 10 Gyr, whereas others predict that all MW-mass galaxies have a significant fraction of old GCs. This will have to be further tested in upcoming surveys, as systems without old GCs in that mass range are currently not known. Finally, we show that the models predict different formation redshifts for the oldest surviving GCs, highlighting that models currently disagree about whether the recently observed young star clusters at high redshifts could be the progenitors of today's GCs.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Wave Bias Parameter from Angular Power Spectra: Bridging Between Galaxies and Binary Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents the modeling of the gravitational wave (GW) bias parameter by bridging a connection between simulated GW sources and galaxies in low redshift galaxy surveys 2MPZ and WISExSCOS (WISC). We study this connection by creating a mock GW catalog, populating galaxy surveys with binary black holes (BBHs) for different scenarios of the GW host-galaxy probability as a function of the galaxy stellar mass. We probe the observable consequences of this connection by exploring the spatial clustering of the GW sources in terms of the GW bias parameter. We consider a phenomenological broken power law model for the host-galaxy probability function, with a potential turnover $M_{K}$ at high stellar mass ($10^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$ in the fiducial model) where the star formation efficiency begins to drop. We vary the parameters of the GW host-galaxy probability function and find that generically the GW bias increases as $M_{K}$ increases (and gets suppressed as $M_{K}$ decreases). The change in the GW bias parameter shows a maximum change of about $30\%$ for different scenarios explored in this work in comparison to the galaxy bias. Future measurements of the GW bias can help constrain $M_{K}$ and the slopes of the host-galaxy probability function and thus offer insights into the underlying astrophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Constraining Schwarzschild Models with Orbit Classifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple orbit classification constraint extension to stellar dynamical modeling using Schwarzschild's method is demonstrated. The classification scheme used is the existing `orbit circularity' scheme (lambda_z) where orbits are split into four groups - hot, warm, cold and counter rotating orbits. Other schemes which can be related to the orbit weights are expected to be viable as well. The results show that the classification constraint works well in modeling. However, given that orbits in external galaxies are not observable, it is not clear how the orbit classification for any particular galaxy may be determined. Perhaps range constraints for different types of galaxies determined from cosmological simulations may offer a way forward.</description>

      <title>Dwarf Galaxies in the TNG50 Field: connecting their Star-formation Rates with their Environments</title>

Abstract: The dwarf galaxies comparable to the LMC and SMC, with stellar masses $7.5 &lt;{\rm log}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})&lt;9.5$, are found in a diversity of environments and have long quenching timescales. We need to understand how this phenomenon is connected to the dwarfs' halo properties and their locations in the large-scale structure of the universe. We study the star-formation rates of dwarfs in the TNG50 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project across different environments, focusing on field dwarfs in host halos with virial masses of $9 &lt; {\rm log}(M_{200}/M_{\odot}) &lt; 11.5$, in contrast to dwarf satellites in hosts with ${\rm log}(M_{200}/M_{\odot}) \geq 11.5$. Our field dwarf sample is heterogeneous, consisting of primary (central) galaxies, with smaller numbers of secondaries and dwarf galaxies that are on backsplash orbits around massive galaxies. We study how the quenched fraction and star-formation histories depend on the dwarfs' large-scale environment and find that only $\sim 1\%$ of the most isolated dwarfs are quenched. The vast majority of the quenched field dwarfs are backsplash dwarfs located in the neighborhood of cluster-scale halos. We discover a two-halo galactic conformity signal that arises from the tendency of the quenched dwarfs, particularly the backsplash sample, to have a quenched massive galaxy as a neighbor. We attribute the low quenched fractions of the simulated LMC/SMC analogs in the field to the locations of their low-mass hosts in the sparse large-scale environment, which predominate over the relatively small number of backsplash and quenched primary dwarfs in denser environments.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots are Tidal Disruption Events in Runaway-Collapsing Clusters</title>

Abstract: I hypothesize a physical explanation for the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The first star formation in the universe occurs in dense clusters, some of which may undergo runaway collapse and form an intermediate mass black hole. This process would appear as a very dense stellar system, with recurring tidal disruption events (TDEs) as stellar material is accreted by the black hole. Such a system would be compact, UV-emitting, and exhibit broad H-alpha emission. If runaway collapse is the primary mechanism for forming massive black hole seeds, this process could be fairly common and explain the large volume densities of LRDs. In order to match the predicted number density of runaway collapse clusters, the tidal disruption rate must be on the order of 10^-4 per year. A top-heavy stellar initial mass function may be required to match observations without exceeding the predicted LambdaCDM mass function. The TDE LRD hypothesis can be verified with followup JWST observations looking for TDE-like variability.</description>

      <title>Probing Signals of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Core Collapse in HI-Rich Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze rotation curves of five HI-rich galaxies recently discovered with MeerKAT. These galaxies exhibit sharply rising rotation curves, while their baryonic components are not dynamically dominant, suggesting that their dark matter halos have high inner densities. When fitting the standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo model, four galaxies require extremely high halo concentrations, exceeding the cosmological median by $5\sigma$. In contrast, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos in the core-collapse phase naturally account for the high densities in these galaxies. For halos with masses around $10^{11}~{\rm M_\odot}$, those in cosmic filaments exhibit concentrations consistent with the cosmological average, while halos in cosmic nodes show relatively higher concentrations that align with the SIDM fits but remain insufficient for the NFW fits. Our analysis indicates that these HI-rich galaxies may have formed in cosmic nodes of dark matter with significant self-interactions.</description>

      <title>Systematic Bias in Ionizing Radiation Escape Fraction Measurements from Foreground Large-Scale Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the Lyman-alpha (Lya) forest transmission in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the environmental density of galaxies, focusing on its implications for the measurement of ionizing radiation escape fractions. Using a sample of 268 spectroscopically confirmed background galaxies at 2.7&lt;z&lt;3.0 and a galaxy density map at z~2.5 within the COSMOS field, we measure the Lya transmission photometrically, leveraging the multiwavelength data available from the COSMOS2020 catalog. Our results reveal a weak but statistically significant positive correlation between Lya optical depth and galaxy density contrast, suggesting that overdense regions are enriched in neutral gas, which could bias escape fraction measurements. This emphasizes the need to account for the large-scale structure of the IGM in analyses of ionizing radiation escape fractions, and highlights the advantages of a photometric approach for increasing the number of sampled lines of sight across large fields. The photometric redshifts provided by upcoming all-sky surveys, such as Euclid, will make it possible to account for this effect across widely separated fields.</description>

      <title>Double-peaked Ca II traces a relativistic broad-line region disk in NGC 4593</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double-peaked emission lines are observed in a small percentage of active galactic nuclei (AGN). These lines allow the determination of properties of the line-emitting region, known as the broad-line region (BLR). We investigated the structure and kinematics of the BLR in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4593 through an analysis of the NIR line blend of Ca II 8498, 8542, 8662, and O I 8446 observed in a 2019 VLT/MUSE spectrum. We performed a detailed decomposition of the near-infrared Ca II triplet and O I 8446 blend, extracting clean profiles of Ca II 8498, 8542, 8662 and O I 8446. We then fitted Ca 8662 with a relativistic elliptical line-emitting disk model. The line profiles are double-peaked with a FWHM of approx. 3700 km/s and exhibit a redward asymmetry with a red-to-blue peak ratio of 4:3. The Ca II triplet lines have an intensity ratio of 1:1:1 and show no evidence of a central narrow or intermediate-width component. The profiles of Ca II and O I are remarkably similar, suggesting a common region of origin. Given the 1:1:1 ratio of the Ca II triplet, this region is likely a high-density emission zone, and the Ca II 8662 profile is well described by a mildly eccentric, low-inclination relativistic disk with minimal internal turbulence. The profile represents one of the clearest kinematic signatures of a relativistic disk observed in BLR emission lines to date. The double-peaked profiles of the NIR Ca II triplet and O I 8446 in NGC 4593 represent the first detection of double-peaked Ca II and O I 8446 in a non-transient AGN spectrum. The minimal intrinsic turbulence (the lowest value reported for an AGN emission line to date) and absence of narrow or intermediate-width components in Ca II 8662 make it a powerful diagnostic tool of BLR structure and kinematics. Further investigations of the profiles of Ca II and O I in other AGN are recommended to better constrain BLR properties.</description>
