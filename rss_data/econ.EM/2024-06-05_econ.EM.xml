      <title>A sequential test procedure for the choice of the number of regimes in multivariate nonlinear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a sequential test procedure for determining the number of regimes in nonlinear multivariate autoregressive models. The procedure relies on linearity and no additional nonlinearity tests for both multivariate smooth transition and threshold autoregressive models. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the finite-sample properties of the proposed test in small samples. Our findings indicate that the test exhibits satisfactory size properties, with the rescaled version of the Lagrange Multiplier test statistics demonstrating the best performance in most simulation settings. The sequential procedure is also applied to two empirical cases, the US monthly interest rates and Icelandic river flows. In both cases, the detected number of regimes aligns well with the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Enabling Decision-Making with the Modified Causal Forest: Policy Trees for Treatment Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision-making plays a pivotal role in shaping outcomes in various disciplines, such as medicine, economics, and business. This paper provides guidance to practitioners on how to implement a decision tree designed to address treatment assignment policies using an interpretable and non-parametric algorithm. Our Policy Tree is motivated on the method proposed by Zhou, Athey, and Wager (2023), distinguishing itself for the policy score calculation, incorporating constraints, and handling categorical and continuous variables. We demonstrate the usage of the Policy Tree for multiple, discrete treatments on data sets from different fields. The Policy Tree is available in Python's open-source package mcf (Modified Causal Forest).</description>

      <title>The Impact of Acquisition on Product Quality in the Console Gaming Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The console gaming industry, a dominant force in the global entertainment sector, has witnessed a wave of consolidation in recent years, epitomized by Microsoft's high-profile acquisitions of Activision Blizzard and Zenimax. This study investigates the repercussions of such mergers on consumer welfare and innovation within the gaming landscape, focusing on product quality as a key metric. Through a comprehensive analysis employing a difference-in-difference model, the research evaluates the effects of acquisition on game review ratings, drawing from a dataset comprising over 16,000 console games released between 2000 and 2023. The research addresses key assumptions underlying the difference-in-difference methodology, including parallel trends and spillover effects, to ensure the robustness of the findings. The DID results suggest a positive and statistically significant impact of acquisition on game review ratings, when controlling for genre and release year. The study contributes to the literature by offering empirical evidence on the direct consequences of industry consolidation on consumer welfare and competition dynamics within the gaming sector.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of the Neyman Allocation with Small Pilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04643v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Neyman Allocation is used in many papers on experimental design, which typically assume that researchers have access to large pilot studies. This may be unrealistic. To understand the properties of the Neyman Allocation with small pilots, we study its behavior in an asymptotic framework that takes pilot size to be fixed even as the size of the main wave tends to infinity. Our analysis shows that the Neyman Allocation can lead to estimates of the ATE with higher asymptotic variance than with (non-adaptive) balanced randomization. In particular, this happens when the outcome variable is relatively homoskedastic with respect to treatment status or when it exhibits high kurtosis. We provide a series of empirical examples showing that such situations can arise in practice. Our results suggest that researchers with small pilots should not use the Neyman Allocation if they believe that outcomes are homoskedastic or heavy-tailed. Finally, we examine some potential methods for improving the finite sample performance of the FNA via simulations.</description>

      <title>Changes-in-Changes for Ordered Choice Models: Too Many "False Zeros"?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a Difference-in-Differences model for discrete, ordered outcomes, building upon elements from a continuous Changes-in-Changes model. We focus on outcomes derived from self-reported survey data eliciting socially undesirable, illegal, or stigmatized behaviors like tax evasion, substance abuse, or domestic violence, where too many "false zeros", or more broadly, underreporting are likely. We provide characterizations for distributional parallel trends, a concept central to our approach, within a general threshold-crossing model framework. In cases where outcomes are assumed to be reported correctly, we propose a framework for identifying and estimating treatment effects across the entire distribution. This framework is then extended to modeling underreported outcomes, allowing the reporting decision to depend on treatment status. A simulation study documents the finite sample performance of the estimators. Applying our methodology, we investigate the impact of recreational marijuana legalization for adults in several U.S. states on the short-term consumption behavior of 8th-grade high-school students. The results indicate small, but significant increases in consumption probabilities at each level. These effects are further amplified upon accounting for misreporting.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Structural Breaks in Factor Models for Macroeconomic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through a routine normalization of the factor variance, standard methods for estimating factor models in macroeconomics do not distinguish between breaks of the factor variance and factor loadings. We argue that it is important to distinguish between structural breaks in the factor variance and loadings within factor models commonly employed in macroeconomics as both can lead to markedly different interpretations when viewed via the lens of the underlying dynamic factor model. We then develop a projection-based decomposition that leads to two standard and easy-to-implement Wald tests to disentangle structural breaks in the factor variance and factor loadings. Applying our procedure to U.S. macroeconomic data, we find evidence of both types of breaks associated with the Great Moderation and the Great Recession. Through our projection-based decomposition, we estimate that the Great Moderation is associated with an over 60% reduction in the total factor variance, highlighting the relevance of disentangling breaks in the factor structure.</description>
