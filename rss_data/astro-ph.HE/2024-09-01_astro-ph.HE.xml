      <title>The cosmic rate of Pair-Instability Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) have crucial implications for many astrophysical topics, including the search for very massive stars, the black hole mass spectrum, and galaxy chemical enrichment. To this end, we need to understand where PISNe are across cosmic time, and what are their favourable galactic environments. We present a new determination of the PISN rate as a function of redshift, obtained by combining up-to-date stellar evolution tracks from the PARSEC and FRANEC codes, with an up-to-date semi-empirical determination of the star formation rate and metallicity evolution of star-forming galaxies throughout cosmic history. We find the PISN rate to exhibit a huge dependence on the model assumptions, including the criterion to identify stars unstable to pair production, and the upper limit of the stellar initial mass function. Remarkably, the interplay between the maximum metallicity at which stars explode as PISNe, and the dispersion of the galaxy metallicity distribution, dominates the uncertainties, causing a $\sim$ seven-orders-of-magnitude PISN rate range. Furthermore, we show a comparison with the core-collapse supernova rate, and study the properties of the favourable PISN host galaxies. According to our results, the main contribution to the PISN rate comes from metallicities between $\sim 10^{-3}$ and $10^{-2}$, against the common assumption that views very-low-metallicity, Population III stars as exclusive or dominant PISN progenitors. The strong dependencies we find offer the opportunity to constrain stellar and galaxy evolution models based on possible future (or the lack of) PISN observations.</description>

      <title>A neural network emulator of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo selection function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization of search selection effects comprises a core element of gravitational-wave data analysis. Knowledge of selection effects is needed to predict observational prospects for future surveys and is essential in the statistical inference of astrophysical source populations from observed catalogs of compact binary mergers. Although gravitational-wave selection functions can be directly measured via injection campaigns -- the insertion and attempted recovery of simulated signals added to real instrumental data -- such efforts are computationally expensive. Moreover, the inability to interpolate between discrete injections limits the ability to which we can study narrow or discontinuous features in the compact binary population. For this reason, there is a growing need for alternative representations of gravitational-wave selection functions that are computationally cheap to evaluate and can be computed across a continuous range of compact binary parameters. In this paper, we describe one such representation. Using pipeline injections performed during Advanced LIGO &amp; Advanced Virgo's third observing run (O3), we train a neural network emulator for $P(\mathrm{det}|\theta)$, the probability that given a compact binary with parameters is successfully detected, averaged over the course of O3. The emulator captures the dependence of $P(\mathrm{det}|\theta)$ on binary masses, spins, distance, sky position, and orbital orientation, and it is valid for compact binaries with components masses between $1$--$100\,M_\odot$. We test the emulator's ability to produce accurate distributions of detectable events, and demonstrate its use in hierarchical inference of the binary black hole population.</description>

      <title>Maven: A Multimodal Foundation Model for Supernova Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common setting in astronomy is the availability of a small number of high-quality observations, and larger amounts of either lower-quality observations or synthetic data from simplified models. Time-domain astrophysics is a canonical example of this imbalance, with the number of supernovae observed photometrically outpacing the number observed spectroscopically by multiple orders of magnitude. At the same time, no data-driven models exist to understand these photometric and spectroscopic observables in a common context. Contrastive learning objectives, which have grown in popularity for aligning distinct data modalities in a shared embedding space, provide a potential solution to extract information from these modalities. We present Maven, the first foundation model for supernova science. To construct Maven, we first pre-train our model to align photometry and spectroscopy from 0.5M synthetic supernovae using a constrastive objective. We then fine-tune the model on 4,702 observed supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility. Maven reaches state-of-the-art performance on both classification and redshift estimation, despite the embeddings not being explicitly optimized for these tasks. Through ablation studies, we show that pre-training with synthetic data improves overall performance. In the upcoming era of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, Maven serves as a Rosetta Stone for leveraging large, unlabeled and multimodal time-domain datasets.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulations of Super-Eddington Accretion Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, we summarize recent progress on the properties of accretion disks when the accretion rate exceeds the so-called Eddington limit based on multi-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We first summarize the classical models that are used to describe the accretion disks in the super-Eddington regime with an emphasis on the key uncertainties in these models. Then we show that radiation-driven outflows are ubiquitously found by numerical simulations of super-Eddington accretion disks. Some key physical processes on energy transport inside the disk are also identified by numerical simulations. Radiative and mechanical output as a function of mass accretion rates, black hole mass, spin, and magnetic field topology are summarized. Applications of super-Eddington accretion disks to different astrophysical systems, particularly tidal disruption events, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>On the Cosmic Variance of the Merger Rate Density of Binary Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic variance on the star formation history may lead to bias to the merger rate density estimation of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers by the compact binary population synthesis. In this paper, we take the advantage of the large boxsize of the Millennium Simulation combined with the semi-analytic galaxy formation model GABE, and the parameterized population binary star evolution (BSE) model to examine how much effect will the cosmic variance introduce on the estimation of merger rate density of BNS mergers. We find that for sub-box size of $100\rm Mpc$ and $200\rm Mpc$, the variance of merger rate density $\sigma_{\rm R}/\rm R$ at different redshift is about $23\%-35\%$ and $13\%-20\%$ respectively. On one hand, as for the variance of the detection rate on BNS mergers with current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detector network, this value is very small $\lesssim 10\%$, which indicates ignoring the cosmic variance is reasonable for estimating the merger rate density from current LVK observation. On the other hand, with next-generation gravitational wave detectors, it is possible to localize BNS mergers within sub-boxes possessing length of $\rm 40 Mpc$ for source redshift $z_{s}&lt;0.2$. In such a small box, the cosmic variance of the merger rate density is significant, i.e., the value of $\sigma_{\rm R}/\rm R$ is about $\sim 55\%$. This hints that estimating the merger rate density of BNS in different sky areas may provide useful information on the cosmic variance.</description>

      <title>The bicoherence analysis of type C quasi-periodic oscillations in Swift J1727.8-1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of bicoherence analysis for Swift J1727.8-1613 during its 2023 outburst, using data from Insight-HXMT. Our analysis focused on observations with quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of frequencies greater than 1 Hz, revealing that all of them belong to type C QPOs. We found a strong correlation between the QPO frequency and the hardness ratio, as well as a linear relationship between the QPO RMS and the hardness ratio. The bicoherence analysis revealed a transition from a "web" pattern to a "hypotenuse" pattern in the LE and HE energy bands. In the bicoherence patterns, there are correlations between horizontal and vertical bicoherence at $f_1=f_2=f_{\rm QPO}$ with count rates. The diagonal structure at $f_1+f_2=f_{\rm QPO}$ becomes more prominent with increasing energy. Additionally, we discovered a new bicoherence pattern in the medium energy band from 10 -- 20 keV, the diagonal structure at $f_1+f_2=f_{\rm har}$ is prominent only in this energy band, which we refer to as the "parallel" pattern. The bicoherence analysis indicates that the source is likely a low-inclination source.</description>

      <title>The size of accretion disks from self-consistent X-ray spectra + UV/optical/NIR photometry fitting: applications to ASASSN-14li and HLX-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a standard thin disk model with the outer disk radius ($R_{\rm out}$) as a free parameter, integrating it into standard X-ray fitting package to enable self-consistent and simultaneous fitting of X-ray spectra and UV/optical/NIR photometry. We apply the model to the late-time data ($\Delta t \approx 350-1300$ days) of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14li. We show that at these late-times the multi-wavelength emission of the source can be fully described by a bare compact accretion disk. We obtain a black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) of $7^{+3}_{-2}\times10^{6} M_{\odot}$, consistent with host-galaxy scaling relations; and an $R_{\rm out}$ of $45 \pm 13 \, R_{\rm g}$, consistent with the circularization radius, with possible expansion at the latest epoch. We discuss how simplistic models, such as a single-temperature blackbody fitted to either X-ray spectra or UV/optical photometry, lead to erroneous interpretations on the scale/energetics of TDE emission. We also apply the model to the soft/high state of the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) candidate HLX-1. The model fits the full spectral energy distribution (from X-rays to NIR) without needing an additional stellar population component. We investigate how relativistic effects improve our results by implementing a version of the model with full ray tracing calculations in the Kerr metric. For HLX-1, we find $M_{\rm BH} = 4^{+3}_{-1} \times 10^{4} M_{\odot}$ and $R_{\rm out} \approx {\rm few} \times 10^{3} \, R_{\rm g}$, in agreement with previous findings. The relativistic model can constrain the inclination ($i$) of HLX-1 to be $20^o \leq i \leq 70^o$.</description>

      <title>Back from the dead: AT2019aalc as a candidate repeating TDE in an AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. To date, three nuclear transients have been associated with high-energy neutrino events. These transients are generally thought to be powered by tidal disruptions of stars (TDEs) by massive black holes. However, AT2019aalc, hosted in a Seyfert-1 galaxy, was not yet classified due to a lack of multiwavelength observations. Interestingly, the source has re-brightened 4 years after its discovery. Aims. We aim to classify the transient and explain the mechanism responsible for its second optical flare. Methods. We conducted a multi-wavelength monitoring program (from radio to X-rays) of AT2019aalc during its re-brightening in 2023. Results. The observations revealed a uniquely bright UV counterpart and multiple X-ray flares during the second optical flaring episode of the transient. The second flare, similarly to the first one, is also accompanied by IR dust echo emission. A long-term radio flare is found with an inverted spectrum. Optical spectroscopic observations reveal the presence of Bowen Fluorescence lines and strong high-ionization coronal lines indicating an extreme level of ionization in the system. Conclusions. The results suggest that the transient can be classified as a Bowen Fluorescence Flare (BFF), a relatively new sub-class of flaring active galactic nuclei (AGN). AT2019aalc can be also classified as an extreme coronal line emitter (ECLE). We found that, in addition to AT2019aalc, another BFF AT2021loi is spatially coincident with a high-energy neutrino event. The multi-wavelength properties of these transients suggest a possible connection between ECLEs, BFFs and TDEs in AGN.</description>

      <title>Two of a Kind: Comparing big and small black holes in binaries with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When modeling the population of merging binary black holes, analyses have generally focused on characterizing the distribution of primary (i.e. more massive) black holes in the binary, while simplistic prescriptions are used for the distribution of secondary masses. However, the secondary mass distribution and its relationship to the primary mass distribution provide a fundamental observational constraint on the formation history of coalescing binary black holes. If both black holes experience similar stellar evolutionary processes prior to collapse, as might be expected in dynamical formation channels, the primary and secondary mass distributions would show similar features. If they follow distinct evolutionary pathways (for example, due to binary interactions that break symmetry between the initially more massive and less massive star), their mass distributions may differ. We present the first analysis of the binary black hole population that explicitly fits for the secondary mass distribution. We find that the data is consistent with a $\sim30\,M_{\odot}$ peak existing only in the distribution of \emph{secondary} rather than primary masses. This would have major implications for our understanding of the formation of these binaries. Alternatively, the data is consistent with the peak existing in both component mass distributions, a possibility not included in most other previous studies. In either case, the peak is observed at $31.4_{-2.6}^{+2.3}\,M_{\odot}$, which is shifted lower than the value obtained in previous analyses of the marginal primary mass distribution, placing this feature in further tension with expectations from a pulsational pair-instability supernova pileup.</description>

Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which a large class of relativistic generalizations of Braginskii's magnetohydrodynamics with shear, bulk, and heat diffusion effects is causal and strongly hyperbolic in the fully nonlinear regime in curved spacetime. We find that causality severely constrains the size of nonideal effects and the onset of kinetic instabilities. Our results are crucial for assessing the regime of validity of fluid dynamical simulations of plasmas near supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Diversity in Fermi/GBM Gamma Ray Bursts: New insights from Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classification of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been a long-standing puzzle in high-energy astrophysics. Recent observations challenge the traditional short vs. long viewpoint, where long GRBs are thought to originate from the collapse of massive stars and short GRBs from compact binary mergers. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been instrumental in addressing this problem, revealing five distinct GRB groups within the Swift/BAT light curve data, two of which are associated with kilonovae (KNe). In this work, we extend our analysis to the Fermi/GBM catalog and identify five clusters using unsupervised ML techniques, consistent with the Swift/BAT results. These five clusters are well separated in fluence-duration plane, hinting at a potential link between fluence, duration and complexities (or structures) in the light curves of GRBs. Further, we confirm two distinct classes of KN-associated GRBs. The presence of GRB 170817A in one of the two KNe-associated clusters lends evidence to the hypothesis that this class of GRBs could potentially be produced by binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The second KN-associated GRB cluster could potentially originate from NS-BH mergers. Future multimessenger observations of compact binaries in gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic waves can be paramount in understanding these clusters better.</description>

      <title>Search for MeV Gamma-ray emission from TeV bright red dwarfs with COMPTEL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SHALON atmospheric Cherenkov telescope has detected very high energy gamma-ray emission at TeV energies from eight red dwarfs, namely, V388 Cas, V547 Cas, V780 Tau, V962 Tau, V1589 Cyg, GJ 1078, GJ 3684 and GL 851.1. Consequently, these red dwarfs have been suggested as sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. In this work, we search for soft gamma-ray emission from these TeV bright red dwarfs between 0.75-30 MeV using archival data from the COMPTEL gamma-ray imaging telescope, as a follow-up to a similar search for GeV gamma-ray emission using the Fermi-LAT telescope. Although, prima-facie, we detect non-zero photon flux from three red dwarfs with high significance, these signals can attributed to contamination from nearby sources such as Crab and Cygnus, which are within the angular resolution of COMPTEL, and have been previously detected as very bright point sources at MeV energies. Therefore, we could not detect any statistically significant signal ($&gt;3\sigma$) from any of these eight red dwarfs from 0.75-30 MeV. We then report the 95% confidence level upper limits on the differential photon flux (at 30 MeV), integral photon flux and integral energy flux for all of the eight red dwarfs. The integral energy flux limits range between $10^{-11}-10^{-10} \rm{ergs/cm^2/s}$.</description>

These systems are typically modeled as a distributionally-forced Teukolsky equation, where the smaller black hole is treated as a Dirac delta distribution. Time-domain solvers often use regularization approaches that approximate the Dirac distribution that often introduce small length scales and are a source of systematic error, especially near the smaller black hole. We describe a multi-domain discontinuous Galerkin method for solving the distributionally-forced Teukolsky equation that describes scalar fields evolving on a Kerr spacetime. To handle the Dirac delta, we expand the solution in spherical harmonics and recast the sourced Teukolsky equation as a first-order, one-dimensional symmetric hyperbolic system. This allows us to derive the method's numerical flux to correctly account for the Dirac delta. As a result, our method achieves global spectral accuracy even at the source's location. To connect the near field to future null infinity, we use the hyperboloidal layer method, allowing us to supply outer boundary conditions and providing direct access to the far-field waveform. We document several numerical experiments where we test our method, including convergence tests against exact solutions, energy luminosities for circular orbits, the scheme's superconvergence properties at future null infinity, and the late-time tail behavior of the scalar field. We also compare two systems that arise from different choices of the first-order reduction variables, finding that certain choices are numerically problematic in practice. The methods developed here may be beneficial when computing gravitational self-force effects, where the regularization procedure has been developed for the spherical harmonic modes and high accuracy is needed at the Dirac delta's location.</description>

      <title>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) Collaboration -- Contributions to the 38th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00120</link>

Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is an envisioned observatory of ultra-high-energy particles of cosmic origin, with energies in excess of 100 PeV. GRAND uses large surface arrays of autonomous radio-detection units to look for the radio emission from extensive air showers that are triggered by the interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos in the atmosphere or underground. In particular, for ultra-high-energy neutrinos, the future final phase of GRAND aims to be sensitive enough to discover them in spite of their plausibly tiny flux. Presently, three prototype GRAND radio arrays are in operation: GRANDProto300, in China, GRAND@Auger, in Argentina, and GRAND@Nancay, in France. Their goals are to field-test the design of the radio-detection units, understand the radio background to which they are exposed, and develop tools for diagnostic, data gathering, and data analysis. This list of contributions to the 38th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2023) presents an overview of GRAND, in its present and future incarnations, and a look at the first data collected by GRANDProto13, the first phase of GRANDProto300.</description>

      <title>Ringdowns for black holes with scalar hair: the large mass case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deviations from General Relativity can alter the quasi-normal mode (QNM) ringdown of perturbed black holes. It is known that a shift-symmetric (hence massless) scalar can only introduce black hole hair if it couples to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, in which case the scalar charge is fixed with respect to the black hole mass and controlled by the strength of that coupling. The charge per unit mass decreases with the mass and can, therefore, be used as a perturbative parameter for black holes that are sufficiently large with respect to the scale suppressing the deviation from General Relativity or the Standard model. We construct an effective field theory scheme for QNMs using this perturbative parameter to capture deviations from Kerr for both the background and the perturbations. We demonstrate that up to second order in the charge per unit mass, QNMs can be calculated by solving standard linearised perturbation equations for the Kerr metric with sources depending on solutions of the same equations up to first order. It follows that corrections to the QNM frequencies are heavily suppressed for sufficiently massive black holes, meaning that LISA is very unlikely to detect any evidence of scalar hair in ringdown signals.</description>

      <title>Gravothermal Catastrophe in Resonant Self-interacting Dark Matter Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model featuring a velocity-dependent cross section with an order-of-magnitude resonant enhancement of the cross section at $\sim 16\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$. To understand the implications for the structure of dark matter halos, we perform N-body simulations of isolated dark matter halos of mass $\sim 10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot$, a halo mass selected to have a maximum response to the resonance. We track the core formation and the gravothermal collapse phases of the dark matter halo in this model and compare the halo evolving with the resonant cross section with halos evolving with velocity-independent cross sections. We show that dark matter halo evolution with the resonant cross section exhibits a deviation from universality that characterizes halo evolution with velocity-independent cross sections. The halo evolving under the influence of the resonance reaches a lower minimum central density during core formation. It subsequently takes about $20\%$ longer to reach its initial central density during the collapse phase. These results motivate a more detailed exploration of halo evolution in models with pronounced resonances.</description>

      <title>Beyond Earthly Limits: Protection against Cosmic Radiation through Biological Response Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The upcoming phase of space exploration not only includes trips to Mars and beyond, but also holds great promise for human progress. However, the harm caused by cosmic radiation, consisting of Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events, is an important safety concern for astronauts and other living things that will accompany them. Research exploring the biological effects of cosmic radiation includes experiments conducted in space itself and in simulated space environments on Earth. Notably, NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory has taken significant steps forward in simulating cosmic radiation by using particle accelerators and is currently pioneering the progress in this field. Curiously, much of the research emphasis thus far has been on understanding how cosmic radiation impacts living organisms, instead of finding ways to help them resist the radiation. In this paper, we briefly talk about current research on the biological effects of cosmic radiation and propose possible protective measures through biological interventions. In our opinion, biological response pathways responsible for coping with stressors on Earth can provide effective solutions for protection against the stress caused by cosmic radiation. We also recommend establishing the Dedicated International Accelerator Laboratory for Space Travel related radiation research (DIAL-ST) to advance this field and evaluate protective biological pathways through particle accelerator experiments simulating cosmic radiation.</description>

      <title>Pulsar timing array sensitivity to anisotropies in the gravitational wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations have recently gathered substantial evidence for the existence of a gravitational wave background in the nHz frequency band. Searching for anisotropies in this signal is key to determining its origin, and in particular to distinguish possible astrophysical from cosmological sources. In this work, we assess the sensitivity of current and future pulsar timing arrays to such anisotropies using the full covariance matrix of pulsar timing delays. While current day pulsar timing arrays can only set mildly informative constraints on the dipole and quadrupole, we show that percent level accuracy for several low multipoles can be achieved in the near future. Moreover, we demonstrate that anisotropies in the gravitational wave background and the Hellings-Downs angular correlation, indicating the presence of GWs, are approximately uncorrelated, and can hence be reconstructed independently. These results can be reproduced with \href{https://github.com/Mauropieroni/fastPTA}{\texttt{fastPTA}}, a publicly available Python code to forecast the constraining power of PTA configurations.</description>

      <title>Shocking and Mass Loss of Compact Donor Stars in Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs accreting from a binary companion. Following the explosion, the surviving donor star leaves at roughly its orbital velocity. The discovery of the runaway helium subdwarf star US 708, and seven hypervelocity stars from Gaia data, all with spatial velocities $\gtrsim 900$ km/s, strongly support a scenario in which the donor is a low-mass helium star, or a white dwarf. Motivated by these discoveries, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the $\texttt{Athena++}$ code modeling the hydrodynamical interaction between a helium star or helium white dwarf, and the supernova ejecta. We find that $\approx 0.01-0.02\,M_{\odot}$ of donor material is stripped, and explain the location of the stripped material within the expanding supernova ejecta. We continue the post-explosion evolution of the shocked donor stars with the $\texttt{MESA}$ code. As a result of entropy deposition, they remain luminous and expanded for $\approx 10^{5}-10^{6}$ yrs. We show that the post-explosion properties of our helium white dwarf donor agree reasonably with one of the best-studied hypervelocity stars, D6-2.</description>
