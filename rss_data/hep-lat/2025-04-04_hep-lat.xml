      <title>The temperature dependence of fractional topological charge objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for defining the topological charge contained within distinct topological objects in the nontrivial ground-state fields of SU(N) lattice gauge theory. Such an analysis has been called for by the growing number of models for Yang-Mills topological structure which propose the existence of fractionally charged objects. This investigation is performed for SU(3) at a range of temperatures across the deconfinement phase transition, providing an assessment of how the topological structure evolves with temperature. This reveals a connection between the topological charge and holonomy of the system which must be satisfied by finite-temperature models of Yang-Mills vacuum structure. We find a promising consistency with the instanton-dyon model for SU(N) vacuum structure.</description>

      <title>Heavy meson lightcone distribution amplitudes from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightcone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) within the framework of heavy quark effective theory (HQET) play a crucial role in the theoretical description of weak decays of heavy bottom mesons. However, the first-principle determination of HQET LCDAs faces significant theoretical challenges. In this presentation, we introduce a practical approach to address these obstacles. This makes sequential use of effective field theories. Leveraging the newly-generated lattice ensembles, we present a pioneering lattice calculation, offering new insights into LCDAs for heavy mesons. Additionally, we discuss the impact of these results on the heavy-to-light form factors and briefly give potential future directions in this field.</description>

      <title>Complex Langevin Simulations of Supersymmetric Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review explores the Complex Langevin Method (CLM), a stochastic quantization technique designed to address the sign problem in quantum field theories with complex actions. Beginning with foundational principles, the review examines the applications of CLM across a range of models, including zero- and two-dimensional systems, supersymmetric quantum mechanics, and the IKKT matrix model, a candidate for non-perturbative string theory. Key advancements, such as stabilization techniques and mass deformations, are highlighted as solutions to challenges like numerical instability and singular drift terms. The review emphasizes the capacity of CLM to simulate complex systems and reveal non-perturbative phenomena, positioning it as a powerful tool for exploring quantum field theory and string theory. Future directions, including higher-dimensional applications and benchmarking against quantum simulations, underscore the potential of CLM to advance both theoretical understanding and computational methodologies.</description>

      <title>Hadronic vacuum polarization for the muon $g-2$ from lattice QCD: Complete short and intermediate windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present complete results for the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_\mu$ in the short- and intermediate-distance window regions, which account for roughly 10% and 35% of the total HVP contribution to $a_\mu$, respectively. In particular, we perform lattice-QCD calculations for the isospin-symmetric connected and disconnected contributions, as well as corrections due to strong isospin-breaking. For the short-distance window observables, we investigate the so-called log-enhancement effects as well as the significant oscillations associated with staggered quarks in this region. For the dominant, isospin-symmetric light-quark connected contribution, we obtain $a^{ll,\,{\mathrm{SD}}}_{\mu}(\mathrm{conn.}) = 48.139(11)_{\mathrm{stat}}(91)_{\mathrm{syst}}[92]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$ and $a^{ll,\,{\mathrm{W}}}_{\mu}(\mathrm{conn.}) = 206.90(14)_{\mathrm{stat}}(61)_{\mathrm{syst}}[63]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$. We use Bayesian model averaging to fully estimate the covariance matrix between the individual contributions. Our determinations of the complete window contributions are $a^{{\mathrm{SD}}}_{\mu} = 69.05(1)_{\mathrm{stat}}(21)_{\mathrm{syst}}[21]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$ and $a^{{\mathrm{W}}}_{\mu} = 236.45(14)_{\mathrm{stat}}(83)_{\mathrm{syst}}[85]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$. This work is part of our ongoing effort to compute all contributions to HVP with an overall uncertainty at the few permille level.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on entanglement entropy without twin copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09935v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of estimating experimentally the von Neumann entanglement entropy $S_{A}^{vN}$ of a symmetric bi-partite quantum system $AB$ by using the basic measurement counts (bitstrings) for a $single$ copy of a prepared state. Using exact diagonalization and analog simulations performed with the publicly available QuEra facilities for chains and ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the Shannon entropy $S_{AB}^X$ associated with the bitstrings of adiabatically prepared ground states and the reduced entropies $S_A^X$ and $S_B^X$ obtained from the marginal probabilities in $A$ and $B$. We then calculate the classical mutual information $I^X_{AB}=S_A^X+S_B^X-S_{AB}^X$, which is a lower bound on $S_{A}^{vN}$. We show that for a broad range of lattice spacing and detuning, $I^X_{AB}$ is typically 20 percent below $S_{A}^{vN}$ in regions where $S_{A}^{vN}$ is large and a less close bound in regions where $S_{A}^{vN}$ is low. We argue that this use of the easily available bitstrings provides a robust and efficient way to explore empirically the phase diagram of qubit-based quantum simulators and identify critical regions.</description>

      <title>Power counting of the pion-dilaton effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confining QCD-like theories close to the conformal window have a ``walking'' coupling. This is believed to lead to a light singlet scalar meson in the low-energy spectrum, a dilaton, which is the pseudo Nambu--Goldstone boson for the approximate scale symmetry. Extending chiral perturbation theory to include the dilaton requires a new small parameter to control the dilaton mass and its interactions. In our previous work we derived a systematic power counting for the dilaton couplings by matching the effective low-energy theory to the underlying theory using mild assumptions. In this paper we examine two alternative power countings which were proposed in the literature based on a phenomenological picture for the conformal transition. We find that one of these power countings fails, in fact, to generate a systematic expansion; the other coincides with the power counting we derived. We also point out that the so-called $\Delta$-potential coincides with the tree-level potential of the former, invalid, power counting.</description>

      <title>Finite group gauge theory on graphs and gravity-like modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gauge theory with finite group $G$ on a graph $X$ using noncommutative differential geometry and Hopf algebra methods with $G$-valued holonomies replaced by gauge fields valued in a `finite group Lie algebra' subset of the group algebra $\C G$ corresponding to the complete graph differential structure on $G$. We show that this richer theory decomposes as a product over the nontrivial irreducible representations $\rho$ with dimension $d_\rho$ of certain noncommutative $U(d_\rho)$-Yang-Mills theories, which we introduce. The Yang-Mills action recovers the Wilson action for a lattice but now with additional terms. We compute the moduli space $\CA^\times / \CG$ of regular connections modulo gauge transformations on connected graphs $X$. For $G$ Abelian, this is given as expected by phases associated to fundamental loops but with additional $\R_{&gt;0}$-valued modes on every edge resembling the metric for quantum gravity models on graphs. For nonAbelian $G$, these modes become positive-matrix valued modes. We study the quantum gauge field theory in the Abelian case in a functional integral approach, particularly for $X$ the finite chain $A_{n+1}$, the $n$-gon $\Z_n$ and the single plaquette $\Z_2\times \Z_2$. We show that, in stark contrast to usual lattice gauge theory, the Lorentzian version is well-behaved, and we identify novel boundary vs bulk effects in the case of the finite chain. We also consider gauge fields valued in the finite-group Lie algebra corresponding to a general Cayley graph differential calculus on $G$, where we study an obstruction to closure of gauge transformations.</description>
