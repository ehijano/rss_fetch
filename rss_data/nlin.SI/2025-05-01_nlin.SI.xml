      <title>From NLS type matrix refactorisation problems to set-theoretical solutions of the 2- and 3-simplex equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for constructing hierarchies of solutions to $n$-simplex equations by variating the spectral parameter in their Lax representation. We use this method to derive new solutions to the set-theoretical 2- and 3-simplex equations which are related to the Adler map and Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) type equations. Moreover, we prove that some of the derived Yang--Baxter maps are completely integrable.</description>

      <title>Long-time asymptotics of the coupled nonlinear Sch\"odinger equation in a weighted Sobolev space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21315v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem for the focusing coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger (CNLS) equation with initial data $\mathbf{q}_0$ lying in the weighted Sobolev space and the scattering data having $n$ simple zeros. Based on the corresponding $3\times3$ matrix spectral problem, we deduce the Riemann-Hilbert problem (RHP) for CNLS equation through inverse scattering transform. We remove discrete spectrum of initial RHP using Darboux transformations. By applying the nonlinear steepest-descent method for RHP introduced by Deift and Zhou, we compute the long-time asymptotic expansion of the solution $\mathbf{q}(x,t)$ to an (optimal) residual error of order $\mathcal{O}\left(t^{-3 / 4+1/(2p)}\right)$ where $2\le p&lt;\infty$. The leading order term in this expansion is a multi-soliton whose parameters are modulated by soliton-soliton and soliton-radiation interactions. Our work strengthens and extends the earlier work regarding long-time asymptotics for solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a delta potential and even initial data by Deift and Park.</description>

      <title>Ultra-discretization of Yang-Baxter maps, probability distributions and independence preserving property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relationship between Yang-Baxter maps and the independence preserving (IP) property, motivated by their role in integrable systems, from the perspective of ultra-discretization. Yang-Baxter maps satisfy the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation, while the IP property ensures independence of transformed random variables. The relationship between these two seemingly unrelated properties has recently started to be studied in arXiv:0911.2895 . Ultra-discretization is a concept primarily used in the context of integrable systems and is an area of active research, serving as a method for exploring the connections between different integrable systems. However, there are few studies on how the stationary distribution for integrable systems changes through ultra-discretization. In this paper, we introduce the concept of ultra-discretization for probability distributions, and prove that the properties of being a Yang-Baxter map and having the IP property are both preserved under ultra-discretization. Applying this to quadrirational Yang-Baxter maps, we confirm that their ultra-discrete versions retain these properties, yielding new examples of piecewise linear maps having the IP property. We also explore implications of our results for stationary distributions of integrable systems and pose several open questions.</description>

      <title>Poncelet porism in singular cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Poncelet porism is usually studied for a pair of smooth conics that are in a general position. Here we discuss Poncelet porism in the real plane - affine or projective, when that is not the case, i.e. the conics have at least one point of tangency or at least one of the conics is not smooth. In all such cases, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an n-gon inscribed in one of the conics and circumscribed about the other.</description>

      <title>Quasi-classical expansion of a hyperbolic solution to the star-star relation and multicomponent 5-point difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quasi-classical expansion of a multicomponent spin solution of the star-star relation with hyperbolic Boltzmann weights is investigated. The equations obtained in a quasi-classical limit provide n-1-component extensions of certain scalar 5-point equations (corresponding to n=2) that were previously investigated by the author in the context of integrability and consistency of equations on face-centered cubics.</description>

      <title>Simple and exact nonlinear pendulum motion for all possible initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simple and formally exact solutions of nonlinear pendulum are derived for all three classes of motion: swinging, stopping, and spinning. Their unique simplicity should be useful in a theoretical development that requires trackable mathematical framework or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss nonlinear pendulum. A simple formula for the complete elliptical integral of the first kind is also proposed. It reproduces the exact analytical forms both in the zero and asymptotic limits, while in the midrange maintains average error of 0.06% and maximum error of 0.17%. The accuracy should be sufficient for typical engineering applications.</description>
