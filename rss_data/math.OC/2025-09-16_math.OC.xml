      <title>Wave Function Collapse Set Covering and the Hill Climbing Algorithm: A New, Fast Heuristic and Metaheuristic Pairing for the Minimum Set Cover Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new heuristic that focuses on the optimization problem for the Minimum Set Cover Problem. Our new heuristic involves using Wave Function Collapse and is called Wave Function Collapse Set Covering (WFC-SC). This algorithm goes through observation, propagation, and collapsing, which will be explained more later on in this paper. We optimize this algorithm to quickly find optimal coverings that are close to the minimum needed. To further optimize this algorithm, we pair it with the Hill Climbing metaheuristic to help WFC-SC find a better solution than its "local optimum." We benchmark our algorithm using the well known OR library from Brunel University against other proficient algorithms. We find that our algorithm has a better balance between both optimality and time.</description>

      <title>Randomized Feasibility-Update Algorithms for Stochastic Variational Inequality Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers stochastic monotone variational inequalities whose feasible region is the intersection of a (possibly infinite) number of convex functional level sets. A projection-based approach or direct Lagrangian-based techniques for such problems can be computationally expensive if not impossible to implement. To deal with the problem, we consider randomized methods that avoid the projection step on the whole constraint set by employing random feasibility updates. In particular, we propose and analyze modified stochastic Korpelevich and Popov methods for solving monotone stochastic VIs. We introduce a modified dual gap function and prove the convergence rates with respect to this function. We illustrate the performance of the methods in simulations on a zero-sum matrix game.</description>

      <title>An Optimization Framework for the Time-Dependent Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Shared Mobility: A Step Toward Smart Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to introduce a mathematical model to solve the time-dependent electric vehicles routing problem in shared travels. Shared mobility has gained significance recently due to its contribution to the alleviation of traffic congestion and air pollution. In this study, a MIP model has been developed and solved for a toy problem using the CPLEX solver to indicate the efficiency of shared mobility compared to private mode. We have considered practical constraints, such as considering the traffic congestion throughout the day by assigning a time-dependent step function to the network's links altering travel times in the peak and off-peak hours, nonlinear charging function, vehicles' queue at charging stations, partial charging possibility, different charging infrastructures, and passengers' desired timewindows, to make the results of the model more applicable in the real world. Among the important results of this presented model according to the solved example, we can mention the reduction of mileage per vehicle in personal mode from 56.42 km to 46.83 km in shared mode while the total travel time per vehicle has only increased slightly from 84.63 min/veh to 89.32 min/veh, respectively. This suggests that the typical problems related to private travel can be offset by shared travel without losing the comfort and convenience of the former.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Adaptive Air Transit Network with Modular Aerial Pods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive air transit network leveraging modular aerial pods and artificial intelligence (AI) to address urban mobility challenges. Passenger demand, forecasted from AI models, serves as input parameters for a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) optimization model that dynamically adjusts pod dispatch schedules and train lengths in response to demand variations. The results reveal a complex interplay of factors, including demand levels, headway bounds, train configurations, and fleet sizes, which collectively influence network performance and service quality. The proposed system demonstrates the importance of dynamic adjustments, where modularity mitigates capacity bottlenecks and improves operational efficiency. Additionally, the framework enhances energy efficiency and optimizes resource utilization through flexible and adaptive scheduling. This framework provides a foundation for a responsive and sustainable urban air mobility solution, supporting the shift from static planning to agile, data-driven operations.</description>

      <title>Exact alternative optima for nonlinear optimization problems defined with maximum component objective function constrained by the Sugeno-Weber fuzzy relational inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a latticized optimization problem with fuzzy relational inequality constraints where the feasible region is formed as the intersection of two inequality fuzzy systems and Sugeno-Weber family of t-norms is considered as fuzzy composition. Sugeno-Weber family of t-norms and t-conorms is one of the most applied one in various fuzzy modelling problems. This family of t-norms and t-conorms was suggested by Weber for modeling intersection and union of fuzzy sets. Also, the t-conorms were suggested as addition rules by Sugeno for so-called alpha-fuzzy measures. The resolution of the feasible region of the problem is firstly investigated when it is defined with max-Sugeno-Weber composition and a necessary and sufficient condition is presented for determining the feasibility. Then, based on some theoretical properties of the problem, an algorithm is presented for solving this nonlinear problem. It is proved that the algorithm can find the exact optimal solution and an example is presented to illustrate the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Loss-aware distributionally robust optimization via trainable optimal transport ambiguity sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal-Transport Distributionally Robust Optimization (OT-DRO) robustifies data-driven decision-making under uncertainty by capturing the sampling-induced statistical error via optimal transport ambiguity sets. The standard OT-DRO pipeline consists of a two-step procedure, where the ambiguity set is first designed and subsequently embedded into the downstream OT-DRO problem. However, this separation between uncertainty quantification and optimization might result in excessive conservatism. We introduce an end-to-end pipeline to automatically learn decision-focused ambiguity sets for OT-DRO problems, where the loss function informs the shape of the optimal transport ambiguity set, leading to less conservative yet distributionally robust decisions. We formulate the learning problem as a bilevel optimization program and solve it via a hypergradient-based method. By leveraging the recently introduced nonsmooth conservative implicit function theorem, we establish convergence to a critical point of the bilevel problem. We present experiments validating our method on standard portfolio optimization and linear regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Differentiable by Design Nonlinear Optimization and its application to Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optimization-based policies have seen large success in recent years, primarily due to the incredible capabilities of nonlinear Model Predictive Control (nMPC). These policies require solving computationally demanding nonlinear optimization programs (NLP) online at each time-step. The solution map of these NLPs, viewed as a function of the measured state of the system and design parameters, may not be differentiable, which poses significant challenges if the policy is designed with a policy optimization scheme. In this paper, we propose a principled way to regularize NLPs to obtain a surrogate derivative even if the NLP is not differentiable. The surrogate problem is differentiable by design and its solution map coincides with the solution of the unregularized problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a free-final-time optimal control problem and a receding-horizon nonlinear MPC example.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis on the Ability of Particle Swarm Optimization to Escape from Local Optimum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the most prominent swarm intelligence algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been extensively applied to solve global optimization problems. The theoretical analysis on the ability of PSO to escape from local optimum (LO) is deeply intertwined with its global optimization performance, making it highly significant to investigate the underlying mechanisms that enable PSO to escape from LO and achieve global optimization. In this study, a rigorous mathematical analysis is presented to explore the ability and mechanisms of PSO to escape from LO. By modelling each search agent as a Markov chain, the probability of PSO escaping from LO within a finite number of iterations is calculated, and the behavior of agents prior to escaping from LO is analyzed. Through this theoretical analysis, two necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed to ensure that PSO escapes from LO in finite iterations with a probability 1: (a) the personal best (pbest) and global best (gbest) positions stagnate around different local optima, and (b) the inertial weight in PSO is equal to one. Upon these conditions, two potential behaviors of agents, namely inertial motion and oscillation, are proposed, and a state transition chain of the agent toward the global optimum is constructed. Additionally, the theoretical analysis reveals that increasing the distance between pbest and gbest, as well as the values of the learning factors in PSO, enhances the speed at which PSO escapes from LO. Finally, the conclusions drawn from the theoretical analysis are corroborated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Trust Region Algorithm for Stochastic Minimax Problems with Decision-Dependent Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic minimax optimization has drawn much attention over the past decade due to its broad applications in machine learning, signal processing and game theory. In some applications, the probability distribution of uncertainty depends on decision variables, as the environment may respond to decisions. In this paper, we propose a trust region algorithm for finding the stationary points of stochastic minimax problems with decision-dependent distributions. At each iteration, the algorithm locally learns the dependence of the random variable on the decision variable from data samples via linear regression, and updates the decision variable by solving trust-region subproblem with the learned distribution. When the objective function is nonconvex--strongly concave and the distribution map follows a regression model, we prove the almost sure convergence of the iterates to a stationary point of the primal function. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is further demonstrated through numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets.</description>

      <title>Consensus-Based Optimization Beyond Finite-Time Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a zeroth-order particle algorithm for the global optimization of a non-convex function, focusing on a variant of Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) with small but fixed noise intensity. Unlike most previous studies restricted to finite horizons, we investigate its long-time behavior with fixed parameters. In the mean-field limit, a quantitative Laplace principle shows exponential convergence to a neighborhood of the minimizer x * . For finitely many particles, a block-wise analysis yields explicit error bounds: individual particles achieve long-time consistency near x * , and the global best particle converge to x * . The proof technique combines a quantitative Laplace principle with block-wise control of Wasserstein distances, avoiding the exponential blow-up typical of Gr{\"o}nwall-based estimates.</description>

      <title>A Dantzig-Wolfe Reformulation for Automated Aircraft Arrival Routing and Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing aircraft arrival routes in a terminal maneuvering area (TMA) together with an automated scheduling of all the arrivals within a given time interval. The arrival routes are modeled as energy-efficient continuous-descent operations, such that separation based on wake-turbulence categories is guaranteed within the TMA. We propose a new model based on a Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation of a previous model for this problem. As in the previous model, we include tree consistency across consecutive planning intervals. However, the reformulation enables us to further improve the model and also consider aircraft that remain in the TMA from the previous period, a feature critical for operational safety. In computational experiments for Stockholm Arlanda airport, the new model consistently outperforms the previous one: we obtain solutions within 5 seconds to 12.65 minutes compared to 40.9 hours with the old model for instances of half hours with high traffic. In addition, we are able to solve instances of a full hour of arriving aircraft with high traffic (33 aircraft) within 22.22 to 58.57 minutes, whereas the old model could not solve these instances at all. While we schedule all aircraft as continuous-descent arrivals, our model can be applied to any type of speed profiles for the arriving aircraft.</description>

      <title>Event-triggered robust control of linear systems: Sliding mode cone method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the global robust stabilization of linear time-invariant systems by using event-triggered sliding mode control (SMC). Different from the practical sliding mode band, which is commonly used in previous studies on event-triggered SMC, a new concept of ideal sliding mode cone is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we design a hybrid event-triggering mechanism that takes into account both the size and direction shift of the error state. The proposed event-triggered SMC law is shown to enforce and sustain the system state in the ideal sliding mode cone. Moreover, the state of the closed-loop system can asymptotically converge to the equilibrium point, rather than merely to a neighborhood of it, which is usually difficult to handle by using practical sliding mode band. Technically speaking, to achieve strong convergence, the triggering frequency should naturally be as high as possible due to the existence of the external disturbances, but this will also increase the communication load. Hence, to balance the asymptotic convergence and frequent triggering near the equilibrium point that is the price paid for achieving asymptotic stability, we extend the obtained results to the case of practical sliding mode cone. In addition, it is verified that the ETM is global, namely, the inter-event times are uniformly lower bounded from zero globally. Further, a practical application for the quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles is presented. Finally, three illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Cardinality-Constrained Bilevel Capacity Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a fundamental problem in transportation and operations research, the bilevel capacity expansion problem (BCEP) has been extensively studied for decades. In practice, BCEPs are commonly addressed in two stages: first, pre-select a small set of links for expansion; then, optimize their capacities. However, this sequential and separable approach can lead to suboptimal solutions as it neglects the critical interdependence between link selection and capacity allocation. In this paper, we propose to introduce a cardinality constraint into the BCEP to limit the number of expansion locations rather than fixing such locations beforehand. This allows us to search over all possible link combinations within the prescribed limit, thereby enabling the joint optimization of both expansion locations and capacity levels. The resulting cardinality-constrained BCEP (CCBCEP) is computationally challenging due to the combination of a nonconvex equilibrium constraint and a nonconvex and discontinuous cardinality constraint. To address this challenge, we develop a penalized difference-of-convex (DC) approach that transforms the original problem into a sequence of tractable subproblems by exploiting its inherent DC structure and the special properties of the cardinality constraint. We prove that the method converges to approximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solutions with arbitrarily prescribed accuracy. Numerical experiments further show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms alternative methods for identifying practically feasible expansion plans investing only a few links, both in solution quality and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Rich Vehicle Routing Problem with diverse Vertices allowing Hierarchical and Multimodal Time-Dependant Transhipment of multiple Node- Vehicle- compatible Cargo with Cascaded Time-Minimization Objective for Emergency Decision Support Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rich vehicle routing problem is considered allowing multiple trips of heterogeneous vehicles stationed at distributed vehicle depots spread across diverse geographies having access to different modes of transportation. The problem arises from the real world requirement of optimizing the disaster response/preparedness time and minimizes the route duration of the vehicles to achieve the solution with the minimum highest-vehicle-route-duration. Multiple diversely-functional vertices are considered including the concept of Transhipment Ports as inter-modal resource transfer stations. Both simultaneous and split pickup and transferring of different types of delivery and pickup cargo is considered, along with Vehicle-Cargo and Transhipment Port-Cargo Compatibility. The superiority of the proposed cascaded minimization approach is shown over existing makespan minimization approaches through the developed MILP formulation. To solve the problem quickly for practical implementation within Disaster Management-specific Decision Support Systems, an extensive Heuristic Algorithm is devised. The Heuristic utilizes Decision Tree based structuring of possible routes and is able to inherently consider the compatibility issues. Preferential generation of small route elements are performed, which are integrated into route clusters; we consider multiple different logical integration approaches, as well as shuffling the logics to simultaneously produce multiple independent solutions. Finally perturbation of the different solutions are done to find better neighbouring solutions. The computational performance of the PSR-GIP Heuristic, on our created novel datasets, indicate that it is able to give good solutions swiftly for practical problems involving large integer instances which the MILP is unable to solve.</description>

      <title>Finite-Agent Stochastic Differential Games on Large Graphs: II. Graph-Based Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel neural network architecture, called Non-Trainable Modification (NTM), for computing Nash equilibria in stochastic differential games (SDGs) on graphs. These games model a broad class of graph-structured multi-agent systems arising in finance, robotics, energy, and social dynamics, where agents interact locally under uncertainty. The NTM architecture imposes a graph-guided sparsification on feedforward neural networks, embedding fixed, non-trainable components aligned with the underlying graph topology. This design enhances interpretability and stability, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters in large-scale, sparse settings. We theoretically establish a universal approximation property for NTM in static games on graphs and numerically validate its expressivity and robustness through supervised learning tasks. Building on this foundation, we incorporate NTM into two state-of-the-art game solvers, Direct Parameterization and Deep BSDE, yielding their sparse variants (NTM-DP and NTM-DBSDE). Numerical experiments on three SDGs across various graph structures demonstrate that NTM-based methods achieve performance comparable to their fully trainable counterparts, while offering improved computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Myopic Optimality: why reinforcement learning portfolio management strategies lose money</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Myopic optimization (MO) outperforms reinforcement learning (RL) in portfolio management: RL yields lower or negative returns, higher variance, larger costs, heavier CVaR, lower profitability, and greater model risk. We model execution/liquidation frictions with mark-to-market accounting. Using Malliavin calculus (Clark-Ocone/BEL), we derive policy gradients and risk shadow price, unifying HJB and KKT. This gives dual gap and convergence results: geometric MO vs. RL floors. We quantify phantom profit in RL via Malliavin policy-gradient contamination analysis and define a control-affects-dynamics (CAD) premium of RL indicating plausibly positive.</description>

      <title>Wave maps from circle to Riemannian manifold: global controllability is equivalent to homotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study wave maps from the circle to a general compact Riemannian manifold. We prove that the global controllability of this geometric equation is characterized precisely by the homotopy class of the data. As a remarkable intermediate result, we establish uniform-time global controllability between steady states, providing a partial answer to an open problem raised by Dehman, Lebeau and Zuazua (2003). Finally, we obtain quantitative exponential stability around closed geodesics with negative sectional curvature. This work highlights the rich interplay between partial differential equations, differential geometry, and control theory.</description>

      <title>Ellipsoidal partitions for improved multi-stage robust model predictive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ellipsoidal tube-based model predictive control methods effectively account for the propagation of the reachable set, typically employing linear feedback policies. In contrast, scenario-based approaches offer more flexibility in the feedback structure by considering different control actions for different branches of a scenario tree. However, they face challenges in ensuring rigorous guarantees. This work aims to integrate the strengths of both methodologies by enhancing ellipsoidal tube-based MPC with a scenario tree formulation. The uncertainty ellipsoids are partitioned by halfspaces such that each partitioned set can be controlled independently. The proposed ellipsoidal multi-stage approach is demonstrated in a human-robot system, highlighting its advantages in handling uncertainty while maintaining computational tractability.</description>

      <title>Efficient Compilation of Algorithms into Compact Linear Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear Programming (LP) is widely applied in industry and is a key component of various other mathematical problem-solving techniques. Recent work introduced an LP compiler translating polynomial-time, polynomial-space algorithms into polynomial-size LPs using intuitive high-level programming languages, offering a promising alternative to manually specifying each set of constraints through Algebraic Modeling Languages (AMLs). However, the resulting LPs, while polynomial in size, are often extremely large, posing challenges for existing LP solvers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating substantially smaller LPs from algorithms. Our goal is to establish minimum-size compact LP formulations for problems in P having natural formulations with exponential extension complexities. Our broader vision is to enable the systematic generation of Compact Integer Programming (CIP) formulations for problems with exponential-size IPs having polynomial-time separation oracles. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical linear pipelining technique that decomposes nested program structures into synchronized regions with well-defined execution transitions -- functions of compile-time parameters. This decomposition allows us to localize LP constraints and variables within each region, significantly reducing LP size without the loss of generality, ensuring the resulting LP remains valid for all inputs of size $n$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two benchmark problems -- the makespan problem, which has exponential extension complexity, and the weighted minimum spanning tree problem -- both of which have exponential-size natural LPs. Our results show up to a $25$-fold reduction in LP size and substantial improvements in solver performance across both commercial and non-commercial LP solvers.</description>

      <title>Optimal Annuitization with stochastic mortality: Piecewise Deterministic Mortality Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of determining the optimal time for an individual to convert retirement savings into a lifetime annuity. The individual invests their wealth into a dividend-paying fund that follows the dynamics of a geometric Brownian motion, exposing them to market risk. At the same time, they face an uncertain lifespan influenced by a stochastic mortality force. The latter is modelled as a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP), which captures sudden and unpredictable changes in the individual's mortality force. The individual aims to maximise expected lifetime linear utility from consumption and bequest, balancing market risk and longevity risk under an irreversible, all-or-nothing annuitization decision. The problem is formulated as a three-dimensional optimal stopping problem and, by exploiting the PDMP structure, it is reduced to a sequence of nested one-dimensional problems. We solve the optimal stopping problem and find a rich structure for the optimal annuitization rule, which cover all parameter specifications. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by a numerical example illustrating the impact of a single health shock on annuitization timing, along with a sensitivity analysis of key model parameters.</description>

      <title>Concentration inequalities for semidefinite least squares based on data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study data-driven least squares (LS) problems with semidefinite (SD) constraints and derive finite-sample guarantees on the spectrum of their optimal solutions when these constraints are relaxed. In particular, we provide a high confidence bound allowing one to solve a simpler program in place of the full SDLS problem, while ensuring that the eigenvalues of the resulting solution are $\varepsilon$-close of those enforced by the SD constraints. The developed certificate, which consistently shrinks as the number of data increases, turns out to be easy-to-compute, distribution-free, and only requires independent and identically distributed samples. Moreover, when the SDLS is used to learn an unknown quadratic function, we establish bounds on the error between a gradient descent iterate minimizing the surrogate cost obtained with no SD constraints and the true minimizer.</description>

      <title>Forward Euler for Wasserstein Gradient Flows: Breakdown and Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wasserstein gradient flows have become a central tool for optimization problems over probability measures. A natural numerical approach is forward-Euler time discretization. We show, however, that even in the simple case where the energy functional is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence against a smooth target density, forward-Euler can fail dramatically: the scheme does not converge to the gradient flow, despite the fact that the first variation $\nabla\frac{\delta F}{\delta\rho}$ remains formally well defined at every step. We identify the root cause as a loss of regularity induced by the discretization, and prove that a suitable regularization of the functional restores the necessary smoothness, making forward-Euler a viable solver that converges in discrete time to the global minimizer.</description>

      <title>An Inexact Proximal Linearized DC Algorithm with Provably Terminating Inner Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard approaches to difference-of-convex (DC) programs require exact solution to a convex subproblem at each iteration, which generally requires noiseless computation and infinite iterations of an inner iterative algorithm. To tackle these difficulties, inexact DC algorithms have been proposed, mostly by relaxing the convex subproblem to an approximate monotone inclusion problem. However, there is no guarantee that such relaxation can lead to a finitely terminating inner loop. In this paper, we point out the termination issue of existing inexact DC algorithms by presenting concrete counterexamples. Exploiting the notion of $\epsilon$-subdifferential, we propose a novel inexact proximal linearized DC algorithm termed tPLDCA. Despite permission to a great extent of inexactness in computation, tPLDCA enjoys the same convergence guarantees as exact DC algorithms. Most noticeably, the inner loop of tPLDCA is guaranteed to terminate in finite iterations as long as the inner iterative algorithm converges to a solution of the proximal point subproblem, which makes an essential difference from prior arts. In addition, by assuming the first convex component of the DC function to be pointwise maximum of finitely many convex smooth functions, we propose a computational friendly surrogate of $\epsilon$-subdifferential, whereby we develop a feasible implementation of tPLDCA. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed implementation of tPLDCA.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Derivative-free Constrained Optimization with a Mixed Penalty-Logarithmic Barrier Approach and Direct Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose the joint use of a mixed penalty-interior point method and direct search, for addressing nonlinearly constrained derivative-free optimization problems. A merit function is considered, wherein the set of nonlinear inequality constraints is divided into two groups: one treated with a logarithmic barrier approach, and another, along with the equality constraints, addressed using a penalization term. This strategy, is adapted and incorporated into a direct search method, enabling the effective handling of general nonlinear constraints. Convergence to KKT-stationary points is established under continuous differentiability assumptions, without requiring any kind of convexity. Using CUTEst test problems, numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and overall effectiveness of the proposed method, when compared with state-of-the-art solvers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04959v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an integer programming-based optimization framework designed to effectively address the complex final exam scheduling challenges encountered at Cornell University. With high flexibility, the framework is specifically tailored to accommodate a variety of different constraints, including the front-loading of large courses and the exclusion of specific time slots during the exam period. By generating multiple scheduling model variants and incorporating heuristic approaches, our framework enables comprehensive comparisons of different schedules. This empowers the University Registrar to make informed decisions, considering trade-offs in terms of schedule comfort measured by different levels of exam conflicts. Our results demonstrate significant advantage over the historical lecture time-based approach, providing time and effort savings for the university administration while enhancing student and faculty satisfaction.</description>

      <title>The robust isolated calmness of spectral norm regularized convex matrix optimization problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to provide a series of characterizations of the robust isolated calmness of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) mapping for spectral norm regularized convex optimization problems. By establishing the variational properties of the spectral norm function, we directly prove that the KKT mapping is isolated calm if and only if the strict Robinson constraint qualification (SRCQ) and the second order sufficient condition (SOSC) hold. Furthermore, we obtain the crucial result that the SRCQ for the primal problem and the SOSC for the dual problem are equivalent. The obtained results can derive more equivalent or sufficient conditions of the robust isolated calmness of the KKT mapping, thereby enriching the stability theory of spectral norm regularized optimization problems and enhancing the usability of isolated calmness in algorithm applications.</description>

      <title>Online Allocation of Throughput-Constrained Resources Using Proxy Assignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a variation of the canonical online resource allocation problem in which resources are throughput, rather than budget, constrained. As in the classical setting, the decision-maker must assign sequentially arriving jobs to one of multiple available resources. However, in addition to the assignment costs incurred from these decisions, the decision-maker is also penalized for deviating from exogenous, time-varying target assignment rates for each resource, which represent the resources' respective throughput capacities throughout the horizon. The goal is to minimize the total expected assignment and deviation penalty costs incurred throughout the horizon when the distribution of assignment costs is unknown. We first show that naive extensions of state-of-the-art algorithms for classical budget-constrained resource allocation problems can fail dramatically when applied to throughput-constrained resource allocation. We then propose a novel ``proxy assignment" primal-dual algorithm that uses current arrivals to simulate the effect of future arrivals. We prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound when the assignment costs of the arriving jobs are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed distribution. We demonstrate the practical performance of our approach by conducting numerical experiments on synthetic datasets, as well as real-world datasets from retail fulfillment operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the performance of the linear consensus algorithm on strongly connected directed graphs using the linear quadratic (LQ) cost as a performance measure. In particular, we derive bounds on the LQ cost by leveraging effective resistance and reversiblization. Our results extend previous analyses-which were limited to reversible cases-to the nonreversible setting. To facilitate this generalization, we introduce novel concepts, termed the back-and-forth path and the pivot node, which serve as effective alternatives to traditional techniques that require reversibility. Moreover, we apply our approach to Cayley graphs and random geometric graphs to estimate the LQ cost without the reversibility assumption. The proposed approach provides a framework that can be adapted to other contexts where reversibility is typically assumed.</description>

      <title>Two Innovations in Inexact Augmented Lagrangian Methods for Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents two new techniques relating to inexact solution of subproblems in augmented Lagrangian methods for convex programming. The first involves combining a relative error criterion for solution of the subproblems with over- or under-relaxation of the multiplier update step. This analysis enables a new kind of inexact augmented Lagrangian method that adapts the amount of multiplier step relaxation to the accuracy of the subproblem, subject to a viability test employing the discriminant of a certain quadratic function. The second innovation involves solution of augmented Lagrangian subproblems for problems posed in standard Fenchel-Rockafellar form. We show that applying alternating minimization to this subproblem, as in the first two steps of the ADMM, is equivalent to executing the classical proximal gradient method on a dual formulation of the subproblem. By substituting more sophisticated variants of the proximal gradient method for the classical one, it is possible to construct new ADMM-like methods with better empirical performance than using ordinary alternating minimization within an inexact augmented Lagrangian framework. The paper concludes by describing some computational experiments exploring using these two innovations, both separately and jointly, to solve LASSO problems.</description>

      <title>A constructive approach to strengthen algebraic descriptions of function and operator classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14377v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that functions (resp. operators) satisfying a property~$p$ on a subset $Q\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ cannot necessarily be extended to a function (resp. operator) satisfying~$p$ on the whole of~$\mathbb{R}^d$. Given $Q \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, this work considers the problem of obtaining necessary and ideally sufficient conditions to be satisfied by a function (resp. operator) on $Q$, ensuring the existence of an extension of this function (resp. operator) satisfying $p$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  More precisely, given some property $p$, we present a refinement procedure to obtain stronger necessary conditions to be imposed on $Q$. This procedure can be applied iteratively until the stronger conditions are also sufficient. We illustrate the procedure on a few examples, including the strengthening of existing descriptions for the classes of smooth functions satisfying a \L{}ojasiewicz condition, convex blockwise smooth functions, Lipschitz monotone operators, strongly monotone cocoercive operators, and uniformly convex functions.
  In most cases, these strengthened descriptions can be represented, or relaxed, to semi-definite constraints, which can be used to formulate tractable optimization problems on functions (resp. operators) within those classes.</description>

      <title>Sliding motions on systems with non-Euclidean state spaces: A differential-geometric perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends sliding-mode control theory to nonlinear systems evolving on smooth manifolds. Building on differential geometric methods, we reformulate Filippov's notion of solutions, characterize well-defined vector fields on quotient spaces, and provide a consistent geometric definition of higher-order sliding modes. We generalize the regular form to non-Euclidean settings and design explicit first- and second-order sliding-mode controllers that respect the manifold structure. Particular attention is given to the role of topological obstructions, which are illustrated through examples on the cylinder, M\"obius bundle, and 2-sphere. Our results highlight how geometric and topological properties fundamentally influence sliding dynamics and suggest new directions for robust control in nonlinear spaces.</description>

      <title>Bang-Ride Optimal Control: Monotonicity, External Positivity, and Fast Battery Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies a class of optimal control problems with scalar inputs and general constraints, whose solutions follow a bang-ride pattern that always activates a constraint and enables efficient numerical computation. As a motivating example, fast battery charging leads to computationally demanding optimal control problems when detailed electrochemical models are used. Recently proposed optimization-free heuristics reduce this computational cost while producing input profiles observed in practice, following a bang-ride pattern and applying the maximum feasible input. We investigate when such heuristics satisfy necessary optimality conditions. By leveraging Pontryagin's maximum principle, we unify and formalize existing insights on the bang-ride structure and on the optimal control attaining the maximum feasible input under monotonicity. We further establish a novel connection between the structured optimal control and the external positivity of the costate dynamics. These results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for heuristic charging strategies and explain the efficiency of optimization-free algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo Approach for Nonsmooth Convex Optimization via Proximal Splitting Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operator splitting algorithms are a cornerstone of modern first-order optimization, relying critically on proximal operators as their fundamental building blocks. However, explicit formulas for proximal operators are available only for limited classes of functions, restricting the applicability of these methods. Recent work introduced HJ-Prox, a zeroth-order Monte Carlo approximation of the proximal operator derived from Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs, which circumvents the need for closed-form solutions. In this work, we extend the scope of HJ-Prox by establishing that it can be seamlessly incorporated into operator splitting schemes while preserving convergence guarantees. In particular, we show that replacing exact proximal steps with HJ-Prox approximations in algorithms such as proximal gradient descent, Douglas-Rachford splitting, Davis-Yin splitting, and the primal-dual hybrid gradient method still ensures convergence under mild conditions.</description>

      <title>Spare Strategy Analysis and Design for Large-Scale Satellite Constellation Using Markov Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for analyzing and designing an optimal spare-management policy in large-scale satellite constellations using a Markov chain model. To capture the stochastic nature of satellite failures and launch vehicle lead times, we adopt Markov chains to model both failure and replenishment processes. We reinvestigate an indirect spare strategy, modeled as a multi-echelon periodic-review reorder-point/order-quantity policy, in which spares are first delivered to parking orbits and then transferred to constellation planes. The stock levels in constellation and parking orbits are each modeled as independent Markov chains, and a fixed-point iteration yields a consistent joint stationary solution that describes the strategy's average behavior. This approach accurately captures the stochastic interplay within a multi-echelon model driven by orbital mechanics, avoiding the aggregation assumptions of prior works and remaining valid across a wider operating domain. Building on this fast, accurate analysis, we formulate an optimization problem and solve it via a genetic algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of both the analysis method and the optimization framework in a real-world mega-constellation case study.</description>

      <title>A Two-fold Randomization Framework for Impulse Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a randomization scheme for a general class of impulse control problems. The solution to this randomized problem is characterized as the fixed point of a compound operator which consists of a regularized nonlocal operator and a regularized stopping operator. This approach allows us to derive a semi-linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Through an equivalent randomization scheme with a Poisson compound measure, we establish a verification theorem that implies the uniqueness of the solution. Via an iterative approach, we prove the existence of the solution. The existence-and-uniqueness result ensures the randomized problem is well-defined. We then demonstrate that our randomized impulse control problem converges to its classical counterpart as the randomization parameter $\pmb \lambda$ vanishes. This convergence, combined with the value function's $C^{2,\alpha}_{loc}$ regularity, confirms our framework provides a robust approximation and a foundation for developing learning algorithms. Under this framework, we propose an offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. Its policy improvement step is naturally derived from the iterative approach from the existence proof, which enjoys a geometric convergence rate. We implement a model-free version of the algorithm and numerically demonstrate its effectiveness using a widely-studied example. The results show that our RL algorithm can learn the randomized solution, which accurately approximates its classical counterpart. A sensitivity analysis with respect to the volatility parameter $\sigma$ in the state process effectively demonstrates the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.</description>

      <title>Optimization hierarchies for distance-avoiding sets in compact spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Witsenhausen's problem asks for the maximum fraction $\alpha_n$ of the $n$-dimensional unit sphere that can be covered by a measurable set containing no pairs of orthogonal points. The best upper bounds for $\alpha_n$ are given by extensions of the Lov\'asz theta number. In this paper, optimization hierarchies based on the Lov\'asz theta number, like the Lasserre hierarchy, are extended to Witsenhausen's problem and similar problems. These hierarchies are shown to converge and are used to compute the best upper bounds for $\alpha_n$ in low dimensions.</description>

      <title>Solving Truly Massive Budgeted Monotonic POMDPs with Oracle-Guided Meta-Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monotonic Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), where the system state progressively decreases until a restorative action is performed, can be used to model sequential repair problems effectively. This paper considers the problem of solving budget-constrained multi-component monotonic POMDPs, where a finite budget limits the maximal number of restorative actions. For a large number of components, solving such a POMDP using current methods is computationally intractable due to the exponential growth in the state space with an increasing number of components. To address this challenge, we propose a two-step approach. Since the individual components of a budget-constrained multi-component monotonic POMDP are only connected via the shared budget, we first approximate the optimal budget allocation among these components using an approximation of each component POMDP's optimal value function which is obtained through a random forest model. Subsequently, we introduce an oracle-guided meta-trained Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to solve each of the independent budget-constrained single-component monotonic POMDPs. The oracle policy is obtained by performing value iteration on the corresponding monotonic Markov Decision Process (MDP). This two-step method provides scalability in solving truly massive multi-component monotonic POMDPs. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we consider a real-world maintenance scenario that involves inspection and repair of an administrative building by a team of agents within a maintenance budget. Finally, we perform a computational complexity analysis for a varying number of components to show the scalability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Convex Regularization and Convergence of Policy Gradient Flows under Safety Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines reinforcement learning (RL) in infinite-horizon decision processes with almost-sure safety constraints, crucial for applications like autonomous systems, finance, and resource management. We propose a doubly-regularized RL framework combining reward and parameter regularization to address safety constraints in continuous state-action spaces. The problem is formulated as a convex regularized objective with parametrized policies in the mean-field regime. Leveraging mean-field theory and Wasserstein gradient flows, policies are modeled on an infinite-dimensional statistical manifold, with updates governed by parameter distribution gradient flows. Key contributions include solvability conditions for safety-constrained problems, smooth bounded approximations for gradient flows, and exponential convergence guarantees under sufficient regularization. General regularization conditions, including entropy regularization, support practical particle method implementations. This framework provides robust theoretical insights and guarantees for safe RL in complex, high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Robust Decision-Making Via Free Energy Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their groundbreaking performance, state-of-the-art autonomous agents can misbehave when training and environmental conditions become inconsistent, with minor mismatches leading to undesirable behaviors or even catastrophic failures. Robustness towards these training/environment ambiguities is a core requirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing challenge when deploying agents in the real world. Here, we introduce a Distributionally Robust Free Energy model (DR-FREE) that instills this core property by design. It directly wires robustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms via free energy minimization. By combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with a novel resolution engine, DR-FREE returns a policy that is optimal-yet-robust against ambiguity. The policy has an explicit, soft-max, structure that reveals the mechanistic role of ambiguity on optimal decisions and requisite Bayesian belief updating. We evaluate DR-FREE on an experimental testbed involving real rovers navigating an ambiguous environment filled with obstacles. Across all the experiments, DR-FREE enables robots to successfully navigate towards their goal even when, in contrast, state-of-the-art free energy models fail. In short, DR-FREE can tackle scenarios that elude previous methods: this milestone may inspire both deployment in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps deeper level, the quest for a biologically plausible explanation of how natural agents -- with little or no training -- survive in capricious environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Branch-and-bound algorithms (B&amp;B) and polynomial-time approximation schemes (PTAS) are two seemingly distant areas of combinatorial optimization. We intend to (partially) bridge the gap between them while expanding the boundary of theoretical knowledge on the B\&amp;B framework. Branch-and-bound algorithms typically guarantee that an optimal solution is eventually found. However, we show that the standard implementation of branch-and-bound for certain knapsack and scheduling problems also exhibits PTAS-like behavior, yielding increasingly better solutions within polynomial time. Our findings are supported by computational experiments and comparisons with benchmark methods. This paper is an extended version of a paper accepted at ICALP 2025</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal control problem of stochastic systems is commonly solved via robust or scenario-based optimization methods, which are both challenging to scale to long optimization horizons. We cast the optimal control problem of a stochastic system as a convex optimization problem over occupation measures. We demonstrate our method on a set of synthetic and real-world scenarios, learning cost functions from data via Christoffel polynomials. The code for our experiments is available at https://github.com/ebuehrle/dpoc.</description>

      <title>Efficient Defection: Overage-Proportional Rationing Attains the Cooperative Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a noncooperative $n$-player game of slack allocation in which each player $j$ has entitlement $L_j&gt;0$ and chooses a claim $C_j\ge0$. Let $v_j=(C_j-L_j)_+$ (overage) and $s_j=(L_j-C_j)_+$ (slack); set $X=\sum_j v_j$ and $I=\sum_j s_j$. At the end of the period an overage-proportional clearing rule allocates cooperative surplus $I$ to defectors in proportion to $v_j$; cooperators receive $C_j$. We show: (i) the selfish outcome reproduces the cooperative payoff vector $(L_1,\dots,L_n)$; (ii) with bounded actions, defection is a weakly dominant strategy; (iii) within the $\alpha$-power family, the linear rule ($\alpha=1$) is the unique boundary-continuous member; and (iv) the dominant-strategy outcome is Strong Nash under transferable utility and hence coalition-proof (Bernheim et al., 1987). We give a policy interpretation for carbon rationing with a penalty collar.</description>
