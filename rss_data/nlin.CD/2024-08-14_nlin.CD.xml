      <title>New Coevolution Dynamic as an Optimization Strategy in Group Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In society, it is common to face problems that require collaboration with other people, from everyday challenges to complex tasks, such as group projects at work. In this context, the search for more effective problem-solving strategies becomes a topic of great interest. This paper presents a new dynamic that integrates coevolution into the NK model together with an Erd\"os-R\'enyi random network, allowing more than one neighbor update. We explore how this coevolution can be employed as an optimization strategy for solving group problems. In recent coevolution models, only one agent is removed and another is added to the neighborhood of influence. Here, we allow $L$ agents to be changed, which had a large impact on the system performance. In the analysis of the results, we consider rewiring as a way for the target agent to obtain information from individuals or groups that were not part of its neighborhood. Our simulations demonstrate that coevolution can produces gain on the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Robust chaos in a totally symmetric network of four phase oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide conditions on the coupling function such that a system of 4 globally coupled identical oscillators has chaotic attractors, a pair of Lorenz attractors or a 4-winged analogue of the Lorenz attractor. The attractors emerge near the triple instability threshold of the splay-phase synchronization state of the oscillators. We provide theoretical arguments and verify numerically, based on the pseudohyperbolicity test, that the chaotic dynamics are robust with respect to small, e.g. time-dependent, perturbations of the system. The robust chaoticity should also be inherited by any network of weakly interacting systems with such attractors.</description>

      <title>Time-Resolved Data-Driven Surrogates of Hall-effect Thrusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The treatment of Hall-effect thrusters as nonlinear, dynamical systems has emerged as a new perspective to understand and analyze data acquired from the thrusters. The acquisition of high-speed data that can resolve the characteristic high-frequency oscillations of these thruster enables additional levels of classification in these thrusters. Notably, these signals may serve as unique indicators for the full state of the system that can aid digital representations of thrusters and predictions of thruster dynamics. In this work, a Reservoir Computing framework is explored to build surrogate models from experimental time-series measurements of a Hall-effect thruster. Such a framework has shown immense promise for predicting the behavior of low-dimensional yet chaotic dynamical systems. In particular, the surrogates created by the Reservoir Computing framework are capable of both predicting the observed behavior of the thruster and estimating the values of certain measurements from others, known as inference.</description>

      <title>Extreme events in locally coupled bursting neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a new mechanism through which extreme events with a dragon king-like distribution emerge in a network of locally coupled Hindmarsh-Rose bursting neurons. We establish and substantiate the fact that depending on the choice of initial conditions, the neurons in the network are divided into clusters and whenever these clusters are phase synchronized intermittently, extreme events originate in the collective observable. This mechanism, which we name as intermittent cluster synchronization is proposed as the new precursor for the generation of extreme events in this system. These results are also true for electrical diffusive coupling. The distribution of the local maxima shows long tailed non-Gaussian while the interevent interval follows the Weibull distribution. The goodness of fit are corroborated using probability-probability plot and quantile-quantile plot. These extreme events become rarer and rarer with the increase in the number of different initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Complexity of chaotic optical frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of a single-mode semiconductor laser induced by the optical injection of a frequency comb are analyzed through the lens of complexity. In particular, the focus is dynamics outside the injection-locking region. Permutation entropy (P.E.) and chaos bandwidth (C.BW.)are used to quantify complexity. Various numerically simulated system outputs across the frequency detuning range and for different injection strengths are considered. Numerically simulated outputs from a single-mode injection system in the absence of comb injection are compared to comment on the origin of the reported complexity. Furthermore, experimental outputs are used to confirm the findings. Despite the presence of periodic dynamics originating from the frequency comb, the presented system generates remarkably high complex outputs with P.E. up to 0.99 maintained over an extended period of observation and long timescales with C.BW. up to 25 GHz.</description>

      <title>The Onset of Intermittency in Active Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results suggest that highly active, chaotic, non-equilibrium states of living fluids might share much in common with high Reynolds number, inertial turbulence. We now show, by using a hydrodynamical model, the onset of intermittency and the consequent multiscaling of Eulerian and Lagrangian structure functions as a function of the bacterial activity. Our results bridge the worlds of low and high Reynolds number flows as well as open up intriguing possibilities of what makes flows intermittent.</description>

      <title>A statistical physics and dynamical systems perspective on geophysical extreme events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical physics and dynamical systems theory are key tools to study high-impact geophysical events such as temperature extremes, cyclones, thunderstorms, geomagnetic storms and many more. Despite the intrinsic differences between these events, they all originate as temporary deviations from the typical trajectories of a geophysical system, resulting in well-organised, coherent structures at characteristic spatial and temporal scales. While statistical extreme value analysis techniques are capable to provide return times and probabilities of occurrence of certain geophysical events, they are not apt to account for their underlying physics. Their focus is to compute the probability of occurrence of events that are large or small with respect to some specific observable (e.g. temperature, precipitation, solar wind), rather than to relate rare or extreme phenomena to the underlying anomalous geophysical regimes. This paper outlines this knowledge gap, presenting some related challenges, new formalisms and briefly commenting on how stochastic approaches tailored to the study of extreme geophysical events can help to advance their understanding.</description>

      <title>Phase reduction explains chimera shape: when multi-body interaction matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05366v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an extension of the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model for networks, deriving the second-order phase approximation for a paradigmatic model of oscillatory networks - an ensemble of non-identical Stuart-Landau oscillators coupled pairwisely via an arbitrary coupling matrix. We explicitly demonstrate how this matrix translates into the coupling structure in the phase equations. To illustrate the power of our approach and the crucial importance of high-order phase reduction, we tackle a trendy setup of non-locally coupled oscillators exhibiting a chimera state. We reveal that our second-order phase model reproduces the dependence of the chimera shape on the coupling strength that is not captured by the typically used first-order Kuramoto-like model. Our derivation contributes to a better understanding of complex networks' dynamics, establishing a relation between the coupling matrix and multi-body interaction terms in the high-order phase model.</description>

      <title>Benchmark: Tao's symplectic integration method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A benchmark test was conducted for a new symplectic integration method originally developed by Molei Tao. The method raises interest due to its explicit evolution equation, with applicability to both separable and non-separable Hamiltonian systems, and an easy-to-implement, easily generalizable algorithm. In order to compare the method with other, more well-known methods, namely St\"{o}rmer-Verlet and Runge-Kutta, we conducted a series of benchmark tests comparing their performance in terms of CPU time, system invariants functions conservation, and numerical symplectic area conservation. Overall, it was found that despite being slower than the more optimized Runge-Kutta-Cash-Karp, Tao's method presents a similar performance to St\"{o}rmer-Verlet, with the extra perk of being more generic and not requiring the use of implicit equations for the evolution of the equations of motion.</description>
