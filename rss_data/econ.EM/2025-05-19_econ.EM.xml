      <title>Distribution Regression with Censored Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a distribution regression model with a censored selection rule, offering a semi-parametric generalization of the Heckman selection model. Our approach applies to the entire distribution, extending beyond the mean or median, accommodates non-Gaussian error structures, and allows for heterogeneous effects of covariates on both the selection and outcome distributions. By employing a censored selection rule, our model can uncover richer selection patterns according to both outcome and selection variables, compared to the binary selection case. We analyze identification, estimation, and inference of model functionals such as sorting parameters and distributions purged of sample selection. An application to labor supply using data from the UK reveals different selection patterns into full-time and overtime work across gender, marital status, and time. Additionally, decompositions of wage distributions by gender show that selection effects contribute to a decrease in the observed gender wage gap at low quantiles and an increase in the gap at high quantiles for full-time workers. The observed gender wage gap among overtime workers is smaller, which may be driven by different selection behaviors into overtime work across genders.</description>

      <title>Statically Significant Linear Regression Coefficients Solely Driven By Outliers In Finite-sample Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of outliers on the statistical significance of coefficients in linear regression. We demonstrate, through numerical simulation using R, that a single outlier can cause an otherwise insignificant coefficient to appear statistically significant. We compare this with robust Huber regression, which reduces the effects of outliers. Afterwards, we approximate the influence of a single outlier on estimated regression coefficients and discuss common diagnostic statistics to detect influential observations in regression (e.g., studentized residuals). Furthermore, we relate this issue to the optional normality assumption in simple linear regression [14], required for exact finite-sample inference but asymptotically justified for large n by the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). We also address the general dangers of relying solely on p-values without performing adequate regression diagnostics. Finally, we provide a brief overview of regression methods and discuss how they relate to the assumptions of the Gauss-Markov theorem.</description>

      <title>Tractable Unified Skew-t Distribution and Copula for Heterogeneous Asymmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate distributions that allow for asymmetry and heavy tails are important building blocks in many econometric and statistical models. The Unified Skew-t (UST) is a promising choice because it is both scalable and allows for a high level of flexibility in the asymmetry in the distribution. However, it suffers from parameter identification and computational hurdles that have to date inhibited its use for modeling data. In this paper we propose a new tractable variant of the unified skew-t (TrUST) distribution that addresses both challenges. Moreover, the copula of this distribution is shown to also be tractable, while allowing for greater heterogeneity in asymmetric dependence over variable pairs than the popular skew-t copula. We show how Bayesian posterior inference for both the distribution and its copula can be computed using an extended likelihood derived from a generative representation of the distribution. The efficacy of this Bayesian method, and the enhanced flexibility of both the TrUST distribution and its implicit copula, is first demonstrated using simulated data. Applications of the TrUST distribution to highly skewed regional Australian electricity prices, and the TrUST copula to intraday U.S. equity returns, demonstrate how our proposed distribution and its copula can provide substantial increases in accuracy over the popular skew-t and its copula in practice.</description>

      <title>A Cautionary Tale on Integrating Studies with Disparate Outcome Measures for Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data integration approaches are increasingly used to enhance the efficiency and generalizability of studies. However, a key limitation of these methods is the assumption that outcome measures are identical across datasets -- an assumption that often does not hold in practice. Consider the following opioid use disorder (OUD) studies: the XBOT trial and the POAT study, both evaluating the effect of medications for OUD on withdrawal symptom severity (not the primary outcome of either trial). While XBOT measures withdrawal severity using the subjective opiate withdrawal scale, POAT uses the clinical opiate withdrawal scale. We analyze this realistic yet challenging setting where outcome measures differ across studies and where neither study records both types of outcomes. Our paper studies whether and when integrating studies with disparate outcome measures leads to efficiency gains. We introduce three sets of assumptions -- with varying degrees of strength -- linking both outcome measures. Our theoretical and empirical results highlight a cautionary tale: integration can improve asymptotic efficiency only under the strongest assumption linking the outcomes. However, misspecification of this assumption leads to bias. In contrast, a milder assumption may yield finite-sample efficiency gains, yet these benefits diminish as sample size increases. We illustrate these trade-offs via a case study integrating the XBOT and POAT datasets to estimate the comparative effect of two medications for opioid use disorder on withdrawal symptoms. By systematically varying the assumptions linking the SOW and COW scales, we show potential efficiency gains and the risks of bias. Our findings emphasize the need for careful assumption selection when fusing datasets with differing outcome measures, offering guidance for researchers navigating this common challenge in modern data integration.</description>

      <title>IISE PG&amp;E Energy Analytics Challenge 2025: Hourly-Binned Regression Models Beat Transformers in Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate electricity load forecasting is essential for grid stability, resource optimization, and renewable energy integration. While transformer-based deep learning models like TimeGPT have gained traction in time-series forecasting, their effectiveness in long-term electricity load prediction remains uncertain. This study evaluates forecasting models ranging from classical regression techniques to advanced deep learning architectures using data from the ESD 2025 competition. The dataset includes two years of historical electricity load data, alongside temperature and global horizontal irradiance (GHI) across five sites, with a one-day-ahead forecasting horizon. Since actual test set load values remain undisclosed, leveraging predicted values would accumulate errors, making this a long-term forecasting challenge. We employ (i) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and (ii) frame the task as a regression problem, using temperature and GHI as covariates to predict load for each hour, (iii) ultimately stacking 24 models to generate yearly forecasts.
  Our results reveal that deep learning models, including TimeGPT, fail to consistently outperform simpler statistical and machine learning approaches due to the limited availability of training data and exogenous variables. In contrast, XGBoost, with minimal feature engineering, delivers the lowest error rates across all test cases while maintaining computational efficiency. This highlights the limitations of deep learning in long-term electricity forecasting and reinforces the importance of model selection based on dataset characteristics rather than complexity. Our study provides insights into practical forecasting applications and contributes to the ongoing discussion on the trade-offs between traditional and modern forecasting methods.</description>

      <title>Local-Polynomial Estimation for Multivariate Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a multivariate local-linear estimator for multivariate regression discontinuity designs in which treatment is assigned by crossing a boundary in the space of running variables. The dominant approach uses the Euclidean distance from a boundary point as the scalar running variable; hence, multivariate designs are handled as uni-variate designs. However, the bandwidth selection with the distance running variable is suboptimal and inefficient for the underlying multivariate problem. We handle multivariate designs as multivariate. In this study, we develop a novel asymptotic normality for multivariate local-polynomial estimators. Our estimator is asymptotically valid and can capture heterogeneous treatment effects over the boundary. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our estimator through numerical simulations. Our empirical illustration of a Colombian scholarship study reveals a richer heterogeneity of the treatment effect that is hidden in the original estimates.</description>

      <title>Inference after discretizing time-varying unobserved heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximating time-varying unobserved heterogeneity by discrete types has become increasingly popular in economics. Yet, provably valid post-clustering inference for target parameters in models that do not impose an exact group structure is still lacking. This paper fills this gap in the leading case of a linear panel data model with nonseparable two-way unobserved heterogeneity. Building on insights from the double machine learning literature, we propose a simple inference procedure based on a bias-reducing moment. Asymptotic theory and simulations suggest excellent performance. In the application on fiscal policy we revisit, the novel approach yields conclusions in line with economic theory.</description>

      <title>Pre-Training Estimators for Structural Models: Application to Consumer Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00526v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore pretraining estimators for structural econometric models. The estimator is "pretrained" in the sense that the bulk of the computational cost and researcher effort occur during the construction of the estimator. Subsequent applications of the estimator to different datasets require little computational cost or researcher effort. The estimation leverages a neural net to recognize the structural model's parameter from data patterns. As an initial trial, this paper builds a pretrained estimator for a sequential search model that is known to be difficult to estimate. We evaluate the pretrained estimator on 12 real datasets. The estimation takes seconds to run and shows high accuracy. We provide the estimator at pnnehome.github.io. More generally, pretrained, off-the-shelf estimators can make structural models more accessible to researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <title>Welfare Analysis in Dynamic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09173</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.09173v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces metrics for welfare analysis in dynamic models. We develop estimation and inference for these parameters even in the presence of a high-dimensional state space. Examples of welfare metrics include average welfare, average marginal welfare effects, and welfare decompositions into direct and indirect effects similar to Oaxaca (1973) and Blinder (1973). We derive dual and doubly robust representations of welfare metrics that facilitate debiased inference. For average welfare, the value function does not have to be estimated. In general, debiasing can be applied to any estimator of the value function, including neural nets, random forests, Lasso, boosting, and other high-dimensional methods. In particular, we derive Lasso and Neural Network estimators of the value function and associated dynamic dual representation and establish associated mean square convergence rates for these functions. Debiasing is automatic in the sense that it only requires knowledge of the welfare metric of interest, not the form of bias correction. The proposed methods are applied to estimate a dynamic behavioral model of teacher absenteeism in \cite{DHR} and associated average teacher welfare.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis testing on invariant subspaces of non-symmetric matrices with applications to network statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.18233v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the inference procedure for eigenvectors of Tyler (1981), which assumes symmetrizable matrices to generic invariant and singular subspaces of non-diagonalisable matrices to test whether $\nu \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times r}$ is an element of an invariant subspace of $M \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$. Our results include a Wald test for full-vector hypotheses and a $t$-test for coefficient-wise hypotheses. We employ perturbation expansions of invariant subspaces from Sun (1991) and singular subspaces from Liu et al. (2007). Based on the former, we extend the popular Davis-Kahan bound to estimations of its higher-order polynomials and study how the bound simplifies for eigenspaces but attains complexity for generic invariant subspaces.</description>
