      <title>Light-weighted foundation model for seismic data processing based on representative and non-redundant pre-training dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fields of computer vision (CV) and remote sensing (RS), foundational models typically follow the "big data + large model parameters" paradigm. However, the application of this strategy in seismic data processing faces several challenges: seismic data is difficult to obtain and the scarcity of publicly available datasets make it difficult to construct large-scale datasets. Additionally, the high computational cost associated with a large number of model parameters restricts widespread research in this domain. Therefore, we propose a lightweight seismic processing foundational model paradigm (SPFM), which aims to overcome the limitations of traditional methods by data engineering and network architecture innovation. Specifically, we propose an innovative dataset construction strategy that generates more seismic data by data augmentation techniques, including collecting publicly available field data and using generative diffusion models (GDM) for data enhancement. Furthermore, we optimize the data distribution by employing dimensionality reduction, cluster analysis, and stratified sampling methods, reducing redundant information while preserving important seismic features, thus constructing a comprehensive dataset. In terms of network architecture design, we introduce the selective structured state-space model (Mamba) structure, which effectively captures global features of seismic data and alleviates the quadratic growth of computational complexity inherent in Transformer-based models, thereby improving computational efficiency. This model, pre-trained with only four A800 GPUs, outperforms traditional methods across multiple tasks, including denoising, interpolation, frequency-band extrapolation, and resolution enhancement. The lightweight paradigm provides an solution for seismic data processing, advancing the generalization and accessibility of seismic data processing.</description>

      <title>Interplay of non-standard interactions and Earth's composition in atmospheric neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many geophysical and geochemical phenomena in the Earth's interior are related to physical and chemical processes in the outer core and the core-mantle boundary, directly linked to isotopic composition. Determining the composition using standard geophysical methods has been a challenge. The oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos, influenced by their weak interactions with terrestrial matter, offer a new way to gather valuable information about the Earth's internal structure and, in particular, to constrain the core composition. If neutrinos had as yet unknown non-standard interactions (NSI), this could affect their propagation in matter and consequently impact studies of Earth's composition using neutrino oscillation tomography. This study focuses on scalar-mediated NSI and their potential impact on atmospheric neutrino oscillations, which could obscure information about the hydrogen content in the outer core. In turn, compositional uncertainties could affect the characterization of NSI parameters. The analysis is based on a Monte-Carlo simulation of the energy distribution and azimuthal angles of neutrino-generated $\mu$ events. Using a model of the Earth consisting of 55 concentric shells with constant densities determined from the PREM, we evaluate the effect on the number of events due to changes in the outer core composition (Z/A)$_{oc}$ and the NSI strength parameter $\epsilon$. To examine the detection capability to observe such variations, we consider regions in the plane of (Z/A)$_{oc}$ and $\epsilon$ where the statistical significance of the discrepancies between the modified Earth model and the reference model is less than $1\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing syndromes of biosphere-atmosphere-socioeconomic change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is increasingly recognized that the multiple and systemic impacts of Earth system change threaten the prosperity of society through altered land carbon dynamics, freshwater variability, biodiversity loss, and climate extremes. For example, in 2022, there are about 400 climate extremes and natural hazards worldwide, resulting in significant losses of lives and economic damage. Beyond these losses, comprehensive assessment on societal well-being, ecosystem services, and carbon dynamics are often understudied. The rapid expansion of geospatial, atmospheric, and socioeconomic data provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop systemic indices to account for a more comprehensive spectrum of Earth system change risks and to assess their socioeconomic impacts. We propose a novel approach based on the concept of syndromes that can integrate synchronized changes in biosphere, atmosphere, and socioeconomic trajectories into distinct co-evolving phenomena. While the syndrome concept was applied in policy related to environmental conservation, it has not been deciphered from systematic data-driven approaches capable of providing a more comprehensive diagnosis of anthropogenic impacts. By advocating interactive dimensionality reduction approaches, we can identify key interconnected socio-environmental changes as syndromes from big data. We recommend future research tailoring syndromes by incorporating granular data, particularly socio-economic, into dimensionality reduction at different spatio-temporal scales to better diagnose regional-to-global atmospheric and environmental changes that are relevant for socioeconomic changes.</description>
