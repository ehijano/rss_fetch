      <title>On the Uncrossed Number of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visualizing a graph $G$ in the plane nicely, for example, without crossings, is unfortunately not always possible. To address this problem, Masa\v{r}\'ik and Hlin\v{e}n\'y [GD 2023] recently asked for each edge of $G$ to be drawn without crossings while allowing multiple different drawings of $G$. More formally, a collection $\mathcal{D}$ of drawings of $G$ is uncrossed if, for each edge $e$ of $G$, there is a drawing in $\mathcal{D}$ such that $e$ is uncrossed. The uncrossed number $\mathrm{unc}(G)$ of $G$ is then the minimum number of drawings in some uncrossed collection of $G$.
  No exact values of the uncrossed numbers have been determined yet, not even for simple graph classes. In this paper, we provide the exact values for uncrossed numbers of complete and complete bipartite graphs, partly confirming and partly refuting a conjecture posed by Hlin\v{e}n\'y and Masa\v{r}\'ik. We also present a strong general lower bound on $\mathrm{unc}(G)$ in terms of the number of vertices and edges of $G$. Moreover, we prove NP-hardness of the related problem of determining the edge crossing number of a graph $G$, which is the smallest number of edges of $G$ taken over all drawings of $G$ that participate in a crossing. This problem was posed as open by Schaefer in his book [Crossing Numbers of Graphs 2018].</description>

      <title>Algorithmic methods of finite discrete structures. Topological graph drawing (part I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern methods of graph theory describe a graph up to isomorphism, which makes it difficult to create mathematical models for visualizing graph drawings on a plane. The topological drawing of the planar part of a graph allows representing the planarization process by algebraic methods, without making any geometric constructions on the plane. Constructing a rotation of graph vertices solves two most important problems of graph theory simultaneously: the problem of testing a graph for planarity and the problem of constructing a topological drawing of a planar graph. It is shown that the problem of constructing a drawing of a non-planar graph can be reduced to the problem of constructing a drawing of a planar graph, taking into account the introduction of additional vertices characterizing the intersection of edges. Naturally, the development of such a mathematical structure will make it possible to solve the following important problems of graph theory: testing the planarity of a graph, identifying the largest planar subgraph of a graph, determining the thickness of a graph, obtaining a graph with a minimum number of intersections, etc.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic methods of finite discrete structures. Topological graph drawing (part II)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A visualized graph is a powerful tool for data analysis and synthesis tasks. In this case, the task of visualization constitutes not only in displaying vertices and edges according to the graph representation, but also in ensuring that the result is visually simple and comprehensible for a human. Thus, the visualization process involves solving several problems, one of which is the problem of constructing a topological drawing of a planar part of a non-planar graph with a minimum number of removed edges. In this manuscript, we consider a mathematical model for representing the topological drawing of a graph, which is based on methods of the theory of vertex rotation with the induction of simple cycles that satisfy the Mac Lane planarity criterion. It is shown that the topological drawing of a non-planar graph can be constructed on the basis of a selected planar part of the graph. The topological model of a graph drawing allows us to reduce the brute-force enumeration problem of identifying a plane graph to a discrete optimization problem - searching for a subset of the set of isometric cycles of the graph that satisfy the zero value of the Mac Lane's functional. To isolate the planar part of the graph, a new computational method has been developed based on linear algebra and the algebra of structural numbers. The proposed method has polynomial computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Dyck Words, Pattern Avoidance, and Automatic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study various aspects of Dyck words appearing in binary sequences, where $0$ is treated as a left parenthesis and $1$ as a right parenthesis. We show that binary words that are $7/3$-power-free have bounded nesting level, but this no longer holds for larger repetition exponents. We give an explicit characterization of the factors of the Thue-Morse word that are Dyck, and show how to count them. We also prove tight upper and lower bounds on $f(n)$, the number of Dyck factors of Thue-Morse of length $2n$.</description>

      <title>Moving a Derivation Along a Derivation Preserves the Spine in Adhesive Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between two elementary operations on derivations in adhesive high-level replacement systems that are well-known in the context of graph transformation: moving a derivation along a derivation based on parallel and sequential independence on one hand and restriction of a derivation with respect to a monomorphism into the start object on the other hand. Intuitively, a restriction clips off parts of the start object that are never matched by a rule application throughout the derivation on the other hand. As main result, it is shown that moving a derivation preserves its spine being the minimal restriction.</description>

      <title>Firefighting with a Distance-Based Restriction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the classic version of the game of firefighter, on the first turn a fire breaks out on a vertex in a graph $G$ and then $k$ firefighters protect $k$ vertices. On each subsequent turn, the fire spreads to the collective unburnt neighbourhood of all the burning vertices and the firefighters again protect $k$ vertices. Once a vertex has been burnt or protected it remains that way for the rest of the game. A common objective with respect to some infinite graph $G$ is to determine how many firefighters are necessary to stop the fire from spreading after a finite number of turns, commonly referred to as containing the fire. We introduce the concept of distance-restricted firefighting where the firefighters' movement is restricted so they can only move up to some fixed distance $d$ per turn rather than being able to move without restriction. We establish some general properties of this new game in contrast to properties of the original game, and we investigate specific cases of the distance-restricted game on the infinite square, strong, and hexagonal grids. We conjecture that two firefighters are insufficient on the square grid when $d = 2$, and we pose some questions about how many firefighters are required in general when $d = 1$.</description>

      <title>The Subspace Flatness Conjecture and Faster Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14605v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a seminal paper, Kannan and Lov\'asz (1988) considered a quantity $\mu_{KL}(\Lambda,K)$ which denotes the best volume-based lower bound on the covering radius $\mu(\Lambda,K)$ of a convex body $K$ with respect to a lattice $\Lambda$. Kannan and Lov\'asz proved that $\mu(\Lambda,K) \leq n \cdot \mu_{KL}(\Lambda,K)$ and the Subspace Flatness Conjecture by Dadush (2012) claims a $O(\log(2n))$ factor suffices, which would match the lower bound from the work of Kannan and Lov\'asz.
  We settle this conjecture up to a constant in the exponent by proving that $\mu(\Lambda,K) \leq O(\log^{3}(2n)) \cdot \mu_{KL} (\Lambda,K)$. Our proof is based on the Reverse Minkowski Theorem due to Regev and Stephens-Davidowitz (2017). Following the work of Dadush (2012, 2019), we obtain a $(\log(2n))^{O(n)}$-time randomized algorithm to solve integer programs in $n$ variables. Another implication of our main result is a near-optimal flatness constant of $O(n \log^{3}(2n))$.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Approach to the Longest Path Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Longest Path Problem is a question of finding the maximum length between pairs of vertices of a graph. In the general case, the problem is NP-complete. However, there is a small collection of graph classes for which there exists an efficient solution. Current approaches involve either approximation or computational enumeration. For Tree-like classes of graphs, there are approximation and enumeration algorithms which solves the problem efficiently. Despite this, we propose a new method of approaching the longest path problem with exact algebraic solutions that give rise to polynomial-time algorithms. Our method provides algorithms that are proven correct by their underlying algebraic operations unlike existing purely algorithmic solutions to this problem. We introduce a `booleanize' mapping on the adjacency matrix of a graph which we prove identifies the solution for trees, uniform block graphs, block graphs, and directed acyclic graphs with exact conditions and associated polynomial-time algorithms. In addition, we display additional algorithms that can generate every possible longest path of acyclic graphs in efficient time, as well as for block graphs.</description>

      <title>Flips in colorful triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The associahedron is the graph $\mathcal{G}_N$ that has as nodes all triangulations of a convex $N$-gon, and an edge between any two triangulations that differ in a flip operation. A flip removes an edge shared by two triangles and replaces it by the other diagonal of the resulting 4-gon. In this paper, we consider a large collection of induced subgraphs of $\mathcal{G}_N$ obtained by Ramsey-type colorability properties. Specifically, coloring the points of the $N$-gon red and blue alternatingly, we consider only colorful triangulations, namely triangulations in which every triangle has points in both colors, i.e., monochromatic triangles are forbidden. The resulting induced subgraph of $\mathcal{G}_N$ on colorful triangulations is denoted by $\mathcal{F}_N$. We prove that $\mathcal{F}_N$ has a Hamilton cycle for all $N\geq 8$, resolving a problem raised by Sagan, i.e., all colorful triangulations on $N$ points can be listed so that any two cyclically consecutive triangulations differ in a flip. In fact, we prove that for an arbitrary fixed coloring pattern of the $N$ points with at least 10 changes of color, the resulting subgraph of $\mathcal{G}_N$ on colorful triangulations (for that coloring pattern) admits a Hamilton cycle. We also provide an efficient algorithm for computing a Hamilton path in $\mathcal{F}_N$ that runs in time $\mathcal{O}(1)$ on average per generated node. This algorithm is based on a new and algorithmic construction of a tree rotation Gray code for listing all $n$-vertex $k$-ary trees that runs in time $\mathcal{O}(k)$ on average per generated tree.</description>
