      <title>Simultaneous Task Allocation and Planning for Multi-Robots under Hierarchical Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research in robotic planning with temporal logic specifications, such as syntactically co-safe Linear Temporal Logic (sc-LTL), has relied on single formulas. However, as task complexity increases, sc-LTL formulas become lengthy, making them difficult to interpret and generate, and straining the computational capacities of planners. To address this, we introduce a hierarchical structure to sc-LTL specifications with both syntax and semantics, proving it to be more expressive than flat counterparts. We conducted a user study that compared the flat sc-LTL with our hierarchical version and found that users could more easily comprehend complex tasks using the hierarchical structure. We develop a search-based approach to synthesize plans for multi-robot systems, achieving simultaneous task allocation and planning. This method approximates the search space by loosely interconnected sub-spaces, each corresponding to an sc-LTL specification. The search primarily focuses on a single sub-space, transitioning to another under conditions determined by the decomposition of automatons. We develop multiple heuristics to significantly expedite the search. Our theoretical analysis, conducted under mild assumptions, addresses completeness and optimality. Compared to existing methods used in various simulators for service tasks, our approach improves planning times while maintaining comparable solution quality.</description>

      <title>Automata and coalgebras in categories of species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04242v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study generalized automata (in the sense of Ad\'amek-Trnkov\'a) in Joyal's category of (set-valued) combinatorial species, and as an important preliminary step, we study coalgebras for its derivative endofunctor $\partial$ and for the "Euler homogeneity operator" $L\circ\partial$ arising from the adjunction $L\dashv\partial\dashv R$. The theory is connected with, and in fact provides relatively nontrivial examples of, "differential 2-rigs", a notion recently introduced by the author putting combinatorial species on the same relation a generic (differential) semiring $(R,d)$ has with the (differential) semiring $\mathbb N[\![ X]\!]$ of power series with natural coefficients. The desire to study categories of "state machines" valued in an ambient monoidal category $(\mathcal K,\otimes)$ gives a pretext to further develop the abstract theory of differential 2-rigs, proving lifting theorems of a differential 2-rig structure from $(\mathcal R,\partial)$ to the category of $\partial$-algebras on objects of $\mathcal R$, and to categories of Mealy automata valued in $(\mathcal R,\otimes)$, as well as various constructions inspired by differential algebra such as jet spaces and modules of differential operators. These theorems adapt to various "species-like" categories such as coloured species, $k$-vector species (both used in operad theory), linear species (introduced by Leroux to study combinatorial differential equations), M\"obius species, and others.</description>
