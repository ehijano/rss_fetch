      <title>Derangetropy in Probability Distributions and Information Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce derangetropy, a novel functional measure designed to characterize the dynamics of information within probability distributions. Unlike scalar measures such as Shannon entropy, derangetropy offers a functional representation that captures the dispersion of information across the entire support of a distribution. By incorporating self-referential and periodic properties, it provides deeper insights into information dynamics governed by differential equations and equilibrium states. Through combinatorial justifications and empirical analysis, we demonstrate the utility of derangetropy in depicting distribution behavior and evolution, providing a new tool for analyzing complex and hierarchical systems in information theory.</description>

      <title>Disruptive RIS for Enhancing Key Generation and Secret Transmission in Low-Entropy Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Key generation, a pillar in physical-layer security (PLS), is the process of the exchanging signals from two legitimate users (Alice and Bob) to extract a common key from the random, common channels. The drawback of extracting keys from wireless channels is the ample dependence on the dynamicity and fluctuations of the radio channel, rendering the key vulnerable to estimation by Eve (an illegitimate user) in low-entropy environments because of insufficient randomness. Added to that, the lack of channel fluctuations lower the secret key rate (SKR) defined as the number of bits of key generated per channel use. In this work, we aim to address this challenge by using a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to produce random phases at certain, carefully curated intervals such that it disrupts the channel in low-entropy environments. We propose an RIS assisted key generation protocol, study its performance, and compare with benchmarks to observe the benefit of using an RIS while considering various important metrics such as key mismatch rate and secret key throughput. Furthermore, we characterize a scaling law as a function of the rate of change of RIS phase switching for the average secret information rate under this protocol. Then, we use both the key throughput and information rate to optimize the overall secrecy rate. Simulations are made to validate our theoretical findings and effectiveness of the proposed scheme showing an improvement in performance when an RIS is deployed.</description>

      <title>Causality-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Joint Communication and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next-generation wireless network, 6G and beyond, envisions to integrate communication and sensing to overcome interference, improve spectrum efficiency, and reduce hardware and power consumption. Massive Multiple-Input Multiple Output (mMIMO)-based Joint Communication and Sensing (JCAS) systems realize this integration for 6G applications such as autonomous driving, as it requires accurate environmental sensing and time-critical communication with neighboring vehicles. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used for mMIMO antenna beamforming in the existing literature. However, the huge search space for actions associated with antenna beamforming causes the learning process for the RL agent to be inefficient due to high beam training overhead. The learning process does not consider the causal relationship between action space and the reward, and gives all actions equal importance. In this work, we explore a causally-aware RL agent which can intervene and discover causal relationships for mMIMO-based JCAS environments, during the training phase. We use a state dependent action dimension selection strategy to realize causal discovery for RL-based JCAS. Evaluation of the causally-aware RL framework in different JCAS scenarios shows the benefit of our proposed framework over baseline methods in terms of the beamforming gain.</description>

      <title>Age of Gossip in Networks with Multiple Views of a Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the version age of information (AoI) in a network where a subset of nodes act as sensing nodes, sampling a source that in general can follow a continuous distribution. Any sample of the source constitutes a new version of the information and the version age of the information is defined with respect to the most recent version of the information available for the whole network. We derive a recursive expression for the average version AoI between different subsets of the nodes which can be used to evaluate the average version AoI for any subset of the nodes including any single node. We derive asymptotic behavior of the average AoI on any single node of the network for various topologies including line, ring, and fully connected networks. The prior art result on version age of a network by Yates [ISIT'21] can be interpreted as in our derivation as a network with a single view of the source, e.g., through a Poisson process with rate $\lambda_{00}$. Our result indicates that there is no loss in the average version AoI performance by replacing a single view of the source with distributed sensing across multiple nodes by splitting the same rate $\lambda_{00}$. Particularly, we show that asymptotically, the average AoI scales with $O(\log(n))$ and $O(\sqrt{n})$ for fully connected and ring networks, respectively. More interestingly, we show that for the ring network the same $O(\sqrt{n})$ asymptotical performance on average AoI is still achieved with distributed sensing if the number of sensing nodes only scales with $O(\sqrt{n})$ instead of prior known result which requires $O(n)$. Our results indicate that the sensing nodes can be arbitrarily chosen as long as the maximum number of consecutive non-sensing nodes also scales as $O(\sqrt{n})$.</description>

      <title>Joint LOS Identification and Data Association for 6G-Enabled Networked Device-Free Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers networked device-free sensing in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) cellular system with multipath environment, where the passive targets reflect the downlink signals to the base stations (BSs) via non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths and/or line-of-sight (LOS) paths, and the BSs share the sensing information extracted from their received echoes to jointly localize the targets. A two-phase localization protocol is considered. In Phase I, we design an efficient method that is able to accurately estimate the range of any path from a transmitting BS to a receiving BS via a target, even if the transmitting and receiving BSs are separated and not perfectly synchronized. In Phase II, we propose an effective method that is able to jointly identify the ranges of the LOS paths between the targets and the BSs as well as associate the ranges of LOS paths with the right targets, such that the number and the locations of the targets both can be accurately estimated. Numerical results verify that our proposed two-phase protocol can achieve high performance of networked sensing in the multipath environment.</description>

      <title>User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO With RIS-Integrated Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is a promising network architecture for beyond 5G systems, which can particularly offer more uniform data rates across the coverage area. Recent works have shown how reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be used as relays in cell-free massive MIMO networks to improve data rates further. In this paper, we analyze an alternative architecture where an RIS is integrated into the antenna array at each access point and acts as an intelligent transmitting surface to expand the aperture area. This approach alleviates the multiplicative fading effect that normally makes RIS-aided systems inefficient and offers a cost-effective alternative to building large antenna arrays. We use a small number of antennas and a larger number of controllable RIS elements to match the performance of an antenna array whose size matches that of the RIS. In this paper, we explore this innovative transceiver architecture in the uplink of a cell-free massive MIMO system for the first time, demonstrating its potential benefits through analytic and numerical contributions. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed phase-shift configuration and highlight scenarios where the proposed architecture significantly enhances data rates.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Learn-then-Test: Statistically Valid and Efficient Hyperparameter Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce adaptive learn-then-test (aLTT), an efficient hyperparameter selection procedure that provides finite-sample statistical guarantees on the population risk of AI models. Unlike the existing learn-then-test (LTT) technique, which relies on conventional p-value-based multiple hypothesis testing (MHT), aLTT implements sequential data-dependent MHT with early termination by leveraging e-processes. As a result, aLTT can reduce the number of testing rounds, making it particularly well-suited for scenarios in which testing is costly or presents safety risks. Apart from maintaining statistical validity, in applications such as online policy selection for offline reinforcement learning and hyperparameter tuning for engineering systems, aLTT is shown to achieve the same performance as LTT while requiring only a fraction of the testing rounds.</description>

      <title>Lattice-Based Vulnerabilities in Lee Metric Post-Quantum Cryptosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography has gained attention due to the need for secure cryptographic systems in the face of quantum computing. Code-based and lattice-based cryptography are two prominent approaches, both heavily studied within the NIST standardization project. Code-based cryptography -- most prominently exemplified by the McEliece cryptosystem -- is based on the hardness of decoding random linear error-correcting codes. Despite the McEliece cryptosystem having been unbroken for several decades, it suffers from large key sizes, which has led to exploring variants using metrics than the Hamming metric, such as the Lee metric. This alternative metric may allow for smaller key sizes, but requires further analysis for potential vulnerabilities to lattice- based attack techniques. In this paper, we consider a generic Lee metric based McEliece type cryptosystem and evaluate its security against lattice-based attacks.</description>

      <title>Enhanced RMT estimator for signal number estimation in the presence of colored noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subspace-based techniques are widely utilized to estimate the parameters of sums of complex sinusoids corrupted by noise, and they need accurate estimation of the signal subspace dimension. The classic RMT estimator for model order estimation based on random matrix theory (RMT) assumes that the noise is white Gaussian, and performs poorly in the presence of colored noise with unknown covariance matrix. In order to deal with this problem, this paper proposes a novel algorithm to estimate the number of signals for the case of colored noise with unknown covariance matrix based on the analysis of the behavior of information theoretic criteria utilized in model order selection. Firstly, a first criterion is defined as the ratio of the current eigenvalue and the mean of the next ones, and its properties is analyzed with respect to the over-modeling and under-modeling. Secondly, a second criterion is designed as the ratio of the current value and the next value of the first criterion, and its properties is analyzed with respect to the over-modeling and under-modeling. Then, a novel enhanced RMT estimator is proposed for signal number estimation by analyzing the detection properties among the signal number estimates obtained by these two criteria and the RMT estimator to determine which eigenvalue is arising from a signal. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate that the proposed enhanced RMT estimator has better estimation performance and works better in the presence of colored noise than the existing methods.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Blind Beamforming for Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Configuring intelligent surface (IS) or passive antenna array without any channel knowledge, namely blind beamforming, is a frontier research topic in the wireless communication field. Existing methods in the previous literature for blind beamforming include the RFocus and the CSM, the effectiveness of which has been demonstrated on hardware prototypes. However, this paper points out a subtle issue with these blind beamforming algorithms: the RFocus and the CSM may fail to work in the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) channel case. To address this issue, we suggest a grouping strategy that enables adaptive blind beamforming. Specifically, the reflective elements (REs) of the IS are divided into three groups; each group is configured randomly to obtain a dataset of random samples. We then extract the statistical feature of the wireless environment from the random samples, thereby coordinating phase shifts of the IS without channel acquisition. The RE grouping plays a critical role in guaranteeing performance gain in the NLoS case. In particular, if we place all the REs in the same group, the proposed algorithm would reduce to the RFocus and the CSM. We validate the advantage of the proposed blind beamforming algorithm in the real-world networks at 3.5 GHz aside from simulations.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Near-Field Sensing (NISE) in Wideband MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of near-field sensing (NISE) in a legacy wideband multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) communication systems is analyzed. The maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) for the target's distance and angle relative to the antenna array are derived. To evaluate the estimation error, closed-form analytical expressions of Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) are derived for both uniform linear arrays (ULAs) and uniform circular arrays (UCAs). The asymptotic CRBs are then analyzed to reveal the scaling laws of CRBs with respect to key system parameters, including array size, bandwidth, and target distance. Our results reveal that 1) the mean-squared error achieved by MLEs approaches CRBs in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime; 2) a larger array aperture does not necessarily improve NISE performance, especially with ultra-large bandwidth; 3) large bandwidth sets an estimation error ceiling for NISE as target distance increases; 4) array aperture and bandwidth, rather than the number of antennas and subcarriers, are the key factors affecting wideband NISE performance; and 5) UCAs offer superior, angle-independent wideband NISE performance compared to ULAs with the same aperture.</description>

      <title>On the Linearization of Optimal Rates for Independent Zero-Error Source and Channel Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-error coding encompasses a variety of source and channel problems where the probability of error must be exactly zero. This condition is stricter than that of the vanishing error regime, where the error probability goes to zero as the code blocklength goes to infinity. In general, zero-error coding is an open combinatorial question. We investigate two unsolved zero-error problems: the source coding problem with side information and the channel coding problem. We focus our attention on families of independent problems for which the distribution decomposes into a product of distributions, corresponding to solved zero-error problems. A crucial step is the linearization property of the optimal rate which does not always hold in the zero-error regime, unlike in the vanishing error regime. We derive a condition under which the linearization properties of the complementary graph entropy $\overline{H}$ for the AND product of graph and for the disjoint union of graphs are equivalent. Then we establish the connection with a recent result obtained by Wigderson and Zuiddam and by Schrijver, for the zero-error capacity $C_0$. As a consequence, we provide new single-letter characterizations of $\overline{H}$ and $C_0$, for example when the graph is a product of perfect graphs, which is not perfect in general, and for the class of graphs obtained by the product of a perfect graph $G$ with the pentagon graph $C_5$. By building on Haemers result for $C_0$, we also show that the linearization of $\overline{H}$ does not hold for the product of the Schl\"{a}fli graph with its complementary graph.</description>

      <title>Assembly Theory Reduced to Shannon Entropy and Rendered Redundant by Naive Statistical Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we give answer to an argument trying to show the divergence of Assembly Theory from LZ compression. We formally proved that any implementation of the concept of `copy number' underlying Assembly Theory (AT) and its assembly index (Ai) is equivalent to Shannon Entropy and not fundamentally or methodologically different from algorithms like ZIP and PNG via an LZ compressing grammar. Here we show that the weak empirical correlation between Ai and LZW, which the authors offered as a defence against the previously proven result that the assembly index calculation method is an LZ scheme, is based on an incomplete and misleading experiment. When the experiment is completed and conducted properly, the asymptotic convergence to LZ compression and Shannon Entropy is evident and aligned with the mathematical proof previously offered. Therefore, this completes both the theoretical and empirical demonstrations that any variation of the copy-number concept underlying AT, which resorts to counting the number of object repetitions `to arrive at a measure for life', is equivalent to statistical compression and Shannon Entropy. We demonstrate that the authors' `we-are-better-because-we-are-worse' defence argument against compression does not withstand basic scrutiny, and that their primary empirical results separating organic from inorganic compounds have not only been previously reported -- sans claims to unify physics and biology -- but are also driven solely by molecular length, not by any special feature of life captured by their assembly index. Finally, we show that Ai is a special case of our Block Decomposition Method introduced almost a decade earlier.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting for Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Performance Analysis and Generative AI Approach</title>

Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) provides a ubiquitous coverage to user equipments (UEs) but it is also susceptible to interference. Ratesplitting (RS) effectively extracts data by decoding interference, yet its effectiveness is limited by the weakest UE. In this paper, we investigate an RS-based CF massive MIMO system, which combines strengths and mitigates weaknesses of both approaches. Considering imperfect channel state information (CSI) resulting from both pilot contamination and noise, we derive a closed-form expression for the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the RS-based CF massive MIMO system under a spatially correlated Rician channel. Moreover, we propose low-complexity heuristic algorithms based on statistical CSI for power-splitting of common messages and power-control of private messages, and genetic algorithm is adopted as a solution for upper bound performance. Furthermore, we formulate a joint optimization problem, aiming to maximize the sum SE of the RS-based CF massive MIMO system by optimizing the power-splitting factor and power-control coefficient. Importantly, we improve a generative AI (GAI) algorithm to address this complex and nonconvexity problem by using a diffusion model to obtain solutions. Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality in mitigating interference, especially in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>On entropic and almost multilinear representability of matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies two notions of generalized matroid representations motivated by algorithmic information theory and cryptographic secret sharing. The first (entropic representability) involves discrete random variables, while the second (almost-multilinear representability) deals with approximate subspace arrangements. In both cases, we prove that determining whether an input matroid has such a representation is undecidable. Consequently, the conditional independence implication problem is also undecidable, providing an independent answer to a question posed by Geiger and Pearl, recently resolved by Cheuk Ting Li. These problems are also closely related to characterizing achievable rates in network coding and constructing secret sharing schemes. For example, another corollary of our work is that deciding whether an access structure admits an ideal secret sharing scheme is undecidable. Our approach reduces undecidable problems from group theory to matroid representation problems. Specifically, we reduce the uniform word problem for finite groups to entropic representability and the word problem for sofic groups to almost-multilinear representability. A key part of this reduction involves modifying group presentations into forms where linear or sofic representations are generic in an appropriate sense when restricted to the generating set.</description>

      <title>Subsampling Suffices for Adaptive Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring that analyses performed on a dataset are representative of the entire population is one of the central problems in statistics. Most classical techniques assume that the dataset is independent of the analyst's query and break down in the common setting where a dataset is reused for multiple, adaptively chosen, queries. This problem of \emph{adaptive data analysis} was formalized in the seminal works of Dwork et al. (STOC, 2015) and Hardt and Ullman (FOCS, 2014).
  We identify a remarkably simple set of assumptions under which the queries will continue to be representative even when chosen adaptively: The only requirements are that each query takes as input a random subsample and outputs few bits. This result shows that the noise inherent in subsampling is sufficient to guarantee that query responses generalize. The simplicity of this subsampling-based framework allows it to model a variety of real-world scenarios not covered by prior work.
  In addition to its simplicity, we demonstrate the utility of this framework by designing mechanisms for two foundational tasks, statistical queries and median finding. In particular, our mechanism for answering the broadly applicable class of statistical queries is both extremely simple and state of the art in many parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>On binomial Weil sums and an application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime, and $N$ be a positive integer not divisible by $p$. Denote by ${\rm ord}_N(p)$ the multiplicative order of $p$ modulo $N$. Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ represent the finite field of order $q=p^{{\rm ord}_N(p)}$. For $a, b\in\mathbb{F}_q$, we define a binomial exponential sum by $$S_N(a,b):=\sum_{x\in\mathbb{F}_q\setminus\{0\}}\chi(ax^{\frac{q-1}{N}}+bx),$$ where $\chi$ is the canonical additive character of $\mathbb{F}_q$. In this paper, we provide an explicit evaluation of $S_{N}(a,b)$ for any odd prime $p$ and any $N$ satisfying ${\rm ord}_{N}(p)=\phi(N)$. Our elementary and direct approach allows for the construction of a class of ternary linear codes, with their exact weight distribution determined. Furthermore, we prove that the dual codes achieve optimality with respect to the sphere packing bound, thereby generalizing previous results from even to odd characteristic fields.</description>

      <title>Testing Dependency of Weighted Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the task of detecting the edge dependency between two weighted random graphs. We formulate this task as a simple hypothesis testing problem, where under the null hypothesis, the two observed graphs are statistically independent, whereas under the alternative, the edges of one graph are dependent on the edges of a uniformly and randomly vertex-permuted version of the other graph. For general edge-weight distributions, we establish thresholds at which optimal testing becomes information-theoretically possible or impossible, as a function of the total number of nodes in the observed graphs and the generative distributions of the weights. Finally, we identify a statistical-computational gap, and present evidence suggesting that this gap is inherent using the framework of low-degree polynomials.</description>
