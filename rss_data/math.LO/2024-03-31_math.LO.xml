      <title>Algorithmic Randomness, Effective Disintegrations, and Rates of Convergence to the Truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: L\'evy's Upward Theorem says that the conditional expectation of an integrable random variable converges with probability one to its true value with increasing information. In this paper, we use methods from effective probability theory to characterise the probability one set along which convergence to the truth occurs, and the rate at which the convergence occurs. We work within the setting of computable probability measures defined on computable Polish spaces and introduce a new general theory of effective disintegrations. We use this machinery to prove our main results, which (1) identify the points along which certain classes of effective random variables converge to the truth in terms of certain classes of algorithmically random points, and which further (2) identify when computable rates of convergence exist. Our convergence results significantly generalize earlier results within a unifying novel abstract framework, and there are no precursors of our results on computable rates of convergence. Finally, we make a case for the importance of our work for the foundations of Bayesian probability theory.</description>

      <title>Mekler's Construction and Murphy's Law for 2-Nilpotent Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mekler's construction is a powerful technique for building purely algebraic structures from combinatorial ones. Its power lies in the fact that it allows various model-theoretic tameness properties of the combinatorial structure to transfer to the algebraic one. In this paper, we push this ideology much further, describing a broad class of properties that transfer through Mekler's construction. This technique subsumes many well-known results and opens avenues for many more.
  As a straightforward application of our methods, we (1) obtain transfer principles for stably embedded pairs of Mekler groups and (2) construct the first examples of strictly $\mathsf{NFOP}_k$ pure groups for all $k\in\mathbb{N}_{&gt;2}$. We also answer a question of Chernikov and Hempel on the transfer of burden.</description>

      <title>A Normalization Theorem in Asymptotic Differential Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the universal exponential extension of an algebraically closed differential field and investigate its properties in the presence of a nice valuation and in connection with linear differential equations. Next we prove normalization theorems for algebraic differential equations over $H$-fields, as a tool in solving such equations in suitable extensions. The results in this monograph are essential in our work on Hardy fields in [6].</description>

      <title>Tannaka-Krein duality for Roelcke-precompact non-archimedean Polish groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let G be a Roelcke-precompact non-archimedean Polish group, B(G) the algebra of matrix coefficients of G arising from its continuous unitary representations. The Gel'fand spectrum H(G) of the norm closure of B(G) is known as the Hilbert compactification of G. Let A be the dense subalgebra of B(G) generated by indicator maps of open cosets in G. We prove that multiplicative linear functionals on A are automatically continuous, generalizing a result of Krein for finite dimensional representations of topological groups. We deduce two abstract realizations of H(G). One is the space P(MG) of partial isomorphisms with algebraically closed domain of MG, the countable set of open cosets of G seen as a homogeneous first order logical structure. The other is T(G) the Tannaka monoid of G. We also obtain that the natural functor that sends G to the category of its representations is full and faithful.</description>

      <title>Analytic holonomicity of real C$^{{\mathrm{exp}}}$-class distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of distributions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, called distributions of C$^{{\mathrm{exp}}}$-class, based on wavelet transforms of distributions and the theory from [6] about C$^{{\mathrm{exp}}}$-class functions. We prove that the framework of C$^{{\mathrm{exp}}}$-class distributions is closed under natural operations, like push-forward, pull-back, derivation and antiderivation, and, in the tempered case, Fourier transforms. Our main result is the (real analytic) holonomicity of all distributions of C$^{{\mathrm{exp}}}$-class.</description>

      <title>Forcing More DC Over the Chang Model Using the Thorn Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of $\mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{DC}$, we force $\mathsf{DC}_\kappa$ for relations on $\mathcal{P}(\kappa)$ for $\kappa{}&lt;\aleph_\omega$ over the Chang model $\mathrm{L}(\mathrm{Ord}^\omega)$ making some assumptions on the thorn sequence defined by ${\it \unicode{xFE}}_0=\omega$, ${\it \unicode{xFE}}_{\alpha{}+1}$ as the least ordinal not a surjective image of ${\it \unicode{xFE}}_\alpha^\omega$ (i.e. no $f:{\it \unicode{xFE}}_{\alpha}^\omega{}\rightarrow {\it \unicode{xFE}}_{\alpha{}+1}$ is surjective) and ${\it \unicode{xFE}}_\gamma{}=\sup_{\alpha{}&lt;\gamma}{\it \unicode{xFE}}_\alpha$ for limit $\gamma$. These assumptions are motivated from results about $\Theta$ in the context of determinacy, and could be reasonable ways of thinking about the Chang model. Explicitly, we assume cardinals $\lambda$ on the thorn sequence are strongly regular (meaning regular and functions $f:\kappa{}^{&lt;\kappa}\rightarrow \lambda$ are bounded whenever $\kappa{}&lt;\lambda$ is on the thorn sequence) and justified (meaning $\mathcal{P}(\kappa^\omega)\cap \mathrm{L}(\mathrm{Ord}^\omega)\subseteq \mathrm{L}_{\lambda}(\lambda^\omega{},X)$ for some $X\subseteq \lambda$ for any $\kappa{}&lt;\lambda$ on the thorn sequence). This allow us to use Cohen forcing and establish more dependent choice.</description>

      <title>A $\Pi^0_2$ Singleton of Minimal Arithmetic Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of the arithmetic degrees (the degree structure induced by relative arithmetic definability, ($\leq_{a}$) the $\omega$-REA sets play a role analogous to the role the r.e. degrees play in the study of the Turing degrees. However, much less is known about the arithmetic degrees and the role of the $\omega$-REA sets in that structure than about the Turing degrees. Indeed, even basic questions such as the existence of a $\omega$-REA set of minimal arithmetic degree are open. This paper makes progress on this question by demonstrating that some promising approaches inspired by the analogy with the r.e sets fail to show that no $\omega$-REA set is arithmetically minimal. Finally, it constructs a $\Pi^0_2$ singleton of minimal arithmetic degree. Not only is this a result of considerable interest in it's own right, constructions of $\Pi^0_2$ singletons often pave the way for constructions of $\omega$-REA sets with similar properties. Along the way, a number of interesting results relating arithmetic reducibility and rates of growth are established.</description>

      <title>Linear Arboreal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arboreal categories, introduced by Abramsky and Reggio, axiomatise categories with tree-shaped objects. These categories provide a categorical language for formalising behavioural notions such as simulation, bisimulation, and resource-indexing. In this paper, we strengthen the axioms of an arboreal category to exclude `branching' behaviour, obtaining a notion of `linear arboreal category'. We then demonstrate that every arboreal category satisfying a linearisability condition has an associated linear arboreal subcategory related via an adjunction. This identifies the relationship between the pebble-relation comonad, of Montacute and Shah, and the pebbling comonad, of Abramsky, Dawar, and Wang, and generalises it further. As another outcome of this new framework, we obtain a linear variant of the arboreal category for modal logic. By doing so we recover different linear-time equivalences between transition systems as instances of their categorical definitions. We conclude with new preservation and characterisation theorems relating trace inclusion and trace equivalence with different linear fragments of modal logic.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic automatic complexity of finite strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new complexity measure for finite strings using probabilistic finite-state automata (PFAs), in the same spirit as existing notions employing DFAs and NFAs, and explore its properties. The PFA complexity $A_P(x)$ is the least number of states of a PFA for which $x$ is the most likely string of its length to be accepted. The variant $A_{P,\delta}(x)$ adds a real-valued parameter $\delta$ specifying a lower bound on the gap in acceptance probabilities between $x$ and other strings. We relate $A_P$ to the DFA and NFA complexities, obtain a complete classification of binary strings with $A_P=2$, and prove $A_{P,\delta}(x)$ is computable for every $x$ and for cofinitely many $\delta$ (depending on $x$). Finally, we discuss several other variations on $A_P$ with a view to obtaining additional desirable properties.</description>

      <title>Complexity of the Model Checking problem for inquisitive propositional and modal logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study the complexity of the model checking problem MC for inquisitive propositional logic InqB and for inquisitive modal logic InqM, that is, the problem of deciding whether a given finite structure for the logic satisfies a given formula. In recent years, this problem has been thoroughly investigated for several variations of dependence and teams logics, systems closely related to inquisitive logic. Building upon some ideas presented by Yang, we prove that the model checking problems for InqB and InqM are both AP-complete.</description>
