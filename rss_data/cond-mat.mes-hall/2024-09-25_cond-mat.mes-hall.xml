      <title>The Viscosity of Liquids in the Dual Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reliable model of viscosity in liquids using a dual liquid model framework is developed. The analytical expression arrived at exhibits the correct T-dependence Arrhenius-like. It is compared with the values of viscosity for water with acceptable accuracy and those related to the mechano-thermal effect in liquids under low-frequency shear. It has even been shown that a numerical approach of viscosity in liquids dealt with as dual systems provides good agreement with experimental data. The expression of viscosity shows an explicit dependence upon the sound velocity and the collective vibratory degrees of freedom excited at a given temperature. The terms involved depend upon the Boltzmann and Planck constants. Finally, the physical model is coherent with the postulate of microscopic reversibility as well as with the time's arrow for macroscopic dissipative mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Switching of magnetic domains in a noncollinear antiferromagnet at the nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets that display very small stray magnetic field are ideal for spintronic applications. Of particular interest are non-collinear, chiral antiferromagnets of the type Mn3X (X=Sn, Ge), which display a large magnetotransport response that is correlated with their antiferromagnetic ordering. The ability to read out and manipulate this ordering is crucial for their integration into spintronic devices. These materials exhibit a tiny unbalanced magnetic moment such that a large external magnetic field can, in principle, be used to set the material into a single antiferromagnetic domain. However, in thin films of Mn3Sn, we find that such fields induce only a partial magnetic ordering. By detecting two orthogonal in-plane components of the magnetic order vector, we find that the non-switchable fraction has a unidirectional anisotropy. This also enables us to visualize switching along multiple easy axes in Mn3Sn. Studying the switching at the nanoscale allows us to correlate the pining behavior to crystal grain boundaries in the Mn3Sn nanowire structures.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement and quantum geometry measured with inelastic X-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS), we experimentally investigate the quantum geometry and quantum information in the large-gap insulator, LiF. Using sum rules for the density-density response function measured in IXS, we compute the quantum Fisher information of the equilibrium density matrix of LiF associated with density perturbations. Next, by exploiting universal relations between the quantum Fisher information, the optical conductivity, and the quantum metric tensor, we extrapolate the diagonal $(h,k,l) = (1,0,0)$ component of the quantum metric of LiF, known as the quantum weight. We compare our results to recently-proposed bounds on the quantum weight and find that LiF resides near the lower bound, supporting the general understanding of this material as a highly localized, ionic insulator. Our work serves as a proof-of-principle that IXS techniques can be used to quantify state-of-the-art quantum geometric quantities of materials.</description>

      <title>Detection of terahertz radiation using topological graphene micro-nanoribbon structures with transverse plasmonic resonant cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lateral interdigital array of the graphene microribbons (GMRs) on the h-BN substrate connected by narrow graphene nanoribbon (GNR) bridges serves as an efficient detector of terahertz (THz) radiation. The detection is enabled by the nonlinear GNR elements providing the rectification of the THz signals. The excitation of plasmonic waves along the GMRs (transverse plasmonic oscillations) by impinging THz radiation can lead to a strong resonant amplification of the rectified signal current and substantial enhancement of the detector response. The GMR arrays with the GNR bridges s can be formed by the perforation of uniform graphene layers</description>

      <title>1/2 Z Topological Invariants and the Half Quantized Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The half-quantized Hall phase represents a unique metallic or semi-metallic state of matter characterized by a fractional quantum Hall conductance, precisely half of an integer $\nu$ multiple of $e^{2}/h$. Here we demonstrate the existence of a novel $\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}$ topological invariant that sets the half-quantized Hall phase apart from two-dimensional ordinary metallic ferromagnets. The $\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}$ classification is determined by the line integral of the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductance, which is safeguarded by two distinct categories of local unitary and anti-unitary symmetries in proximity to the Fermi surface of electron states. We further validate the $\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}$ topological order in the context of the quantized Hall phase by examining semi-magnetic topological insulator $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3}$ film for $\nu=1$ and topological crystalline insulator SnTe films for $\nu=2$ or $4$. Our findings pave the way for future exploration and understanding of topological metals and their unique properties.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously enhancing brightness and purity of WSe$_2$ single photon emitter using high-aspect-ratio nanopillar array on metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer semiconductor transferred on nanopillar arrays provides site-controlled, on-chip single photon emission, which is a scalable light source platform for quantum technologies. However, the brightness of these emitters reported to date often falls short of the perceived requirement for such applications. Also, the single photon purity usually degrades as the brightness increases. Hence, there is a need for a design methodology to achieve enhanced emission rate while maintaining high single photon purity. Using WSe$_2$ on high-aspect-ratio ($\sim 3$ - at least two-fold higher than previous reports) nanopillar arrays, here we demonstrate $&gt;10$ MHz single photon emission rate in the 770-800 nm band that is compatible with quantum memory and repeater networks (Rb-87-D1/D2 lines), and satellite quantum communication. The emitters exhibit excellent purity (even at high emission rates) and improved out-coupling due to the use of a gold back reflector that quenches the emission away from the nanopillar.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As for the study of Landau level wavefunctions for the quantum Hall effect, the magnetic translation group and the magnetic Bloch wavefunctions are extensively investigated in the past few decades. It is natural to ask what is its electric counterpart. In this article, the electric translation group is defined as well as the electric Brillouin zone, which is applied to the problem of one dimensional tight-binding model under an external electric field. The spectrum of electric Floquet-Bloch states can be generated by the projective representation of electric translation group, and the topological properties of these states are investigated.</description>

      <title>Spatial mapping of magnetization fluctuations via time-lapse Kerr microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining wide-field magneto-optical Kerr microscopy with a time-lapse analysis scheme allows investigating magnetization fluctuations with high spatial as well as temporal resolution. We here use this technique to study magnetization fluctuations in a thin ferromagnetic film prepared into a quasi-equilibrium magnetic state via a dedicated field sweep protocol. Our experiments reveal spatially localized noise hotspots distributed across the sample surface within the magnetic domains in the quasi-equilibrium state. The spatial density of the noise hot spots is very similar at different low magnetic field strengths, as expected from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The measurement scheme thus opens the way for the spatially resolved investigation of quasi-equilibrium noise processes in magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced surface plasmon control of ultrafast melting modes in Au nanorods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoinduced ultrafast phenomena in materials exhibiting nonequilibrium behavior can lead to the emergence of exotic phases beyond the limits of thermodynamics, presenting opportunities for femtosecond photoexcitation. Despite extensive research, the ability to actively control quantum materials remains elusive owing to the lack of clear evidence demonstrating the explicit control of phase-changing kinetics through light-matter interactions. To address this drawback, we leveraged single-pulse time-resolved X-ray imaging of Au nanorods undergoing photoinduced melting to showcase control over the solid-to-liquid transition process through the use of localized surface plasmons. Our study uncovers transverse or longitudinal melting processes accompanied by characteristic oscillatory distortions at different laser intensities. Numerical simulations confirm that the localized surface plasmons, excited by polarized laser fields, dictate the melting modes through anharmonic lattice deformations. These results provide direct evidence of photoinduced surface plasmon-mediated ultrafast control of matter, establishing a foundation for the customization of material kinetics using femtosecond laser fields.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Spin Nernst Effect and Chiral Edge Modes in van der Waals Ferromagnetic Insulators: Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vs. Kitaev Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermomagnetic Nernst effect and chiral edge states are key signatures of nontrivial topology and emerging Berry curvature in magnonic systems. Implementing atomistic spin simulations, we theoretically demonstrate the emergence of chiral magnon edge states at the boundaries of a ferromagnetic hexagonal lattice in the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and Kitaev interactions, which are robust against nonlinear magnon interactions. In our simulations, we consider the spin parameters of CrI$_3$ as a prototype of van der Waals magnetic layers. We show that the spin accumulation is reduced in the presence of Kitaev spin interactions compared to systems governed by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This reduction stems from the breaking of the $U(1)$ symmetry, which leads to a shorter spin coherence length imposed by the Kitaev interaction. We propose that measuring the angular dependence of the Nernst signal in a magnetic field provides an effective indirect method for identifying the microscopic origin of topological magnons. Our findings hold promising potential for advancing next-generation energy-harvesting Nernst materials and facilitating the integration of topological magnetic materials with spintronic-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Transverse voltage in anisotropic hydrodynamic conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak momentum dissipation in ultra-clean metals gives rise to novel non-Ohmic current flow, including ballistic and hydrodynamic regimes. Recently, hydrodynamic flow has attracted intense interest because it presents a valuable window into the electronic correlations and the longest lived collective modes of quantum materials. However, diagnosing viscous flow is difficult as the macroscopic observables of ballistic and hydrodynamic transport such as the average current distribution can be deceptively similar, even if their respective microscopics deviate notably. Based on kinetic Boltzmann theory, here we propose to address this issue via the transverse channel voltage at zero magnetic field, which can efficiently detect hydrodynamic flow in a number of materials. To this end, we show that the transverse voltage is sensitive to the interplay between anisotropic fermiology and boundary scattering, resulting in a non-trivial behavior in narrow channels along crystalline low-symmetry directions. We discuss several materials where the channel-size dependent stress of the quantum fluid leads to a characteristic sign change of the transverse voltage as a new hallmark of the cross-over from the ballistic to the hydrodynamic regime.</description>

      <title>Theory of Polar Skyrmions in Layered Structure of Ferroelectric Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovery of polar skyrmions on the (PbTiO$_3$)$_n$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_n$ superlattice in the absence of any known interaction, which can orient electric polarizations at a point with respect to its neighboring points, is enigmatic. We here show that the coupling of the electric polarization and strain at each layer is responsible for orienting polarizations. We formulate coupled Euler equations for electric polarization and elastic displacement vectors, and solve to find skyrmion solution for a range of electric fields with unique topological number in each layer. The types of skyrmions vary from Neel to Bloch depending on the position of the layers in the superlattice, as observed in the experiments.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Photogalvanic Effects in Two-Dimensional Multiferroic Breathing Kagome Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroic materials, known for their multiple tunable orders, present an exceptional opportunity to manipulate nonlinear optical responses, which are sensitive to symmetry. In this study, we propose leveraging electric and magnetic fields to selectively control and switch specific types of photogalvanic effects in two-dimensional multiferroic breathing kagome materials. Taking monolayer Nb3I8 as an example, we demonstrate that the shift current, characterized by the real-space shift of electrons and holes, is predominantly unaffected by magnetic order. In contrast, injection current, featured by quantum metric dipole in momentum space, is closely related to valley polarization which can be controlled by magnetic field. Furthermore, both photocurrents can be reversed by out-of-plane electric field via the lattice breathing. Our findings reveal the potential of multiferroic beathing kagome structures for multifunctional optoelectronic applications and sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subwavelength ring-shaped structures of quantum emitters exhibit outstanding radiation properties and are useful for antennas, excitation transport, and storage. Taking inspiration from the oligomeric geometry of biological light-harvesting 2 (LH2) complexes, we study here generic examples and predict highly efficient excitation transfer in a three-dimensional (3D) subwavelength concentric stacked ring structure with a diameter of 400 \textit{nm}, formed by two-level atoms. Utilizing the quantum optical open system master equation approach for the collective dipole dynamics, we demonstrate that, depending on the system parameters, our bio-mimicked 3D ring enables efficient excitation transfer between two ring layers. Our findings open prospects for engineering other biomimetic light-matter platforms and emitter arrays to achieve efficient energy transfer.</description>

      <title>Single-crystalline GaAs/Si Heterojunction Tunnel Diodes Interfaced by an Ultrathin Oxygen-enriched Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the fabrication and characteristics of GaAs/Si p+/n+ heterojunction tunnel diodes. These diodes were fabricated via grafting the freestanding single-crystalline p-type degenerately doped GaAs (4E19 cm-3) nanomembrane (NM) onto single-crystalline n-type Si (5E19 cm-3) substrate. At the heterointerface, an amorphous ultrathin oxygen-enriched layer (UOL) was intentionally engineered through chemical oxidation and atomic layer deposition (ALD). Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirmed the formation of the UOL and the single crystallinity of the grafted junction. The resulting tunnel diodes consistently exhibited negative differential resistance (NDR) behavior at room temperature, with a high maximum peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR) of 36.38, valley voltages ranging from 1.3 to 1.8 V, and a peak tunneling current density of 0.95 kA/cm2. This study not only highlights the critical roles of the UOL as both an interface improvement layer and a quantum tunneling medium, but also establishes "semiconductor grafting" as an effective and versatile method for high-performance, lattice-mismatched heterojunction devices.</description>

      <title>Kohn-Luttinger Mechanism of Superconductivity in Twisted Bilayer WSe$_2$: Gate-Tunable Unconventional Pairing Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, we theoretically investigate the pairing instability induced by Coulomb interaction via the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. Within random phase approximation, we show that the Coulomb repulsion is strongly screened around the mori\'e length scale, resulting in attractive regimes that facilitate electron pairing in unconventional channels. By solving the linearized gap equation, we find that the maxima of the superconducting critical temperature occur at the van Hove singularities in the density of states, with magnitude on the order of $\sim$0.2 K, comparable with experimental observations. Moreover, we identify a phase transition from an $f$-wave-like pairing state to a doubly degenerate $d$-wave-like pairing state upon increasing the electric displacement field. These findings provide a purely electronic explanation of the superconducting state observed in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, offering insights into the interplay between superconductivity and other correlated states in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>The Arrhenius Law Prefactor in Permalloy Mesoscale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Arrhenius equation was used to describe the dynamics of two-state switching in mesoscale, ferromagnetic particles. Using square, permalloy dots as an idealized two-state switching system, measurements of the prefactor of the Arrhenius law changed by 26 decades over barrier heights from 30 meV to 700 meV. Measurements of the prefactor ratios for a two well system revealed significant deviations from the common interpretation of the Arrhenius law. The anomalous Arrhenius prefactors and the prefactor ratios can be fitted to a modified model that includes entropic contributions to two-state transitions. Similar considerations are likely for the application of the Arrhenius law to other mesoscale systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced magnetoelectric coupling in two-dimensional hybrid multiferroic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric coupling in insulating multiferroic materials is invaluable for both fundamental research and multifunctional device applications. However, material realization remains a significant challenge. We employ first-principles calculations to predict an enhanced and stacking-robust magnetoelectric coupling in a multiferroic van der Waals heterostructure consisting of CrCl3 and CuCrP2S6. Within this heterostructure, the intralayer ferroic orders exhibit characteristics of a type-I multiferroic, while the interlayer ferroic orders resemble those of a type-II multiferroic, thus creating a hybrid-type multiferroic. Notably, the interlayer magnetic configuration can be switched upon electric polarization reversal, while maintaining the insulating property without any nontrivial phase transitions. Our analysis reveals a strongly interfacial spin local-field effect and proximity polarization effect on band alignments. These factors work synergistically to decide the interlayer exchange interaction and drive enhanced magnetoelectric coupling. Finally, we show that this magnetoelectric effect is robust in multi-layer structures, exhibiting a dependence on the layer number's parity. This research offers promising prospects for discovering enhanced magnetoelectric couplings in hybrid multiferroic van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Raman Spectra and Excitonic Effects of the novel Ta$_2$Ni$_3$Te$_5$ Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the Raman spectrum and excitonic effects of the novel two-dimensional Ta$_2$Ni$_3$Te$_5$ structure. The monolayer is an indirect band gap semiconductor with an electronic band gap value of 0.09 eV and 0.38 eV, determined using GGA-PBE and HSE06 exchange-correlation functionals, respectively. Since this structure is energetically, dynamically, and mechanically stable, it could be synthesized as a free-standing material. We identify ten Raman and ten infrared active modes for various laser energies, including those commonly used in Raman spectroscopy experiments. It was also observed that the contribution of Ni atoms is minimal in most Raman vibrational modes. In contrast, most infrared vibrational modes do not involve the vibration of the Ta atoms. As far as the optical properties are concerned, this monolayer shows a robust linear anisotropy, an exciton binding energy of 287 meV, and also presents a high reflectivity in the ultraviolet region, which is more intense for linear light polarization along the x-direction.</description>

      <title>Evidence of $\phi$0-Josephson junction from skewed diffraction patterns in Sn-InSb nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00199v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Josephson junctions based on InSb nanowires with Sn shells. We observe skewed critical current diffraction patterns: the maxima in forward and reverse current bias are at different magnetic flux, with a displacement of 20-40 mT. The skew is greatest when the external field is nearly perpendicular to the nanowire, in the substrate plane. This orientation suggests that spin-orbit interaction plays a role. We develop a phenomenological model and perform tight-binding calculations, both methods reproducing the essential features of the experiment. The effect modeled is the $\phi$0-Josephson junction with higher-order Josephson harmonics. The system is of interest for Majorana studies: the effects are either precursor to or concomitant with topological superconductivity. Current-phase relations that lack inversion symmetry can also be used to design quantum circuits with engineered nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Orbital Hall Conductivity in a Graphene/Haldane and Haldane/Haldane Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the orbital Hall conductivity in bilayer graphene (G/G) by modifying one or both the layers as Haldane type ($\rm G/ \tilde G$ : Graphene/Haldane and $\rm \tilde G/ \tilde G$ : Haldane/Haldane) with the inclusion of next nearest neighbour (NNN) hopping strength ($t_2$) and flux ($\phi$). It is observed that the low energy bands of $\rm G/ \tilde G$ and $\rm \tilde G/ \tilde G$ are isolated with a gap at charge neutrality with the next nearest neighbour (NNN) hopping term $t_2e^{\pm i\phi}$. The time reversal (\textit{TR}) symmetry breaking with $t_2e^{\pm i\phi}$ induces a large orbital magnetic moment ($\vb{m}_n(\vb{k})$) for the $n^{th}$ band in $\rm G/ \tilde G$ and $\rm \tilde G/ \tilde G$ bilayers. This \textit{TR} symmetry breaking, modulated by the $t_2$ strength, leads to the emergence of {\it Orbital Ferromagnetism} and {\it Valley Orbital Magnetism} within the BZ for the Haldane single layer as well for both $\rm G/ \tilde G$ and $\rm \tilde G/ \tilde G$. We show that for the applied longitudinal electric fields, the intrinsic angular momentum ($L^z$) gives the orbital current ($\mathcal{J}^{z,orb}$) along a transverse direction and generates the orbital Hall conductivity (OHC). We further show that the orbital magnetic polarity leads the Haldane single layer to {\it Orbital Chern Insulator} with the quantized OHC in the gap over the occupied bands. Moreover, the accumulation of orbital magnetic moment of the bands in Haldane graphene bilayer shows {\it Quantum Orbital Hall Insulator} and {\it Orbital Chern Insulators}. Similarly, we show that in the hetero-bilayers, one of the layers of the Haldane type generates the orbital magnetism and induces the OHC. We conclude that the isolated bands in Haldane graphene bilayers with external stimuli are of an orbital nature and have various quantum orbital Hall phases.</description>

      <title>Non-quasiconvex dispersion of composite fermions and the fermionic Haffnian state in the first-excited Landau level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been puzzling that fractional quantum Hall states in the first excited Landau level (1LL) often differ significantly from their counterparts in the lowest Landau level. We show that the dispersion of composite fermions (CFs) is a deterministic factor driving the distinction. We find that CFs with two quantized vortices in the 1LL have a non-quasiconvex dispersion. Consequently, in the filling fraction $7/3$, CFs occupy the second $\Lambda$-level instead of the first. The corresponding ground state wave function, based on the CF wave function ansatz, is identified to be the fermionic Haffnian wave function rather than the Laughlin wave function. The conclusion is supported by numerical evidence from exact diagonalizations in both disk and spherical geometries. Furthermore, we show that the dispersion becomes quasiconvex in wide quantum wells or for CFs with four quantized vortices in the filling fraction $11/5$, coinciding with observations that the distinction between the Landau levels disappears under these circumstances.</description>

      <title>Symmetry constraints on topological invariants and irreducible band representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: EBR is considered the building block in TQC and fundamental concept in SI methods. One of the hypophysis is that a fully occupied EBR has zero Berry-Wilczek-Zee phase and those occupied corresponds to trivial topology. Associated with it are the concepts of atomic limit and equivalence between BRs. In this manuscript, an explicit link between the BWZ phase of connected bands and that of its EBR or irreducible band representation (IBR) basis is established. When gapped system occurs under the TB model, the relation between the BWZ phase of a set of connected bands and its BR basis only persist if the later are IBRs. Thus the BWZ phase can be evaluated in terms of the IBRs. Equivalent segments of path integral of BWZ connection with respect to IBRs are established as representation of the space group and selection rule for corresponding BWZ phase established where possible. The occurrence of IBRs is rooted in real space symmetry but dependent on dynamic interaction and band topology. Three gapped systems in honeycomb lattices are discussed. Two spin-less cases are shown to be topologically trivial, whereas the selection rule cannot be developed for the spin-full pz orbital as in graphene. Two necessary conditions for topologically trivial phase are established, namely 1.Connected bands having the same closed set of IBR basis for all k and, 2.The reduced tensor element for the path integral of BWZ connection for such basis is symmetry forbidden due to contractable close loop having zero BWZ phase. Thus the IBRs are the building block of topologically trivial phase and symmetry constraint on BWZ phase are obtained through IBRs and selection rules via Wigner-Eckart theorem. Some examples demonstrate that the basic hypothesis of SI method is false. The analysis here advocate a paradigm shift from EBR to IBR as building block of topologically trivial phase.</description>

      <title>Thermolectricity in irradiated bilayer graphene flakes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE) performance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily polarized light, focusing on $AA$- and $AB$-stacked configurations with zigzag edges. Utilizing a combination of tight-binding theory and density functional theory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on electronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the electronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function, which significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the overall {\it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT calculations reveal that $AB$-stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal conductivity compared to $AA$-stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic scattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM exceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the irradiation-induced gap. Additionally, we explore the dependence of FOM on the system dimensions and temperature, demonstrating that light-irradiated BLG holds great promise for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and waste heat recovery. Our results show favorable responses over a wide range of irradiation parameters. These findings provide crucial insights into optimizing BLG for advanced TE applications through light-induced modifications.</description>

      <title>Individually tunable tunnelling coefficients in optical lattices using local periodic driving</title>

Abstract: Ultracold atoms in optical lattices have emerged as powerful quantum simulators of translationally invariant systems with many applications in e.g.\ strongly-correlated and topological systems. However, the ability to locally tune all Hamiltonian parameters remains an outstanding goal that would enable the simulation of a wider range of quantum phenomena. Motivated by recent advances in quantum gas microscopes and optical tweezers, we here show theoretically how local control over individual tunnelling links in an optical lattice can be achieved by incorporating local time-periodic potentials. We propose to periodically modulate the on-site energy of individual lattice sites and employ Floquet theory to demonstrate how this provides full individual control over the tunnelling amplitudes in one dimension. We provide various example configurations realising interesting topological models such as extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models that would be challenging to realise by other means. Extending to two dimensions, we demonstrate that local periodic driving in a Lieb lattice engineers a 2D network with fully controllable tunnelling magnitudes. In a three-site plaquette, we show full simultaneous control over the relative tunnelling amplitudes and the gauge-invariant flux piercing the plaquette, providing a clear stepping stone to building a fully programmable 2D tight-binding model. We also explicitly demonstrate how utilise our technique to generate a magnetic field gradient in 2D. This local modulation scheme is applicable to many different lattice geometries.</description>

      <title>Universal collective Larmor-Silin mode emerging in magnetized correlated Dirac fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14358v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we find that in the magnetized interacting Dirac fermion model there emerges a universal collective Larmor-Silin spin wave mode in the transverse dynamical spin susceptibility. Such mode purely originates from the interaction among Dirac fermions and distinguishes itself from the usual particle-hole continuum with finite lifetime and clear dispersion, both at small and large momenta in a large portion of the Brillouin zone. Our unbiased numerical results offer the dynamic signature of this collective excitation in interacting Dirac fermion systems, and provide experimental guidance for inelastic neutron scattering, electron spin resonance, and other spectroscopic approaches in the investigation of such universal collective modes in quantum Moire materials, topological insulators, and quantum spin liquid materials under magnetic field, with quintessential interaction nature beyond the commonly assumed noninteracting Dirac fermion or spinon approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Janus VSBrI monolayer, identified by first-principles calculations, emerges as a promising semiconducting material with desirable ferromagnetic and ferroelectric properties. It's in-plane magnetic anisotropic energy is up to 460 $\mu$eV/V , and in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric strain coefficients are larger than many other known two-dimensional materials. The energy variations among different magnetic states show a strong correlate with polarization. Interestingly, the stability of the ferroelectric phase can be further enhanced by the application of biaxial tensile strain. These intriguing properties make the Janus VSBrI monolayer highly desirable for practical applications in piezoelectronic devices, and a promising candidate for multifunctional spintronic devices.</description>
