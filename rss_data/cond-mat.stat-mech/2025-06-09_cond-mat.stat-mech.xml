      <title>Emergent Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless deconfinement in super-Coulombic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistical mechanics of two-dimensional "super-Coulombic" plasmas, namely, neutral plasmas with power-law interactions longer-ranged than Coulomb. To that end, we employ numerically exact large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Contrary to naive energy-entropy arguments, we observe a charge confinement-deconfinement transition as a function of temperature. Remarkably, the transition lies in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) universality class. Our results corroborate recent dielectric medium and renormalization group calculations predicting effective long-scale Coulomb interactions in microscopically super-Coulombic gases. We explicitly showcase this novel dielectric screening phenomenon, capturing the emergent Coulomb potential and the associated crossover length scale. This is achieved by utilizing a new test charge based methodology for determining effective inter-particle interactions. Lastly, we show that this Coulomb emergence and the associated BKT transition occur universally across generic interactions and densities.</description>

      <title>Ground states of classical spin polygons: Rigorous results and examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the lowest energy configurations (LECs) of classical spin polygons characterized by arbitrary couplings between neighboring spin sites. Our study shows that these ground states exhibit either collinear or coplanar arrangements, which allows us to determine the precise boundaries between these two phases. By simultaneously applying a spin flip and a bond inversion, we simplify the LEC problem and reduce it to a specific scenario with predominantly ferromagnetic (FM) bonds and a single antiferromagnetic (AFM) bond. Hence, competing interactions are always present, but, nevertheless, in the well-defined ranges of the system parameters the collinear LEC is realized. The difference angles between neighboring spins within the LEC can be captured by a single Lagrange parameter. We analytically investigate its dependence on the AFM bond and arrive at revealing results. Similarly, we can analyze the energy of the LEC, which shows a pronounced maximum as a function of AFM bond. To illustrate our findings, we give various examples that clearly demonstrate these results.</description>

      <title>Load-Dependent Power-Law Exponent in Creep Rupture of Heterogeneous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creep tests on heterogeneous materials under subcritical loading typically show a power-law decaying strain rate before failure, with the exponent often considered material-dependent but independent of applied stress. By imposing successive small stress relaxations through a displacement feedback loop, we probe creep dynamics and show experimentally that this exponent varies with both applied load and loading direction. Simulations of a disordered fiber bundle model reproduce this load dependence, demonstrating that such models capture essential features of delayed rupture dynamics.</description>

      <title>Transient and steady-state chaos in dissipative quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative quantum chaos plays a central role in the characterization and control of information scrambling, non-unitary evolution, and thermalization, but it still lacks a precise definition. The Grobe-Haake-Sommers conjecture, which links Ginibre level repulsion to classical chaotic dynamics, was recently shown to fail [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. We properly restore the quantum-classical correspondence through a dynamical approach based on entanglement entropy and out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), which reveal signatures of chaos beyond spectral statistics. Focusing on the open anisotropic Dicke model, we identify two distinct regimes: transient chaos, marked by rapid early-time growth of entanglement and OTOCs followed by low saturation values, and steady-state chaos, characterized by high long-time values. We introduce a random matrix toy model and show that Ginibre spectral statistics signals short-time chaos rather than steady-state chaos. Our results establish entanglement dynamics and OTOCs as reliable diagnostics of dissipative quantum chaos across different timescales.</description>

      <title>On the completeness of the $\delta_{KLS}$-generalized statistical field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a field-theoretic tool that enable us to evaluate the critical exponents of $\delta_{KLS}$-generalized systems undergoing continuous phase transitions, namely $\delta_{KLS}$-generalized statistical field theory. It generalizes the standard Boltzmann-Gibbs through the introduction of the $\delta_{KLS}$ parameter from which Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics is recovered in the limit $\delta_{KLS}\rightarrow 0$. From the results for the critical exponents we provide the referred physical interpretation for the $\delta_{KLS}$ parameter. Although new generalized universality classes emerge, we show that they are incomplete for describing the behavior of some real materials. This task is fulfilled only for nonextensive statistical field theory, which is related to fractal derivative and multifractal geometries, up to the moment, for our knowledge.</description>

      <title>When can in-context learning generalize out of task distribution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize \emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem influence the transition.</description>

      <title>The influence of multi-dimensionality and off-diagonal non-Markovian friction coupling on coarse-grained dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse-graining complex molecular systems to lower-dimensional reaction coordinates is a powerful approach for capturing their effective dynamics. The generalized Langevin equation (GLE) provides an exact framework for modeling coarse-grained dynamics, and is particularly useful when non-Markovian effects are significant. While one-dimensional GLE models are commonly used, many systems require multi-dimensional reaction coordinates to account for coupled dynamics. Here, we study the GLE formalism for multi-dimensional reaction coordinates, incorporating a memory matrix to quantify non-Markovian frictional coupling between coordinates, and a multi-dimensional potential. Using the GLE model, in conjunction with a multi-dimensional Markovian embedding scheme, we investigate different systems that are characterized by two-dimensional reaction coordinates, namely the dihedral dynamics of pentane and alanine dipeptide, obtained from molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water. We identify significant off-diagonal friction couplings arising from intramolecular and hydrodynamic interactions. Unlike previous studies, our results highlight the critical role of different terms in the multi-dimensional GLE in accurately capturing key dynamical properties, including mean first-passage times and mean-squared displacements, particularly in systems with coupled non-Markovian coordinates.</description>

      <title>Anomalous flow in correlated quantum systems: No-go result and multiple-charge scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated quantum systems can exhibit thermodynamic behaviors that defy classical expectations, with anomalous energy flow (AEF) against temperature gradients serving as a paradigmatic example. While AEF has been shown to arise from the consumption of initial quantum correlations, little is known about whether AEF can occur without correlation depletion, or if analogous anomalous transport exists for conserved charges beyond energy. Here, we develop a general global-local thermodynamic approach to describe charge exchange between arbitrary correlated quantum systems. For energy-conserving systems, we analytically rule out AEF in initially uncorrelated states, even with the involvement of quantum catalysts, thereby complementing existing studies. In contrast, in systems with multiple conserved charges, we uncover a mechanism for AEF that requires no initial correlations but is instead induced by a drag effect from normal flows of non-energy charges. Furthermore, by treating all conserved charges on equal footing, we generalize AEF to a broader concept of anomalous charge flow, applicable to any conserved charge. We confirm theoretical expectations with numerical examples. These findings deepen our understanding of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics and open new avenues for controlling transport phenomena in correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>An Optimized Franz-Parisi Criterion and its Equivalence with SQ Lower Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bandeira et al. (2022) introduced the Franz-Parisi (FP) criterion for characterizing the computational hard phases in statistical detection problems. The FP criterion, based on an annealed version of the celebrated Franz-Parisi potential from statistical physics, was shown to be equivalent to low-degree polynomial (LDP) lower bounds for Gaussian additive models, thereby connecting two distinct approaches to understanding the computational hardness in statistical inference. In this paper, we propose a refined FP criterion that aims to better capture the geometric ``overlap" structure of statistical models. Our main result establishes that this optimized FP criterion is equivalent to Statistical Query (SQ) lower bounds -- another foundational framework in computational complexity of statistical inference. Crucially, this equivalence holds under a mild, verifiable assumption satisfied by a broad class of statistical models, including Gaussian additive models, planted sparse models, as well as non-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA), single-index (SI) models, and convex truncation detection settings. For instance, in the case of convex truncation tasks, the assumption is equivalent with the Gaussian correlation inequality (Royen, 2014) from convex geometry.
  In addition to the above, our equivalence not only unifies and simplifies the derivation of several known SQ lower bounds -- such as for the NGCA model (Diakonikolas et al., 2017) and the SI model (Damian et al., 2024) -- but also yields new SQ lower bounds of independent interest, including for the computational gaps in mixed sparse linear regression (Arpino et al., 2023) and convex truncation (De et al., 2023).</description>

      <title>Biased random walk on random networks in presence of stochastic resetting: Exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider biased random walks on random networks constituted by a random comb comprising a backbone with quenched-disordered random-length branches. The backbone and the branches run in the direction of the bias. For the bare model as also when the model is subject to stochastic resetting, whereby the walkers on the branches reset with a constant rate to the respective backbone sites, we obtain exact stationary-state static and dynamic properties for a given disorder realization of branch lengths sampled following an arbitrary distribution. We derive a criterion to observe in the stationary state a non-zero drift velocity along the backbone. For the bare model, we discuss the occurrence of a drift velocity that is non-monotonic as a function of the bias, becoming zero beyond a threshold bias because of walkers trapped at very long branches. Further, we show that resetting allows the system to escape trapping, resulting in a drift velocity that is finite at any bias.</description>

Abstract: The transition probability for a one-dimensional discrete symmetric random walk under a reflecting barrier was once given by the method of images. [S. Chandrasekhar, Rev. Mod. Phys. 15, 1 (1943).] However, several inconsistencies have been reported when the method of images is applied in cases where a reflecting barrier is considered, even after the exact solution has been obtained. Here, we explicitly show that the method of images becomes applicable if the image position is shifted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boltzmann sampling plays a key role in numerous algorithms, including those in machine learning. While quantum annealers have been explored as fast Boltzmann samplers, their reliance on environmental noise limits control over the effective temperature, introducing uncertainties in the sampling process. As an alternative, we propose diabatic quantum annealing -- a faster, purely unitary process -- as a controllable Boltzmann sampler, where the effective temperature is tuned via the annealing rate. Using infinite-range and two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising models, we show that this approach enables rapid and accurate sampling in the high-temperature regime, with errors remaining bounded in the paramagnetic phase, regardless of system size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a hydrodynamic framework for describing monitored classical stochastic processes. We study the conditional ensembles for these monitored processes -- i.e., we compute spacetime correlation functions conditioned on a fixed, typical measurement record. In the presence of global symmetries we show that these conditional ensembles can undergo measurement-induced "sharpening" phase transitions as a function of the monitoring rate; moreover, even weak monitoring can give rise to novel critical phases, derived entirely from a classical perspective. We give a simple hydrodynamic derivation of the known charge-sharpening transition for diffusive many-body quantum systems. We show that although the unmonitored symmetric and asymmetric exclusion processes are in different universality classes of transport, their conditional ensembles flow to the same fixed point with emergent relativistic invariance under monitoring. On the other hand, weakly monitored systems with non-Abelian symmetries enter a novel strongly coupled fixed point with non-trivial dynamical exponent, which we characterize. Our formalism naturally accounts for monitoring general observables, such as currents or density gradients, and allows for a direct calculation of information-theoretic diagnostics of sharpening transitions, including the Shannon entropy of the measurement record.</description>

Abstract: We present a method to design driving protocols that achieve fast thermal equilibration of a system of interest using techniques inspired by machine learning training algorithms. For example, consider a Brownian particle manipulated by optical tweezers. The force on the particle can be controlled and adjusted over time, resulting in a driving protocol that transitions the particle from an initial state to a final state. Once the driving protocol has been completed, the system requires additional time to relax to thermal equilibrium. Designing driving protocols that bypass the relaxation period is of interest so that, at the end of the protocol, the system is either in thermal equilibrium or very close to it. Several studies have addressed this problem through reverse engineering methods, which involve prescribing a specific evolution for the probability density function of the system and then deducing the corresponding form of the driving protocol potential. Here, we propose a new method that can be applied to more complex systems where reverse engineering is not feasible. We simulate the evolution of a large ensemble of trajectories while tracking the gradients with respect to a parametrization of the driving protocol. The final probability density function is compared to the target equilibrium one. Using machine learning libraries, the gradients are computed via backpropagation and the protocol is iteratively adjusted until the optimal protocol is achieved. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with several examples.</description>

      <title>Counting observables in stochastic excursions</title>

Abstract: Understanding fluctuations of observables across stochastic trajectories is essential for various fields of research, from quantum thermal machines to biological motors. We introduce the notion of stochastic excursions as a framework to analyze sub-trajectories of processes far from equilibrium. Given a partition of state space in two phases, labeled active and inactive, an excursion starts with a transition into the active phase and ends upon returning to inactivity. By incorporating counting observables, our approach captures finite-time fluctuations and trajectory-level behavior, providing insights on thermodynamic trade-offs between energy expenditure, entropy production, and dynamical activity. As our main result, we uncover a fundamental relation between fluctuations of counting observables at the single-excursion level and the steady state noise obtained from full counting statistics. We also show the existence of an exchange-type fluctuation theorem at the level of individual excursions. As an application, we explore how analyzing excursions yields additional insights into the operation of the three-qubit absorption refrigerator.</description>

      <title>Inferring entropy production in many-body systems using nonequilibrium MaxEnt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables (such as spatiotemporal correlation functions). It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. It may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different kinds of interactions, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a thermodynamic uncertainty relation. We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.</description>

Abstract: We consider a ladder system where one leg, referred to as the ``bath", is governed by an Aubry-Andr\'{e} (AA) type Hamiltonian, while the other leg, termed the ``subsystem", follows a standard tight-binding Hamiltonian. We investigate the localization properties in the subsystem induced by its coupling to the bath. For the coupling strength larger than a critical value ($t'&gt;t'_c$), the analysis of the static properties show that there are three distinct phases as the AA potential strength $V$ is varied: a fully delocalized phase at low $V$, a localized phase at intermediate $V$, and a weakly delocalized (fractal) phase at large $V$. An analysis of the wavepacket dynamics shows that the delocalized phase exhibits a ballistic behavior, whereas the weakly delocalized phase is subdiffusive. Interestingly, we also find a superdiffusive narrow crossover regime along the line separating the delocalized and localized phases. When $t'&lt;t'_c$, the intermediate localized phase disappears, and we find a delocalized (ballistic) phase at low $V$ and a weakly delocalized (subdiffusive) phase at large $V$. Between those two phases, there is also a crossover regime where the system can be super- or subdiffusive. Finally, in some limiting scenario, we also establish a mapping between our ladder system and a well-studied one-dimensional generalized Aubry-Andr\'{e} (GAA) model.</description>

      <title>Thermally activated detection of dark particles in a weakly coupled quantum Ising ladder</title>

Abstract: The Ising$_h^2$ integrable field theory emerges when two quantum critical Ising chains are weakly coupled. This theory possesses eight types of relativistic particles, among which the lightest one ($B_1$) has been predicted to be a dark particle, which cannot be excited from the ground state through (quasi-)local operations. The stability on one hand highlights its potential for applications, and on the other hand makes it challenging to be observed. Here, we point out that the mass of the $B_1$ dark particle $m_{B_1}$ appears as a thermally activated gap extracted from local spin dynamical structure factor at low frequency ($\omega \ll m_{B_1}$) and low temperatures ($T \ll m_{B_1}$). We then further propose that this gapped behavior can be directly detected via the NMR relaxation rate measurement in a proper experimental setup. Our results provide a practical criterion for verifying the existence of dark particles.</description>

      <title>Collective motion from quantum-inspired dynamics in visual perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18985v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a model of collective behavior in self-propelled active agents that incorporates a perceptual decision-making process. In this framework, the decision-making dynamics is modeled using quantum formalism. The perceptual decision state of each agent is an entangled or superposed state of the decision states for the neighboring agents within the vision cone. We suggest that in this framework, the force driving the movement of active agents is governed by the quantum average of its perception operator, providing a bridge between perceptual decision-making processes and classical dynamics. Additionally, we introduce two perceptual measures of cohesion in the flock, namely, perception strength and perceptual energy, to characterize collective behavior in terms of decision-making dynamics. Our model demonstrates that, with an appropriate choice of perceptual decision state, the well-known Vicsek model of flocking behavior can be derived as a specific case of this quantum-inspired approach. This approach provides fresh insights into collective behavior and multi-agent coordination, revealing how classical patterns of collective behavior emerge naturally from perception.</description>

      <title>Competing automorphisms and disordered Floquet codes</title>

Abstract: Topological order is a promising basis for quantum error correction, a key milestone towards large-scale quantum computing. Floquet codes provide a dynamical scheme for this while also exhibiting Floquet-enriched topological order (FET) where anyons periodically undergo a measurement-induced automorphism that acts uniformly in space. We study disordered Floquet codes where automorphisms have a spatiotemporally heterogeneous distribution -- the automorphisms "compete". We characterize the effect of this competition, showing how key features of the purification dynamics of mixed codestates can be inferred from anyon and automorphism properties for any Abelian topological order. This perspective can explain the protection or measurement of logical information in a dynamic automorphism (DA) code when subjected to a noise model of missing measurements. We demonstrate this using a DA color code with perturbed measurement sequences. The framework of competing automorphisms captures essential features of Floquet codes and robustness to noise, and may elucidate key mechanisms involving topological order, automorphisms, and fault-tolerance.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent quasilinear theory for collisionless relaxation to universal quasi-steady state attractors in cold dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems, e.g., cold dark matter halos, harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation, the origin of which has been a persistent mystery. To solve this problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of driven, inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation (QLDE) for the secular evolution of the mean distribution function $f_0$ of a halo due to linear fluctuations (induced by random perturbations in the force field) that are collectively dressed by self-gravity, a phenomenon described by the response matrix. Unlike previous studies, we treat collective dressing up to all orders. Well-known halo density profiles $\rho(r)$ commonly observed in $N$-body simulations, including the $r^{-1}$ NFW cusp, an Einasto central core, and the $r^{-1.5}$ prompt cusp, emerge as quasi-steady state attractor solutions of the QLDE. The $r^{-1}$ cusp is a constant flux steady-state solution for a constantly accreting massive halo perturbed by small-scale white noise fluctuations induced by substructure. It is an outcome of the universal nature of collisionless relaxation: lower energy particles attract more particles, gain higher effective mass and get less accelerated by the fluctuating force field. The zero-flux steady state solution for an isolated halo is an $f_0$ that is flat in energy, and the corresponding $\rho(r)$ can either be cored or an $r^{-1.5}$ cusp depending on the inner boundary condition. The latter forms around a central dense object, e.g., a compact subhalo or a black hole. We demonstrate for the first time that these halo profiles emerge as quasi-steady state attractors of collisionless relaxation described by a self-consistent QLT.</description>

      <title>A new pathway to generative artificial intelligence by minimizing the maximum entropy</title>

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence revolutionized society. Current models are trained by minimizing the distance between the produced data and the training set. Consequently, development is plateauing as they are intrinsically data-hungry and challenging to direct during the generative process. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a paradigm shift through a framework where we do not fit the training set but find the most informative yet least noisy representation of the data simultaneously minimizing the entropy to reduce noise and maximizing it to remain unbiased via adversary training. The result is a general physics-driven model, which is data-efficient and flexible, permitting to control and influence the generative process. Benchmarking shows that our approach outperforms variational autoencoders. We demonstrate the methods effectiveness in generating images, even with limited training data, and its unprecedented capability to customize the generation process a posteriori without any fine-tuning or retraining</description>
