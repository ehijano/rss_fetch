      <title>Very-Well-Behaved Epireflections for Categories of Models of Sketches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Firstly, precise conditions on how to obtain very-well-behaved epireflections are explored and improved from the author's previous papers; meaning that, beginning with a monad and a prefactorization system on a category, is produced a reflection with stable units (stronger than semi-left-exactness, also called admissibility in categorical Galois Theory) and an associated monotone-light factorization. Then, we were able to show that, for a pseudo-filtered category J in which every arrow is a monomorphism, the colimit functor on Set^J produces a very-well-behaved epireflection; if J = 2 the monotone-light factorization is non-trivial, as showed as an example. Then, new results are presented that grant very-well-behaved subreflections from the very-well-behaved reflections induced by an adjunction given by right Kan extensions for presheaves. These subreflections are obtained by restricting to the models of a sketch; it is showed finally that the known very-well-behaved reflection of n-categories into n-preorders is an example of this process (being n any positive integer).</description>

      <title>Coderived and contraderived categories for a cotorsion pair, flat-type cotorsion pairs, and relative periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a hereditary complete cotorsion pair $(\mathsf A,\mathsf B)$ generated by a set of objects in a Grothendieck category $\mathsf K$, we construct a natural equivalence between the Becker coderived category of the left-hand class $\mathsf A$ and the Becker contraderived category of the right-hand class $\mathsf B$. We show that a nested pair of cotorsion pairs $(\mathsf A_1,\mathsf B_1)\le(\mathsf A_2,\mathsf B_2)$ provides an adjunction between the related co/contraderived categories, which is induced by a Quillen adjunction between abelian model structures. Then we specialize to the cotorsion pairs $(\mathsf F,\mathsf C)$ sandwiched between the projective and the flat cotorsion pairs in a module category, and prove that the related co/contraderived categories for $(\mathsf F,\mathsf C)$ are the same as for the projective and flat cotorsion pairs if and only if two periodicity properties hold for $\mathsf F$ and $\mathsf C$. The same applies to the cotorsion pairs sandwiched between the very flat and the flat cotorsion pairs in the category of quasi-coherent sheaves over a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme. The motivating examples of the classes of flaprojective modules and relatively cotorsion modules for a ring homomorphism are discussed, and periodicity conjectures formulated for them.</description>

      <title>On fibred products of toposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the setting of relative topos theory, we show that the pullback of a relative presheaf topos on an arbitrary fibration is the relative presheaf topos on its inverse image. To this end, we develop and exploit a notion of extension with base change of a morphism of sites along the canonical functor. This provides a tool to compare the canonical relative site of the direct (resp. inverse) image with the direct (resp. inverse) image of the canonical relative site: although these operations do not commute in general, we show that in the case of the direct image they are related by an indexed weak geometric morphism, while in the case of the inverse image they can be compared via a cartesian functor that induces a suitable topology making them Morita-equivalent.</description>

      <title>A functorial approach to $n$-abelian categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10438v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a functorial approach to the study of $n$-abelian categories by reformulating their axioms in terms of their categories of finitely presented functors. Such an approach allows the use of classical homological algebra and representation theory techniques to understand higher homological algebra. As an application, we present two possible generalizations of the axioms "every monomorphism is a kernel" and "every epimorphism is a cokernel" of an abelian category to $n$-abelian categories. We also specialize our results to modules over rings, thereby describing when the category of finitely generated projective modules over a ring is $n$-abelian. Moreover, we establish a correspondence for $n$-abelian categories with additive generators, which extends the higher Auslander correspondence.</description>

      <title>Idempotence for relative monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the concept of idempotence for relative monads, which exhibits several subtleties not present for non-relative monads. In particular, there is a bifurcation of notions of idempotence in the relative setting, which are indistinguishable for idempotent monads. As a special case, we obtain several characterisations of idempotence for monads in extension form.</description>
