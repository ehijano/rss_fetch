      <title>Mitigating "Epistemic Debt" in Generative AI-Scaffolded Novice Programming using Metacognitive Scripts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The democratization of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to ``Vibe Coding," a workflow where novice programmers prioritize semantic intent over syntactic implementation. While this lowers barriers to entry, we hypothesize that without pedagogical guardrails, it is fundamentally misaligned with cognitive skill acquisition. Drawing on the distinction between Cognitive Offloading and Cognitive Outsourcing, we argue that unrestricted AI encourages novices to outsource the Intrinsic Cognitive Load required for schema formation, rather than merely offloading Extraneous Load. This accumulation of ``Epistemic Debt" creates ``Fragile Experts" whose high functional utility masks critically low corrective competence.
  To quantify and mitigate this debt, we conducted a between-subjects experiment (N=78) using a custom Cursor IDE plugin backed by Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Participants represented "AI-Native" learners across three conditions: Manual (Control), Unrestricted AI (Outsourcing), and Scaffolded AI (Offloading). The Scaffolded condition utilized a novel ``Explanation Gate," leveraging a real-time LLM-as-a-Judge framework to enforce a ``Teach-Back" protocol before generated code could be integrated.
  Results reveal a ``Collapse of Competence": while Unrestricted AI users matched the productivity of the Scaffolded group (p &lt; .001 vs. Manual), they suffered a 77% failure rate in a subsequent AI-Blackout maintenance task, compared to only 39% in the Scaffolded group. Qualitative analysis suggests that successful vibe coders naturally engage in self-scaffolding, treating the AI as a consultant rather than a contractor. We discuss the implications for the maintainability of AI-generated software and propose that future learning systems must enforce Metacognitive Friction to prevent the mass production of unmaintainable code.</description>

      <title>What Drives Students' Use of AI Chatbots? Technology Acceptance in Conversational AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational AI tools have been rapidly adopted by students and are becoming part of their learning routines. To understand what drives this adoption, we draw on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and examine how perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use relate to students' behavioral intention to use conversational AI that generates responses for learning tasks. We extend TAM by incorporating trust, perceived enjoyment, and subjective norms as additional factors that capture social and affective influences and uncertainty around AI outputs.
  Using partial least squares structural equation modeling, we find perceived usefulness remains the strongest predictor of students' intention to use conversational AI. However, perceived ease of use does not exert a significant direct effect on behavioral intention once other factors are considered, operating instead indirectly through perceived usefulness. Trust and subjective norms significantly influence perceptions of usefulness, while perceived enjoyment exerts both a direct and indirect effect on usage intentions. These findings suggest that adoption decisions for conversational AI systems are influenced less by effort-related considerations and more by confidence in system outputs, affective engagement, and social context. Future research is needed to further examine how these acceptance relationships generalize across different conversational systems and usage contexts.</description>

      <title>SoK: Agentic Skills -- Beyond Tool Use in LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic systems increasingly rely on reusable procedural capabilities, \textit{a.k.a., agentic skills}, to execute long-horizon workflows reliably. These capabilities are callable modules that package procedural knowledge with explicit applicability conditions, execution policies, termination criteria, and reusable interfaces. Unlike one-off plans or atomic tool calls, skills operate (and often do well) across tasks.
  This paper maps the skill layer across the full lifecycle (discovery, practice, distillation, storage, composition, evaluation, and update) and introduces two complementary taxonomies. The first is a system-level set of \textbf{seven design patterns} capturing how skills are packaged and executed in practice, from metadata-driven progressive disclosure and executable code skills to self-evolving libraries and marketplace distribution. The second is an orthogonal \textbf{representation $\times$ scope} taxonomy describing what skills \emph{are} (natural language, code, policy, hybrid) and what environments they operate over (web, OS, software engineering, robotics).
  We analyze the security and governance implications of skill-based agents, covering supply-chain risks, prompt injection via skill payloads, and trust-tiered execution, grounded by a case study of the ClawHavoc campaign in which nearly 1{,}200 malicious skills infiltrated a major agent marketplace, exfiltrating API keys, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser credentials at scale. We further survey deterministic evaluation approaches, anchored by recent benchmark evidence that curated skills can substantially improve agent success rates while self-generated skills may degrade them. We conclude with open challenges toward robust, verifiable, and certifiable skills for real-world autonomous agents.</description>

      <title>Qubit-Efficient Quantum Annealing for Stochastic Unit Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Unit Commitment (SUC) has been proposed to manage the uncertainties driven by renewable integration, but it leads to significant computational complexity. When accelerated by Benders Decomposition (BD), the master problem becomes binary integer programming, which is still NP-hard and computationally demanding for classical methods. Quantum Annealing (QA), known for efficiently solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, presents a potential solution. However, existing quantum algorithms rely on slack variables to handle linear binary inequality constraints, leading to increased qubit consumption and reduced computational efficiency. To solve the problem, this paper introduces the Powell-Hestenes-Rockafellar Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier (PHR-ALM) method to eliminate the need for slack variables, making qubit consumption independent of the increasing number of Benders cuts. To further reduce the qubit overhead, quantum ADMM is applied to break large-scale SUC into smaller blocks for sequential solutions, which does not scale with the number of generators. Finally, the simulation results on both 4-generator and the IEEE bus-118 systems demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the proposed algorithm, indicating its superior qubit and runtime efficiency over classical and baseline quantum approaches on the D-Wave QPU platform.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Federated Semantic Communication with Global Representation Alignment and Domain-Aware Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication can significantly improve bandwidth utilization in wireless systems by exploiting the meaning behind raw data. However, the advancements achieved through semantic communication are closely dependent on the development of deep learning (DL) models for joint source-channel coding (JSCC) encoder/decoder techniques, which require a large amount of data for training. To address this data-intensive nature of DL models, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to train a model in a distributed manner, where the server broadcasts the DL model to clients in the network for training with their local data. However, the conventional FL approaches suffer from catastrophic degradation when client data are from different domains. In contrast, in this paper, a novel FL framework is proposed to address this domain shift by constructing the global representation, which aligns with the local features of the clients to preserve the semantics of different data domains. In addition, the dominance problem of client domains with a large number of samples is identified and, then, addressed with a domain-aware aggregation approach. This work is the first to consider the domain shift in training the semantic communication system for the image reconstruction task. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the model-contrastive FL (MOON) framework by 0.5 for PSNR values under three domains at an SNR of 1 dB, and this gap continues to widen as the channel quality improves.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Segmentation via Diffractive Neural Networks for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation and lane detection are crucial tasks in autonomous driving systems. Conventional approaches predominantly rely on deep neural networks (DNNs), which incur high energy costs due to extensive analog-to-digital conversions and large-scale image computations required for low-latency, real-time responses. Diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) have shown promising advantages over conventional DNNs on digital or optoelectronic computing platforms in energy efficiency. By performing all-optical image processing via light diffraction at the speed of light, DONNs save computation energy costs while reducing the overhead associated with analog-to-digital conversions by all-optical encoding and computing. In this work, we propose a novel all-optical computing framework for RGB image segmentation and lane detection in autonomous driving applications. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DONN system for image segmentation on the CityScapes dataset. Additionally, we conduct case studies on lane detection using a customized indoor track dataset and simulated driving scenarios in CARLA, where we further evaluate the model's generalizability under diverse environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Games That Teach, Chats That Convince: Comparing Interactive and Static Formats for Persuasive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactive systems such as chatbots and games are increasingly used to persuade and educate on sustainability-related topics, yet it remains unclear how different delivery formats shape learning and persuasive outcomes when content is held constant. Grounding on identical arguments and factual content across conditions, we present a controlled user study comparing three modes of information delivery: static essays, conversational chatbots, and narrative text-based games. Across subjective measures, the chatbot condition consistently outperformed the other modes and increased perceived importance of the topic. However, perceived learning did not reliably align with objective outcomes: participants in the text-based game condition reported learning less than those reading essays, yet achieved higher scores on a delayed (24-hour) knowledge quiz. Additional exploratory analyses further suggest that common engagement proxies, such as verbosity and interaction length, are more closely related to subjective experience than to actual learning. These findings highlight a dissociation between how persuasive experiences feel and what participants retain, and point to important design trade-offs between interactivity, realism, and learning in persuasive systems and serious games.</description>
