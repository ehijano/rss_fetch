      <title>Detecting imbalanced financial markets through time-varying optimization and nonlinear functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the time-varying structure of the equity market with respect to market capitalization. First, we analyze the distribution of the 100 largest companies' market capitalizations over time, in terms of inequality, concentration at the top, and overall discrepancies in the distribution between different times. In the next section, we introduce a mathematical framework of linear and nonlinear functionals of time-varying portfolios. We apply this to study the market capitalization exposure and spread of optimal portfolios chosen by a Sharpe optimization procedure. These methods could be more widely used to study various measures of optimal portfolios and measure different aspects of market exposure while holding portfolios selected by an optimization routine that changes over time.</description>

      <title>A model of strategic sustainable investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a problem of optimal irreversible investment and emission reduction formulated as a nonzero-sum dynamic game between an investor with environmental preferences and a firm. The game is set in continuous time on an infinite-time horizon. The firm generates profits with a stochastic dynamics and may spend part of its revenues towards emission reduction (e.g., renovating the infrastructure). The firm's objective is to maximize the discounted expectation of a function of its profits. The investor participates in the profits and may decide to invest to support the firm's production capacity. The investor uses a profit function which accounts for both financial and environmental factors. Nash equilibria of the game are obtained via a system of variational inequalities. We formulate a general verification theorem for this system in a diffusive setup and construct an explicit solution in the zero-noise limit. Our explicit results and numerical approximations show that both the investor's and the firm's optimal actions are triggered by moving boundaries that increase with the total amount of emission abatement.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical CEV Option Pricing Model: an Analytical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to obtain closed form solutions for the semiclassical (or WKB) approximation of the heat kernel propagator of the diffusion equation defined by the constant elasticity variance (CEV) option pricing model. One of the key points is that our calculations are based on the Van Vleck-Morette determinant instead of the Van Vleck determinant used by other authors. In fact, we compute this determinant in two different ways: by means of the solution of the classical Hamiltonian equations, and by solving the variational equations. Furthermore, the calculation reveals an exponential factor in the prefactor of the kernel not considered in previous works.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional fractional Brownian motion in the G-setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a definition of a multi-dimensional fractional Brownian motion of Hurst index $H \in (0, 1)$ under volatility uncertainty (in short G-fBm). We study the properties of such a process and provide first results about stochastic calculus with respect to a fractional G-Brownian motion for a Hurst index $H &gt;\frac{1}{2}$ .</description>
