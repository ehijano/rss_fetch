      <title>Rogue waves excitation on zero-background in the (2+1)-dimensional KdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An analytical method for constructing various coherent localized solutions with short-lived characteristics is proposed based on a novel self-mapping transformation of the (2+1) dimensional KdV equation. The highlight of this method is that it allows one to generate a class of basic two--dimensional rogue waves excited on zero-background for this equation, which includes the line-soliton-induced rogue wave and dromion-induced rogue wave with exponentially decaying as well as the lump-induced rogue wave with algebraically decaying in the -plane. Our finding provides a proper candidate to describe two-dimensional rogue waves and paves a feasible path for studying rogue waves.</description>

      <title>A semiclassical model for charge transfer along ion chains in silicates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been observed in fossil tracks and experiments in the layered silicate mica muscovite the transport of charge through the cation layers sandwiched between the layers of tetrahedra-octahedra-tetrahedra. A classical model for the propagation of anharmonic vibrations along the cation chains has been proposed based on first principles and empirical functions. In that model, several propagating entities have been found as kinks or crowdions and breathers, both with or without wings, the latter for specific velocities and energies. Crowdions are equivalent to moving interstitials and transport electric charge if the moving particle is an ion, but they also imply the movement of mass, which was not observed in the experiments. Breathers, being just vibrational entities, do not transport charge. In this work, we present a semiclassical model obtained by adding a quantum particle, electron or hole to the previous model. We present the construction of the model based on the physics of the system. In particular, the strongly nonlinear vibronic interaction between the nuclei and the extra electron or hole is essential to explain the localized charge transport, which is not compatible with the adiabatic approximation. The formation of vibrational localized charge carriers breaks the lattice symmetry group in a similar fashion to the Jahn-Teller Effect, providing a new stable dynamical state. We study the properties and the coherence of the model through numerical simulations from initial conditions obtained by tail analysis and other means. We observe that although the charge spreads from an initial localization in a lattice at equilibrium, it can be confined basically to a single particle when coupled to a chaotic quasiperiodic breather. This is coherent with the observation that experiments imply that a population of charge is formed due to the decay of potassium unstable isotopes.</description>
