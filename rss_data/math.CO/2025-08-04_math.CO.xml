      <title>Partitioning set $[n] = \{1, \dots, n\}$ into subsets of size at most $m$ such that all sums are powers of $m$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given integer $n &gt; 0$ and $m &gt; 1$, we call a partition of set $[n] = \{1, \dots, n\}$ {\em $m$-good} if each of the partitioning sets is of size at most $m$ and the sum of numbers in it is a power of $m$, that is, $m^t$ for some $t \geq 0$. It is easily seen that a unique 2-good partition exists for each $n$ and, in contrast, for each fixed $m&gt;3$, for infinitely many $n$, no $m$-good partition exists.
  Case $m=3$ is more difficult. We conjecture that 3-good partitions exist for each $n$ and prove that a minimal counter-example, if any, is at least 101 and must belong to the set
  {\centering $N_o = \{n \equiv 2 \pmod 3\} \cap \{3^t+1 &lt; n &lt; (3^{t+1}+1)/2 \mid t \geq 4\}.$ }
  For this case we provide some partial results. We also show that a 3-good partition is unique if $n \in N_u = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 3^t-4, 3^t-2, 3^t-1, 3^t, 3^t+1, 3^t+2, 3^t+3 \mid t &gt; 1\}$ and conjecture that the inverse holds too.</description>

      <title>A note on multiset reconstruction from sum and pairwise products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ballantine, Beck, and Merca defined a map $\mathrm{pre}_2$, which sends an integer partition $\lambda = (\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_{\ell})$ to the set $\{\lambda_i\lambda_j : 1 \leq i &lt; j \leq \ell\}$ consisting of the pairwise products of parts of $\lambda$. The same three authors and Sagan conjectured that for each $n$, the map $\mathrm{pre}_2$ is injective on the set of integer partitions of $n$. In this note, we prove their conjecture.</description>

      <title>A family of regular integral graphs and its application to the $n$-Queens' graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of regular integral graphs introduced in [I.F.S. Costa, The $n$-Queens graph and its generalizations, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Aveiro 2024], denoted by ${\cal T}(n)$ and herein called triangular graphs, is analysed. In this analysis, the consistent structure of the graph spectra and the patterns of the corresponding eigenvectors are highlighted. The properties of these graphs are examined and applied to the decomposition of the $n$-Queens' graph into three distinct families: a family of a single graph whose components are two triangular graphs, ${\cal T}(n)$ and ${\cal T}(n-1)$, a family of a single graph whose components are cliques and a family of complete bipartite graphs. Finally, using Weyl's inequalities, we introduce some techniques to establish lower and upper bounds on the eigenvalues of the $n$-Queens' graph.</description>

      <title>New conjectures on the inertia of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with adjacency matrix $A(G)$. We conjecture that \[2n^+(G) \le n^-(G)(n^-(G) + 1),\] where $n^+(G)$ and $n^-(G)$ denote the number of positive and negative eigenvalues of $A(G)$, respectively. This conjecture generalizes to all graphs the well-known absolute bound for strongly regular graphs. The conjecture also relates to a question posed by Torga\v{s}ev. We prove the conjecture for special graph families, including line graphs and planar graphs, and provide examples where the conjecture is exact. We also conjecture that for any connected graph $G$, its line graph $L(G)$ satisfies $n^+(L(G)) \le n^-(L(G)) + 1$ and obtain partial results.</description>

      <title>Toroidal involutory Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $R$ is a finite commutative ring with identity. The involutory Cayley graph $\G(R)$ of $R$ is the graph whose vertices are the elements of $R$, and two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if $(x-y)^2=1$. In this paper, we classify all rings $R$ for which $\G(R)$ is a toroidal graph, that is, a graph that can be embedded on a torus.</description>

      <title>Classification of polyhedral graphs by numbers of common neighbours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a classification of polyhedra (planar, $3$-connected graphs) according to their type i.e., their set of quantities of common neighbours for each pair of distinct vertices.
  For every (finite) set of non-negative integers, we either classify all the polyhedra of that type, or construct infinitely many polyhedra of that type, or prove that none exist.
  This problem is related to the theory of strongly regular and Deza graphs, distances in graphs, and degree sequences. There is potential for application to complex networks and data science.</description>

Abstract: Since the thesis of K. Reinhardt in 1918, it is well known that there are exactly three types of convex hexagons that can tile the plane. However, the proof of the fact is far from being complete. We prove this fact, under an assumption much weaker than the convexity.</description>

      <title>Ornamentation lattices and intreeval hypergraphic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a directed graph $D$ with transitive closure $\operatorname{tc}(D)$ and path hypergraph $\mathbb{P}(D)$, we study the connections between the (acyclic) reorientation poset of $\operatorname{tc}(D)$, the (acyclic) sourcing poset of $\mathbb{P}(D)$, and the (acyclic) ornamentation poset of $D$. Geometrically, the acyclic reorientation poset of $\operatorname{tc}(D)$ (resp. the acyclic sourcing poset of $\mathbb{P}(D)$) is the transitive closure of the skeleton of the graphical zonotope of $\operatorname{tc}(D)$ (resp. of the hypergraphic polytope of $\mathbb{P}(D)$) oriented in a linear direction. When $D$ is a rooted (or even unstarred) increasing tree, we show that the acyclic sourcing poset of $\mathbb{P}(D)$ is isomorphic to the ornamentation lattice of $D$, and that they form a lattice quotient of the acyclic reorientation lattice of $\operatorname{tc}(D)$. As a consequence, we obtain polytopal realizations of the ornamentation lattices of rooted (or even unstarred) increasing trees, answering an open question of C. Defant and A. Sack. When $D$ is an increasing tree, we show that the ornamentation lattice of $D$ is the MacNeille completion of the acyclic sourcing poset of $\mathbb{P}(D)$. Finally, still when $D$ is an increasing tree, we use the ornamentation lattice of $D$ to characterize the subhypergraphs of the path hypergraph $\mathbb{P}(D)$ whose acyclic sourcing poset is a lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces permutation-invariant Niven numbers--a novel class of Niven numbers where all digit permutations (with leading zeros automatically ignored) must retain the Niven property. We demonstrate that there exist infinitely many such numbers and that their magnitude is unbounded. Furthermore, we present an exhaustive search method for identifying permutation--invariant Niven numbers.</description>

      <title>An analytical framework for the Levine hats problem: new strategies, bounds and generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Levine hat problem, a classic combinatorial puzzle introduced by Lionel Levine in 2010. This problem involves a game in which $n \geq 2$ players, each seeing an infinite stack of hats on each of their teammates' heads but not on their own, must simultaneously guess the index of a black hat on their own stack. If one of the players fails to do so, the team loses collectively. The players must therefore come up with a good strategy before the game starts. While the optimal winning probability $V_{n}$ remains unknown even for $n=2$, we make three key advances. First, we develop a novel geometric framework for representing strategies through measurable functions, providing a new expression of $V_{n}$ and a unified treatment of the game for finite and for infinite stacks via integral formulations. Secondly, we construct a new strategy $K_{5}$ that reaches the conjectured optimal probability of victory : $0.35$. We also show that $K_{5}$ is part of a larger class of strategies that allow us to improve current bounds and resolve conjectured inequalities. Finally, we introduce and entirely solve a continuous generalization of the problem, demonstrating that extending to uncountable hat stacks increases the optimal winning probability to exactly $1/2$. This generalization naturally leads to a broader and smoother strategic framework, within which we also describe how to compute optimal responses to a range of strategies.</description>

      <title>Edge open packing: further characterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph where $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ are the vertex and edge sets, respectively. In a graph $G$, two edges $e_1, e_2\in E(G)$ are said to have \emph{common edge} $e\neq e_1, e_2$ if $e$ joins an endpoint of $e_1$ to an endpoint of $e_2$ in $G$. A subset $D\subseteq E(G)$ is called an \emph{edge open packing set} in $G$ if no two edges in $D$ share a common edge in $G$, and the largest size of such a set in $G$ is known as \emph{edge open packing number}, represented by $\rho_{e}^o(G)$. In the introductory paper (Chelladurai et al. (2022)), necessary and sufficient conditions for $\rho_{e}^o(G)=1, 2$ were provided, and the graphs $G$ with $\rho_{e}^o(G)\in \{m-2, m-1, m\}$ were characterized, where $m$ is the number of edges of $G$. In this paper, we further characterize the graphs $G$. First, we show necessary and sufficient conditions for $\rho_{e}^o(G)=t$, for any integer $t\geq 3$. Finally, we characterize the graphs with $\rho_{e}^o(G)=m-3$.</description>

      <title>An Improved Bound for the Beck-Fiala Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1981, Beck and Fiala [Discrete Appl. Math, 1981] conjectured that given a set system $A \in \{0,1\}^{m \times n}$ with degree at most $k$ (i.e., each column of $A$ has at most $k$ non-zeros), its combinatorial discrepancy $\mathsf{disc}(A) := \min_{x \in \{\pm 1\}^n} \|Ax\|_\infty$ is at most $O(\sqrt{k})$. Previously, the best-known bounds for this conjecture were either $O(k)$, first established by Beck and Fiala [Discrete Appl. Math, 1981], or $O(\sqrt{k \log n})$, first proved by Banaszczyk [Random Struct. Algor., 1998].
  We give an algorithmic proof of an improved bound of $O(\sqrt{k \log\log n})$ whenever $k \geq \log^5 n$, thus matching the Beck-Fiala conjecture up to $O(\sqrt{\log \log n})$ for almost the full regime of $k$.</description>

      <title>On the cardinalities of quantum Latin squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum Latin square of order $v$, QLS($v$), is a $v\times v$ array in which each of entries is a unit column vector from the Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{v}$, such that every row and column forms an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb{C}^{v}$. The cardinality of a QLS($v$) is the number of its vectors distinct up to a global phase, which is the crucial indicator for distinguishing between classical QLSs and non-classical QLSs. In this paper, we investigate the possible cardinalities of a QLS($v$). As a result, we completely resolve the existence of a QLS($v$) with maximal cardinality for any $v\geq 4$. Moreover, based on Wilson's construction and Direct Product construction, we establish some possible cardinality range of a QLS($v$) for any $v\geq 4$.</description>

      <title>On two-distance-transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $2$-distance-transitive graph is a vertex-transitive graph whose vertex stabilizer is transitive on both the first step and the second step neighborhoods. In this paper, we first answer a question of A. Devillers, M. Giudici, C. H. Li and C. E. Praeger in 2012 about vertex-quasiprimitive $2$-distance-transitive graphs for the odd order case. Then we characterize $2$-distance-transitive graphs of valency $p$ or $p+1$ where $p$ is a prime. After that, as an application of the above result, we classify locally-primitive, $2$-distance-transitive graphs of small valency.
  In addition to the above results on $2$-distance-transitive graphs, we also classify a family of amply regular graphs with diameter at least $4$ and parameters $(v, k, \lambda, \frac{k - 1}{2})$, and these graphs arise naturally in the classification of locally-primitive, $2$-distance-transitive graphs with small valency.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap Percolation, Indecomposable Permutations, and the n-Kings problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the process of bootstrap percolation on n x n permutation matrices, inspired by the work of Shapiro and Stephens [5]. In this percolation model, cells mutate (from 0 to 1) if at least two of their cardinal neighbors contain a 1, and thereafter remain unchanged; the process continues until no further mutations are possible. After carefully analyzing this process, we consider how it interacts with the notion of (in)decomposable permutations. We prove that the number of indecomposable permutations whose matrices "fill up'' to contain all 1's (or are "full") is half of the total number of full permutations. This leads to a new proof of a key result in [5], that the number of full n x n permutations is the (n-1)st large Schroeder number. Finally, after rigorously justifying a heuristic argument in [5], we find a new formula for the number of n x n "no growth" permutations, and hence a new solution to the well-known n-kings problem.</description>

      <title>Monotone Paths on Acyclic 3-Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by trying to understand the behavior of the simplex method, Athanasiadis, De Loera and Zhang provided upper and lower bounds on the number of the monotone paths on 3-polytopes. For simple 3-polytopes with $2n$ vertices, they showed that the number of monotone paths is bounded above by $(1+\varphi)^n$, with $\varphi$ being the golden ratio. We improve the result and show that for a larger family of graphs the number is bounded above by $c \cdot 1.6779^n$ for some universal constant $c$. Meanwhile, the best known construction and conjectured extremizer is approximately $\varphi^n$.</description>

      <title>Descent sets of cyclic permutations in types B and D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elizalde constructed a bijection $\phi$ from the cyclic permutations $\pi\in S_{n+1}$ to the symmetric group $S_n$ satisfying $\operatorname{Des}(\pi)\cap \{1,2,\ldots,n-1\}=\operatorname{Des}(\phi(\pi))$. We give a corresponding result on the signed symmetric group $B_n$ by constructing a function $\Phi$ from the cyclic signed permutations $\pi\in B_{n+1}$ to $B_n$ satisfying $\operatorname{Des}(\pi)\cap \{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}=\operatorname{Des}(\Phi(\pi))$. Moreover, letting $D_{n+1}\subseteq B_{n+1}$ be the subgroup consisting of signed permutations with an even number of sign changes, we show that the restriction of $\Phi$ to the cyclic signed permutations in $D_{n+1}$ or its complement is a bijection. Our function $\Phi$ reduces to Elizalde's original bijection $\phi$ under the natural identification of the symmetric groups as subgroups of the signed symmetric groups. One application of our results is asymptotic normality of the descent and flag major index statistics on the cyclic signed permutations in $B_{n}$ and $D_n$.</description>

      <title>All rectangles exhibit canonical Ramsey property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a seminal work, Cheng and Xu proved that for any positive integer \(r\), there exists an integer \(n_0\), independent of \(r\), such that every \(r\)-coloring of the \(n\)-dimensional Euclidean space \(\mathbb{E}^n\) with \(n \ge n_0\) contains either a monochromatic or a rainbow congruent copy of a square. This phenomenon of dimension-independence was later formalized as the canonical Ramsey property by Gehe\'{e}r, Sagdeev, and T\'{o}th, who extended the result to all hypercubes, and to rectangles whose side lengths \(a\), \(b\) satisfy \((\frac{a}{b})^2\) is rational. They further posed the natural problem of whether every rectangle admits the canonical Ramsey property, regardless of the aspect ratio.
  In this paper, we show that all rectangles exhibit the canonical Ramsey property, thereby completely resolving this open problem of Gehe\'{e}r, Sagdeev, and T\'{o}th. Our proof introduces a new structural reduction that identifies product configurations with bounded color complexity, enabling the application of simplex Ramsey theorems and product Ramsey amplification to control arbitrary aspect ratios.</description>

      <title>Thresholds of Queen covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimal configurations of Queens on a square chessboard, defined as those covering the maximum number of squares. For a fixed number of Queens, $q$, we prove the existence of two thresholds in board size: a non-attacking threshold beyond which all optimal configurations are pairwise non-attacking, and a stabilizing threshold beyond which the set of optimal configurations becomes constant. Related studies on Queen domination, such as Tarnai and G\'asp\'ar (2007), focus on minimizing the number of Queens needed for full board coverage. Our approach, by contrast, fixes the number of Queens and analyzes optimal cover via a certain loss-function due to {\em internal loss} and {\em decentralization}. We demonstrate how the internal loss can be decomposed in terms of defined concepts, {\em balance} and {\em overlap concentration}. Moreover, by using our results, for sufficiently large board sizes, we find all optimal Queen configurations for all $2\le q\le 9$. And, whenever possible, we relate those solutions in terms of the classical problem of placing $q$ non-attacking Queens on a $q\times q$ board. For example, in case $q=8$, out of the twelve classical fundamental solutions, only three apply here as centralized patterns on large boards. On the other hand, the single classical fundamental solution for $q=6$ is never cover optimal on large boards, even if centralized, but another pattern that fits inside a $q\times (q+1)$ board applies.</description>

      <title>Leaky Forcing: Extending Zero Forcing Results to a Fault-Tolerant Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a recent variation of zero forcing called leaky forcing. Zero forcing is a propagation process on a network whereby some nodes are initially blue with all others white. Blue vertices can "force" a white neighbor to become blue if all other neighbors are blue. The goal is to find the minimum number of initially blue vertices to eventually force all vertices blue after exhaustively applying the forcing rule above. Leaky forcing is a fault-tolerant variation of zero forcing where certain vertices (not necessarily initially blue) cannot force. The goal in this context is to find the minimum number of initially blue vertices needed that can eventually force all vertices to be blue, regardless of which small number of vertices can't force. This work extends results from zero forcing in terms of leaky forcing. In particular, we provide a complete determination of leaky forcing numbers for all unicyclic graphs and upper bounds for generalized Petersen graphs. We also provide bounds for the effect of both edge removal and vertex removal on the $\ell$-leaky forcing number. Finally, we completely characterize connected graphs that have the minimum and maximum possible $1$-leaky forcing number (i.e., when $Z_{1}(G) = 2$ and when $Z_{1}(G) = |V(G)|-1$).</description>

      <title>Grounded partitions at level 2 in type A_1^(1): bijections and affine crystal structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grounded partitions, introduced by Dousse and Konan and motivated by the theory of perfect crystals, are combinatorial objects whose generating functions-associated to specific defining matrices-admit infinite product expressions. In this paper, we investigate the combinatorics of grounded partitions at level $2$ in type $A_1^{(1)}$ with exact difference conditions. We provide the first bijective proof that their generating functions are given by infinite products. Furthermore, we show that these partitions carry an affine crystal structure in type $A_1^{(1)}$. By restricting to the finite type $A$ crystal structure, we obtain new infinite sum expressions for the corresponding products. Remarkably, the major index statistic on Yamanouchi words arises naturally within this framework.</description>

      <title>Determination of Some Types of Permutations over $\mathbb{F}_q^2$ with Low-Degree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characterization of permutations over finite fields is an important topic in number theory with a long-standing history. This paper presents a systematic investigation of low-degree bivariate polynomial systems $F=(f_1(x,y),f_2(x,y))$ defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q}^2$. Specifically, we employ Hermite's Criterion to completely classify bivariate quadratic permutation polynomial systems, while utilizing the theory of permutation rational functions to give a full classification of bivariate 3-homogeneous permutation polynomial systems. Furthermore, as an application of our findings, we provide an explicit characterization of the permutation binomials of the form $x^3+ax^{2q+1}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ with characteristic $p\neq3$, thereby resolving a significant special case within this classical research domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we consider Szemer\'{e}di's theorem on $k$-term arithmetic progressions over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_p^n$, where the allowed set $S$ of common differences in these progressions is chosen randomly of fixed size. Combining a generalization of an argument of Altman with Moshkovitz--Zhu's bounds for the partition rank of a tensor in terms of its analytic rank, we (slightly) improve the best known lower bounds (due to Bri\"et) on the size $|S|$ required for Szemer\'edi's theorem with difference in $S$ to hold asymptotically almost surely.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Gowers Norm Estimation, Polynomial Testing, and Arithmetic Progression Counting over Finite Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a family of quantum algorithms for estimating Gowers uniformity norms $ U^k $ over finite abelian groups and demonstrate their applications to testing polynomial structure and counting arithmetic progressions. Building on recent work for estimating the $ U^2 $-norm over $ \mathbb{F}_2^n $, we generalize the construction to arbitrary finite fields and abelian groups for higher values of $ k $. Our algorithms prepare quantum states encoding finite differences and apply Fourier sampling to estimate uniformity norms, enabling efficient detection of structural correlations.
  As a key application, we show that for certain degrees $ d = 4, 5, 6 $ and under appropriate conditions on the underlying field, there exist quasipolynomial-time quantum algorithms that distinguish whether a bounded function $ f(x) $ is a degree-$ d $ phase polynomial or far from any such structure. These algorithms leverage recent inverse theorems for Gowers norms, together with amplitude estimation, to reveal higher-order algebraic correlations.
  We also develop a quantum method for estimating the number of 3-term arithmetic progressions in Boolean functions $ f : \mathbb{F}_p^n \to \{0,1\} $, based on estimating the $ U^2 $-norm. Though not as query-efficient as Grover-based counting, our approach provides a structure-sensitive alternative aligned with additive combinatorics.
  Finally, we demonstrate that our techniques remain valid under certain quantum noise models, due to the shift-invariance of Gowers norms. This enables noise-resilient implementations within the NISQ regime and suggests that Gowers-norm-based quantum algorithms may serve as robust primitives for quantum property testing, learning, and pseudorandomness.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the edge-coloring number of the power graph of a finite group. We characterize which finite groups have overfull power graphs, showing that this occurs if and only if the group is cyclic of odd prime power order. We then show that this classsifies the class of power graphs: The power graph of a finite group is Class 2 if and only if the group is cyclic of odd prime power order.</description>

      <title>Singular values of sparse random rectangular matrices: Emergence of outliers at criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the random bipartite Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathbb{G}(n, m, p)$, where each edge with one vertex in $V_{1}=[n]$ and the other vertex in $V_{2} =[m]$ is connected with probability $p$, and $n=\lfloor \gamma m\rfloor$ for a constant aspect ratio $\gamma \geq 1$. It is well known that the empirical spectral measure of its centered and normalized adjacency matrix converges to the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur (MP) distribution. However, largest and smallest singular values may not converge to the right and left edges, respectively, especially when $p = o(1)$. Notably, it was proved by Dumitriu and Zhu (2024) that there are almost surely no singular value outside the compact support of the MP law when $np = \omega(\log(n))$. In this paper, we consider the critical sparsity regime where $p = b\log(n)/\sqrt{mn}$ for some constant $b&gt;0$. We quantitatively characterize the emergence of outlier singular values as follows. For explicit $b_{*}$ and $b^{*}$ functions of $\gamma$, we prove that when $b &gt; b_{*}$, there is no outlier outside the bulk; when $b^{*}&lt; b &lt; b_{*}$, outliers are present only outside the right edge of the MP law; and when $b &lt; b^{*}$, outliers are present on both sides, all with high probability. Moreover, locations of those outliers are precisely characterized by a function depending on the largest and smallest degree vertices of the random graph. We estimate the number of outliers as well. Our results follow the path forged by Alt, Ducatez and Knowles (2021), and can be extended to sparse random rectangular matrices with bounded entries.</description>

      <title>Polymorphic Combinatorial Frameworks (PCF): Guiding the Design of Mathematically-Grounded, Adaptive AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF) leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and mathematical frameworks to guide the meta-prompt enabled design of solution spaces and adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments. Unlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter reconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a multidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches, Resources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how LLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter values/variabilities. Using PCF, we parameterized mock caf\'e domains (five levels of complexity), estimated variables/variabilities, and conducted over 1.25 million Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed trends in agent adaptability and performance across the five complexity tiers, with diminishing returns at higher complexity levels highlighting thresholds for scalable designs. PCF enables the generation of optimized agent configurations for specific scenarios while maintaining logical consistency. This framework supports scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in domains like customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, paving the way for adaptable and cooperative next-generation polymorphic agents.</description>

      <title>The approach of cluster symmetry to Diophantine equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to use a cluster-theoretic approach to give a kind of Diophantine equation whose solutions can be obtained by starting from initial solutions through mutations.
  We establish a novel framework bridging cluster theory and Diophantine equations through the lens of cluster symmetry. On the one hand, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for Laurent polynomials to remain invariant under a given cluster symmetric map. On the other hand, we construct a discriminant algorithm to determine whether the corresponding Laurent polynomial admits a cluster symmetric pair and whether it can be realized in a generalized cluster algebra.
  As applications of this framework, we solve two Diophantine equations, describe three classes of invariant Laurent polynomial rings, resolve two questions posed by Gyoda and Matsushita in \cite{Gyoda}, and lastly give two Matlab programs, respectively, for constructing invariant Laurent polynomials and finding cluster symmetric pairs.</description>

Abstract: The dual Hahn polynomials $\{u_i(x)\}_{i=0}^d$ are a family of discrete orthogonal polynomials involving two real parameters $r$ and $s$. Let $L,L^*$ denote the corresponding Leonard pair. Assume that $r\not=0$ and $r+s=0$. We show that $L,(L^*+\frac{r-d}{2})^{2}$ is a Leonard pair. According to the theory of Leonard pairs, the polynomials $\{u_i(x)\}_{i=0}^d$ are not only the dual Hahn polynomials but also the Racah polynomials with respect to the same inner product.</description>

      <title>A Threshold Phenomenon for the Shortest Lattice Vector Problem in the Infinity Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One important question in the theory of lattices is to detect a shortest vector: given a norm and a lattice, what is the smallest norm attained by a non-zero vector contained in the lattice? We focus on the infinity norm and work with lattices of the form $A\mathbb{Z}^n$, where $A$ has integer entries and is of full column rank. Finding a shortest vector is NP-hard. We show that this task is fixed parameter tractable in the parameter $\Delta$, the largest absolute value of the determinant of a full rank submatrix of $A$. The algorithm is based on a structural result that can be interpreted as a threshold phenomenon: whenever the dimension $n$ exceeds a certain value determined only by $\Delta$, then a shortest lattice vector attains an infinity norm value of one. This threshold phenomenon has several applications. In particular, it reveals that integer optimal solutions lie on faces of the given polyhedron whose dimensions are bounded only in terms of $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Quantum symmetry of $3$-transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum automorphism group of $3$-transitive graphs in this article. Those are highly symmetric graphs that were classified by Cameron and Macpherson in 1985, and we compute the quantum automorphism group of all such graphs, excluding the orthogonal graphs $\mathrm{O}^-(6,q)$ for $q&gt;3$. We show that there is no quantum symmetry for the McLaughlin graph and the orthogonal graphs $\mathrm{O}^-(6,q)$ with $q = 2, 3$, while that the quantum automorphism group of the affine polar graphs $\mathrm{VO}^{+}(2k,2)$ and $\mathrm{VO}^{-}(2k,2)$ are monoidally equivalent to $\mathrm{PO}(n)$ and $\mathrm{PSp}(n)$, respectively. We use planar algebras to obtain our results, where the $3$-transitivity of the graphs gives bounds on the dimensions of the $2$-- and $3$-box spaces of the associated planar algebras.</description>

      <title>Concatenations of Terms of an Arithmetic Progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.07127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(u(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ be an arithmetic progression of natural integers in base $b\in\mathbb{N}\setminus \{0,1\}$. We consider the following sequences: $s(n)=\overline{u(0)u(1)\cdots u(n) }^b$ formed by concatenating the first $n+1$ terms of $(u(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ in base $b$ from the right; $s_g(n) = \overline{u(n)u(n-1)\cdots u(0)}^b$; and $(s_*(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, given by $s_*(0)=u(0)$, $s_*(n)=\overline{s(n)s_g(n-1)}^b, n\geq 1$. We construct explicit formulae for these sequences and use basic concepts of linear difference operators to prove they are not P-recursive (holonomic). We also present an alternative proof that follows directly from their definitions. We implemented $(s(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ and $(s_g(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ in the decimal base when $(u(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}=\mathbb{N}\setminus \{0\}$.</description>

      <title>On self-duality and unigraphicity for $3$-polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent literature posed the problem of characterising the graph degree sequences with exactly one $3$-polytopal (i.e. planar, $3$-connected) realisation. This seems to be a difficult problem in full generality. In this paper, we characterise the sequences with exactly one self-dual $3$-polytopal realisation.
  An algorithm in the literature constructs a self-dual $3$-polytope for any admissible degree sequence. To do so, it performs operations on the radial graph, so that the corresponding $3$-polytope and its dual are modified in exactly the same way. To settle our question and construct the relevant graphs, we apply this algorithm, we introduce some modifications of it, and we also devise new ones. The speed of these algorithms is linear in the graph order.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Log-concavity of Dominant Lower Bruhat Intervals via Brunn--Minkowski Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bj\"orner and Ekedahl [Ann. of Math. (2), 170.2(2009), pp. 799--817] pioneered the study of length-counting sequences associated with parabolic lower Bruhat intervals in crystallographic Coxeter groups. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of these sequences in affine Weyl groups. Let $W$ be an affine Weyl group with corresponding Weyl group $W_f$ and ${}^{f}{W}$ be the set of minimal representatives for the right cosets $W_f \backslash W$. Let $t_{\lambda}$ be the translation by a dominant coroot lattice element $\lambda$ and ${}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{\lambda}}$ be the number of elements of length $i$ below $t_\lambda$ in the Bruhat order on ${}^{f}{W}$. We show that the sequence $({}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{\lambda}})_i$ is ''asymptotically log-concave'' in the following sense: The sequence of discrete measures $(\mathfrak{m}_k)_k$ constructed from the $k$-fold dilated sequence $({}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{k\lambda}})_i$, as $k$ tends to infinity, converges weakly to a continuous measure obtained from a polytope $P^\lambda$. Moreover, the sequence of step functions $(S_k)_k$ of $({}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{k\lambda}})_i$ converges uniformly to the density function of this continuous measure. By Brunn--Minkowski inequality, this density is log-concave.</description>

      <title>Growth of regular partitions 3: strong regularity and the vertex partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider here the strong regularity for $3$-uniform hypergraphs developed by Frankl, Gowers, Kohayakawa, Nagle, R\"{o}dl, Skokan, and Schacht. This type of regular decomposition comes with two components, a partition of the vertices, and a partition of the pairs of vertices. The data of a regular decomposition also includes two parameters measuring quasirandomness, a fixed constant $\epsilon_1&gt;0$, and a function $\epsilon_2:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow (0,1]$. We define two growth functions associated to a hereditary property $\mathcal{H}$ of $3$-uniform hypergraphs: $T_{\mathcal{H}}(\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2)$ which measures the size of the vertex component, and $L_{\mathcal{H}}(\epsilon,\epsilon_2)$ which measures the size of the pairs component. We introduce the following question. What are the possible asymptotic growth rates of functions of the form $T_{\mathcal{H}}$ and $L_{\mathcal{H}}$? In this paper, we consider this question for $T_{\mathcal{H}}$, proving a separation into four classes: constant, polynomial, exponential, or at least wowzer. The separations among the constant, polynomial and exponential ranges require only slow growing (namely polynomial) choices for $\epsilon_2$. The jump to the wowzer range uses a very fast growing $\epsilon_2$ and makes crucial use of a lower bound construction for strong graph regularity due to Conlon and Fox.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies bounds in a strong form of regularity for $3$-uniform hypergraphs which was developed by Frankl, Gowers, Kohayakawa, Nagle, R\"{o}dl, Skokan, and Schacht. Regular decompositions of this type involve two structural components: a partition on the vertex set and a partition on the pairs of vertices. The regularity of such decompositions are measured by two parameters: an $\epsilon_1&gt;0$ and a function $\epsilon_2:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow (0,1]$. To each hereditary property $\mathcal{H}$ of $3$-uniform hypergraphs, we associate two corresponding growth functions: $T_{\mathcal{H}}(\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2)$ for the size of the vertex component, and $L_{\mathcal{H}}(\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2)$ for the size of the pairs component. The problem of understanding the asymptotic growth of such functions was introduced in a companion paper, which also proved several results about $T_{\mathcal{H}}$. In this paper we study the possible asymptotic behavior of $L_{\mathcal{H}}$. We show any such function is either constant, bounded above and below by a polynomial, or bounded below by an exponential. All results require only reasonable growth rates for $\epsilon_2$ (namely polynomial).</description>

      <title>Gallai's Path Decomposition of Levi Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gallai's path decomposition conjecture states that for a connected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, there exists a path decomposition of size $\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$. The Levi graph of order one, denoted by $L_{1}(m,k)$, is a bipartite graph with vertex partition $(A,B)$, where $A$ is the collection of all $(k-1)$-element subsets of $[m]$, and $B$ is the collection of all $k$-element subsets of $[m]$. In this graph, a $(k-1)$-element subset is adjacent to a $k$-element subset if and only if it is properly contained within the $k$-element subset. The path number of a graph $G$ is the minimum size of its path decomposition. Gallai's conjecture can be seen as a conjecture on the upper bound of the path number of a connected graph. In this work, we prove the conjecture for $L_{1}(m,k)$ for all $m \ge 2 $ and $2 \le k \le m$. Moreover, we determine the path number of $L_{1}(m,2)$ for all $m$.</description>

Abstract: We characterize the extremal structure for the exact mixing time for random walks on trees $T_{n,d}$ of order $n$ with diameter $d$. Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, let $H(v,\pi)$ denote the expected length of an optimal stopping rule from vertex $v$ to the stationary distributon $\pi$. We show that the quantity $\max_{G \in T_{n,d} } T_{\mbox{mix}}(G) = \max_{G \in T_{n,d} } \max_{v \in V} H(v,\pi)$ is achieved uniquely by the balanced double broom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06705v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 1990s, Kita--Yoshida and Cho--Matsumoto introduced intersection forms on the twisted (co)homologies of hyperplane arrangement complements. We give a closed combinatorial formula for these intersection pairings. We show that these intersection pairings are obtained from (continuous and discrete) Laplace transforms of subfans of the Bergman fan of the associated matroid. We compute inverses of these intersection pairings, allowing us to identify (variants of) these intersection forms with the contravariant form of Schechtman--Varchenko, and the bilinear form of Varchenko.
  Building on parallel joint work with C. Eur, we define a notion of scattering amplitudes for matroids. We show that matroid amplitudes satisfy locality and unitarity, and recover biadjoint scalar amplitudes in the case of the complete graphic matroid. We apply our formulae for twisted intersection forms to deduce old and new formulae for scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k\geq 2$ and fix a $k$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{F}$. Consider the random process that, starting from a $k$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ on $n$ vertices, repeatedly deletes the edges of a copy of $\mathcal{F}$ chosen uniformly at random and terminates when no copies of $\mathcal{F}$ remain. Let $R(\mathcal{H},\mathcal{F})$ denote the number of edges that are left after termination. We show that $R(\mathcal{H},\mathcal{F})=n^{k-1/\rho\pm o(1)}$, where $\rho:=(\lvert E(\mathcal{F})\rvert-1)/(\lvert V(\mathcal{F})\rvert -k)$, holds with high probability provided that $\mathcal{F}$ is strictly $k$-balanced and $\mathcal{H}$ is sufficiently dense with pseudorandom properties. Since we may in particular choose $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{H}$ to be complete graphs, this confirms the major folklore conjecture in the area in a very strong form.</description>

Abstract: Rational Dyck paths are the rational generalization of classical Dyck paths. They play an important role in Catalan combinatorics, and have multiple applications in algebra and geometry. Two statistics over rational Dyck paths called run and ratio-run are introduced. They both have symmetric joint distributions with the return statistic. We give combinatorial proofs and algebraic proofs of the symmetries, generalizing a result of Li and Lin.</description>

Abstract: A proper Euler's magic matrix is an integer $n\times n$ matrix $M\in\mathbb Z^{n\times n}$ such that $M\cdot M^t=\gamma\cdot I$ for some nonzero constant $\gamma$, the sum of the squares of the entries along each of the two main diagonals equals $\gamma$, and the squares of all entries in $M$ are pairwise distinct. Euler constructed such matrices for $n=4$. In this work, we construct examples for $n=8$ and prove that no such matrix exists for $n=3$.</description>

      <title>Color rules for cyclic wreath products and semigroup algebras from projective toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of "color rules" for computing class functions of $Z_k \wr S_n$, where $Z_k$ is the cyclic group of order $k$ and $S_n$ is the symmetric group on $n$ letters. Using a general sign-reversing involution and a map of order $k$, we give a combinatorial proof that the irreducible decomposition of these class functions is given by a weighted sum over semistandard tableaux in the colors. Since using two colors at once is also a color rule, we are consequently able to decompose arbitrary tensor products of representations whose characters can be computed via color rules. This method extends to class functions of $G \wr S_n$ where $G$ is a finite abelian group. We give a number of applications, including decomposing tensor powers of the defining representation, along with a combinatorial proof of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for $Z_k \wr S_n$.
  Our main application is to the study of the linear action of $Z_k \wr S_n$ on bigraded affine semigroup algebras arising from the product of projective toric varieties. In the case of the product of projective spaces, our methods give the decomposition of these bigraded characters into irreducible characters, thus deriving equivariant generalizations of Euler-Mahonian identities.</description>

Abstract: Answering a question of Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal, Chen and Ma proved that for all \(n\geq600\) every graph with \(2n + 1\) vertices and at least \(n^2 + n+1\) edges contains two vertices of equal degree connected by a path of length three. The complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n+1}$ shows that this edge bound is sharp. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to handle graphs with large equal degrees, which enables us to establish the result for all $n\ge2$, thereby fully resolving the problem posed by Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by an old question of Gallai (1966) on the intersection of longest paths in a graph and the well-known conjectures of Lov\'{a}sz (1969) and Thomassen (1978) on the maximum length of paths and cycles in vertex-transitive graphs, we present improved bounds for the parameters $\mathrm{lpt}(G)$ and $\mathrm{lct}(G)$, defined as the minimum size of a set of vertices in a graph $G$ hitting all longest paths (cycles, respectively). First, we show that every connected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices satisfies $\mathrm{lpt}(G)\le \sqrt{8n}$, and $\mathrm{lct}(G)\le \sqrt{8n}$ if $G$ is additionally $2$-connected. This improves a sequence of earlier bounds for these problems, with the previous state of the art being $O(n^{2/3})$. Second, we show that every connected graph $G$ satisfies $\mathrm{lpt}(G)\le O(\ell^{5/9})$, where $\ell$ denotes the maximum length of a path in $G$. As an immediate application of this latter bound, we present further progress towards Lov\'{a}sz' and Thomassen's conjectures: We show that every connected vertex-transitive graph of order $n$ contains a cycle (and path) of length $\Omega(n^{9/14})$. This improves the previous best bound of the form $\Omega(n^{13/21})$. Interestingly, our proofs make use of several concepts and results from structural graph theory, such as a result of Robertson and Seymour (1990) on transactions in societies and Tutte's $2$-separator theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For positive integers $n,n'$, we give a combinatorial characterization for the set of quadratic inequalities on minors that are valid for all $n\times n'$ totally nonnegative matrices. This is obtained as a consequence from our earlier results on stable quadratic identities on minors of matrices generated by flows in planar graphs via Lindstr\"om's construction.</description>

      <title>A general solution for the 1-2 conjecture using real numbers</title>

Abstract: For a simple graph $G=(V,E)$, a \emph{proper total weighting} is a mapping $w: V\cup E\rightarrow \mathbb R$ such that for every edge $uv\in E$, $w(u)+\sum_{e\ni u}w(e)\neq w(v)+\sum_{e\ni v}w(e)$. The graph $G$ is said to be $(2,2)$-\emph{choosable} if, for any list assignment $L$ that assigns to each $z$ in $V\cup E$ a set $L(z)$ of two real numbers, there exists a {proper total weighting} $w$ with $w(z)\in L(z)$ for every $z\in V\cup E$. Wong and Zhu, and independently Przyby{\l}o and Wo\'{z}niak conjectured that every simple graph is $(2,2)$-choosable. This conjecture remains open.
  For a set $\{a,b\}\subset \mathbb R$, its span is defined as $|b-a|$. We call a graph $G=(V,E)$ \emph{uniform-span} $(2,2)$-\emph{choosable} if, for any list assignment $L$ that assigns to every $z\in V\cup E$ a two-element list of a common span, there exists a {proper total weighting} respecting the assignment. In this paper, we present a novel lemma and perform comprehensive enhancements to our previous algorithm. These contributions enable us to prove that every graph is uniform-span $(2,2)$-choosable, and thus admits a proper total weighting using any prescribed pair $\{a,b\}\subset \mathbb R$. This confirms the 1-2 conjecture in full generality.</description>

Abstract: Foulkes' conjecture has several generalisations due to Doran, Abdesselam--Chipalkatti, Bergeron, and Troyka. For the special linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$, these assert that given $a \le c \le d \le b$ with $ab=cd$, the $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-representation $\mathrm{Sym}^a\mathrm{Sym}^b\mathbb{C}^2$ is a subrepresentation of $\mathrm{Sym}^c\mathrm{Sym}^d\mathbb{C}^2$. We present a short proof in the case where $a$ divides $c$ or $d$, which includes all prime values of $a$. This is the first proof in this family of conjectures valid for infinitely many values of $a$; previously only the cases $a=2$ and $a=3$ were known.</description>

      <title>Characterization of matchable sets and subspaces via Dyson transforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A matching from a finite subset $A$ of an abelian group $G$ to another subset $B$ is a bijection $f : A \to B$ such that $af(a) \notin A$ for all $a \in A$. The study of matchings began in the 1990s and was motivated by a conjecture of E. K. Wakeford on canonical forms for homogeneous polynomials. The theory was later extended to the linear setting of vector subspaces over field extensions, and then to matroids. In this paper, we investigate the existence and structure of matchings in both abelian groups and field extensions. Using Dyson's $e$-transform, a tool from additive combinatorics, along with a linear analogue which is introduced in this paper, we establish characterization theorems for matchable sets and subspaces. Several applications are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of these theorems as standalone tools. Throughout, we highlight the parallels between the group-theoretic and linear perspectives.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents `chipfiring`, a comprehensive Python package for the mathematical analysis of chip-firing games on finite graphs. The package provides a robust toolkit for defining graphs and chip configurations (divisors), performing chip-firing operations, and analyzing fundamental properties such as winnability, linear equivalence, and divisor rank. We detail the core components of the library, including its object-oriented graph and divisor implementations, integrated Laplacian matrix computations, and an efficient implementation of Dhar's algorithm for determining the solvability of the dollar game. The `chipfiring` package is designed for researchers and students in graph theory, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry, providing essential algorithms and data structures for exploring these rich mathematical models. We describe the library's architecture, illustrate its usage with comprehensive examples, and highlight its specialized contributions compared to general-purpose graph libraries.</description>

Abstract: We prove an optimal strategy for the children's game Guess Who? assuming the official rules are in use and that both players ask `classical' questions with a bipartite response. Applying a technique described in [Rabern, B \&amp; Rabern, L 2008, 'A simple solution to the hardest logic puzzle ever', \textit{Analysis}, vol. 68, no. 2, pp.~105-112.] allows for questions with tripartite responses; we explain this innovation and give an optimal strategy for two players applying it.</description>

      <title>A Maximum Linear Arrangement Problem on Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.12277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new arrangement problem on directed graphs, Maximum Directed Linear Arrangement (MaxDLA). This is a directed variant of a similar problem for undirected graphs, in which however one seeks maximum and not minimum; this problem known as the Minimum Linear Arrangement Problem (MinLA) has been much studied in the literature. We establish a number of theorems illustrating the behavior and complexity of MaxDLA. First, we relate MaxDLA to Maximum Directed Cut (MaxDiCut) by proving that every simple digraph $D$ on $n$ vertices satisfies $\frac{n}{2}$$maxDiCut(D) \leq MaxDLA(D) \leq (n-1)MaxDiCut(D)$. Next, we prove that MaxDiCut is NP-Hard for planar digraphs (even with the added restriction of maximum degree 15); it follows from the above bounds that MaxDLA is also NP-Hard for planar digraphs. In contrast, Hadlock (1975) and Dorfman and Orlova (1972) showed that the undirected Maximum Cut problem is solvable in polynomial time on planar graphs.
  On the positive side, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for solving MaxDLA on orientations of trees with degree bounded by a constant, which translates to a polynomial-time algorithm for solving MinLA on the complements of those trees. This pairs with results by Goldberg and Klipker (1976), Shiloach (1979) and Chung (1984) solving MinLA in polynomial time on trees. Finally, analogues of Harper's famous isoperimetric inequality for the hypercube, in the setting of MaxDLA, are shown for tournaments, orientations of graphs with degree at most two, and transitive acyclic digraphs.</description>

      <title>Dao numbers and the asymptotic behaviour of fullness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05555v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the Dao numbers $\mathfrak{d}_1(I),\mathfrak{d}_2(I)$ and $\mathfrak{d}_3(I)$ of an ideal $I$ of a Noetherian local ring $(R,\mathfrak{m},K)$ or a standard graded Noetherian $K$-algebra. They are defined as the smallest $\ell\ge0$ such that $I\mathfrak{m}^k$ is $\mathfrak{m}$-full, full, weakly $\mathfrak{m}$-full, respectively, for all $k\ge\ell$. We provide general bounds for the Dao numbers in terms of the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of certain modules over the Rees algebra $\mathcal{R}(\mathfrak{m})$. If $R$ is a Koszul algebra, we prove that the Dao numbers are less or equal to $\text{reg}_{\text{gr}_\mathfrak{m}(R)}\text{gr}_\mathfrak{m}(I)$, where $\text{gr}_\mathfrak{m}(I)$ is the associated graded module of $I$. Finally, for monomial ideals, we combinatorially bound the Dao numbers in terms of asymptotic linear quotients and bounding multidegrees.</description>

      <title>On the enumeration of signatures of XOR-CNF's</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a CNF formula $\varphi$ with clauses $C_1, \dots, C_m$ over a set of variables $V$, a truth assignment $\mathbf{a} : V \to \{0, 1\}$ generates a binary sequence $\sigma_\varphi(\mathbf{a})=(C_1(\mathbf{a}), \ldots, C_m(\mathbf{a}))$, called a signature of $\varphi$, where $C_i(\mathbf{a})=1$ if clause $C_i$ evaluates to 1 under assignment $\mathbf{a}$, and $C_i(\mathbf{a})=0$ otherwise. Signatures and their associated generation problems have given rise to new yet promising research questions in algorithmic enumeration. In a recent paper, B\'erczi et al. interestingly proved that generating signatures of a CNF is tractable despite the fact that verifying a solution is hard. They also showed the hardness of finding maximal signatures of an arbitrary CNF due to the intractability of satisfiability in general. Their contribution leaves open the problem of efficiently generating maximal signatures for tractable classes of CNFs, i.e., those for which satisfiability can be solved in polynomial time. Stepping into that direction, we completely characterize the complexity of generating all, minimal, and maximal signatures for XOR-CNFs.</description>

      <title>When are quarnets sufficient to reconstruct semi-directed phylogenetic networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are graphs that are used to represent evolutionary relationships between different taxa. They generalize phylogenetic trees since for example, unlike trees, they permit lineages to combine. Recently, there has been rising interest in semi-directed phylogenetic networks, which are mixed graphs in which certain lineage combination events are represented by directed edges coming together, whereas the remaining edges are left undirected. One reason to consider such networks is that it can be difficult to root a network using real data. In this paper, we consider the problem of when a semi-directed phylogenetic network is defined or encoded by the smaller networks that it induces on the 4-leaf subsets of its leaf set. These smaller networks are called quarnets. We prove that semi-directed binary level-2 phylogenetic networks are encoded by their quarnets, but that this is not the case for level-3. In addition, we prove that the so-called blob tree of a semi-directed binary network, a tree that give the coarse-grained structure of the network, is always encoded by the quarnets of the network. These results are relevant for proving the statistical consistency of programs that are currently being developed for reconstructing phylogenetic networks from practical data, such as the recently developed Squirrel software tool.</description>

      <title>Machines and Mathematical Mutations: Using GNNs to Characterize Quiver Mutation Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is becoming an increasingly valuable tool in mathematics, enabling one to identify subtle patterns across collections of examples so vast that they would be impossible for a single researcher to feasibly review and analyze. In this work, we use graph neural networks to investigate \emph{quiver mutation} -- an operation that transforms one quiver (or directed multigraph) into another -- which is central to the theory of cluster algebras with deep connections to geometry, topology, and physics. In the study of cluster algebras, the question of \emph{mutation equivalence} is of fundamental concern: given two quivers, can one efficiently determine if one quiver can be transformed into the other through a sequence of mutations? In this paper, we use graph neural networks and AI explainability techniques to independently discover mutation equivalence criteria for quivers of type $\tilde{D}$. Along the way, we also show that even without explicit training to do so, our model captures structure within its hidden representation that allows us to reconstruct known criteria from type $D$, adding to the growing evidence that modern machine learning models are capable of learning abstract and parsimonious rules from mathematical data.</description>

      <title>Vietoris-Rips complexes of torus grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of Vietoris--Rips complexes of finite grids on the torus. Let $T_{n,n}$ be the grid of $n\times n$ points on the flat torus $S^1\times S^1$, equipped with the $l^1$ metric. Let $\mathrm{VR}(T_{n,n};k)$ be the Vietoris--Rips simplicial complex of this torus grid at scale $k\ge 0$. For $n\ge 7$ and small scales $2\le k\le \frac{n-1}{3}$, the complex $\mathrm{VR}(T_{n,n};k)$ is homotopy equivalent to the torus. For large scales $k\ge 2\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$, the complex $\mathrm{VR}(T_{n,n};k)$ is a simplex and hence contractible. Interesting topology arises over intermediate scales $\frac{n-1}{3}&lt;k&lt;2\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$. For example, we prove that $\mathrm{VR}(T_{2n,2n};2n-1)\cong S^{2n^2-1}$ for $n\ge 2$, that $\mathrm{VR}(T_{3n,3n};n)\simeq\vee^{6n^2-1}S^2$ for $n\ge 2$, and that $\mathrm{VR}(T_{3n-1,3n-1};n)\simeq \bigvee_{6n-3} S^2\vee \bigvee_{6n-2}S^3$ for $n\geq 3$. Based on homology computations, we conjecture that $\mathrm{VR}(T_{n,n};k)$ is homotopy equivalent to a $3$-sphere for a countable family of $(n,k)$ pairs, and we prove this for $(n,k)=(7,4)$.</description>

      <title>Enumerating minimal dominating sets and variants in chordal bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enumerating minimal dominating sets with polynomial delay in bipartite graphs is a long-standing open problem. To date, even the subcase of chordal bipartite graphs is open, with the best known algorithm due to Golovach, Heggernes, Kant\'e, Kratsch, Saether, and Villanger running in incremental-polynomial time. We improve on this result by providing a polynomial delay and space algorithm enumerating minimal dominating sets in chordal bipartite graphs. Additionally, we show that the total and connected variants admit polynomial and incremental-polynomial delay algorithms, respectively, within the same class. This provides an alternative proof of a result by Golovach et al. for total dominating sets, and answers an open question for the connected variant. Finally, we give evidence that the techniques used in this paper cannot be generalized to bipartite graphs for (total) minimal dominating sets, unless P = NP, and show that enumerating minimal connected dominating sets in bipartite graphs is harder than enumerating minimal transversals in general hypergraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify all graphs $G$ satisfying the property that all matching powers $I(G)^{[k]}$ of the edge ideal $I(G)$ are bi-Cohen-Macaulay for $1\le k\le\nu(G)$, where $\nu(G)$ is the maximum size of a matching of $G$.</description>

      <title>Sharp character bounds and cutoff for symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a flexible technique to bound the characters of symmetric groups, via the Naruse hook length formula, the Larsen--Shalev character bounds, and appropriate diagram slicings. It allows us to prove a uniform exponential character bound with optimal constant $1/2$. We furthermore prove sharp character bounds for conjugacy classes having a macroscopic number of fixed points, and deduce that the random walks on the associated Cayley graphs exhibit a total variation and $L^2$ cutoff.</description>
