      <title>Spatio-temporal patterns of active epigenetic turnover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA methylation is a primary layer of epigenetic modification that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of development, aging, and cancer. The concurrent activity of opposing enzymes that mediate DNA methylation and demethylation gives rise to a biochemical cycle and active turnover of DNA methylation. While the ensuing biochemical oscillations have been implicated in the regulation of cell differentiation, their functional role and spatio-temporal dynamics are, however, unknown. In this work, we demonstrate that chromatin-mediated coupling between these local biochemical cycles can lead to the emergence of phase-locked domains, regions of locally synchronized turnover activity, whose coarsening is arrested by genomic heterogeneity. We introduce a minimal model based on stochastic oscillators with constrained long-range and non-reciprocal interactions, shaped by the local chromatin organization. Through a combination of analytical theory and stochastic simulations, we predict both the degree of synchronization and the typical size of emergent phase-locked domains. We qualitatively test these predictions using single-cell sequencing data. Our results show that DNA methylation turnover exhibits surprisingly rich spatio-temporal patterns which may be used by cells to control cell differentiation.</description>

      <title>Evaluation and optimization of deep learning models for enhanced detection of brain cancer using transmission optical microscopy of thin brain tissue samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical transmission spectroscopy is one method to understand brain tissue structural properties from brain tissue biopsy samples, yet manual interpretation is resource intensive and prone to inter observer variability. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer automated feature learning directly from raw brightfield images. Here, we evaluate ResNet50 and DenseNet121 on a curated dataset of 2,931 bright-field transmission optical microscopy images of thin brain tissue, split into 1,996 for training, 437 for validation, and 498 for testing. Our two stage transfer learning protocol involves initial training of a classifier head on frozen pretrained feature extractors, followed by fine tuning of deeper convolutional blocks with extensive data augmentation (rotations, flips, intensity jitter) and early stopping. DenseNet121 achieves 88.35 percent test accuracy, 0.9614 precision, 0.8667 recall, and 0.9116 F1 score the best performance compared to ResNet50 (82.12 percent, 0.9035, 0.8142, 0.8563). Detailed analysis of confusion matrices, training and validation curves, and classwise prediction distributions illustrates robust convergence and minimal bias. These findings demonstrate the superior generalization of dense connectivity on limited medical datasets and outline future directions for multi-class tumor grading and clinical translation.</description>

      <title>Measuring the mechanical properties of asymmetric membranes in computer simulations -- new methods and insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Monte Carlo simulations of an ultra coarse-grained lipid bilayer with different number of lipids on both leaflets. In the simulations, we employ a new method for measuring the elastic parameters of the membrane, including the area per lipid, area elasticity modulus, and bending rigidity. The method also allows to measure the spontaneous curvature and non-local bending modulus, which are not accessible by standard computer simulations with periodic boundary conditions. For membranes with lipid densities much smaller than the liquid to gel transition density, $\rho_g$, we find a very good agreement between the simulation results and the theory expressing the bilayer elastic free energy as the sum of quadratic free energies in the strains associated with the area density and the local curvature of the monolayers. The theory fails when the lipid area density (in the symmetric reference case) is only slightly smaller than $\rho_g$. Increasing the degree of asymmetry and changing the density of the condensed leaflet to a value larger than $\rho_g$, causes the layer to phase separate between regions with distinct densities which, in turn, may also induce density variations in the dilated liquid layer. Moreover, the phase separation may also trigger local curvature variations along the membrane, which can be attributed to the disparity between the values of the elastic parameters of the coexisting bilayer segments that are mechanically coupled. This mechanism leading to density-curvature variations and instabilities may play a role in cellular processes occurring in liquid-ordered raft domains that are surrounded by the disordered liquid matrix of the cell.</description>

      <title>Polymer (imperfect) single-file diffusion: A phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Langevin dynamics (LD) simulations to investigate single-file diffusion (SFD) in a dilute solution of flexible linear polymers inside a narrow tube with periodic boundary conditions (a torus). The transition from SFD, where the time (t) dependence of the mean-square displacement scales like $\langle x^2\rangle \sim t^{1/2}$, to normal diffusion with $\langle x^2 \rangle \sim t$, is studied as a function of the system parameters, such as the size and concentration of the polymer chains and the width of the tube. We propose a phase diagram describing different diffusion regimes. In particular, we highlight the fact that there are two different pathways to normal long-time diffusion. We also map this problem onto a one-dimensional Lattice Monte Carlo model where the diffusing object represents the polymer center of mass. Possible extensions of this work to polydisperse polymer solutions, one-dimensional electrophoresis and DNA mapping are discussed.</description>

      <title>Characterization of phospholipid-cholesterol bilayers as self-assembled amphiphile block polymers that contain headgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12726v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cholesterol is known to modulate the structure and function of biological membranes. In this study, we use self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to investigate phospholipid/cholesterol bilayer membranes modeled with two types of diblock copolymers. These copolymer-based bilayers serve as biomimetic platforms with applications in areas such as drug delivery. Our simulations identify a minimum free energy configuration characterized by phospholipid tails tilted relative to the membrane normal. The model quantitatively captures the well-known area condensation effect as cholesterol concentration increases, along with membrane thickening and reduced tilt angle. Thermodynamically, we observe a linear dependence between cholesterol's chemical potential and its concentration within the 37-50% range, consistent with experimental results. Additionally, we analyze the effects of block copolymer length and headgroup interactions on bilayer structure. Interactions between phospholipid headgroups and the solvent emerge as the most influential. This work provides a theoretical framework for understanding cholesterol's regulatory role in membrane structure and mechanics.</description>

      <title>Flow interactions and forward flight dynamics of tandem flapping wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine theoretically the flow interactions and forward flight dynamics of tandem or in-line flapping wings. Two wings are driven vertically with prescribed heaving-and-plunging motions, and the horizontal propulsion speeds and positions are dynamically selected through aero- or hydro-dynamic interactions. Our simulations employ an improved vortex sheet method to solve for the locomotion of the pair within the collective flow field, and we identify 'schooling states' in which the wings travel together with nearly constant separation. Multiple terminal configurations are achieved by varying the initial conditions, and the emergent separations are approximately integer multiples of the wavelength traced out by each wing. We explain the stability of these states by perturbing the follower and mapping out an effective potential for its position in the leader's wake. Each equilibrium position is stabilized since smaller separations are associated with in-phase follower-wake motions that constructively reinforce the flow but lead to decreased thrust on the follower; larger separations are associated with antagonistic follower-wake motions, increased thrust, and a weakened collective wake. The equilibria and their stability are also corroborated by a linearized theory for the motion of the leader, the wake it produces, and its effect on the follower. We also consider a weakly-flapping follower driven with lower heaving amplitude than the leader. We identify 'keep-up' conditions for which the wings may still 'school' together despite their dissimilar kinematics, with the 'freeloading' follower passively assuming a favorable position within the wake that permits it to travel significantly faster than it would in isolation.</description>

      <title>Inferring stochastic dynamics with growth from cross-sectional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13197v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved single-cell omics data offers high-throughput, genome-wide measurements of cellular states, which are instrumental to reverse-engineer the processes underpinning cell fate. Such technologies are inherently destructive, allowing only cross-sectional measurements of the underlying stochastic dynamical system. Furthermore, cells may divide or die in addition to changing their molecular state. Collectively these present a major challenge to inferring realistic biophysical models. We present a novel approach, \emph{unbalanced} probability flow inference, that addresses this challenge for biological processes modelled as stochastic dynamics with growth. By leveraging a Lagrangian formulation of the Fokker-Planck equation, our method accurately disentangles drift from intrinsic noise and growth. We showcase the applicability of our approach through evaluation on a range of simulated and real single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Comparing to several existing methods, we find our method achieves higher accuracy while enjoying a simple two-step training scheme.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Control of Evolutionary and Ecological Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Evolutionary Dynamics moves from the realm of theory into application, algorithms are needed to move beyond simple models. Yet few such methods exist in the literature. Ecological and physiological factors are known to be central to evolution in realistic contexts, but accounting for them generally renders problems intractable to existing methods. We introduce a formulation of evolutionary games which accounts for ecology and physiology by modeling both as computations and use this to analyze the problem of directed evolution via methods from Reinforcement Learning. This combination enables us to develop first-of-their-kind results on the algorithmic problem of learning to control an evolving population of cells. We prove a complexity bound on eco-evolutionary control in situations with limited prior knowledge of cellular physiology or ecology, give the first results on the most general version of the mathematical problem of directed evolution, and establish a new link between AI and biology.</description>

      <title>Boundary geometry controls a topological defect transition that determines lumen nucleation in embryonic development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological defects determine the collective properties of anisotropic materials. How their configurations are controlled is not well understood however, especially in 3D. In living matter moreover, 2D defects have been linked to biological functions, but the role of 3D polar defects is unclear. Combining computational and experimental approaches, we investigate how confinement geometry controls surface-aligned polar fluids, and what biological role 3D polar defects play in tissues interacting with extracellular boundaries. We discover a charge-preserving transition between 3D defect configurations driven by boundary geometry and independent of material parameters, and show that defect positions predict the locations where fluid-filled lumina -- structures essential for development -- form within the confined polar tissue of the mouse embryo. Experimentally perturbing embryo shape beyond the transition point, we moreover create additional lumina at predicted defect locations. Our work reveals how boundary geometry controls polar defects, and how embryos use this mechanism for shape-dependent lumen formation. We expect this defect control principle to apply broadly to systems with orientational order.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Three-dimensional Nematic Guidance of Microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that an anisotropic liquid crystalline (LC) environment can be used to guide the self-propulsion dynamics of dispersed microswimmers, such as bacteria. This type of composite system is named "living nematic" (LN). In the dilute limit, bacteria are found to mainly follow the local director field. Beyond the dilute limit, however, they exhibit novel dynamical behaviors, from swirling around a spiral +1 defect pattern to forming undulating waves, and to active turbulence. Our current knowledge of how these different behaviors emerge at different population densities remains limited. Here we develop a hybrid method to simulate the dynamics of microswimmers dispersed in a nematic LC. Specifically, we model the microswimmers using active Brownian dynamics method, which is coupled to a hydrodynamic model of nematic LCs to describe the evolution of the flow field and the LC structure. Our method is validated by comparing to existing quasi-two-dimensional (2D) experiments, including undulated swirling around a spiral pattern and stabilized undulated jets on a periodic C-pattern. We further extend our method to three-dimensional (3D) systems by examining loop-defect dynamics. We find that the morphodynamics and destiny of a loop defect not only depend on the activity (self-propulsion velocity), effective size, and the initial distribution of the swimmers, but also rely on its winding profile. Specifically, +1/2 wedge and radial twist winding can dictate the dynamics of loop defects. By varying the characteristic reversal time, we predict that microswimmers not necessarily accumulate in splay regions. Taken together, our hybrid method provides a faithful tool to explain and guide the experiments of LNs in both 2D and 3D, sheds light on the interplay between microswimmer distribution and defect dynamics, and unravels the design principles of using LCs to control active matter.</description>
