      <title>Computational Study on the Impact of Gasoline-Ethanol Blending on Autoignition and Soot/NOx Emissions under Gasoline Compression Ignition Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of a single-cylinder gasoline compression ignition engine are performed to investigate the impact of gasoline-ethanol blending on autoignition, nitrogen oxide (NOx), and soot emissions under low-load conditions. A four-component toluene primary reference fuel (TPRF) + ethanol (ETPRF) surrogate (with 10% ethanol by volume; E10) is employed to represent the test gasoline (RD5-87). A 3D engine CFD model employing finite-rate chemistry with a skeletal kinetic mechanism, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), and hybrid method of moments (HMOM) is adopted to capture in-cylinder combustion and soot/NOx emissions. The engine CFD model is validated against experimental data for three gasoline-ethanol blends: E10, E30 and E100, with varying ethanol content by volume. Model validation is carried out for multiple start-of-injection (SOI) timings (-21, -27, -36, and -45 crank angle degrees after top-dead-center (aTDC)) with respect to in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate, combustion phasing, NOx and soot emissions. For late injection timings (-21 and -27oaTDC), E30 yields higher soot than E10; while the trend reverses for early injection cases (-36 and -45oaTDC). E100 yields the lowest amount of soot among all fuels irrespective of SOI timing. Further, E10 shows a non-monotonic trend in soot emissions with SOI timing: SOI-36&gt;SOI-45&gt;SOI-21&gt;SOI-27, while soot emissions from E30 exhibit monotonic decrease with advancing SOI timing. NOx emissions from various fuels follow a trend of E10&gt;E30&gt;E100. NOx emissions increase as SOI timing is advanced for all fuels, with an anomaly for E10 and E100 where NOx decreases when SOI is advanced beyond -36oaTDC. Detailed analysis of the numerical results is performed to investigate the emission trends and elucidate the impact of chemical composition and physical properties on autoignition and emissions characteristics.</description>

      <title>A new coupled electro-thermo-fluid radiofrequency model of cardiac tissue: Mathematical modeling, analysis and numerical simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a nonlinear reaction-diffusion-fluid system that simulates radiofrequency ablation within cardiac tissue.
  The model conveys the dynamic evolution of temperature and electric potential in both the fluid and solid regions, along with the evolution of velocity within the solid region.
  By formulating the system that describes the phenomena across the entire domain, encompassing both solid and fluid phases, we proceed to an analysis of well-posedness, considering a broad class of right-hand side terms. The system involves parameters such as heat conductivity, kinematic viscosity, and electrical conductivity, all of which exhibit nonlinearity contingent upon the temperature variable.
  The mathematical analysis extends to establishing the existence of a global solution, employing the Faedo-Galerkin method in a three-dimensional space.
  To enhance the practical applicability of our theoretical results, we complement our study with a series of numerical experiments. We implement the discrete system using the finite element method for spatial discretization and an Euler scheme for temporal discretization. Nonlinear parameters are linearized through decoupling systems, as introduced in our continuous analysis. These experiments are conducted to demonstrate and validate the theoretical findings we have established.</description>

      <title>High order Well-Balanced Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian ADER discontinuous Galerkin schemes on general polygonal moving meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel family of high order accurate numerical schemes for the solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) which combines several geometrical and physical structure preserving properties. First, we settle our methods in the Lagrangian framework, where each element of the mesh evolves following as close as possible the local fluid flow, so to reduce the numerical dissipation at contact waves and moving interfaces and to satisfy the Galilean and rotational invariance properties of the studied PDEs system. In particular, we choose the direct Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach which, in order to always guarantee the high quality of the moving mesh, allows to combine the Lagrangian motion with mesh optimization techniques. The employed polygonal tessellation is thus regenerated at each time step, the previous one is connected with the new one by space-time control volumes, including hole-like sliver elements in correspondence of topology changes, over which we integrate a space-time divergence form of the original PDEs through a high order accurate ADER discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme. Mass conservation and adherence to the GCL condition are guaranteed by construction thanks to the integration over closed control volumes, and robustness over shock discontinuities is ensured by the use of an a posteriori subcell finite volume (FV) limiting technique.</description>

      <title>Reduced Basis Method for the Elastic Scattering by Multiple Shape-Parametric Open Arcs in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the elastic scattering problem by multiple disjoint arcs or \emph{cracks} in two spatial dimensions. A key aspect of our approach lies in the parametric description of each arc's shape, which is controlled by a potentially high-dimensional, possibly countably infinite, set of parameters. We are interested in the efficient approximation of the parameter-to-solution map employing model order reduction techniques, specifically the reduced basis method.
  Initially, we utilize boundary potentials to transform the boundary value problem, originally posed in an unbounded domain, into a system of boundary integral equations set on the parametrically defined open arcs. Our aim is to construct a rapid surrogate for solving this problem. To achieve this, we adopt the two-phase paradigm of the reduced basis method. In the offline phase, we compute solutions for this problem under the assumption of complete decoupling among arcs for various shapes. Leveraging these high-fidelity solutions and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), we construct a reduced-order basis tailored to the single arc problem. Subsequently, in the online phase, when computing solutions for the multiple arc problem with a new parametric input, we utilize the aforementioned basis for each individual arc. To expedite the offline phase, we employ a modified version of the Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM) to compute a precise and cost-effective affine representation of the interaction terms between arcs. Finally, we present a series of numerical experiments demonstrating the advantages of our proposed method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>The truncated EM scheme for multiple-delay SDEs with irregular coefficients and application to stochastic volatility model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the numerical scheme for multiple-delay stochastic differential equations with partially H\"older continuous drifts and locally H\"older continuous diffusion coefficients. To handle with the superlinear terms in coefficients, the truncated Euler-Maruyama scheme is employed. Under the given conditions, the convergence rates at time $T$ in both $\mathcal{L}^{1}$ and $\mathcal{L}^{2}$ senses are shown by virtue of the Yamada-Watanabe approximation technique. Moreover, the convergence rates over a finite time interval $[0,T]$ are also obtained. Additionally, it should be noted that the convergence rates will not be affected by the number of delay variables. Finally, we perform the numerical experiments on the stochastic volatility model to verify the reliability of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Mesh-free mixed finite element approximation for nonlinear time-fractional biharmonic problem using weighted b-splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a fully-discrete scheme for the numerical solution of a nonlinear time-fractional biharmonic problem. This problem is first converted into an equivalent system by introducing a new variable. Then spatial and temporal discretizations are done by the weighted $b$-spline method and $L2$-$1_\sigma$ approximation, respectively. The weighted $b$-spline method uses weighted $b$-splines on a tensor product grid as basis functions for the finite element space and by construction, it is a mesh-free method. This method combines the computational benefits of $b$-splines and standard mesh-based elements. We derive $\alpha$-robust \emph{a priori} bound and convergence estimate in the $L^2(\Omega)$ norm for the proposed scheme. Finally, we carry out few numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Localized Orthogonal Decomposition Methods vs. Classical FEM for the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-dependent Gross-Pitaevksii equation (GPE) is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation which is used in quantum physics to model the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates. In this work we consider numerical approximations of the GPE based on a multiscale approach known as the localized orthogonal decomposition. Combined with an energy preserving time integrator one derives a method which is of high order in space and time under mild regularity assumptions. In previous work, the method has been shown to be numerically very efficient compared to first order Lagrange FEM. In this paper, we further investigate the performance of the method and compare it with higher order Lagrange FEM. For rough problems we observe that the novel method performs very efficient and retains its high order, while the classical methods can only compete well for smooth problems.</description>

      <title>Determination of a Small Elliptical Anomaly in Electrical Impedance Tomography using Minimal Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of determining a small elliptical conductivity anomaly in a unit disc from boundary measurements. The conductivity of the anomaly is assumed to be a small perturbation from the constant background. A measurement of voltage across two point-electrodes on the boundary through which a constant current is passed. We further assume the limiting case when the distance between two electrodes go to zero, creating a dipole field. We show that three such measurements suffice to locate the anomaly size and location inside the disc. Two further measurements are needed to obtain the aspect ratio and the orientation of the ellipse. The investigation includes the studies of the stability of the inverse problem and optimal experiment design.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo and importance sampling methods for Bayesian inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Importance Sampling (IS), an effective variance reduction strategy in Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, is frequently utilized for Bayesian inference and other statistical challenges. Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) replaces the random samples in MC with low discrepancy points and has the potential to substantially enhance error rates. In this paper, we integrate IS with a randomly shifted rank-1 lattice rule, a widely used QMC method, to approximate posterior expectations arising from Bayesian Inverse Problems (BIPs) where the posterior density tends to concentrate as the intensity of noise diminishes. Within the framework of weighted Hilbert spaces, we first establish the convergence rate of the lattice rule for a large class of unbounded integrands. This method extends to the analysis of QMC combined with IS in BIPs. Furthermore, we explore the robustness of the IS-based randomly shifted rank-1 lattice rule by determining the quadrature error rate with respect to the noise level. The effects of using Gaussian distributions and $t$-distributions as the proposal distributions on the error rate of QMC are comprehensively investigated. We find that the error rate may deteriorate at low intensity of noise when using improper proposals, such as the prior distribution. To reclaim the effectiveness of QMC, we propose a new IS method such that the lattice rule with $N$ quadrature points achieves an optimal error rate close to $O(N^{-1})$, which is insensitive to the noise level. Numerical experiments are conducted to support the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Stochastic approach for elliptic problems in perforated domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of applications in science and engineering involve a PDE model in a domain with perforations, such as perforated metals or air filters. Solving such perforated domain problems suffers from computational challenges related to resolving the scale imposed by the geometries of perforations. We propose a neural network-based mesh-free approach for perforated domain problems. The method is robust and efficient in capturing various configuration scales, including the averaged macroscopic behavior of the solution that involves a multiscale nature induced by small perforations. The new approach incorporates the derivative-free loss method that uses a stochastic representation or the Feynman-Kac formulation. In particular, we implement the Neumann boundary condition for the derivative-free loss method to handle the interface between the domain and perforations. A suite of stringent numerical tests is provided to support the proposed method's efficacy in handling various perforation scales.</description>

      <title>Well-balanced path-conservative discontinuous Galerkin methods with equilibrium preserving space for two-layer shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces well-balanced path-conservative discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for two-layer shallow water equations, ensuring exactness for both still water and moving water equilibrium steady states. The approach involves approximating the equilibrium variables within the DG piecewise polynomial space, while expressing the DG scheme in the form of path-conservative schemes. To robustly handle the nonconservative products governing momentum exchange between the layers, we incorporate the theory of Dal Maso, LeFloch, and Murat (DLM) within the DG method. Additionally, linear segment paths connecting the equilibrium functions are chosen to guarantee the well-balanced property of the resulting scheme. The simple ``lake-at-rest" steady state is naturally satisfied without any modification, while a specialized treatment of the numerical flux is crucial for preserving the moving water steady state. Extensive numerical examples in one and two dimensions validate the exact equilibrium preservation of the steady state solutions and demonstrate its high-order accuracy. The performance of the method and high-resolution results further underscore its potential as a robust approach for nonconservative hyperbolic balance laws.</description>

      <title>A physics-informed neural network method for the approximation of slow invariant manifolds for the general class of stiff systems of ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach for the discovery of slow invariant manifolds (SIMs), for the most general class of fast/slow dynamical systems of ODEs. In contrast to other machine learning (ML) approaches that construct reduced order black box surrogate models using simple regression, and/or require a priori knowledge of the fast and slow variables, our approach, simultaneously decomposes the vector field into fast and slow components and provides a functional of the underlying SIM in a closed form. The decomposition is achieved by finding a transformation of the state variables to the fast and slow ones, which enables the derivation of an explicit, in terms of fast variables, SIM functional. The latter is obtained by solving a PDE corresponding to the invariance equation within the Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT) using a single-layer feedforward neural network with symbolic differentiation. The performance of the proposed physics-informed ML framework is assessed via three benchmark problems: the Michaelis-Menten, the target mediated drug disposition (TMDD) reaction model and a fully competitive substrate-inhibitor(fCSI) mechanism. We also provide a comparison with other GPST methods, namely the quasi steady state approximation (QSSA), the partial equilibrium approximation (PEA) and CSP with one and two iterations. We show that the proposed PINN scheme provides SIM approximations, of equivalent or even higher accuracy, than those provided by QSSA, PEA and CSP, especially close to the boundaries of the underlying SIMs.</description>

      <title>Semi-Analytical Methods for Population Balance models involving Aggregation and Breakage processes: A comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Population balance models often integrate fundamental kernels, including sum, gelling and Brownian aggregation kernels. These kernels have demonstrated extensive utility across various disciplines such as aerosol physics, chemical engineering, astrophysics, pharmaceutical sciences and mathematical biology for the purpose of elucidating particle dynamics. The objective of this study is to refine the semi-analytical solutions derived from current methodologies in addressing the nonlinear aggregation and coupled aggregation-breakage population balance equation. This work presents a unique semi-analytical approach based on the homotopy analysis method (HAM) to solve pure aggregation and couple aggregation-fragmentation population balance equations, which is an integro-partial differentia equation. By decomposing the non-linear operator, we investigate how to utilize the convergence control parameter to expedite the convergence of the HAM solution towards its precise values in the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Finite element method coupled with multiscale finite element method for the non-stationary Stokes-Darcy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we combine the multiscale flnite element method to propose an algorithm for solving the non-stationary Stokes-Darcy model, where the permeability coefflcient in the Darcy region exhibits multiscale characteristics. Our algorithm involves two steps: first, conducting the parallel computation of multiscale basis functions in the Darcy region. Second, based on these multiscale basis functions, we employ an implicitexplicit scheme to solve the Stokes-Darcy equations. One signiflcant feature of the algorithm is that it solves problems on relatively coarse grids, thus signiflcantly reducing computational costs. Moreover, under the same coarse grid size, it exhibits higher accuracy compared to standard flnite element method. Under the assumption that the permeability coefflcient is periodic and independent of time, this paper demonstrates the stability and convergence of the algorithm. Finally, the rationality and effectiveness of the algorithm are verifled through three numerical experiments, with experimental results consistent with theoretical analysis.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on efficient methods to solve discretized linear systems obtained from eddy current optimal control problems in an all-at-once approach. We construct a new low-rank matrix equation method based on a special splitting of the coefficient matrix and the Krylov-plus-inverted-Krylov (KPIK) algorithm. Firstly, we rewrite the resulting discretized linear system in a matrix-equation form. Then using the KPIK algorithm, we can obtain the low-rank approximation solution. The new method is named the splitting-based Krylov-plus-inverted-Krylov (SKPIK) method. The SKPIK method can not only solve the large and sparse discretized systems fast but also overcomes the storage problem. Theoretical results about the existence of the low-rank solutions are given. Numerical experiments are used to illustrate the performance of the new low-rank matrix equation method by compared with some existing classical efficient methods.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Stabilization of Nitsche's Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak imposition of essential boundary conditions is an integral aspect of unfitted finite element methods, where the physical boundary does not in general coincide with the computational domain. In this regard, the symmetric Nitsche's method is a powerful technique that preserves the symmetry and variational consistency of the unmodified weak formulation. The stabilization parameter in Nitsche's method plays a crucial role in the stability of the resultant formulation, whose estimation is computationally intensive and dependent on the particular cut configuration using the conventional eigenvalue-based approach. In this work, we employ as model problem the finite cell method in which the need for the generation of a boundary-conforming mesh is circumvented by embedding the physical domain in a, typically regular, background mesh. We propose a data-driven estimate based on machine learning methods for the estimation of the stabilization parameter in Nitsche's method that offers an efficient constant-complexity alternative to the eigenvalue-based approach independent of the cut configuration. It is shown, using numerical benchmarks, that the proposed method can estimate the stabilization parameter accurately and is by far more computationally efficient. The data-driven estimate can be integrated into existing numerical codes with minimal modifications and thanks to the wide adoption of accelerators such as GPUs by machine learning frameworks, can be used with virtually no extra implementation cost on GPU devices, further increasing the potential for computational gains over the conventional eigenvalue-based estimate.</description>

      <title>A restricted additive smoother for finite cell flow problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an adaptive geometric multigrid method for the solution of large-scale finite cell flow problems. The finite cell method seeks to circumvent the need for a boundary-conforming mesh through the embedding of the physical domain in a regular background mesh. As a result of the intersection between the physical domain and the background computational mesh, the resultant systems of equations are typically numerically ill-conditioned, rendering the appropriate treatment of cutcells a crucial aspect of the solver. To this end, we propose a smoother operator with favorable parallel properties and discuss its memory footprint and parallelization aspects. We propose three cache policies that offer a balance between cached and on-the-fly computation and discuss the optimization opportunities offered by the smoother operator. It is shown that the smoother operator, on account of its additive nature, can be replicated in parallel exactly with little communication overhead, which offers a major advantage in parallel settings as the geometric multigrid solver is consequently independent of the number of processes. The convergence and scalability of the geometric multigrid method is studied using numerical examples. It is shown that the iteration count of the solver remains bounded independent of the problem size and depth of the grid hierarchy. The solver is shown to obtain excellent weak and strong scaling using numerical benchmarks with more than 665 million degrees of freedom. The presented geometric multigrid solver is, therefore, an attractive option for the solution of large-scale finite cell problems in massively parallel high-performance computing environments.</description>

      <title>Calibration-Based ALE Model Order Reduction for Hyperbolic Problems with Self-Similar Travelling Discontinuities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel Model Order Reduction framework that is able to handle solutions of hyperbolic problems characterized by multiple travelling discontinuities. By means of an optimization based approach, we introduce suitable calibration maps that allow us to transform the original solution manifold into a lower dimensional one. The optimization process does not require the knowledge of the discontinuities location. In the online phase, the coefficients of the projection of the reduced order solution onto the reduced space are recovered by means of an Artificial Neural Network. To validate the methodology, we present numerical results for the 1D Sod shock tube problem and for the 2D double Mach reflection problem, also in the parametric case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new Riemannian gradient descent method for computing spherical area-preserving mappings of topological spheres using a Riemannian retraction-based framework with theoretically guaranteed convergence. The objective function is based on the stretch energy functional, and the minimization is constrained on a power manifold of unit spheres embedded in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Numerical experiments on several mesh models demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the proposed framework. Comparisons with two existing state-of-the-art methods for computing area-preserving mappings demonstrate that our algorithm is both competitive and more efficient. Finally, we present a concrete application to the problem of landmark-aligned surface registration of two brain models.</description>

      <title>An efficient algorithm for the Riemannian logarithm on the Stiefel manifold for a family of Riemannian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the popularization of the Stiefel manifold for numerical applications in 1998 in a seminal paper from Edelman et al., it has been exhibited to be a key to solve many problems from optimization, statistics and machine learning. In 2021, H\"uper et al. proposed a one-parameter family of Riemannian metrics on the Stiefel manifold, subsuming the well-known Euclidean and canonical metrics. Since then, several methods have been proposed to obtain a candidate for the Riemannian logarithm given any metric from the family. Most of these methods are based on the shooting method or rely on optimization approaches. For the canonical metric, Zimmermann proposed in 2017 a particularly efficient method based on a pure matrix-algebraic approach. In this paper, we derive a generalization of this algorithm that works for the one-parameter family of Riemannian metrics. The algorithm is proposed in two versions, termed backward and forward, for which we prove that it conserves the local linear convergence previously exhibited in Zimmermann's algorithm for the canonical metric.</description>

      <title>A path-dependent PDE solver based on signature kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a provably convergent kernel-based solver for path-dependent PDEs (PPDEs). Our numerical scheme leverages signature kernels, a recently introduced class of kernels on path-space. Specifically, we solve an optimal recovery problem by approximating the solution of a PPDE with an element of minimal norm in the signature reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) constrained to satisfy the PPDE at a finite collection of collocation paths. In the linear case, we show that the optimisation has a unique closed-form solution expressed in terms of signature kernel evaluations at the collocation paths. We prove consistency of the proposed scheme, guaranteeing convergence to the PPDE solution as the number of collocation points increases. Finally, several numerical examples are presented, in particular in the context of option pricing under rough volatility. Our numerical scheme constitutes a valid alternative to the ubiquitous Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>Entrywise tensor-train approximation of large tensors via random embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of low-rank tensor-train approximation is well-understood when the approximation error is measured in the Frobenius norm. The entrywise maximum norm is equally important but is significantly weaker for large tensors, making the estimates obtained via the Frobenius norm and norm equivalence pessimistic or even meaningless. In this article, we derive a new, direct estimate of the entrywise approximation error that is applicable in such cases. Our argument is based on random embeddings, the tensor-structured Hanson--Wright inequality, and the core coherences of a tensor. The theoretical results are accompanied with numerical experiments: we compute low-rank tensor-train approximations in the maximum norm for two classes of tensors using the method of alternating projections.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of A Data-Driven Regularized Stochastic Gradient Descent for Nonlinear Ill-Posed Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a promising method for solving large-scale inverse problems, due to its excellent scalability with respect to data size. In this work, we analyze a new data-driven regularized stochastic gradient descent for the efficient numerical solution of a class of nonlinear ill-posed inverse problems in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. At each step of the iteration, the method randomly selects one equation from the nonlinear system combined with a corresponding equation from the learned system based on training data to obtain a stochastic estimate of the gradient and then performs a descent step with the estimated gradient. We prove the regularizing property of this method under the tangential cone condition and a priori parameter choice and then derive the convergence rates under the additional source condition and range invariance conditions. Several numerical experiments are provided to complement the analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-fractional parabolic equations with a Caputo time derivative of order $\alpha\in(0,1)$ are discretized in time using continuous collocation methods. For such discretizations, we give sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of their solutions. Two approaches are explored: the Lax-Milgram Theorem and the eigenfunction expansion. The resulting sufficient conditions, which involve certain $m\times m$ matrices (where $m$ is the order of the collocation scheme), are verified both analytically, for all $m\ge 1$ and all sets of collocation points, and computationally, for all $ m\le 20$. The semilinear case is also addressed.</description>

      <title>Numerical method for nonlinear Kolmogorov PDEs via sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine nonlinear Kolmogorov partial differential equations (PDEs). Here the nonlinear part of the PDE comes from its Hamiltonian where one maximizes over all possible drift and diffusion coefficients which fall within a $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of pre-specified baseline coefficients. Our goal is to quantify and compute how sensitive those PDEs are to such a small nonlinearity, and then use the results to develop an efficient numerical method for their approximation. We show that as $\varepsilon\downarrow 0$, the nonlinear Kolmogorov PDE equals the linear Kolmogorov PDE defined with respect to the corresponding baseline coefficients plus $\varepsilon$ times a correction term which can be also characterized by the solution of another linear Kolmogorov PDE involving the baseline coefficients. As these linear Kolmogorov PDEs can be efficiently solved in high-dimensions by exploiting their Feynman-Kac representation, our derived sensitivity analysis then provides a Monte Carlo based numerical method which can efficiently solve these nonlinear Kolmogorov equations. We provide numerical examples in up to 100 dimensions to empirically demonstrate the applicability of our numerical method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Crouzeix--Raviart finite element method is widely recognized in the field of finite element analysis due to its nonconforming nature. The main goal of this paper is to present a general strategy for enhancing the Crouzeix--Raviart finite element using quadratic polynomial functions and three additional general degrees of freedom. To achieve this, we present a characterization result on the enriched degrees of freedom, enabling to define a new enriched finite element. This general approach is employed to introduce two distinct admissible families of enriched degrees of freedom. Numerical results demonstrate an enhancement in the accuracy of the proposed method when compared to the standard Crouzeix--Raviart finite element, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed enrichment strategy.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the design of an invariant measure-preserving transformed dynamics for the numerical treatment of Langevin dynamics based on rescaling of time, with the goal of sampling from an invariant measure. Given an appropriate monitor function which characterizes the numerical difficulty of the problem as a function of the state of the system, this method allows the stepsizes to be reduced only when necessary, facilitating efficient recovery of long-time behavior. We study both the overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics. We investigate how an appropriate correction term that ensures preservation of the invariant measure should be incorporated into a numerical splitting scheme. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the technique in several model systems, including a Bayesian sampling problem with a steep prior.</description>

      <title>Holographic Phase Retrieval via Wirtinger Flow: Cartesian Form with Auxiliary Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new gradient method for holography, where a phase-only hologram is parameterized by not only the phase but also amplitude. The key idea of our approach is the formulation of a phase-only hologram using an auxiliary amplitude. We optimize the parameters using the so-called Wirtinger flow algorithm in the Cartesian domain, which is a gradient method defined on the basis of the Wirtinger calculus. At the early stage of optimization, each element of the hologram exists inside a complex circle, and it can take a large gradient while diverging from the origin. This characteristic contributes to accelerating the gradient descent. Meanwhile, at the final stage of optimization, each element evolves along a complex circle, similar to previous state-of-the-art gradient methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods, primarily due to the optimization of the amplitude.</description>

      <title>Generative Modelling of Stochastic Rotating Shallow Water Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work, the authors have developed a generic methodology for calibrating the noise in fluid dynamics stochastic partial differential equations where the stochasticity was introduced to parametrize subgrid-scale processes. The stochastic parameterization of sub-grid scale processes is required in the estimation of uncertainty in weather and climate predictions, to represent systematic model errors arising from subgrid-scale fluctuations. The previous methodology used a principal component analysis (PCA) technique based on the ansatz that the increments of the stochastic parametrization are normally distributed.
  In this paper, the PCA technique is replaced by a generative model technique. This enables us to avoid imposing additional constraints on the increments. The methodology is tested on a stochastic rotating shallow water model with the elevation variable of the model used as input data. The numerical simulations show that the noise is indeed non-Gaussian. The generative modelling technology gives good RMSE, CRPS score and forecast rank histogram results.</description>

      <title>Using Uncertainty Quantification to Characterize and Improve Out-of-Domain Learning for PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing work in scientific machine learning (SciML) has shown that data-driven learning of solution operators can provide a fast approximate alternative to classical numerical partial differential equation (PDE) solvers. Of these, Neural Operators (NOs) have emerged as particularly promising. We observe that several uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for NOs fail for test inputs that are even moderately out-of-domain (OOD), even when the model approximates the solution well for in-domain tasks. To address this limitation, we show that ensembling several NOs can identify high-error regions and provide good uncertainty estimates that are well-correlated with prediction errors. Based on this, we propose a cost-effective alternative, DiverseNO, that mimics the properties of the ensemble by encouraging diverse predictions from its multiple heads in the last feed-forward layer. We then introduce Operator-ProbConserv, a method that uses these well-calibrated UQ estimates within the ProbConserv framework to update the model. Our empirical results show that Operator-ProbConserv enhances OOD model performance for a variety of challenging PDE problems and satisfies physical constraints such as conservation laws.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical solvers of partial differential equations (PDEs) have been widely employed for simulating physical systems. However, the computational cost remains a major bottleneck in various scientific and engineering applications, which has motivated the development of reduced-order models (ROMs). Recently, machine-learning-based ROMs have gained significant popularity and are promising for addressing some limitations of traditional ROM methods, especially for advection dominated systems. In this chapter, we focus on a particular framework known as Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI), which transforms the high-fidelity data, governed by a PDE, to simpler and low-dimensional latent-space data, governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These ODEs can be learned and subsequently interpolated to make ROM predictions. Each building block of LaSDI can be easily modulated depending on the application, which makes the LaSDI framework highly flexible. In particular, we present strategies to enforce the laws of thermodynamics into LaSDI models (tLaSDI), enhance robustness in the presence of noise through the weak form (WLaSDI), select high-fidelity training data efficiently through active learning (gLaSDI, GPLaSDI), and quantify the ROM prediction uncertainty through Gaussian processes (GPLaSDI). We demonstrate the performance of different LaSDI approaches on Burgers equation, a non-linear heat conduction problem, and a plasma physics problem, showing that LaSDI algorithms can achieve relative errors of less than a few percent and up to thousands of times speed-ups.</description>

      <title>Computational Seismic Fracture Synthesis of Tidal Barrage using Enhanced Isotropic Plasticity Damage Mechanics and Coupled Lagrangian-Eulerian Multiphase Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mega-engineered hydraulic structures like dams and barrages are critically sensitive to strong ground motion if constructed within the vicinity of triggered fault lines. Collapse post excessive deformation leads to severe environmental impact. In this study, fracture corresponding to the response of a concrete tidal barrage to strong ground motion is analyzed along with behavioral effects due to reservoir-barrage dynamic interaction. An enhanced version of the plasticity damage mechanical model, which includes effects due to degradation of elastic stiffness of concrete as well as restoration of fracture energy losses is assigned as material behavior. The fluid-structure interaction is solved using an idealized Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation. The proposed improvised numerical formulations are validated against benchmark simulations performed on the Koyna dam situated in Maharashtra, India and the results captured are upto 94% accurate. Finite element simulation of a tidal barrage is performed using a computationally stable mesh with global grid to length ratio of 4.2. The yield surface captured is elliptical in nature and fracture is observed to be propagating from bottom of gate housing covering upto four nodal integration points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the problem of optimizing a stellarator subject to hard constraints on the design variables and physics properties of the equilibrium. We survey current numerical methods for handling these constraints, and summarize a number of methods from the wider optimization community that have not been used extensively for stellarator optimization thus far. We demonstrate the utility of new methods of constrained optimization by optimizing a QA stellarator for favorable physics properties while preventing strong shaping of the plasma boundary which can be difficult to create with external current sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Texture Edge detection using Patch consensus (TEP) which is a training-free method to detect the boundary of texture. We propose a new simple way to identify the texture edge location, using the consensus of segmented local patch information. While on the boundary, even using local patch information, the distinction between textures are typically not clear, but using neighbor consensus give a clear idea of the boundary. We utilize local patch, and its response against neighboring regions, to emphasize the similarities and the differences across different textures. The step of segmentation of response further emphasizes the edge location, and the neighborhood voting gives consensus and stabilize the edge detection. We analyze texture as a stationary process to give insight into the patch width parameter verses the quality of edge detection. We derive the necessary condition for textures to be distinguished, and analyze the patch width with respect to the scale of textures. Various experiments are presented to validate the proposed model.</description>

      <title>A component-level co-rotational 3D continuum finite element framework for efficient flexible multibody analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a systematic and novel component level co-rotational (CR) framework, for upgrading existing 3D continuum finite elements to flexible multibody analysis. Without using any model reduction techniques, the high efficiency is achieved through sophisticated operations in both modeling and numerical implementation phrases. In modeling phrase, as in conventional 3D nonlinear finite analysis, the nodal absolute coordinates are used as the system generalized coordinates, therefore simple formulations of the inertia force terms can be obtained. For the elastic force terms, inspired by existing floating frame of reference formulation (FFRF) and conventional element-level CR formulation, a component-level CR modeling strategy is developed. By in combination with Schur complement theory and fully exploring the nature of the component-level CR modeling method, an extremely efficient procedure is developed, which enables us to transform the linear equations raised from each Newton-Raphson iteration step into linear systems with constant coefficient matrix. The coefficient matrix thus can be pre-calculated and decomposed only once, and at all the subsequent time steps only back substitutions are needed, which avoids frequently updating the Jacobian matrix and avoids directly solving the large-scale linearized equation in each iteration. Multiple examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rolling shutter (RS) cameras dominate consumer and smartphone markets. Several methods for computing the absolute pose of RS cameras have appeared in the last 20 years, but the relative pose problem has not been fully solved yet. We provide a unified theory for the important class of order-one rolling shutter (RS$_1$) cameras. These cameras generalize the perspective projection to RS cameras, projecting a generic space point to exactly one image point via a rational map. We introduce a new back-projection RS camera model, characterize RS$_1$ cameras, construct explicit parameterizations of such cameras, and determine the image of a space line. We classify all minimal problems for solving the relative camera pose problem with linear RS$_1$ cameras and discover new practical cases. Finally, we show how the theory can be used to explain RS models previously used for absolute pose computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence rate of various first-order optimization algorithms is a pivotal concern within the numerical optimization community, as it directly reflects the efficiency of these algorithms across different optimization problems. Our goal is making a significant step forward in the formal mathematical representation of optimization techniques using the Lean4 theorem prover. We first formalize the gradient for smooth functions and the subgradient for convex functions on a Hilbert space, laying the groundwork for the accurate formalization of algorithmic structures. Then, we extend our contribution by proving several properties of differentiable convex functions that have not yet been formalized in Mathlib. Finally, a comprehensive formalization of these algorithms is presented. These developments are not only noteworthy on their own but also serve as essential precursors to the formalization of a broader spectrum of numerical algorithms and their applications in machine learning as well as many other areas.</description>

      <title>A Data-driven Approach for Rapid Detection of Aeroelastic Modes from Flutter Flight Test Based on Limited Sensor Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flutter flight test involves the evaluation of the airframes aeroelastic stability by applying artificial excitation on the aircraft lifting surfaces. The subsequent responses are captured and analyzed to extract the frequencies and damping characteristics of the system. However, noise contamination, turbulence, non-optimal excitation of modes, and sensor malfunction in one or more sensors make it time-consuming and corrupt the extraction process. In order to expedite the process of identifying and analyzing aeroelastic modes, this study implements a time-delay embedded Dynamic Mode Decomposition technique. This approach is complemented by Robust Principal Component Analysis methodology, and a sparsity promoting criterion which enables the automatic and optimal selection of sparse modes. The anonymized flutter flight test data, provided by the fifth author of this research paper, is utilized in this implementation. The methodology assumes no knowledge of the input excitation, only deals with the responses captured by accelerometer channels, and rapidly identifies the aeroelastic modes. By incorporating a compressed sensing algorithm, the methodology gains the ability to identify aeroelastic modes, even when the number of available sensors is limited. This augmentation greatly enhances the methodology's robustness and effectiveness, making it an excellent choice for real-time implementation during flutter test campaigns.</description>

      <title>Inverse Coefficient Problem for One-Dimensional Subdiffusion with Data on Disjoint Sets in Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate an inverse coefficient problem for the one-dimensional subdiffusion model, which involves a Caputo fractional derivative in time. The inverse problem is to determine two coefficients and multiple parameters (the order, and length of the interval) from one pair of lateral Cauchy data. The lateral Cauchy data are given on disjoint sets in time with a single excitation and the measurement is made on a time sequence located outside the support of the excitation. We prove two uniqueness results for different lateral Cauchy data. The analysis is based on the solution representation, analyticity of the observation and a refined version of inverse Sturm-Liouville theory due to Sini [35]. Our results heavily exploit the memory effect of fractional diffusion for the unique recovery of the coefficients in the model. Several numerical experiments are also presented to complement the analysis.</description>

      <title>Shadow Hamiltonians of structure-preserving integrators for Nambu mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symplectic integrators are widely implemented numerical integrators for Hamiltonian mechanics, which preserve the Hamiltonian structure (symplecticity) of the system. Although the symplectic integrator does not conserve the energy of the system, it is well known that there exists a conserving modified Hamiltonian, called the shadow Hamiltonian. For the Nambu mechanics, which is one of the generalized Hamiltonian mechanics, we can also construct structure-preserving integrators by the same procedure used to construct the symplectic integrators. In the structure-preserving integrator, however, the existence of shadow Hamiltonians is non-trivial. This is because the Nambu mechanics is driven by multiple Hamiltonians and it is non-trivial whether the time evolution by the integrator can be cast into the Nambu mechanical time evolution driven by multiple shadow Hamiltonians. In the present paper we construct structure-preserving integrators for a simple Nambu mechanical system, and derive the shadow Hamiltonians in two ways. This is the first attempt to derive shadow Hamiltonians of structure-preserving integrators for Nambu mechanics. We show that the fundamental identity, which corresponds to the Jacobi identity in Hamiltonian mechanics, plays an important role to calculate the shadow Hamiltonians using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. It turns out that the resulting shadow Hamiltonians have indefinite forms depending on how the fundamental identities are used. This is not a technical artifact, because the exact shadow Hamiltonians obtained independently have the same indefiniteness.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo on Lie groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicit, momentum-based dynamics for optimizing functions defined on Lie groups was recently constructed, based on techniques such as variational optimization and left trivialization. We appropriately add tractable noise to the optimization dynamics to turn it into a sampling dynamics, leveraging the advantageous feature that the momentum variable is Euclidean despite that the potential function lives on a manifold. We then propose a Lie-group MCMC sampler, by delicately discretizing the resulting kinetic-Langevin-type sampling dynamics. The Lie group structure is exactly preserved by this discretization. Exponential convergence with explicit convergence rate for both the continuous dynamics and the discrete sampler are then proved under W2 distance. Only compactness of the Lie group and geodesically L-smoothness of the potential function are needed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence result for kinetic Langevin on curved spaces, and also the first quantitative result that requires no convexity or, at least not explicitly, any common relaxation such as isoperimetry.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we compare the intrusive proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with Galerkin projection and the data-driven dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), for Heston's option pricing model. The full order model is obtained by discontinuous Galerkin discretization in space and backward Euler in time. Numerical results for butterfly spread, European and digital call options reveal that in general DMD requires more modes than the POD modes for the same level of accuracy. However, the speed-up factors are much higher for DMD than POD due to the non-intrusive nature of the DMD.</description>

Abstract: A unified construction of $H(\textrm{div})$-conforming finite element tensors, including vector div element, symmetric div matrix element, traceless div matrix element, and in general tensors with linear constraints, is developed in this work. It is based on the geometric decomposition of Lagrange elements into bubble functions on each sub-simplex. Then the tensor at each sub-simplex is decomposed into the tangential and the normal component. The tangential component forms the bubble function space and the normal component characterizes the trace. A deep exploration on boundary degrees of freedom is presented for discovering various finite elements. The developed finite element spaces are $H(\textrm{div})$-conforming and satisfy the discrete inf-sup condition. An explicit basis of the constraint tensor space is also established.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Data Modelling by Randomized Orthogonal Decomposition and Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.08659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A digital twin is a surrogate model that has the main feature to mirror the original process behavior. Associating the dynamical process with a digital twin model of reduced complexity has the significant advantage to map the dynamics with high accuracy and reduced costs in CPU time and hardware to timescales over which that suffers significantly changes and so it is difficult to explore. This paper introduces a new framework for creating efficient digital twin models of fluid flows. We introduce a novel algorithm that combines the advantages of Krylov based dynamic mode decomposition with proper orthogonal decomposition and outperforms the selection of the most influential modes. We prove that randomized orthogonal decomposition algorithm provides several advantages over SVD empirical orthogonal decomposition methods and mitigates the projection error formulating a multiobjective optimization problem.We involve the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence Deep Learning (DL) to perform a real-time adaptive calibration of the digital twin model, with increasing fidelity. The output is a high-fidelity DIGITAL TWIN DATA MODEL of the fluid flow dynamics, with the advantage of a reduced complexity. The new modelling tools are investigated in the numerical simulation of three wave phenomena with increasing complexity. We show that the outputs are consistent with the original source data.We perform a thorough assessment of the performance of the new digital twin data models, in terms of numerical accuracy and computational efficiency, including a time simulation response feature study.</description>

      <title>The pressure-wired Stokes element: a mesh-robust version of the Scott-Vogelius element</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Scott-Vogelius finite element pair for the numerical discretization of the stationary Stokes equation in 2D is a popular element which is based on a continuous velocity approximation of polynomial order $k$ and a discontinuous pressure approximation of order $k-1$. It employs a "singular distance" (measured by some geometric mesh quantity $ \Theta \left( \mathbf{z}\right) \geq 0$ for triangle vertices $\mathbf{z}$) and imposes a local side condition on the pressure space associated to vertices $\mathbf{z}$ with $\Theta \left( \mathbf{z}\right) =0$. The method is inf-sup stable for any fixed regular triangulation and $k\geq 4$. However, the inf-sup constant deteriorates if the triangulation contains nearly singular vertices $0&lt;\Theta \left( \mathbf{z}\right) \ll 1$.
  In this paper, we introduce a very simple parameter-dependent modification of the Scott-Vogelius element such that the inf-sup constant is independent of nearly-singular vertices. We will show by analysis and also by numerical experiments that the effect on the divergence-free condition for the discrete velocity is negligibly small.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fourth-order variational inequalities are encountered in various scientific and engineering disciplines, including elliptic optimal control problems and plate obstacle problems. In this paper, we consider additive Schwarz methods for solving fourth-order variational inequalities. Based on a unified framework of various finite element methods for fourth-order variational inequalities, we develop one- and two-level additive Schwarz methods. We prove that the two-level method is scalable in the sense that the convergence rate of the method depends on $H/h$ and $H/\delta$ only, where $h$ and $H$ are the typical diameters of an element and a subdomain, respectively, and $\delta$ measures the overlap among the subdomains. This proof relies on a new nonlinear positivity-preserving coarse interpolation operator, the construction of which was previously unknown. To the best of our knowledge, this analysis represents the first investigation into the scalability of the two-level additive Schwarz method for fourth-order variational inequalities. Our theoretical results are verified by numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: Stability and optimal convergence analysis of a non-uniform implicit-explicit L1 finite element method (IMEX-L1-FEM) is studied for a class of time-fractional linear partial differential/integro-differential equations with non-self-adjoint elliptic part having (space-time) variable coefficients. The proposed scheme is based on a combination of an IMEX-L1 method on graded mesh in the temporal direction and a finite element method in the spatial direction. With the help of a discrete fractional Gr\"{o}nwall inequality, global almost optimal error estimates in $L^2$- and $H^1$-norms are derived for the problem with initial data $u_0 \in H_0^1(\Omega)\cap H^2(\Omega)$. The novelty of our approach is based on managing the interaction of the L1 approximation of the fractional derivative and the time discrete elliptic operator to derive the optimal estimate in $H^1$-norm directly. Furthermore, a super convergence result is established when the elliptic operator is self-adjoint with time and space varying coefficients, and as a consequence, an $L^\infty$ error estimate is obtained for 2D problems that too with the initial condition is in $ H_0^1(\Omega)\cap H^2(\Omega)$. All results proved in this paper are valid uniformly as $\alpha\longrightarrow 1^{-}$, where $\alpha$ is the order of the Caputo fractional derivative. Numerical experiments are presented to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Double-loop quasi-Monte Carlo estimator for nested integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating the expected information gain (EIG) is a critical task in many areas of computational science and statistics, necessitating the approximation of nested integrals. Available techniques for this problem based on quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods have focused on enhancing the efficiency of either the inner or outer integral approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that extends the scope of these efforts to address inner and outer expectations simultaneously. Leveraging the principles of Owen's scrambling of digital nets, we develop a randomized QMC (rQMC) method that improves the convergence behavior of the approximation of nested integrals. We also indicate how to combine this methodology with importance sampling to address a measure concentration arising in the inner integral.
  Our method capitalizes on the unique structure of nested expectations to offer a more efficient approximation mechanism. By incorporating Owen's scrambling techniques, we handle integrands exhibiting infinite variation in the Hardy--Krause sense, paving the way for theoretically sound error estimates. As the main contribution of this work, we derive asymptotic error bounds for the bias and variance of our estimator, along with regularity conditions under which these error bounds can be attained. In addition, we provide nearly optimal sample sizes for the rQMC approximations, which are helpful for the actual numerical implementations.
  Moreover, we verify the quality of our estimator through numerical experiments in the context of EIG estimation. Specifically, we compare the computational efficiency of our rQMC method against standard nested MC integration across two case studies: one in thermo-mechanics and the other in pharmacokinetics. These examples highlight our approach's computational savings and enhanced applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider unconditionally energy stable numerical schemes for the nonstationary 3D magneto-micropolar equations that describes the microstructure of rigid microelements in electrically conducting fluid flow under some magnetic field. The first scheme is comprised of the Euler semi-implicit discretization in time and conforming finite element/stabilizedfinite element in space. The second one is based on Crank-Nicolson discretization in time and extrapolated treatment of the nonlinear terms such that skew-symmetry properties are retained. We prove that the proposed schemes are unconditionally energy stable. Some error estimates for the velocity field, the magnetic field, the micro-rotation field and the fluid pressure are obtained. Furthermore, we establish some first-order decoupled numerical schemes. Numerical tests are provided to check the theoretical rates and unconditionally energy stable.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic preserving kinetic scheme for the M1 model of linear transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moment models with suitable closure can lead to accurate and computationally efficient solvers for particle transport. Hence, we propose a new asymptotic preserving scheme for the M1 model of linear transport that works uniformly for any Knudsen number. Our idea is to apply the M1 closure at the numerical level to an existing asymptotic preserving scheme for the corresponding kinetic equation, namely the Unified Gas Kinetic scheme (UGKS) originally proposed in [27] and extended to linear transport in [24]. In order to ensure the moments realizability in this new scheme, the UGKS positivity needs to be maintained. We propose a new density reconstruction in time to obtain this property. A second order extension is also suggested and validated. Several test cases show the performances of this new scheme.</description>

      <title>Direct parametrisation of invariant manifolds for non-autonomous forced systems including superharmonic resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The direct parametrisation method for invariant manifold is a model-order reduction technique that can be applied to nonlinear systems described by PDEs and discretised e.g. with a finite element procedure in order to derive efficient reduced-order models (ROMs). In nonlinear vibrations, it has already been applied to autonomous and non-autonomous problems to propose ROMs that can compute backbone and frequency-response curves of structures with geometric nonlinearity. While previous developments used a first-order expansion to cope with the non-autonomous term, this assumption is here relaxed by proposing a different treatment. The key idea is to enlarge the dimension of the parametrising coordinates with additional entries related to the forcing. A new algorithm is derived with this starting assumption and, as a key consequence, the resonance relationships appearing through the homological equations involve multiple occurrences of the forcing frequency, showing that with this new development, ROMs for systems exhibiting a superharmonic resonance, can be derived. The method is implemented and validated on academic test cases involving beams and arches. It is numerically demonstrated that the method generates efficient ROMs for problems involving 3:1 and 2:1 superharmonic resonances, as well as converged results for systems where the first-order truncation on the non-autonomous term showed a clear limitation.</description>

      <title>Information geometric regularization of the barotropic Euler equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key numerical difficulty in compressible fluid dynamics is the formation of shock waves. Shock waves feature jump discontinuities in the velocity and density of the fluid and thus preclude the existence of classical solutions to the compressible Euler equations. Weak entropy solutions are commonly defined by viscous regularization, but even small amounts of viscosity can substantially change the long-term behavior of the solution. In this work, we propose the first inviscid regularization of the multidimensional Euler equation based on ideas from semidefinite programming, information geometry, geometric hydrodynamics, and nonlinear elasticity. From a Lagrangian perspective, shock formation in entropy solutions amounts to inelastic collisions of fluid particles. Their trajectories are akin to that of projected gradient descent on a feasible set of non-intersecting paths. We regularize these trajectories by replacing them with solution paths of interior point methods based on log determinantal barrier functions. These paths are geodesic curves with respect to the information geometry induced by the barrier function. Thus, our regularization replaces the Euclidean geometry of trajectories with a suitable information geometry. We extend this idea to infinite families of paths by viewing Euler's equations as a dynamical system on a diffeomorphism manifold. Our regularization embeds this manifold into an information geometric ambient space, equipping it with a geodesically complete geometry. Expressing the resulting Lagrangian equations in Eulerian form, we derive a regularized Euler equation in conservation form. Numerical experiments on one and two-dimensional problems show its promise as a numerical tool. While we focus on the barotropic Euler equations for concreteness and simplicity of exposition, our regularization easily extends to more general Euler and Navier-Stokes-type equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structure-preserving linearly implicit exponential integrators are constructed for Hamiltonian partial differential equations with linear constant damping. Linearly implicit integrators are derived by polarizing the polynomial terms of the Hamiltonian function and portioning out the nonlinearly of consecutive time steps. They require only a solution of one linear system at each time step. Therefore they are computationally more advantageous than implicit integrators. We also construct an exponential version of the well-known one-step Kahan's method by polarizing the quadratic vector field. These integrators are applied to one-dimensional damped Burger's, Korteweg-de-Vries, and nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equations. Preservation of the dissipation rate of linear and quadratic conformal invariants and the Hamiltonian is illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a high-order boundary integral equation (BIE) method for the frequency-domain acoustic scattering of a point source by a singly-periodic, infinite, corrugated boundary. We apply it to the accurate numerical study of acoustic radiation in the neighborhood of a sound-hard two-dimensional staircase modeled after the El Castillo pyramid. Such staircases support trapped waves which travel along the surface and decay exponentially away from it. We use the array scanning method (Floquet--Bloch transform) to recover the scattered field as an integral over the family of quasiperiodic solutions parameterized by their on-surface wavenumber. Each such BIE solution requires the quasiperiodic Green's function, which we evaluate using an efficient integral representation of lattice sum coefficients. We avoid the singularities and branch cuts present in the array scanning integral by complex contour deformation. For each frequency, this enables a solution accurate to around 10 digits in a couple of seconds. We propose a residue method to extract the limiting powers carried by trapped modes far from the source. Finally, by computing the trapped mode dispersion relation, we use a simple ray model to explain an observed acoustic "raindrop" effect (chirp-like time-domain response).</description>

Abstract: The problem of 3-dimensional, convex rigid-body collision over a plane is fully investigated; this includes bodies with sharp corners that is resolved without the need for nonsmooth convex analysis of tangent and normal cones. In particular, using nonsmooth Lagrangian mechanics, the equations of motion and jump equations are derived, which are largely dependent on the collision detection function. Following the variational approach, a Lie group variational collision integrator (LGVCI) is systematically derived that is symplectic, momentum-preserving, and has excellent long-time, near energy conservation. Furthermore, systems with corner impacts are resolved adeptly using $\epsilon$-rounding on the sign distance function (SDF) of the body. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the conservation properties of the LGVCI.</description>

Abstract: Solving inverse problems requires the knowledge of the forward operator, but accurate models can be computationally expensive and hence cheaper variants that do not compromise the reconstruction quality are desired. This chapter reviews reconstruction methods in inverse problems with learned forward operators that follow two different paradigms. The first one is completely agnostic to the forward operator and learns its restriction to the subspace spanned by the training data. The framework of regularisation by projection is then used to find a reconstruction. The second one uses a simplified model of the physics of the measurement process and only relies on the training data to learn a model correction. We present the theory of these two approaches and compare them numerically. A common theme emerges: both methods require, or at least benefit from, training data not only for the forward operator, but also for its adjoint.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on the inverse elastic impedance and the geometry problem by a Cauchy data pair on the access part of the boundary in a two-dimensional case. Through the decomposition of the displacement, the problem is transform the solution of into a coupled boundary value problem that involves two scalar Helmholtz equations. Firstly, a uniqueness result is given, and a non-iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the data completion problem using a Cauchy data pair on a known part of the solution domain's boundary. Next, we introduce a Newton-type iterative method for reconstructing the boundary and the impedance function using the completion data on the unknown boundary, which is governed by a specific type of boundary conditions. Finally, we provide several examples to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we introduce novel stress-only formulations of linear elasticity with special attention to their approximate solution using weighted residual methods. We present four sets of boundary value problems for a pure stress formulation of three-dimensional solids, and in two dimensions for plane stress and plane strain. The associated governing equations are derived by modifications and combinations of the Beltrami-Michell equations and the Navier-Cauchy equations. The corresponding variational forms of dimension $d \in \{2,3\}$ allow to approximate the stress tensor directly, without any presupposed potential stress functions, and are shown to be well-posed in $H^1 \otimes \mathrm{Sym}(d)$ in the framework of functional analysis via the Lax-Milgram theorem, making their finite element implementation using $C^0$-continuous elements straightforward. Further, in the finite element setting we provide a treatment for constant and piece-wise constant body forces via distributions. The operators and differential identities in this work are provided in modern tensor notation and rely on exact sequences, making the resulting equations and differential relations directly comprehensible. Finally, numerical benchmarks for convergence as well as spectral analysis are used to test the limits and identify viable use-cases of the equations.</description>

      <title>Robust Implicit Adaptive Low Rank Time-Stepping Methods for Matrix Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop implicit rank-adaptive schemes for time-dependent matrix differential equations. The dynamic low rank approximation (DLRA) is a well-known technique to capture the dynamic low rank structure based on Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent variational principle. In recent years, it has attracted a lot of attention due to its wide applicability. Our schemes are inspired by the three-step procedure used in the rank adaptive version of the unconventional robust integrator (the so called BUG integrator) for DLRA. First, a prediction (basis update) step is made computing the approximate column and row spaces at the next time level. Second, a Galerkin evolution step is invoked using a base implicit solve for the small core matrix. Finally, a truncation is made according to a prescribed error threshold. Since the DLRA is evolving the differential equation projected on to the tangent space of the low rank manifold, the error estimate of the BUG integrator contains the tangent projection (modeling) error which cannot be easily controlled by mesh refinement. This can cause convergence issue for equations with cross terms.
  To address this issue, we propose a simple modification, consisting of merging the row and column spaces from the explicit step truncation method together with the BUG spaces in the prediction step. In addition, we propose an adaptive strategy where the BUG spaces are only computed if the residual for the solution obtained from the prediction space by explicit step truncation method, is too large. We prove stability and estimate the local truncation error of the schemes under assumptions. We benchmark the schemes in several tests, such as anisotropic diffusion, solid body rotation and the combination of the two, to show robust convergence properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12140v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel optimization procedure for the generation of stability polynomials of stabilized explicit Runge-Kutta methods is devised. Intended for semidiscretizations of hyperbolic partial differential equations, the herein developed approach allows the optimization of stability polynomials with more than hundred stages. A potential application of these high degree stability polynomials are problems with locally varying characteristic speeds as found in non-uniformly refined meshes and different wave speeds.
  To demonstrate the applicability of the stability polynomials we construct 2N storage many-stage Runge-Kutta methods that match their designed second order of accuracy when applied to a range of linear and nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs with smooth solutions. The methods are constructed to reduce the amplification of round off errors which becomes a significant concern for these many-stage methods.</description>

      <title>A Vortex Damping Outflow Forcing for Multiphase Flows with Sharp Interfacial Jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Outflow boundaries play an important role in multiphase fluid dynamics simulations that involve transition between liquid and vapor phases. These flows are dominated by low Weber numbers and a sharp jump in pressure, velocity, and temperature. Inadequate treatment of these jumps at the outlet generates undesirable fluid disturbances that propagate upstream and lead to instabilities within the computational domain. To mitigate these disturbances, we introduce a forcing term that can be applied to incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to enforce stability in the numerical solution. The forcing term acts as a damping mechanism to control vortices that are generated by droplet/bubbles in multiphase flows, and is designed to be a general formulation that can be coupled with a fixed pressure outflow boundary condition to simulate a variety of multiphase flow problems. We demonstrate its applicability to simulate pool and flow boiling problems, where bubble-induced vortices during evaporation and condensation present a challenge at the outflow. Validation and verification cases are chosen to quantify accuracy and stability of the proposed method in comparison to established benchmarks and reference solutions, along with detailed performance analysis for three-dimensional simulations on leadership supercomputing platforms. Computational experiments are performed using Flash-X, which is a composable open-source software instrument designed for multiscale fluid dynamics simulations on heterogeneous architectures.</description>

Abstract: The elastic energy of a bending-resistant interface depends both on its geometry and its material composition. We consider such a heterogeneous interface in the plane, modeled by a curve equipped with an additional density function. The resulting energy captures the complex interplay between curvature and density effects, resembling the Canham-Helfrich functional. We describe the curve by its inclination angle, so that the equilibrium equations reduce to an elliptic system of second order. After a brief variational discussion, we investigate the associated nonlocal $L^2$-gradient flow evolution, a coupled quasilinear parabolic problem. We analyze the (non)preservation of quantities such as convexity, positivity, and symmetry, as well as the asymptotic behavior of the system. The results are illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Deep Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with Beta Divergences</title>

Abstract: Deep Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (deep NMF) has recently emerged as a valuable technique for extracting multiple layers of features across different scales. However, all existing deep NMF models and algorithms have primarily centered their evaluation on the least squares error, which may not be the most appropriate metric for assessing the quality of approximations on diverse datasets. For instance, when dealing with data types such as audio signals and documents, it is widely acknowledged that $\beta$-divergences offer a more suitable alternative. In this paper, we develop new models and algorithms for deep NMF using some $\beta$-divergences, with a focus on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Subsequently, we apply these techniques to the extraction of facial features, the identification of topics within document collections, and the identification of materials within hyperspectral images.</description>

      <title>Deep Regularized Compound Gaussian Network for Solving Linear Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating prior information into inverse problems, e.g. via maximum-a-posteriori estimation, is an important technique for facilitating robust inverse problem solutions. In this paper, we devise two novel approaches for linear inverse problems that permit problem-specific statistical prior selections within the compound Gaussian (CG) class of distributions. The CG class subsumes many commonly used priors in signal and image reconstruction methods including those of sparsity-based approaches. The first method developed is an iterative algorithm, called generalized compound Gaussian least squares (G-CG-LS), that minimizes a regularized least squares objective function where the regularization enforces a CG prior. G-CG-LS is then unrolled, or unfolded, to furnish our second method, which is a novel deep regularized (DR) neural network, called DR-CG-Net, that learns the prior information. A detailed computational theory on convergence properties of G-CG-LS and thorough numerical experiments for DR-CG-Net are provided. Due to the comprehensive nature of the CG prior, these experiments show that DR-CG-Net outperforms competitive prior art methods in tomographic imaging and compressive sensing, especially in challenging low-training scenarios.</description>

      <title>A low-rank augmented Lagrangian method for large-scale semidefinite programming based on a hybrid convex-nonconvex approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces HALLaR, a new first-order method for solving large-scale semidefinite programs (SDPs) with bounded domain. HALLaR is an inexact augmented Lagrangian (AL) method where the AL subproblems are solved by a novel hybrid low-rank (HLR) method. The recipe behind HLR is based on two key ingredients: 1) an adaptive inexact proximal point method with inner acceleration; 2) Frank-Wolfe steps to escape from spurious local stationary points. In contrast to the low-rank method of Burer and Monteiro, HALLaR finds a near-optimal solution (with provable complexity bounds) of SDP instances satisfying strong duality. Computational results comparing HALLaR to state-of-the-art solvers on several large SDP instances arising from maximum stable set, phase retrieval, and matrix completion show that the former finds higher accurate solutions in substantially less CPU time than the latter ones. For example, in less than 20 minutes, HALLaR can solve a maximum stable set SDP instance with dimension pair $(n,m)\approx (10^6,10^7)$ within $10^{-5}$ relative precision.</description>

      <title>Graph-Informed Neural Networks for Sparse Grid-Based Discontinuity Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting the discontinuity interfaces of a discontinuous function. This approach leverages Graph-Informed Neural Networks (GINNs) and sparse grids to address discontinuity detection also in domains of dimension larger than 3. GINNs, trained to identify troubled points on sparse grids, exploit graph structures built on the grids to achieve efficient and accurate discontinuity detection performances. We also introduce a recursive algorithm for general sparse grid-based detectors, characterized by convergence properties and easy applicability. Numerical experiments on functions with dimensions n = 2 and n = 4 demonstrate the efficiency and robust generalization of GINNs in detecting discontinuity interfaces. Notably, the trained GINNs offer portability and versatility, allowing integration into various algorithms and sharing among users.</description>

      <title>Learning solution operators of PDEs defined on varying domains via MIONet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a method to learn the solution operators of PDEs defined on varying domains via MIONet, and theoretically justify this method. We first extend the approximation theory of MIONet to further deal with metric spaces, establishing that MIONet can approximate mappings with multiple inputs in metric spaces. Subsequently, we construct a set consisting of some appropriate regions and provide a metric on this set thus make it a metric space, which satisfies the approximation condition of MIONet. Building upon the theoretical foundation, we are able to learn the solution mapping of a PDE with all the parameters varying, including the parameters of the differential operator, the right-hand side term, the boundary condition, as well as the domain. Without loss of generality, we for example perform the experiments for 2-d Poisson equations, where the domains and the right-hand side terms are varying. The results provide insights into the performance of this method across convex polygons, polar regions with smooth boundary, and predictions for different levels of discretization on one task. We also show the additional result of the fully-parameterized case in the appendix for interested readers. Reasonably, we point out that this is a meshless method, hence can be flexibly used as a general solver for a type of PDE.</description>
