      <title>Evolution and sudden change of steady interactions of low enthalpy hypersonic double wedge flows with fore angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution and sudden change of steady interaction structures is numerically studied with the fore wedge angle theta_1 in a low enthalpy hypersonic double wedge configuration. It particularly focuses on the conditions of Swantek and Austin's experiments where Ma=7, and h_0=2 MJ/kg but with a reduced Reynolds number (Re). The sudden structural change indicates that when theta_1 reaches a critical value, minor angular variations can trigger a discontinuous transformation in flow structures. The analysis is based on the laminar Navier-Stokes equations, using ideal gas and non-equilibrium gas models. Under the condition of Re=1E5/m, detailed numerical simulations are conducted as theta_1 varies over 0 deg-40 deg. This study yields the following findings: (a) The upper and lower boundaries of theta_1 for the onset of unsteady flow are identified. When theta_1 lies outside these boundaries, the flow remains steady. (b) As theta_1 increases, the interaction patterns evolve sequentially, progressing from Type VI through Type VI-&gt;V, Type III, Type IV_r, and ultimately to a flow dominated solely by a bow shock. This evolution defines the boundaries between different interaction patterns and provides a comprehensive understanding of their progression with theta_1. Sudden structural changes occur during the transitions from Type III to Type IV_r and from Type IV_r to a bow shock-dominated flow. In addition, a comparative study is performed through shock polar analysis to compare its predictions with computational results. (c) An unconventional reflection pattern of the transmitted shock over the separation zone, called Type III_r, is observed in non-equilibrium gas flows, which differs from classical interaction patterns. (d) The aerodynamic distribution of wall properties under various interactions is obtained, indicating distinct features before and after the sudden structural change.</description>

      <title>Model-based time super-sampling of turbulent flow field sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for model-based time super-sampling of turbulent flow fields. The key enabler is the identification of an empirical Galerkin model from the projection of the Navier-Stokes equations on a data-tailored basis. The basis is obtained from a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) of the measured fields. Time super-sampling is thus achieved by a time-marching integration of the identified dynamical system, taking the original snapshots as initial conditions. Temporal continuity of the reconstructed velocity fields is achieved through a forward-backwards integration between consecutive measured Particle Image Velocimetry measurements of a turbulent jet flow. The results are compared with the interpolation of the POD temporal coefficients and the low-order reconstruction of data measured at a higher sampling rate. In both cases, the results obtained show the ability of the method to reconstruct the dynamics of the flow with small errors during several flow characteristic times.</description>

      <title>An Insight into Parameter Identifiability Issues in the Carreau-Yasuda Model: a Novel Rheological Formulation for Shear-thinning non-Newtonian Inelastic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Carreau-Yasuda rheological model is widely employed in both research and industrial applications to describe the shear-thinning behaviour of non-Newtonian inelastic fluids. However, its calibration against experimental data is often affected by intrinsic identifiability issues, which can lead to misleading physical interpretations of model parameters and unreliable flow predictions. In this paper, starting from the analysis of the identifiability challenges associated with the Carreau-Yasuda model, a novel rheological formulation for shear-thinning non-Newtonian inelastic fluids is proposed. Analytical results and exemplary numerical case studies demonstrate that the proposed formulation is based on physically meaningful model parameters, whose identifiability is not compromised by the key limitations of the Carreau-Yasuda model. Moreover, the new approach allows for effective parameter estimation through a straightforward direct identification strategy, eliminating the need for inverse calibration procedures based on optimization techniques.</description>

      <title>High-level, high-resolution ocean modeling at all scales with Oceananigans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the vision, user interface, governing equations, and numerical methods that underpin new ocean modeling software called ``Oceananigans''. Oceananigans is being developed by the Climate Modeling Alliance as part of a larger project to build a trainable climate model with quantifiable uncertainty. We argue that Oceananigans status as a popular, capable modeling system realizes a vision for accelerating progress in Earth system modeling that balances demands for model accuracy and performance, needed for state-of-the-art science, against accessibility, which is needed to accelerate development. This vision combines three cooperative elements: (i) a relatively simple finite volume algorithm (ii) optimized for high-resolution simulations on GPUs which is (iii) exposed behind an expressive, high-level user interface (using the Julia programming language in our case). We offer evidence for the vision's potential by illustrating the creative potential of our user interface, showcasing Oceananigans physics with example simulations that range from simple classroom problems to a realistic global ocean simulation spanning all scales of oceanic fluid motion, and describing advances in parameterization, numerical methods, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Porous Microstructures: Automatic Design, Simulation, and Permeability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces an open-source computational framework for the generation and permeability evaluation of synthetic porous media. The proposed methodology integrates crystallographic and meshing tools to construct controlled microstructures with tunable porosity, facilitating seamless transitions from geometric modelling to computational domains for numerical simulations. The generated structures are analysed through fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations, leveraging the Entropically Damped Artificial Compressibility (EDAC) formulation in conjunction with the Discretization-Corrected Particle Strength Exchange (DC-PSE) method.
  A novel approach for the numerical estimation of the macroscopic permeability tensor is presented, employing a stochastic upscaling technique inspired by the volume averaging method. To validate the framework, we investigate the transition between creeping and non-Darcy flow regimes through parametric permeability studies, utilizing a one-dimensional approach for practical benchmarking.
  The results establish a foundation for experimental validation and provide insights into the customised design of porous structures for engineering and biomedical applications, offering a versatile tool for research in fluid transport and porous media mechanics.</description>

      <title>A data-driven approach for modeling large-amplitude flow-induced oscillations of elastically mounted pitching wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and validate a data-driven approach for modeling large-amplitude flow-induced oscillations of elastically mounted pitching wings. We first train a neural networks regression model for the nonlinear aerodynamic moment using data obtained from experimental measurements during prescribed pitching oscillations and at fixed angles of attack. We then embed this model into an ordinary differential equation solver to solve the governing equation of the passive aeroelastic system with desired structural parameters. The system dynamics predicted by the proposed data-driven approach are characterized and compared with those obtained from physical experiments. The predicted and experimental pitching amplitude, frequency and aerodynamic moment responses are found to be in excellent agreement. Both the inertia-dominated mode and the hydrodynamic-dominated mode are successfully predicted. The transient growth and saturation of the pitching oscillation amplitude and the aerodynamic moment are also faithfully captured by the proposed approach. Additional test cases demonstrate the broad applicability and good scalability potential of this approach.</description>

      <title>Expressing turbulent kinetic energy as coarse-grained enstrophy or strain deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08672v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In turbulent flows, the fluid element gets deformed by chaotic motion due to the formation of sharp velocity gradients. A direct connection between the element of fluid stresses and the energy balance still remains elusive. Here, an exact identity of incompressible turbulence is derived linking the velocity gradient norm across the scales with the total kinetic energy. In the context of three-dimensional (3D) homogeneous turbulence, this relation can be specialised obtaining the expression of total kinetic energy decomposed either in terms of deformations due to strain motion or via the resolved-scale enstrophy of the fluid element. Applied to data from direct numerical simulations (DNS) describing homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, the decomposition reveals that, beyond the scales dominated by the external forcing, contractile and extensional deformations account approximately for 55% and 40% of the kinetic energy of the associated scale while less than the remaining 5% is carried by the indefinite-type stresses. From these two identities one can derive an exact expression for the kinetic energy spectrum which is based solely on real space quantities providing a characterisation of the Kolomogorov constant as well. Numerical evidences show that this formulation of the energy spectrum reproduces the power-law behaviour of the Kolmogorov spectral scaling.</description>

      <title>Near-inertial echoes of ageostrophic instability in submesoscale filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ocean submesoscales, flows with characteristic size around 10 m - 10 km, are transitional between the larger, rotationally-constrained mesoscale and three-dimensional turbulence. In this paper we present simulations of a submesoscale ocean filament. In our case, the filament is strongly sheared in both vertical and cross-filament directions and is unstable. Instability indeed dominates the early behaviour with a fast extraction of kinetic energy from the vertically sheared thermal wind. The filament is expected to be subject to instabilities, including symmetric and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. However, the instability that emerges does not exhibit characteristics that match either, and appears to be non-normal in nature. The action of the instability is sufficiently rapid - with energy extraction from the mean flow emerging and peaking within the first inertial period (~ 18 hr) - that the filament does not respond in a geostrophically balanced sense. Instead, it later exhibits vertically sheared near-inertial oscillations with higher amplitude as the initial minimum Richardson number decreases and at all initial noise levels. Horizontal gradients strengthen only briefly as the fronts restratify. These unstable filaments can be generated by strong mixing events at pre-existing stable structures; we also caution against inadvertently triggering this response in idealised studies that start in a very unstable state.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic hydrodynamic model for spreading, sliding and coarsening compound drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the mesoscopic hydrodynamic description of the dynamics of sessile partially wetting compound drops, i.e., of drops that consist of two immiscible nonvolatile partially wetting liquids and are situated on a smooth rigid solid substrate. We briefly discuss and complete existing dynamic models employing a gradient dynamics approach. Thereby, the underlying energy features capillarity and wettability contributions for all relevant interfaces in full-curvature formulation. Establishing transparent consistency relations between macroscopic and mesoscopic parameters, we obtain mesoscopic Neumann and Young laws that are also fully consistent with the macroscopic ones. In particular, we discuss the minimal requirements for the wetting energy that ensure the full spectrum of macroscopic parameters {for partially wetting cases} is addressed by the mesoscopic model. Subsequently, we distinguish long-wave and full-curvature variants of the dynamical model based on properties of the energy, and employ the latter to illustrate the usage of the mesoscopic model. As examples, we chose the spreading of individual compound drops on one-dimensional horizontal substrates, sliding compound drops on one-dimensional inclined substrates, and the coarsening of drop ensembles on one- and two-dimensional horizontal substrates. In each case, the discussion emphasizes occurring qualitative changes in the drop configurations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Velocity Sharp-Interface Continuum Thermodynamics of Fluid Systems with Adsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the sharp-interface continuum thermodynamics of two-phase multicomponent fluid systems, accounting for partial mass and partial momentum balances both in the bulk phases and on the interface. This allows to describe the transfer of species between the individual bulk phases and the interface, i.e. ad- and desorption processes. In fact, the transfer of any constituent between the two bulk-phases is considered as a series of ad- and desorption processes. In this framework, all species transfer processes are coupled via the interfacial thermodynamics. As a consequence, the influence of surface active species on the transfer of other constituents can be captured in detail. The derivation of this model class relies on an axiomatic form of the entropy principle which, at the same time, allows for an efficient closure process. This form of the entropy principle has been introduced for one-phase fluid systems in (Bothe, Dreyer, Acta Mechanica 226, 2015) as the result of intense joint work of the late Wolfgang Dreyer and the present author.</description>

      <title>Compact quantum algorithms for time-dependent differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many claims of computational advantages have been made for quantum computing over classical, but they have not been demonstrated for practical problems. Here, we present algorithms for solving time-dependent PDEs, with particular reference to fluid equations. We build on an idea based on linear combination of unitaries to simulate non-unitary, non-Hermitian quantum systems, and generate hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that efficiently perform iterative matrix-vector multiplication and matrix inversion operations. These algorithms are end-to-end, with relatively low-depth quantum circuits that demonstrate quantum advantage, with the best-case asymptotic complexities, which we show are near-optimal. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithms by conducting: (a) fully gate level, state-vector simulations using an in-house, high performance, quantum simulator called QFlowS; (b) experiments on a real quantum device; and (c) noisy simulations using Qiskit Aer. We also provide device specifications such as error-rates (noise) and state sampling (measurement) to accurately perform convergent flow simulations on noisy devices. The results offer evidence that the proposed algorithm is amenable for use on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>A domain decomposition-based autoregressive deep learning model for unsteady and nonlinear partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a domain-decomposition-based deep learning (DL) framework, named transient-CoMLSim, for accurately modeling unsteady and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The framework consists of two key components: (a) a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based autoencoder architecture and (b) an autoregressive model composed of fully connected layers. Unlike existing state-of-the-art methods that operate on the entire computational domain, our CNN-based autoencoder computes a lower-dimensional basis for solution and condition fields represented on subdomains. Timestepping is performed entirely in the latent space, generating embeddings of the solution variables from the time history of embeddings of solution and condition variables. This approach not only reduces computational complexity but also enhances scalability, making it well-suited for large-scale simulations. Furthermore, to improve the stability of our rollouts, we employ a curriculum learning (CL) approach during the training of the autoregressive model. The domain-decomposition strategy enables scaling to out-of-distribution domain sizes while maintaining the accuracy of predictions -- a feature not easily integrated into popular DL-based approaches for physics simulations. We benchmark our model against two widely-used DL architectures, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and U-Net, and demonstrate that our framework outperforms them in terms of accuracy, extrapolation to unseen timesteps, and stability for a wide range of use cases.</description>

      <title>Dewetting Fingering Instability in Capillary Suspensions: Role of Particles and Liquid Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the fingering instability that forms during stretching of capillary suspensions with and without added nanoparticles. The dewetting process is observed using a transparent lifted Hele-Shaw cell. The liquid bridge is stretched under constant acceleration, and the resulting instability patterns are recorded using two high-speed cameras. Finger-like structures, characteristic of the Saffman-Taylor instability are observed. The total length of the dendrites and the intersecting number of branches are quantified. We reveal the roles of microparticles, nanoparticles, and the secondary liquid during the fingering instability. The addition of microparticles to pure liquid enhanced finger length due to increased particle interactions and nucleation sites for bubbles. The addition of secondary fluid reduces fingering length by forming a strong interparticle network. Incorporation of nanoparticles induces an early onset of cavitation and enhances fingering instability. However, nanoparticles make the capillary suspensions' overall microstructure more homogeneous, reduce the sample variation in fingering patterns, and promote the even distribution of gel on both slides during splitting. These findings highlight the complex interactions governing dewetting in capillary (nano)suspensions. This knowledge has potential applications in microfluidics, 3D printing, and thin-film coatings, where controlling dewetting is crucial.</description>
