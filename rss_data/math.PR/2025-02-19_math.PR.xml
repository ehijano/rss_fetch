      <title>Limit theorems for squared increment sums of the maximum of two isotropic fractional Brownian fields over a fixed-domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pointwise maximum of two independent and identically distributed isotropic fractional Brownian fields (with Hurst parameter $H&lt;1/2$) is observed in a family of points in the unit square $\mathbf{C}=(-1/2,1/2]^{2}$. We assume that these points come from the realization of a homogeneous Poisson point process with intensity $N$. We consider normalized increments (resp. pairs of increments) along the edges of the Delaunay triangulation generated by the Poisson point process (resp. pairs of edges within triangles). We investigate the asymptotic behaviors of the squared increment sums as $N\rightarrow \infty $. We show that the normalizations differ from the case of a unique isotropic fractional Brownian field as obtained in \cite{Chenavier&amp;Robert25a} and that the sums converge to the local time of the difference of the two isotropic fractional Brownian fields up to constant factors.</description>

      <title>Dynamic generalizations of the Asymmetric Inclusion Process, Asymmetric Brownian Energy Process and their Dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two new interacting particle systems are introduced in this paper: dynamic versions of the asymmetric inclusion process (ASIP) and the asymmetric Brownian energy process (ABEP). Dualities and reversibility of these processes are proven, where the quantum algebra $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ and the Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials play a crucial role. Two hierarchies of duality functions are found, where the Askey-Wilson polynomials and Jacobi polynomials sit on top.</description>

      <title>Approximation theorems for stochastic integrals and stochastic differential equations concerning weak solutions with the spatial variable involved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Watanabe's textbook, a classical approximation result indicates that if a solution exists to a stochastic differential equation, then by an approximation of the Wiener process, a sequence of deterministic equations with their corresponding solutions converges to the solution of the stochastic differential equation in probability. In the traditional approximation theorem of a stochastic differential equation, solutions of the sequence of approximating deterministic equations do not contain the spatial variable, but merely indexed by the time parameter. When consider the solution to each deterministic approximating equation a weak solution with the spatial variable involved, we may not be able to directly apply this classical approximation result. In this work, we extend the existing approximation result from Watanabe's textbook to the case when solutions to approximating deterministic equations are weak ones containing the spatial variable. We show that the sequence of these weak solutions converges to the solution of the stochastic differential equation in probability.</description>

      <title>Moderate deviations in first-passage percolation for bounded weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the moderate and large deviations in first-passage percolation (FPP) with bounded weights on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d \geq 2$. Write $T(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$ for the first-passage time and denote by $\mu(\mathbf{u})$ the time constant in direction $\mathbf{u}$. In this paper, we establish that, if one assumes that the sublinear error term $T(\mathbf{0}, N\mathbf{u}) - N\mu(\mathbf{u})$ is of order $N^\chi$, then under some unverified (but widely believed) assumptions, for $\chi &lt; a &lt; 1$, \begin{align*}
  &amp;\mathbb{P}\bigl(T(\mathbf{0}, N\mathbf{u}) &gt; N\mu(\mathbf{u}) + N^a\bigr) = \exp{\Big(-\,N^{\frac{d(1+o(1))}{1-\chi}(a-\chi)}\Big)},
  &amp;\mathbb{P}\bigl(T(\mathbf{0}, N\mathbf{u}) &lt; N\mu(\mathbf{u}) - N^a\bigr) = \exp{\Big(-\,N^{\frac{1+o(1)}{1-\chi}(a-\chi)}\Big)}, \end{align*} with accompanying estimates in the borderline case $a=1$. Moreover, the exponents $\frac{d}{1-\chi}$ and $\frac{1}{1-\chi}$ also appear in the asymptotic behavior near $0$ of the rate functions for upper and lower tail large deviations. Notably, some of our estimates are established rigorously without relying on any unverified assumptions. Our main results highlight the interplay between fluctuations and the decay rates of large deviations, and bridge the gap between these two regimes.
  A key ingredient of our proof is an improved concentration via multi-scale analysis for several moderate deviation estimates, a phenomenon that has previously appeared in the contexts of two-dimensional last-passage percolation and two-dimensional rotationally invariant FPP.</description>

      <title>The diffusion approximation of the Multiclass Processor Sharing queue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a multiclass GI/GI/1 processor sharing queue with feedback. Upon service completion, jobs may either exit the system or re-enter as a different class according to a probabilistic, Jackson-like routing mechanism. Under heavy-traffic conditions, we establish a diffusion approximation for a measure-valued process tracking the residual service times of jobs.</description>

      <title>The gene's eye-view of quantitative genetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling the evolution of a continuous trait in a biological population is one of the oldest problems in evolutionary biology, which led to the birth of quantitative genetics. With the recent development of GWAS methods, it has become essential to link the evolution of the trait distribution to the underlying evolution of allelic frequencies at many loci, co-contributing to the trait value. The way most articles go about this is to make assumptions on the trait distribution, and use Wright's formula to model how the evolution of the trait translates on each individual locus. Here, we take a gene's eye-view of the system, starting from an explicit finite-loci model with selection, drift, recombination and mutation, in which the trait value is a direct product of the genome. We let the number of loci go to infinity under the assumption of strong recombination, and characterize the limit behavior of a given locus with a McKean-Vlasov SDE and the corresponding Fokker-Planck IPDE. In words, the selection on a typical locus depends on the mean behaviour of the other loci which can be approximated with the law of the focal locus. Results include the independence of two loci and explicit stationary distribution for allelic frequencies at a given locus (under some hypotheses on the fitness function). We recover Wright's formula and the breeder's equation as special cases.</description>

      <title>Separation of time scales in weakly interacting diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study metastable behaviour in systems of weakly interacting Brownian particles with localised, attractive potentials which are smooth and globally bounded. In this particular setting, numerical evidence suggests that the particles converge on a short time scale to a "droplet state" which is $metastable$, i.e. persists on a much longer time scale than the time scale of convergence, before eventually diffusing to $0$.
  In this article, we provide rigorous evidence and a quantitative characterisation of this separation of time scales. Working at the level of the empirical measure, we show that (after quotienting out the motion of the centre of mass) the rate of convergence to the quasi-stationary distribution, which corresponds with the droplet state, is $O(1)$ as the inverse temperature $\beta \to \infty$. Meanwhile the rate of leakage away from its centre of mass is $O(e^{-\beta})$. Futhermore, the quasi-stationary distribution is localised on a length scale of order $O(\beta^{-\frac12})$. We thus provide a partial answer to a question posed by Carrillo, Craig, and Yao (Aggregation-Diffusion Equations: Dynamics, Asymptotics, and Singular Limits. In: Active Particles, Volume 2, 2019) in the microscopic setting.</description>

      <title>The snake in the Brownian sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Brownian sphere is a random metric space, homeomorphic to the two-dimensional sphere, which arises as the universal scaling limit of many types of random planar maps. The direct construction of the Brownian sphere is via a continuous analogue of the Cori--Vauquelin--Schaeffer (CVS) bijection. The CVS bijection maps labeled trees to planar maps, and the continuous version maps Aldous' continuum random tree with Brownian labels (the Brownian snake) to the Brownian sphere. In this work, we describe the inverse of the continuous CVS bijection, by constructing the Brownian snake as a measurable function of the Brownian sphere. Special care is needed to work with the orientation of the Brownian sphere.</description>

      <title>Discrete $N$-particle systems at high temperature through Jack generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers for random discrete $N$-particle systems with the deformation (inverse temperature) parameter $\theta$, as their size $N$ tends to infinity simultaneously with the inverse temperature going to zero. Our conditions are expressed in terms of the Jack generating functions, and our analysis is based on the asymptotics of the action of Cherednik operators obtained via Hecke relations. We apply the general framework to obtain the LLN for a large class of Markov chains of $N$ nonintersecting particles with interaction of log-gas type, and the LLN for the multiplication of Jack polynomials, as the inverse temperature tends to zero. We express the answer in terms of novel one-parameter deformations of cumulants and their description provided by us recovers previous work by Bufetov--Gorin on quantized free cumulants when $\theta=1$, and by Benaych-Georges--Cuenca--Gorin after a deformation to continuous space of random matrix eigenvalues. Our methods are robust enough to be applied to the fixed temperature regime, where we recover the LLN of Huang.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference from time series of allele frequency data using exact simulation techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central statistical problem in population genetics is to infer evolutionary and biological parameters such as the strength of natural selection and allele age from DNA samples extracted from a contemporary population. That all samples come only from the present-day has long been known to limit statistical inference; there is potentially more information available if one also has access to ancient DNA so that inference is based on a time-series of historical changes in allele frequencies. We introduce a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for Bayesian inference from allele frequency time-series data based on an underlying Wright--Fisher diffusion model of evolution, through which one can infer the parameters of essentially any selection model including those with frequency-dependent effects. The chief novelty is that we show this method to be exact in the sense that it is possible to augment the state space explored by MCMC with the unobserved diffusion trajectory, even though the transition function of this diffusion is intractable. Through careful design of a proposal distribution, we describe an efficient method in which updates to the trajectory and accept/reject decisions are calculated without error. We illustrate the method on data capturing changes in coat colour over the past 20,000 years, and find evidence to support previous findings that the mutant alleles ASIP and MC1R responsible for changes in coat color have experienced very strong, possibly overdominant, selection and further provide estimates for the ages of these genes.</description>

      <title>On the peak height distribution of non-stationary Gaussian random fields: 1D general covariance and scale space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the peak height distribution of certain non-stationary Gaussian random fields. The explicit peak height distribution of smooth, non-stationary Gaussian processes in 1D with general covariance is derived. The formula is determined by two parameters, each of which has a clear statistical meaning. For multidimensional non-stationary Gaussian random fields, we generalize these results to the setting of scale space fields, which play an important role in peak detection by helping to handle peaks of different spatial extents. We demonstrate that these properties not only offer a better interpretation of the scale space field but also simplify the computation of the peak height distribution. Finally, two efficient numerical algorithms are proposed as a general solution for computing the peak height distribution of smooth multidimensional Gaussian random fields in applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12774v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the pricing and hedging of counterparty credit risk and funding when there is no possibility to hedge the jump to default of either the bank or the counterparty. This represents the situation which is most often encountered in practice, due to the absence of quoted corporate bonds or CDS contracts written on the counterparty and the difficulty for the bank to buy/sell protection on her own default. We apply local risk-minimization to find the optimal strategy and compute it via a BSDE.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a household-scale model for the invasion of Wolbachia into a resident mosquito population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In areas infested with Aedes aegypti mosquitoes it may be possible to control dengue, and some other vector-borne diseases, by introducing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes into the wildtype population. Thus far, empirical and theoretical studies of Wolbachia release have tended to focus on the dynamics at the community scale. However, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes typically dwell in and around the same houses as the people they bite and it can be insightful to explore what happens at the household scale where small population sizes lead to inherently stochastic dynamics. Here we use a continuous-time Markov framework to develop a stochastic household model for small populations of wildtype and Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. We investigate the transient and long term dynamics of the system, in particular examining the impact of stochasticity on the Wolbachia invasion threshold and bistability between the wildtype-only and Wolbachia-only steady states previously observed in deterministic models. We focus on the influence of key parameters which determine the fitness cost of Wolbachia infection and the probability of Wolbachia vertical transmission. Using Markov and matrix population theory, we derive salient characteristics of the system including the probability of successful Wolbachia invasion, the expected time until invasion and the probability that a Wolbachia-infected population reverts to a wildtype population. These attributes can inform strategies for the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. In addition, we find that releasing the minimum number of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes required to displace a resident wildtype population according to the deterministic model, only results in that outcome about 20% of the time in the stochastic model; a significantly larger release is required to reach a steady state composed entirely of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes 90% of the time.</description>

      <title>Tensor cross interpolation for global discrete optimization with application to Bayesian network inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global discrete optimization is notoriously difficult due to the lack of gradient information and the curse of dimensionality, making exhaustive search infeasible. Tensor cross approximation is an efficient technique to approximate multivariate tensors (and discretized functions) by tensor product decompositions based on a small number of tensor elements, evaluated on adaptively selected fibers of the tensor, that intersect on submatrices of (nearly) maximum volume. The submatrices of maximum volume are empirically known to contain large elements, hence the entries selected for cross interpolation can also be good candidates for the globally maximal element within the tensor. In this paper we consider evolution of epidemics on networks, and infer the contact network from observations of network nodal states over time. By numerical experiments we demonstrate that the contact network can be inferred accurately by finding the global maximum of the likelihood using tensor cross interpolation. The proposed tensor product approach is flexible and can be applied to global discrete optimization for other problems, e.g. discrete hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>A measure-valued HJB perspective on Bayesian optimal adaptive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Bayesian adaptive optimal stochastic control problem where a hidden static signal has a non-separable influence on the drift of a noisy observation. Being allowed to control the specific form of this dependence, we aim at optimising a cost functional depending on the posterior distribution of the hidden signal. Expressing the dynamics of this posterior distribution in the observation filtration, we embed our problem into a genuinely infinite-dimensional stochastic control problem featuring so-called measure-valued martingales. We address this problem by use of viscosity theory and approximation arguments. Specifically, we show equivalence to a corresponding weak formulation, characterise the optimal value of the problem in terms of the unique continuous viscosity solution of an associated HJB equation, and construct a piecewise constant and arbitrarily-close-to-optimal control to our main problem of study.</description>

      <title>A random matrix model towards the quantum chaos transition conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider $D$ random systems that are modeled by independent $N\times N$ complex Hermitian Wigner matrices. Suppose they are lying on a circle and the neighboring systems interact with each other through a deterministic matrix $A$. We prove that in the asymptotic limit $N\to \infty$, the whole system exhibits a quantum chaos transition when the interaction strength $\|A\|_{HS}$ varies. Specifically, when $\|A\|_{HS}\ge N^{\varepsilon}$, we prove that the bulk eigenvalue statistics match those of a $DN\times DN$ GUE asymptotically and each bulk eigenvector is approximately equally distributed among the $D$ subsystems with probability $1-o(1)$. These phenomena indicate quantum chaos of the whole system. In contrast, when $\|A\|_{HS}\le N^{-\varepsilon}$, we show that the system is integrable: the bulk eigenvalue statistics behave like $D$ independent copies of GUE statistics asymptotically and each bulk eigenvector is localized on only one subsystem. In particular, if we take $D\to \infty$ after the $N\to \infty$ limit, the bulk statistics converge to a Poisson point process under the $DN$ scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a refracted skew Brownian motion as a risk model with endogenous regime switching, which generalizes the refracted diffusion risk process introduced by Gerber and Shiu. We consider an optimal dividend problem for the refracted skew Brownian risk model and identify sufficient conditions, respectively, for barrier strategy, band strategy and their variants to be optimal.</description>

      <title>Strong propagation of chaos for systems of interacting particles with nearly stable jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ interacting particles, described by SDEs driven by Poisson random measures, where the coefficients depend on the empirical measure of the system. Every particle jumps with a jump rate depending on its position. When this happens, all the other particles of the system receive a small random kick which is distributed according to a heavy tailed random variable belonging to the domain of attraction of an $\alpha-$ stable law and scaled by $N^{-1/\alpha},$ where $0 &lt; \alpha &lt;2 .$ We call these jumps collateral jumps. Moreover, in case $ 0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1, $ the jumping particle itself undergoes a macroscopic, main jump. Such systems appear in the modeling of large neural networks, such as the human brain.
  The particular scaling of the collateral jumps implies that the limit of the empirical measures of the system is random and equals the conditional distribution of one typical particle in the limit system, given the source of common noise. Thus the system exhibits the conditional propagation of chaos property. The limit system turns out to be solution of a non-linear SDE, driven by an $ \alpha-$stable process. We prove strong unique existence of the limit system and introduce a suitable coupling to obtain the strong convergence of the finite to the limit system, together with precise error bounds for finite time marginals.</description>

      <title>The reference interval in higher-order stochastic dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two random variables taking values in a bounded interval, we study whether one dominates the other in higher-order stochastic dominance depends on the reference interval in the model setting. We obtain two results. First, the stochastic dominance relations get strictly stronger when the reference interval shrinks if and only if the order of stochastic dominance is larger than three. Second, for mean-preserving stochastic dominance relations, the reference interval is irrelevant if and only if the difference between the degree of the stochastic dominance and the number of moments is no larger than three. These results highlight complications arising from using higher-order stochastic dominance in economic applications.</description>

Abstract: We completely characterize the class of univariate distributions allowing for a Stein kernel and illustrate our result by means of some concrete distributions. Moreover, we apply our findings to prove a quantitative version of the central limit theorem with optimal rate $n^{-1/2}$ in total variation distance for i.i.d. random variables whose distribution belongs to that class.</description>

      <title>Heat kernels and Green functions for fractional Schr\"{o}dinger operators with confining potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give two-sided, global (in all variables) estimates of the heat kernel and the Green function of the fractional Schr\"odinger operator with a non-negative and locally bounded potential $V$ such that $V(x) \to \infty$ as $|x| \to \infty$. We assume that $V$ is comparable to a radial profile with the doubling property. Our bounds are sharp with respect to spatial variables and qualitatively sharp with respect to time. The methods we use combine probabilistic and analytic arguments. They are based on the strong Markov property and the Feynman--Kac formula.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Picard algorithm for general semilinear parabolic PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12545v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a multilevel Picard approximation algorithm for general semilinear parabolic PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities whose coefficient functions do not need to be constant. We also provide a full convergence and complexity analysis of our algorithm. To obtain our main results, we consider a particular stochastic fixed-point equation (SFPE) motivated by the Feynman-Kac representation and the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula. We show that the PDE under consideration has a unique viscosity solution which coincides with the first component of the unique solution of the stochastic fixed-point equation. Moreover, the gradient of the unique viscosity solution of the PDE exists and coincides with the second component of the unique solution of the stochastic fixed-point equation. Furthermore, we also provide a numerical example in up to $300$ dimensions to demonstrate the practical applicability of our multilevel Picard algorithm.</description>

      <title>Relative Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of optimal transport relative to a distinguished subset, which acts as a reservoir of mass, allowing us to compare measures of different total variation. This relative transportation problem has an optimal solution and we obtain relative versions of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm, Wasserstein distance, Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality and Monge-Kantorovich duality. We also prove relative versions of the Riesz-Markov-Kakutani theorem, which connect the spaces of measures arising from the relative optimal transport problem to spaces of Lipschitz functions. For a boundedly compact Polish space, we show that our relative 1-finite real-valued Radon measures with relative Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm coincide with the sequentially order continuous dual of relative Lipschitz functions with the operator norm. As part of our work we develop a theory of Riesz cones that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Selective Reviews of Bandit Problems in AI via a Statistical View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a widely researched area in artificial intelligence that focuses on teaching agents decision-making through interactions with their environment. A key subset includes stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) and continuum-armed bandit (SCAB) problems, which model sequential decision-making under uncertainty. This review outlines the foundational models and assumptions of bandit problems, explores non-asymptotic theoretical tools like concentration inequalities and minimax regret bounds, and compares frequentist and Bayesian algorithms for managing exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Additionally, we explore K-armed contextual bandits and SCAB, focusing on their methodologies and regret analyses. We also examine the connections between SCAB problems and functional data analysis. Finally, we highlight recent advances and ongoing challenges in the field.</description>
