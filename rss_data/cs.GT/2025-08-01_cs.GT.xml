      <title>Learning with Episodic Hypothesis Testing in General Games: A Framework for Equilibrium Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new hypothesis testing-based learning dynamics in which players update their strategies by combining hypothesis testing with utility-driven exploration. In this dynamics, each player forms beliefs about opponents' strategies and episodically tests these beliefs using empirical observations. Beliefs are resampled either when the hypothesis test is rejected or through exploration, where the probability of exploration decreases with the player's (transformed) utility. In general finite normal-form games, we show that the learning process converges to a set of approximate Nash equilibria and, more importantly, to a refinement that selects equilibria maximizing the minimum (transformed) utility across all players. Our result establishes convergence to equilibrium in general finite games and reveals a novel mechanism for equilibrium selection induced by the structure of the learning dynamics.</description>

      <title>Online Combinatorial Allocation with Interdependent Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study online combinatorial allocation problems in the secretary setting, under interdependent values. In the interdependent model, introduced by Milgrom and Weber (1982), each agent possesses a private signal that captures her information about an item for sale, and the value of every agent depends on the signals held by all agents. Mauras, Mohan, and Reiffenh\"auser (2024) were the first to study interdependent values in online settings, providing constant-approximation guarantees for secretary settings, where agents arrive online along with their signals and values, and the goal is to select the agent with the highest value.
  In this work, we extend this framework to {\em combinatorial} secretary problems, where agents have interdependent valuations over {\em bundles} of items, introducing additional challenges due to both combinatorial structure and interdependence. We provide $2e$-competitive algorithms for a broad class of valuation functions, including submodular and XOS functions, matching the approximation guarantees in the single-choice secretary setting. Furthermore, our results cover the same range of valuation classes for which constant-factor algorithms exist in classical (non-interdependent) secretary settings, while incurring only an additional factor of $2$ due to interdependence. Finally, we extend our study to strategic settings, and provide a $4e$-competitive truthful mechanism for online bipartite matching with interdependent valuations, again meeting the frontier of what is known, even without interdependence.</description>

      <title>Competitive Bundle Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A retailer is purchasing goods in bundles from suppliers and then selling these goods in bundles to customers; her goal is to maximize profit, which is the revenue obtained from selling goods minus the cost of purchasing those goods. In this paper, we study this general trading problem from the retailer's perspective, where both suppliers and customers arrive online. The retailer has inventory constraints on the number of goods from each type that she can store, and she must decide upon arrival of each supplier/customer which goods to buy/sell in order to maximize profit.
  We design an algorithm with logarithmic competitive ratio compared to an optimal offline solution. We achieve this via an exponential-weight-update dynamic pricing scheme, and our analysis dual fits the retailer's profit with respect to a linear programming formulation upper bounding the optimal offline profit. We prove (almost) matching lower bounds, and we also extend our result to an incentive compatible mechanism. Prior to our work, algorithms for trading bundles were known only for the special case of selling an initial inventory.</description>

      <title>Expectation in Stochastic Games with Prefix-independent Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18048v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic two-player games model systems with an environment that is both adversarial and stochastic. In this paper, we study the expected value of bounded quantitative prefix-independent objectives in the context of stochastic games. We show a generic reduction from the expectation problem to linearly many instances of the almost-sure satisfaction problem for threshold Boolean objectives. The result follows from partitioning the vertices of the game into so-called value classes where each class consists of vertices of the same value. Our procedure further entails that the memory required by both players to play optimally for the expectation problem is no more than the memory required by the players to play optimally for the almost-sure satisfaction problem for a corresponding threshold Boolean objective.
  We show the applicability of the framework to compute the expected window mean-payoff measure in stochastic games. The window mean-payoff measure strengthens the classical mean-payoff measure by computing the mean payoff over windows of bounded length that slide along an infinite path. We show that the decision problem to check if the expected window mean-payoff value is at least a given threshold is in UP $\cap$ coUP when the window length is given in unary.</description>

      <title>Explaining vague language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why is language vague? Vagueness may be explained and rationalized if it can be shown that vague language is more useful to speaker and hearer than precise language. In a well-known paper, Lipman proposes a game-theoretic account of vagueness in terms of mixed strategy that leads to a puzzle: vagueness cannot be strictly better than precision at equilibrium. More recently, \'Egr\'e, Spector, Mortier and Verheyen have put forward a Bayesian account of vagueness establishing that using vague words can be strictly more informative than using precise words. This paper proposes to compare both results and to explain why they are not in contradiction. Lipman's definition of vagueness relies exclusively on a property of signaling strategies, without making any assumptions about the lexicon, whereas \'Egr\'e et al.'s involves a layer of semantic content. We argue that the semantic account of vagueness is needed, and more adequate and explanatory of vagueness.</description>
