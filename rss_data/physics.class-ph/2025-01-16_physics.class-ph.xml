      <title>Phase-Locking Parametric Instability Coupling Longitudinal and Transverse Waves on Rivulets in a Hele-Shaw Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an instability exhibited by a fluid system when coupling two distinct types of waves, both linearly damped. While none of them is unstable on its own, they amplify one another, resulting in a previously unreported convective instability. An external excitation is used to induce a parametric cross-coupling between longitudinal and transverse deformations of a liquid bridge between two vertical glass plates. Coherent amplification results in waves satisfying a synchronization condition, which selects a precise wavelength. We derive a model for this instability using depth-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, showing the physical origin of the coamplification, and confirm its relevance experimentally. Our findings open new perspectives in the study of parametrically controlled pattern formation, and invites the search for analogous parametric cross-coupling instabilities in other systems exhibiting distinct wave types, from plasma to elastic media.</description>

      <title>Isochronous oscillator with a singular position-dependent mass and its quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of the equation $\ddot{x} - (1/2x) \dot{x}^2 + 2 \omega^2 x - 1/8x = 0$, where $\omega &gt; 0$ and $x = x(t)$ is a real-valued variable. We first discuss the appearance of this equation from a position-dependent-mass scenario in which the mass profile goes inversely with $x$, admitting a singularity at $x = 0$. The associated potential is also singular at $x = 0$, splitting the real axis into two halves, i.e., $x &gt; 0$ and $x &lt; 0$. The dynamics is exactly solvable for both the branches and so for definiteness, we stick to the $x &gt; 0$ branch. Performing a canonical quantization in the position representation and upon employing the ordering strategy of the kinetic-energy operator due to von Roos, we show that the problem is isospectral with the isotonic oscillator. Thus, the quantum spectrum consists of an infinite number of equispaced levels which is in line with the expectation that classical systems that support isochronous oscillations are associated in their quantized versions with equally-spaced spectra. The spacing between energy levels is found to be insensitive to the specific choices of the ambiguity parameters that are employed for ordering the kinetic-energy operator \`a la von Roos.</description>

      <title>The parametric instability landscape of coupled Kerr parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of coupled Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) hold promise as for the realization of neuromorphic and quantum computation. Yet, their rich bifurcation structure remains largely not understood. Here, we employ secular perturbation theory to map the stability regions of these networks, and identify the regime where the system can be mapped to an Ising model. Starting with two coupled KPOs, we show how the bifurcations arise from the competition between the global parametric drive and linear coupling between the KPOs. We then extend this framework to larger networks with all-to-all equal coupling, deriving analytical expressions for the full cascade of bifurcation transitions. In the thermodynamic limit, we find that these transitions become uniformly spaced, leading to a highly regular structure. Our results reveal the precise bounds under which KPO networks have an Ising-like solution space, and thus provides crucial guidance for their experimental implementation.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of elastic grids containing rigid elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inclusion of rigid elements into elastic composites may lead to superior mechanical properties for the equivalent elastic continuum, such as, for instance, extreme auxeticity. To allow full exploitation of these properties, a tool for the homogenization of two-dimensional elastic grids containing rigid elements is developed and tested on elaborate geometries, such as, for instance, Chinese lattices. The rigid elements are assumed to be either jointed with full continuity of displacement or hinged to the elastic rods. It is shown that the two different constraints induce strongly different mechanical characteristics of the equivalent elastic solid. The presented results open the way to the design of architected materials or metamaterials containing both elastic and rigid parts.</description>
