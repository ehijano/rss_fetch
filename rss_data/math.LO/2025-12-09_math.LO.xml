      <title>A Note About Models of Synthetic Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to build models of Synthetic Algebraic Geometry over rings k such that finitely presented k-algebra have a decidable equality. The construction is done in a constructive and weak (same proof theoretic strength as dependent type theory with universes) meta theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main result of this paper shows that a weak form of Tower Sealing holds in a generic extension of hod mice with a strong cardinal and a proper class of Woodin cardinals. We show Tower Sealing fails in such extensions in general. We show that this weak form of Tower Sealing (called Partial Tower Sealing) implies Sealing and that its consistency strength is below that of ZFC + there is a Woodin limit of Woodin cardinals.</description>

      <title>On certain definable coarsenings of valuation rings and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how suitable extensions $(L|K,v)$ of prime degree of valued fields give rise to definable coarsenings of the valuation rings of $L$ and $K$. In the case of Artin-Schreier and Kummer extensions with wild ramification, we can also define the ramification ideal. We demonstrate the use of the coarsenings on $L$, their maximal ideals, and the ramification ideals for the classification of defects and for the presentation of the K\"ahler differentials of the extension of the valuation rings of $(L|K,v)$, and their annihilators. Finally, we give a construction that realizes predescribed convex subgroups of suitable value groups as those that are associated with Galois extensions of degree $p$ with independent defect, which in turn give rise to definable coarsenings.</description>

      <title>A potentialist conception of ultrafinitism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I shall explore various senses in which ultrafinitism can be fruitfully understood as engaging with a potentialist perspective in mathematics. First, I explain that every model $M$ of the theory of finite arithmetic -- arithmetic with a largest number, in which addition and multiplication are merely partial functions -- is bi-interpretable with a strictly taller model $M^+$, in which the arithmetic operations on objects taken from the original base model $M$ are totally defined in the extended world $M^+$. More generally, I explain how ultrafinitist ideas emerge in the modal potentialist system consisting of all models of arithmetic under end-extension.</description>

      <title>Stationary list colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Komjath studied the list chromatic number of infinite graphs and introduced the notion of restricted list chromatic number. For a graph $X=(V_X,E_X)$ and a cardinal $\kappa$, we say that $X$ is restricted list colorable for $\kappa$ if for every $L:V_X\to[\kappa]^\kappa$ there is a choice function $c$ of $L$ such that $c(v)\neq c(w)$ whenever ${v,w}\in E_X$. In this paper, we discuss a variation, stationary list colorability for $\kappa$, obtained by replacing $[\kappa]^\kappa$ with the set of all stationary subsets of $\kappa$. We compare the stationary list colorability with other coloring properties. Among other things, we prove that the stationary list colorability is essentially different from other coloring properties including the restricted list colorability. We also prove the consistency result showing that for some $\kappa&lt;\lambda$, restricted and stationary list colorability at $\kappa$ do not imply the corresponding properties at $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Higman's Theorem and iterated ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Higman's Theorem is the direct counterpart of Higman's Theorem that asserts the closure of the class of \emph{better} quasi-orders, instead of the class of \emph{well} quasi-orders, under the construction $P\mapsto P^{&lt;\omega}$ of the embeddability order on finite sequences. Traditionally, this result is obtained as a consequence of very powerful and general techniques of Nash-Williams. In this paper, we propose a new proof of this result that is based on an explicit characterization of the underlying orders. In particular, this new technique allows us to formalize the proof of the result in the formal theory $\mathsf{atr}_0$, thus resolving a long-standing open problem in the field of reverse mathematics.
  The main ingredient of our proof is the introduction of a transfinite hierarchy of orders $\dot I^*_\alpha(P)$ starting with $\dot I^*_0(P)=P$ and $\dot I^*_{\alpha+1}(P)$ being the inclusion order on ideals of $\dot I^*_{\alpha}(P)$. On one hand, we show that a quasi-order $P$ is a bqo if and only if all $\dot I^*_\alpha(P)$ are wqos. On the other hand, under the assumption that $P$ is a bqo, we show that the $\dot I^*_\alpha(P^{&lt;\omega})$ are wqos, and furthermore give a characterization of their structure in terms of a transfinite iteration of a Higman-like construction. The sufficiently explicit character of this proof allows us to formalize it in a rather straightforward manner.</description>

      <title>$\sigma$-Porosity of Certain Ideals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $\sigma$-porosity of certain known ideals of subsets of natural numbers. Porosity is a notion of smallness in metric spaces that is stronger than nowhere density. Analogously, $\sigma$-porosity is a strengthening of meagerness. In this paper, we verify which ideals are $\sigma$-porous.</description>

      <title>On masas of the Calkin algebra generated by projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First, assuming the continuum hypothesis CH, for every compact totally disconnected Hausdorff space $K$ of weight not exceeding the continuum and without $G_\delta$ points, we construct a masa of the Calkin algebra $\mathcal Q(\ell_2)$ which is $*$-isomorphic to the algebra $C(K)$ of complex-valued continuous functions on $K$. This is sharp in two ways: (1) there cannot be other $*$-isomorphic types of masas of $\mathcal Q(\ell_2)$ generated by projections and so, this result gives a complete $*$-isomorphic classification of masas of $\mathcal Q(\ell_2)$ generated by projections, (2) some additional set-theoretic hypothesis, like CH, is necessary to have all these C*-algebras as masas of $\mathcal Q(\ell_2)$.
  This shows that masas of the Calkin algebras could have rather unexpected properties compared to the previously known three $*$-isomorphic types of them generated by projections: $\ell_\infty/c_0$, $L_\infty$ and $\ell_\infty/c_0\oplus L_\infty$.
  Secondly, without making any additional set-theoretic assumptions we construct a family of maximal possible cardinality (of the power set of $\mathbb R$) of pairwise non-$*$-isomorphic masas of $\mathcal Q(\ell_2)$ generated by projections which (a) are not SAW*-algebras unlike the liftable masas (Gelfand spaces in this group of our masas are not $F$-spaces) (b) do not admit conditional expectations. This improves the results which required additional set-theoretic hypotheses to construct a single masa of $\mathcal Q(\ell_2)$ generated by projections without a commutative lift.</description>

      <title>Resource-Bounded Type Theory: Compositional Cost Analysis via Graded Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a compositional framework for certifying resource bounds in typed programs. Terms are typed with synthesized bounds drawn from an abstract resource lattice, enabling uniform treatment of time, memory, gas, and domain-specific costs.
  We introduce a graded feasibility modality with co-unit and monotonicity laws. Our main result is a syntactic cost soundness theorem for the recursion-free simply-typed fragment: if a closed term has synthesized bound b under a given budget, its operational cost is bounded by b. We provide a syntactic term model in the topos of presheaves over the lattice -- where resource bounds index a cost-stratified family of definable values -- with cost extraction as a natural transformation. We prove canonical forms via reification and establish initiality of the syntactic model: it embeds uniquely into all resource-bounded models.
  A case study demonstrates compositional reasoning for binary search using Lean's native recursion with separate bound proofs.</description>

      <title>Symmetries in Sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science, and their correctness criteria are well understood as rearranging elements of a list according to a specified total order on the underlying set of elements. As mathematical functions, they are functions on lists that perform combinatorial operations on the representation of the input list. In this paper, we study sorting algorithms conceptually as abstract sorting functions.
  There is a canonical surjection from the free monoid on a set (lists of elements) to the free commutative monoid on the same set (multisets of elements). We show that sorting functions determine a section (right inverse) to this surjection satisfying two axioms, that do not presuppose a total order on the underlying set. Then, we establish an equivalence between (decidable) total orders on the underlying set and correct sorting functions.
  The first part of the paper develops concepts from universal algebra from the point of view of functorial signatures, and gives constructions of free monoids and free commutative monoids in (univalent) type theory. Using these constructions, the second part of the paper develops the axiomatisation of sorting functions. The paper uses informal mathematical language, and comes with an accompanying formalisation in Cubical Agda.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Finite Distance Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the work of Gabriel Conant, we investigate the enumeration problems of finite distance monoids by applying the decomposition of Archimedean classes and studying their internal arithmetic progressions. Specifically, we first determine the exact value of $DM(n,2)$, which denotes the number of distance monoids on $n$ non-zero elements with Archimedean complexity $2$. This computation allows us to resolve a conjecture of Conant, establishing that the total number $DM(n)$ of distance monoids grows at least exponentially in $n$. Furthermore, we study the asymptotic behavior of $DM(n,n-k)$ for fixed $k$, proving that $DM(n,n-k) = O(n^k)$ and providing an exact formula for $DM(n,n-2)$.</description>

      <title>Inner models from extended logics and the Delta-operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $\mathcal{L}$ is an abstract logic (a.k.a. model theoretic logic), we can define the inner model $C(\mathcal{L})$ by replacing first order logic with $\mathcal{L}$ in G\"odel's definition of the inner model $L$ of constructible sets. Set theoretic properties of such inner models $C(\mathcal{L})$ have been investigated recently and a spectrum of new inner models is emerging between $L$ and $\mathrm{HOD}$. The topic of this paper is the effect on $C(\mathcal{L})$ of a slight modification of $\mathcal{L}$ i.e. how sensitive is $C(\mathcal{L})$ on the exact definition of $\mathcal{L}$? The $\Delta$-extension $\Delta(\mathcal{L})$ of a logic is generally considered a "mild" extension of $\mathcal{L}$. We give examples of logics $\mathcal{L}$ for which the inner model $C(\mathcal{L})$ is consistently strictly smaller than the inner model $C(\Delta(\mathcal{L}))$, and in one case we show this follows from the existence of $0^{\sharp}$.</description>

      <title>Plenitudinous Urelements and the Definability of Cardinality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Axiom of Plenitude asserts that every ordinal is equinumerous with a set of urelements, while its stronger form, Plenitude$^+$, extends it to all sets. We investigate these two axioms within ZF set theory with urelements. Assuming that cardinality is definable, Plenitude$^+$ together with the Collection Principle implies the Reflection Principle. If either cardinality is representable or Small Violations of Choice (SVC) holds, Plenitude$^+$ implies the Reflection Principle. In contrast, Plenitude is considerably weaker: SVC + Plenitude does not prove the Collection Principle, and SVC + Plenitude + Reflection Principle does not prove Plenitude$^+$.</description>
