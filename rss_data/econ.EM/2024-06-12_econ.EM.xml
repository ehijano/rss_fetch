      <title>Robustness to Missing Data: Breakdown Point Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Missing data is pervasive in econometric applications, and rarely is it plausible that the data are missing (completely) at random. This paper proposes a methodology for studying the robustness of results drawn from incomplete datasets. Selection is measured as the squared Hellinger divergence between the distributions of complete and incomplete observations, which has a natural interpretation. The breakdown point is defined as the minimal amount of selection needed to overturn a given result. Reporting point estimates and lower confidence intervals of the breakdown point is a simple, concise way to communicate the robustness of a result. An estimator of the breakdown point of a result drawn from a generalized method of moments model is proposed and shown root-n consistent and asymptotically normal under mild assumptions. Lower confidence intervals of the breakdown point are simple to construct. The paper concludes with a simulation study illustrating the finite sample performance of the estimators in several common models.</description>

      <title>Cluster GARCH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel multivariate GARCH model with flexible convolution-t distributions that is applicable in high-dimensional systems. The model is called Cluster GARCH because it can accommodate cluster structures in the conditional correlation matrix and in the tail dependencies. The expressions for the log-likelihood function and its derivatives are tractable, and the latter facilitate a score-drive model for the dynamic correlation structure. We apply the Cluster GARCH model to daily returns for 100 assets and find it outperforms existing models, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Moreover, the convolution-t distribution provides a better empirical performance than the conventional multivariate t-distribution.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Switchback Experiments: Theoretical Tradeoffs and Empirical Bayes Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the design and analysis of switchback experiments conducted on a single aggregate unit. The design problem is to partition the continuous time space into intervals and switch treatments between intervals, in order to minimize the estimation error of the treatment effect. We show that the estimation error depends on four factors: carryover effects, periodicity, serially correlated outcomes, and impacts from simultaneous experiments. We derive a rigorous bias-variance decomposition and show the tradeoffs of the estimation error from these factors. The decomposition provides three new insights in choosing a design: First, balancing the periodicity between treated and control intervals reduces the variance; second, switching less frequently reduces the bias from carryover effects while increasing the variance from correlated outcomes, and vice versa; third, randomizing interval start and end points reduces both bias and variance from simultaneous experiments. Combining these insights, we propose a new empirical Bayes design approach. This approach uses prior data and experiments for designing future experiments. We illustrate this approach using real data from a ride-sharing platform, yielding a design that reduces MSE by 33% compared to the status quo design used on the platform.</description>

      <title>Aggregated Intersection Bounds and Aggregated Minimax Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework of aggregated intersection bounds, where the target parameter is obtained by averaging the minimum (or maximum) of a collection of regression functions over the covariate space. Examples of such quantities include the lower and upper bounds on distributional effects (Fr\'echet-Hoeffding, Makarov) as well as the optimal welfare in statistical treatment choice problems. The proposed estimator -- the envelope score estimator -- is shown to have an oracle property, where the oracle knows the identity of the minimizer for each covariate value. Next, the result is extended to the aggregated minimax values of a collection of regression functions, covering optimal distributional welfare in worst-case and best-case, respectively. This proposed estimator -- the envelope saddle value estimator -- is shown to have an oracle property, where the oracle knows the identity of the saddle point.</description>

      <title>Calibrating doubly-robust estimators with unbalanced treatment assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning methods, particularly the double machine learning (DML) estimator (Chernozhukov et al., 2018), are increasingly popular for the estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE). However, datasets often exhibit unbalanced treatment assignments where only a few observations are treated, leading to unstable propensity score estimations. We propose a simple extension of the DML estimator which undersamples data for propensity score modeling and calibrates scores to match the original distribution. The paper provides theoretical results showing that the estimator retains the DML estimator's asymptotic properties. A simulation study illustrates the finite sample performance of the estimator.</description>

      <title>Seemingly unrelated Bayesian additive regression trees for cost-effectiveness analyses in healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, theoretical results and simulation evidence have shown Bayesian additive regression trees to be a highly-effective method for nonparametric regression. Motivated by cost-effectiveness analyses in health economics, where interest lies in jointly modelling the costs of healthcare treatments and the associated health-related quality of life experienced by a patient, we propose a multivariate extension of BART applicable in regression and classification analyses with several correlated outcome variables. Our framework overcomes some key limitations of existing multivariate BART models by allowing each individual response to be associated with different ensembles of trees, while still handling dependencies between the outcomes. In the case of continuous outcomes, our model is essentially a nonparametric version of seemingly unrelated regression. Likewise, our proposal for binary outcomes is a nonparametric generalisation of the multivariate probit model. We give suggestions for easily interpretable prior distributions, which allow specification of both informative and uninformative priors. We provide detailed discussions of MCMC sampling methods to conduct posterior inference. Our methods are implemented in the R package `suBART'. We showcase their performance through extensive simulations and an application to an empirical case study from health economics. By also accommodating propensity scores in a manner befitting a causal analysis, we find substantial evidence for a novel trauma care intervention's cost-effectiveness.</description>
