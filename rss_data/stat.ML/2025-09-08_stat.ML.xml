      <title>Any-Step Density Ratio Estimation via Interval-Annealed Secant Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating density ratios is a fundamental problem in machine learning, but existing methods often trade off accuracy for efficiency. We propose \textit{Interval-annealed Secant Alignment Density Ratio Estimation (ISA-DRE)}, a framework that enables accurate, any-step estimation without numerical integration.
  Instead of modeling infinitesimal tangents as in prior methods, ISA-DRE learns a global secant function, defined as the expectation of all tangents over an interval, with provably lower variance, making it more suitable for neural approximation. This is made possible by the \emph{Secant Alignment Identity}, a self-consistency condition that formally connects the secant with its underlying tangent representations.
  To mitigate instability during early training, we introduce \emph{Contraction Interval Annealing}, a curriculum strategy that gradually expands the alignment interval during training. This process induces a contraction mapping, which improves convergence and training stability.
  Empirically, ISA-DRE achieves competitive accuracy with significantly fewer function evaluations compared to prior methods, resulting in much faster inference and making it well suited for real-time and interactive applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal Variance and Covariance Estimation under Differential Privacy in the Add-Remove Model and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of estimating the variance and covariance of datasets under differential privacy in the add-remove model. While estimation in the swap model has been extensively studied in the literature, the add-remove model remains less explored and more challenging, as the dataset size must also be kept private. To address this issue, we develop efficient mechanisms for variance and covariance estimation based on the \emph{B\'{e}zier mechanism}, a novel moment-release framework that leverages Bernstein bases. We prove that our proposed mechanisms are minimax optimal in the high-privacy regime by establishing new minimax lower bounds. Moreover, beyond worst-case scenarios, we analyze instance-wise utility and show that the B\'{e}zier-based estimator consistently achieves better utility compared to alternative mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the B\'{e}zier mechanism beyond variance and covariance estimation, showcasing its applicability to other statistical tasks.</description>

      <title>Spectral Algorithms in Misspecified Regression: Convergence under Covariate Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the convergence properties of spectral algorithms -- a class of regularization methods originating from inverse problems -- under covariate shift. In this setting, the marginal distributions of inputs differ between source and target domains, while the conditional distribution of outputs given inputs remains unchanged. To address this distributional mismatch, we incorporate importance weights, defined as the ratio of target to source densities, into the learning framework. This leads to a weighted spectral algorithm within a nonparametric regression setting in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). More importantly, in contrast to prior work that largely focuses on the well-specified setting, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the more challenging misspecified case, in which the target function does not belong to the RKHS. Under the assumption of uniformly bounded density ratios, we establish minimax-optimal convergence rates when the target function lies within the RKHS. For scenarios involving unbounded importance weights, we introduce a novel truncation technique that attains near-optimal convergence rates under mild regularity conditions, and we further extend these results to the misspecified regime. By addressing the intertwined challenges of covariate shift and model misspecification, this work extends classical kernel learning theory to more practical scenarios, providing a systematic framework for understanding their interaction.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic operator learning: generative modeling and uncertainty quantification for foundation models of differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05186v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context operator networks (ICON) are a class of operator learning methods based on the novel architectures of foundation models. Trained on a diverse set of datasets of initial and boundary conditions paired with corresponding solutions to ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs), ICON learns to map example condition-solution pairs of a given differential equation to an approximation of its solution operator. Here, we present a probabilistic framework that reveals ICON as implicitly performing Bayesian inference, where it computes the mean of the posterior predictive distribution over solution operators conditioned on the provided context, i.e., example condition-solution pairs. The formalism of random differential equations provides the probabilistic framework for describing the tasks ICON accomplishes while also providing a basis for understanding other multi-operator learning methods. This probabilistic perspective provides a basis for extending ICON to \emph{generative} settings, where one can sample from the posterior predictive distribution of solution operators. The generative formulation of ICON (GenICON) captures the underlying uncertainty in the solution operator, which enables principled uncertainty quantification in the solution predictions in operator learning.</description>

      <title>Fundamental bounds on efficiency-confidence trade-off for transductive conformal prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transductive conformal prediction addresses the simultaneous prediction for multiple data points. Given a desired confidence level, the objective is to construct a prediction set that includes the true outcomes with the prescribed confidence. We demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between confidence and efficiency in transductive methods, where efficiency is measured by the size of the prediction sets. Specifically, we derive a strict finite-sample bound showing that any non-trivial confidence level leads to exponential growth in prediction set size for data with inherent uncertainty. The exponent scales linearly with the number of samples and is proportional to the conditional entropy of the data. Additionally, the bound includes a second-order term, dispersion, defined as the variance of the log conditional probability distribution. We show that this bound is achievable in an idealized setting. Finally, we examine a special case of transductive prediction where all test data points share the same label. We show that this scenario reduces to the hypothesis testing problem with empirically observed statistics and provide an asymptotically optimal confidence predictor, along with an analysis of the error exponent.</description>

      <title>Survival Analysis with Adversarial Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16019v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Survival Analysis (SA) models the time until an event occurs, with applications in fields like medicine, defense, finance, and aerospace. Recent research indicates that Neural Networks (NNs) can effectively capture complex data patterns in SA, whereas simple generalized linear models often fall short in this regard. However, dataset uncertainties (e.g., noisy measurements, human error) can degrade NN model performance. To address this, we leverage advances in NN verification to develop training objectives for robust, fully-parametric SA models. Specifically, we propose an adversarially robust loss function based on a Min-Max optimization problem. We employ CROWN-Interval Bound Propagation (CROWN-IBP) to tackle the computational challenges inherent in solving this Min-Max problem. Evaluated over 10 SurvSet datasets, our method, Survival Analysis with Adversarial Regularization (SAWAR), consistently outperforms baseline adversarial training methods and state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep SA models across various covariate perturbations with respect to Negative Log Likelihood (NegLL), Integrated Brier Score (IBS), and Concordance Index (CI) metrics. Thus, we demonstrate that adversarial robustness enhances SA predictive performance and calibration, mitigating data uncertainty and improving generalization across diverse datasets by up to 150% compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Inferring Change Points in High-Dimensional Regression via Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of localizing change points in a generalized linear model (GLM), a model that covers many widely studied problems in statistical learning including linear, logistic, and rectified linear regression. We propose a novel and computationally efficient Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm for estimating both the signals and the change point locations, and rigorously characterize its performance in the high-dimensional limit where the number of parameters $p$ is proportional to the number of samples $n$. This characterization is in terms of a state evolution recursion, which allows us to precisely compute performance measures such as the asymptotic Hausdorff error of our change point estimates, and allows us to tailor the algorithm to take advantage of any prior structural information on the signals and change points. Moreover, we show how our AMP iterates can be used to efficiently compute a Bayesian posterior distribution over the change point locations in the high-dimensional limit. We validate our theory via numerical experiments, and demonstrate the favorable performance of our estimators on both synthetic and real data in the settings of linear, logistic, and rectified linear regression.</description>

      <title>Refined Risk Bounds for Unbounded Losses via Transductive Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the sequential variants of linear regression with the squared loss, classification problems with hinge loss, and logistic regression, all characterized by unbounded losses in the setup where no assumptions are made on the magnitude of design vectors and the norm of the optimal vector of parameters. The key distinction from existing results lies in our assumption that the set of design vectors is known in advance (though their order is not), a setup sometimes referred to as transductive online learning. While this assumption seems similar to fixed design regression or denoising, we demonstrate that the sequential nature of our algorithms allows us to convert our bounds into statistical ones with random design without making any additional assumptions about the distribution of the design vectors--an impossibility for standard denoising results. Our key tools are based on the exponential weights algorithm with carefully chosen transductive (design-dependent) priors, which exploit the full horizon of the design vectors.
  Our classification regret bounds have a feature that is only attributed to bounded losses in the literature: they depend solely on the dimension of the parameter space and on the number of rounds, independent of the design vectors or the norm of the optimal solution. For linear regression with squared loss, we further extend our analysis to the sparse case, providing sparsity regret bounds that additionally depend on the magnitude of the response variables. We argue that these improved bounds are specific to the transductive setting and unattainable in the worst-case sequential setup. Our algorithms, in several cases, have polynomial time approximations and reduce to sampling with respect to log-concave measures instead of aggregating over hard-to-construct $\varepsilon$-covers of classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The last decade has seen a number of advances in computationally efficient algorithms for statistical methods subject to robustness constraints. An estimator may be robust in a number of different ways: to contamination of the dataset, to heavy-tailed data, or in the sense that it preserves privacy of the dataset. We survey recent results in these areas with a focus on the problem of mean estimation, drawing technical and conceptual connections between the various forms of robustness, showing that the same underlying algorithmic ideas lead to computationally efficient estimators in all these settings.</description>

      <title>Landmark-Based Node Representations for Shortest Path Distance Approximations in Random Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning node representations is a fundamental problem in graph machine learning. While existing embedding methods effectively preserve local similarity measures, they often fail to capture global functions like graph distances. Inspired by Bourgain's seminal work on Hilbert space embeddings of metric spaces (1985), we study the performance of local distance-preserving node embeddings. Known as landmark-based algorithms, these embeddings approximate pairwise distances by computing shortest paths from a small subset of reference nodes called landmarks. Our main theoretical contribution shows that random graphs, such as Erdos-Renyi random graphs, require lower dimensions in landmark-based embeddings compared to worst-case graphs. Empirically, we demonstrate that the GNN-based approximations for the distances to landmarks generalize well to larger real-world networks, offering a scalable and transferable alternative for graph representation learning.</description>

      <title>Test Set Sizing for the Ridge Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the ideal train/test split for the ridge regression to high accuracy in the limit that the number of training rows m becomes large. The split must depend on the ridge tuning parameter, alpha, but we find that the dependence is weak and can asymptotically be ignored; all parameters vanish except for m and the number of features, n, which is held constant. This is the first time that such a split is calculated mathematically for a machine learning model in the large data limit. The goal of the calculations is to maximize "integrity," so that the measured error in the trained model is as close as possible to what it theoretically should be. This paper's result for the ridge regression split matches prior art for the plain vanilla linear regression split to the first two terms asymptotically.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Bayesian GANs with Log-Signatures for Uncertainty-Aware Credit Card Fraud Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel deep generative semi-supervised framework for credit card fraud detection, formulated as time series classification task. As financial transaction data streams grow in scale and complexity, traditional methods often require large labeled datasets, struggle with time series of irregular sampling frequencies and varying sequence lengths. To address these challenges, we extend conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for targeted data augmentation, integrate Bayesian inference to obtain predictive distributions and quantify uncertainty, and leverage log-signatures for robust feature encoding of transaction histories. We introduce a novel Wasserstein distance-based loss to align generated and real unlabeled samples while simultaneously maximizing classification accuracy on labeled data. Our approach is evaluated on the BankSim dataset, a widely used simulator for credit card transaction data, under varying proportions of labeled samples, demonstrating consistent improvements over benchmarks in both global statistical and domain-specific metrics. These findings highlight the effectiveness of GAN-driven semi-supervised learning with log-signatures for irregularly sampled time series and emphasize the importance of uncertainty-aware predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data integration methods aim to extract low-dimensional embeddings from high-dimensional outcomes to remove unwanted variations, such as batch effects and unmeasured covariates, across heterogeneous datasets. However, multiple hypothesis testing after integration can be biased due to data-dependent processes. We introduce a robust post-integrated inference (PII) method that adjusts for latent heterogeneity using control outcomes. Leveraging causal interpretations, we derive nonparametric identifiability of the direct effects using negative control outcomes. By utilizing surrogate control outcomes as an extension of negative control outcomes, we develop semiparametric inference on projected direct effect estimands, accounting for hidden mediators, confounders, and moderators. These estimands remain statistically meaningful under model misspecifications and with error-prone embeddings. We provide bias quantifications and finite-sample linear expansions with uniform concentration bounds. The proposed doubly robust estimators are consistent and efficient under minimal assumptions and potential misspecification, facilitating data-adaptive estimation with machine learning algorithms. Our proposal is evaluated with random forests through simulations and analysis of single-cell CRISPR perturbed datasets with potential unmeasured confounders.</description>

      <title>Barrier Certificates for Unknown Systems with Latent States and Polynomial Dynamics using Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certifying safety in dynamical systems is crucial, but barrier certificates - widely used to verify that system trajectories remain within a safe region - typically require explicit system models. When dynamics are unknown, data-driven methods can be used instead, yet obtaining a valid certificate requires rigorous uncertainty quantification. For this purpose, existing methods usually rely on full-state measurements, limiting their applicability. This paper proposes a novel approach for synthesizing barrier certificates for unknown systems with latent states and polynomial dynamics. A Bayesian framework is employed, where a prior in state-space representation is updated using output data via a targeted marginal Metropolis-Hastings sampler. The resulting samples are used to construct a barrier certificate through a sum-of-squares program. Probabilistic guarantees for its validity with respect to the true, unknown system are obtained by testing on an additional set of posterior samples. The approach and its probabilistic guarantees are illustrated through a numerical simulation.</description>

Abstract: The Schr\"{o}dinger bridge (SB) has evolved into a universal class of probabilistic generative models. In practice, however, estimated learning signals are innately uncertain, and the reliability promised by existing methods is often based on speculative optimal case scenarios. Recent studies regarding the Sinkhorn algorithm through mirror descent (MD) have gained attention, revealing geometric insights into solution acquisition of the SB problems. In this paper, we propose a variational online MD (OMD) framework for the SB problems, which provides further stability to SB solvers. We formally prove convergence and a regret bound for the novel OMD formulation of SB acquisition. As a result, we propose a simulation-free SB algorithm called Variational Mirrored Schr\"{o}dinger Bridge (VMSB) by utilizing the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao geometry of the Gaussian mixture parameterization for Schr\"{o}dinger potentials. Based on the Wasserstein gradient flow theory, the algorithm offers tractable learning dynamics that precisely approximate each OMD step. In experiments, we validate the performance of the proposed VMSB algorithm across an extensive suite of benchmarks. VMSB consistently outperforms contemporary SB solvers on a wide range of SB problems, demonstrating the robustness as well as generality predicted by our OMD theory.</description>

      <title>Gradient Methods with Online Scaling Part I. Theoretical Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical foundations of the online scaled gradient methods (OSGM), a framework that utilizes online learning to adapt stepsizes and provably accelerate first-order methods. OSGM quantifies the effectiveness of a stepsize by a feedback function motivated from a convergence measure and uses the feedback to adjust the stepsize through an online learning algorithm. Consequently, instantiations of OSGM achieve convergence rates that are asymptotically no worse than the optimal stepsize. OSGM yields desirable convergence guarantees on smooth convex problems, including 1) trajectory-dependent global convergence on smooth convex objectives; 2) an improved complexity result on smooth strongly convex problems, and 3) local superlinear convergence. Notably, OSGM constitutes a new family of first-order methods with non-asymptotic superlinear convergence, joining the celebrated quasi-Newton methods. Finally, OSGM explains the empirical success of the popular hypergradient-descent heuristic in optimization for machine learning.</description>

      <title>The Features at Convergence Theorem: a first-principles alternative to the Neural Feature Ansatz for how networks learn representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05644</link>

Abstract: It is a central challenge in deep learning to understand how neural networks learn representations. A leading approach is the Neural Feature Ansatz (NFA) (Radhakrishnan et al. 2024), a conjectured mechanism for how feature learning occurs. Although the NFA is empirically validated, it is an educated guess and lacks a theoretical basis, and thus it is unclear when it might fail, and how to improve it. In this paper, we take a first-principles approach to understanding why this observation holds, and when it does not. We use first-order optimality conditions to derive the Features at Convergence Theorem (FACT), an alternative to the NFA that (a) obtains greater agreement with learned features at convergence, (b) explains why the NFA holds in most settings, and (c) captures essential feature learning phenomena in neural networks such as grokking behavior in modular arithmetic and phase transitions in learning sparse parities, similarly to the NFA. Thus, our results unify theoretical first-order optimality analyses of neural networks with the empirically-driven NFA literature, and provide a principled alternative that provably and empirically holds at convergence.</description>

      <title>Fantastic Pretraining Optimizers and Where to Find Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AdamW has long been the dominant optimizer in language model pretraining, despite numerous claims that alternative optimizers offer 1.4 to 2x speedup. We posit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and hindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited or misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a systematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales (0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum). We find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter tuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios, performed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one optimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer unfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned baselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before reaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two optimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our thorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon and Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with matrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based optimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over AdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.</description>

      <title>The Personality Illusion: Revealing Dissociation Between Self-Reports &amp; Behavior in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human behavior. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior. Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and interpretability.</description>
