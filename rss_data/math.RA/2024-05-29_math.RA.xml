      <title>Biunits of ternary algebra of hypermatrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study ternary algebras of third-order hypermatrices. By hypermatrix we mean a complex-valued variable with three indices, which is also called a three-dimensional matrix or spatial matrix. We assume that a hypermatrix is defined in three-dimensional Euclidean space and when this space is rotated, it transforms as a SO(3)-tensor. We consider two ternary multiplications of hypermatrices, which have the property of generalized associativity. We explore the geometric meaning of two independent SO(3)-invariants of hypermatrices and show that one of them defines a Hermitian metric. We study the 10-dimensional subspace of hypermatrices, known in the theory of representations of the rotation group, as the space of the weight 2 tensor representation of the rotation group. It is proved that the elements of this subspace that satisfy the regularity condition are right biunits of the ternary algebra of hypermatrices. The motivation for studying biunits of ternary algebra of hypermatrices was a ternary generalization of the Pauli exclusion principle.</description>

      <title>Modified double brackets and a conjecture of S. Arthamonov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Around 20 years ago, M. Van den Bergh introduced double Poisson brackets as operations on associative algebras inducing Poisson brackets under the representation functor. Weaker versions of these operations, called modified double Poisson brackets, were later introduced by S. Arthamonov in order to induce a Poisson bracket on moduli spaces of representations of the corresponding associative algebras. Moreover, he defined two operations that he conjectured to be modified double Poisson brackets. The first case of this conjecture was recently proved by M. Goncharov and V. Gubarev motivated by the theory of Rota-Baxter operators of nonzero weight. We settle the conjecture by realising the second case as part of a new family of modified double Poisson brackets.</description>

      <title>Compatible Associative Algebras and Some Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compatible associative algebra is a vector space equipped with two associative multiplication structures that interact in a certain natural way. This article presents the classification of these algebras with dimension less than four, as well as the classifications of their corresponding derivations, centroids, automorphisms, and quasi-centroids. We then characterize a selection of further invariants such as Rota-Baxter operators and second cohomology for some specific examples.</description>

      <title>Stable finiteness of monoid algebras and surjunctivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A monoid $M$ is said to be surjunctive if every injective cellular automaton with finite alphabet over $M$ is surjective. We show that monoid algebras of surjunctive monoids are stably finite. In other words, given any field $K$ and any surjunctive monoid $M$, every one-sided invertible square matrix with entries in the monoid algebra $K[M]$ is two-sided invertible. Our proof uses first-order model theory.</description>

      <title>Actions of Drinfeld doubles of finite groups on Artin-Schelter regular algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$ and $\Bbbk$ an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero we consider Artin-Schelter regular algebras $A$ on which the Drinfeld double $D(G)$ acts inner faithfully, and its associated algebras of invariants $A^{D(G)}$. Explicit computations for the cases when $G$ is the (generalized) quaternion group of order 8 and 16 are given.</description>

      <title>Linear Algebra and Galois Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \cite{GQ2008} R. Gow and R. Quinlan have cast a new look on the endomorphism algebra of a $K$-vector space $V$ of dimension $n$ assuming that $K$ has a Galois extension $L$ of degree $n$. In this approach the $K$-space $L$ may serve as a model for $V$ and Galois-theoretic ideas and results may be applied to elucidate the structure of endomorphisms and other important objects of linear algebra. In particular, this leads to the clarification of the structure of a rank-one endomorphism, trace of an endomorphism, criteria for linear indepedence etc. We present an exposition of these results using the language of tensor algebra wherever possible to provide shorter and more conceptual proofs.</description>

      <title>Pentagram maps over rings, Grassmannians, and skewers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pentagram map is a discrete dynamical system on planar polygons. By definition, the image of a polygon $P$ under the pentagram map is the polygon $P'$ whose vertices are the intersection points of consecutive shortest diagonals of $P$. The pentagram map was introduced by R. Schwartz in 1992, and is now one of the most renowned discrete integrable systems. Several authors proposed generalizations of the pentagram map to other geometries, in particular to Grassmannians, where the role of points and lines is played by higher-dimensional subspaces, as well to skewer geometry, where both points and lines are affine lines in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. In the present paper, we develop a common framework for these kinds of generalizations. Specifically, we show that those maps can be viewed as pentagram maps in the projective plane over an appropriate ring. In general, those rings need not be division rings or commutative. We show that the Grassmannian pentagram map corresponds to the ring of matrices, while the skewer map is the pentagram map over the ring of dual numbers. Furthermore, we prove that the pentagram map remains integrable for any stably finite ground ring $R$.</description>
