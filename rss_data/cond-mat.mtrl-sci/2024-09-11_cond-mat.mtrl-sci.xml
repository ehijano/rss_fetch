      <title>The conclusion that metamaterials could have negative mass is a consequence of improper constitutive characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of "effective mass" is frequently used for the simplification of complex lumped parameter systems (discrete dynamical systems) as well as materials that have complicated microstructural features. From the perspective of wave propagation, it is claimed that for some bodies described as metamaterials, the corresponding "effective mass" can be frequency dependent, negative or it may not even be a scalar quantity. The procedure has even led some authors to suggest that Newton's second law needs to be modified within the context of classical continuum mechanics. Such absurd physical conclusions are a consequence of appealing to the notion of "effective mass" with a preconception for the constitutive structure of the metamaterial and using a correct mathematical procedure. We show that such unreasonable physical conclusions would not arise if we were to use the appropriate "effective constitutive relation" for the metamaterial, rather than use the concept of "effective mass" with an incorrect predetermined constitutive relation.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Comments regarding "Transonic dislocation propagation in diamond" by Katagiri, et al. (Science 382, 69-72, 2023)" by Hawreliak, et al. (arXiv:2401.04213)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their comment (1), Hawreliak et al. claims that our observation of stacking fault formation and transonic dislocation propagation in diamond (2) is not valid as they interpret the observed features as cracks. In this response letter, we describe our rationale for interpreting the observed features as stacking faults. We also address other points raised in their comments, including the clarifications of how the results of Makarov et al. (3) are not in conflict with our study.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of vortex gyrotropic mode excited by surface acoustic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional method for exciting spin-wave dynamics in magnetic materials involves microwave magnetic fields generated by current injection into inductive antennas. However, there is a growing interest in non-inductive excitation methods. Magneto-acoustic effects present a viable alternative, where strains produced by applying voltages to a piezoelectric substrate can couple to spin-waves in a magnetic film. Recently, it has been proposed that surface acoustic waves (SAWs) can excite the gyrotropic mode of the vortex state in a magnetic disk. Here we report on experiments utilizing a magnetic resonance force microscope to investigate magnetization dynamics in CoFeB sub-micrometer disks in the vortex state, grown on a Z-cut LiNbO$_3$ substrate. The device design enables excitation of the gyrotropic mode either inductively, using an antenna on top of the disks, or acoustically via SAWs launched from an interdigital transducer. Our modelling indicates that the lattice rotation {\omega}xz generates a localized magneto-acoustic field that displaces the vortex core from the disk center, initiating the gyration motion. Tuning of the magneto-acoustic torque acting on the vortex structure is achieved by a perpendicular magnetic field. These results demonstrate the clear excitation of the vortex gyrotropic mode by magneto-acoustic excitation.</description>

      <title>Tantalum thin films sputtered on silicon and on different seed layers: material characterization and coplanar waveguide resonator performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits are a promising platform for large-scale quantum computing. Besides the Josephson junction, most parts of a superconducting qubit are made of planar, patterned superconducting thin films. In the past, most qubit architectures have relied on niobium (Nb) as the material of choice for the superconducting layer. However, there is also a variety of alternative materials with potentially less losses, which may thereby result in increased qubit performance. One such material is tantalum (Ta), for which high-performance qubit components have already been demonstrated. In this study, we report the sputter-deposition of Ta thin films directly on heated and unheated silicon (Si) substrates as well as onto different, nanometer-thin seed layers from tantalum nitride (TaN), titanium nitride (TiN) or aluminum nitride (AlN) that were deposited first. The thin films are characterized in terms of surface morphology, crystal structure, phase composition, critical temperature, residual resistance ratio (RRR) and RF-performance. We obtain thin films indicative of pure alpha-Ta for high temperature (600{\deg}C) sputtering directly on silicon and for Ta deposited on TaN or TiN seed layers. Coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator measurements show that the Ta deposited directly on the heated silicon substrate performs best with internal quality factors $Q_i$ reaching 1 x $10^6$ in the single-photon regime, measured at $T=100 {\space \rm mK}$.</description>

      <title>Constructing multicomponent cluster expansions with machine-learning and chemical embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster expansions are commonly employed as surrogate models to link the electronic structure of an alloy to its finite-temperature properties. Using cluster expansions to model materials with several alloying elements is challenging due to a rapid increase in the number of fitting parameters and training set size. We introduce the embedded cluster expansion (eCE) formalism that enables the parameterization of accurate on-lattice surrogate models for alloys containing several chemical species. The eCE model simultaneously learns a low dimensional embedding of site basis functions along with the weights of an energy model. A prototypical senary alloy comprised of elements in groups 5 and 6 of the periodic table is used to demonstrate that eCE models can accurately reproduce ordering energetics of complex alloys without a significant increase in model complexity. Further, eCE models can leverage similarities between chemical elements to efficiently extrapolate into compositional spaces that are not explicitly included in the training dataset. The eCE formalism presented in this study unlocks the possibility of employing cluster expansion models to study multicomponent alloys containing several alloying elements.</description>

      <title>Regression with Large Language Models for Materials and Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform material and molecular property regression tasks, a significant deviation from the conventional LLM use case. We benchmark the Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) 3 on several molecular properties in the QM9 dataset and 24 materials properties. Only composition-based input strings are used as the model input and we fine tune on only the generative loss. We broadly find that LLaMA 3, when fine-tuned using the SMILES representation of molecules, provides useful regression results which can rival standard materials property prediction models like random forest or fully connected neural networks on the QM9 dataset. Not surprisingly, LLaMA 3 errors are 5-10x higher than those of the state-of-the-art models that were trained using far more granular representation of molecules (e.g., atom types and their coordinates) for the same task. Interestingly, LLaMA 3 provides improved predictions compared to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o. This work highlights the versatility of LLMs, suggesting that LLM-like generative models can potentially transcend their traditional applications to tackle complex physical phenomena, thus paving the way for future research and applications in chemistry, materials science and other scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Cooperative dynamic polaronic picture of diamond color centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarons can control carrier mobility and can also be used in the design of quantum devices. Although much effort has been directed into investigating the nature of polarons, observation of defect-related polarons is challenging due to electron-defect scattering. Here we explore the polaronic behavior of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in a diamond crystal using an ultrafast pump-probe technique. A 10-fs optical pulse acts as a source of high electric field exceeding the dielectric breakdown threshold, in turn exerting a force on the NV charge distribution and polar optical phonons. The electronic and phononic responses are enhanced by an order of magnitude for a low density of NV centers, which we attribute to a combination of cooperative polaronic effects and scattering by defects. First-principles calculations support the presence of dipolar Fr\"ohlich interaction via non-zero Born effective charges. Our findings provide insights into the physics of color centers in diamonds.</description>

      <title>Performance of Exchange-Correlation Approximations to Density-Functional Theory for Rare-earth Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth oxides (REOs) are an important class of materials owing to their unique properties, including high ionic conductivities, large dielectric constants, and elevated melting temperatures, making them relevant to several technological applications such as catalysis, ionic conduction, and sensing. The ability to predict these properties at moderate computational cost is essential to guiding materials discovery and optimizing materials performance. Although density-functional theory (DFT) is the favored approach for predicting electronic and atomic structures, its accuracy is limited in describing strong electron correlation and localization inherent to REOs. The newly developed strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized-gradient approximations (meta-GGAs) promise improved accuracy in modeling these strongly correlated systems. We assess the performance of these meta-GGAs on binary REOs by comparing the numerical accuracy of thirteen exchange-correlation approximations in predicting structural, magnetic, and electronic properties. Hubbard U corrections for self-interaction errors and spin-orbit coupling are systematically considered. Our comprehensive assessment offers insights into the physical properties and functional performance of REOs predicted by first-principles and provides valuable guidance for selecting optimal DFT functionals for exploring these materials.</description>

      <title>Non-Monotonic Size-Dependent Exciton Radiative Lifetime in CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-halide perovskite nanocrystals have recently emerged as desirable optical materials for applications such as coherent quantum light emitters and solid-state laser cooling due to their short radiative lifetime and near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Here, we investigate the effect of CsPbBr3 nanocrystal size on the radiative lifetime under ambient conditions. High-quality nanocrystals, with monoexponential time-resolved photoluminescence decay behaviors, unveil a non-monotonic trend in radiative lifetime. This non-monotonicity appears to reflect a behavior common among II-VI (CdSe) and perovskites semiconducting nanocrystals. We find that large nanocrystals in the weak quantum confinement regime exhibit long radiative lifetimes due to a thermally accessible population of dim states. Small nanocrystals within the strong quantum confinement regime, surprisingly, also show long radiative lifetimes, due however to a substantial reduction in oscillator strength. Nanocrystals in the intermediate quantum confinement regime displays the shortest radiative lifetime, as their oscillator strength is enhanced relative to particles in the strong confinement regime, but do not have sufficient low-lying dim states like the large particles to counteract this affect. These findings shed light on the impact of nanocrystal size on radiative lifetime and pave the way for tailored optical materials in various optical applications.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric tuning of the valley polarized metal-semiconductor transition in Mn2P2S3Se3/Sc2CO2 van der Waals heterostructures and application to nonlinear Hall effect devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to promote the development of the next generation of nano-spintronic devices, it is of great significance to tune the freedom of valley in two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here, we propose a mechanism for manipulating the valley and nonlinear Hall effect by the 2D ferroelectric substrate. The monolayer Mn2P2S3Se3 is a robust antiferromagnetic valley polarized semiconductor. Importantly, the valley polarized metal-semiconductor phase transition of Mn2P2S3Se3 can be effectively tuned by switching the ferroelectric polarization of Sc2CO2. We reveal the microscopic mechanism of phase transition, which origins from the charge transfer and band alignment. Additionally, we find that transformed polarization direction of Sc2CO2 flexibly manipulate the Berry curvature dipole. Based on this discovery, we present the detection valley polarized metal-semiconductor transition by the nonlinear Hall effect devices. These findings not only offer a scheme to tune the valley degree of freedom, but also provide promising platform to design the nonlinear Hall effect devices.</description>

      <title>Influence of temperature and crack-tip speed on crack propagation in elastic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study the influence of temperature and the crack-tip velocity of the bond breaking at the crack tip in rubber-like materials. The bond breaking is considered as a stress-aided thermally activated process and result in an effective crack propagation energy which increases strongly with decreasing temperature or increasing crack-tip speed. This effect is particular important for adhesive (interfacial) crack propagation but less important for cohesive crack propagation owing to the much larger bond-breaking energies in the latter case. For adhesive cracks the theory results are consistent with adhesion measurements for silicone (PDMS) rubber in contact with silica glass surfaces. For cohesive cracks the theory agree well with experimental results PDMS films chemically bound to silinized glass.</description>

      <title>VQCrystal: Leveraging Vector Quantization for Discovery of Stable Crystal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering functional crystalline materials through computational methods remains a formidable challenge in materials science. Here, we introduce VQCrystal, an innovative deep learning framework that leverages discrete latent representations to overcome key limitations in current approaches to crystal generation and inverse design. VQCrystal employs a hierarchical VQ-VAE architecture to encode global and atom-level crystal features, coupled with a machine learning-based inter-atomic potential(IAP) model and a genetic algorithm to realize property-targeted inverse design. Benchmark evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate VQCrystal's advanced capabilities in representation learning and novel crystal discovery. Notably, VQCrystal achieves state-of-the-art performance with 91.93\% force validity and a Fr\'echet Distance of 0.152 on MP-20, indicating both strong validity and high diversity in the sampling process. To demonstrate real-world applicability, we apply VQCrystal for both 3D and 2D material design. For 3D materials, the density-functional theory validation confirmed that 63.04\% of bandgaps and 99\% of formation energies of the 56 filtered materials matched the target range. Moreover, 437 generated materials were validated as existing entries in the full database outside the training set. For the discovery of 2D materials, 73.91\% of 23 filtered structures exhibited high stability with formation energies below -1 eV/atom. Our results highlight VQCrystal's potential to accelerate the discovery of novel materials with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Investigating Ionic Diffusivity in Amorphous Solid Electrolytes using Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating Li$^+$ transport within the amorphous lithium phosphorous oxynitride (LiPON) framework, especially across a Li||LiPON interface, has proven challenging due to its amorphous nature and varying stoichiometry, necessitating large supercells and long timescales for computational models. Notably, machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can combine the computational speed of classical force fields with the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT), making them the ideal tool for modelling such amorphous materials. Thus, in this work, we train and validate the neural equivariant Interatomic potential (NequIP) framework on a comprehensive DFT-based dataset consisting of 13,454 chemically relevant structures to describe LiPON. With an optimized training (validation) energy and force mean absolute errors of 5.5 (6.1) meV/atom and 13.6 (13.2) meV/{\AA}, respectively, we employ the trained potential in model Li-transport in both bulk LiPON and across a Li||LiPON interface. Amorphous LiPON structures generated by the optimized potential do resemble those generated by ab initio molecular dynamics, with N being incorporated on non-bridging apical and bridging sites. Subsequent analysis of Li$^+$ diffusivity in the bulk LiPON structures indicates broad agreement with computational and experimental literature so far. Further, we investigate the anisotropy in Li$^+$ transport across the Li(110)||LiPON interface, where we observe Li-transport across the interface to be one order-of-magnitude slower than Li-motion within the bulk Li and LiPON phases. Nevertheless, we note that this anisotropy of Li-transport across the interface is minor and do not expect it to cause any significant impedance buildup. Finally, our work highlights the efficiency of MLIPs in enabling high-fidelity modelling of complex non-crystalline systems over large length and time scales.</description>

Abstract: Ferroelasticity describes a phenomenon in which a material exhibits two or more equally stable orientation variants and can be switched from one form to another under an applied stress. Recent works have demonstrated that two-dimensional layered organic$-$inorganic hybrid Ruddlesden$-$Popper perovskites can serve as ideal platforms for realizing ferroelasticity, however, the ferroelastic (FE) behavior of structures with a single octahedra layer such as (BA)$_2$PbI$_4$ (BA = CH$_3$(CH$_2$)$_3$NH$_3$$^+$) has remained elusive. Herein, by using a combined first-principles and metadynamics approach, the FE behavior of (BA)$_2$PbI$_4$ under mechanical and thermal stresses is uncovered. FE switching is mediated by cross-plane intermolecular coupling, which could occur through multiple rotational modes, rendering the formation of FE domains and several metastable paraelastic (PE) phases. Such metastable phases are akin to wrinkled structures in other layered materials and can act as a "funnel" of hole carriers. Thermal excitation tends to flatten the kinetic barriers of the transition pathways between orientation variants, suggesting an enhanced concentration of metastable PE states at high temperatures, while halogen mixing with Br raises these barriers and conversely lowers the concentration of PE states. These findings reveal the rich structural diversity of (BA)$_2$PbI$_4$ domains, which can play a vital role in enhancing the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite and raise exciting prospects for mechanical switching, shape memory, and information processing.</description>

      <title>Absence of itinerant ferromagnetism in a cobalt-based oxypnictide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a layered transition-metal-ordered oxypnictide Sr$_{2}$CrCoAsO$_{3}$. The new material was synthesized by solid-state reactions under vacuum. It has an intergrowth structure with a perovskite-like Sr$_3$Cr$_2$O$_6$ unit and ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type SrCo$_2$As$_2$ block stacking coherently along the crystallographic $c$ axis. The measurements of electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat indicate metallic conductivity from the CoAs layers and short-range antiferromagnetic ordering in the CrO$_{2}$ planes. No itinerant-electron ferromagnetism expected in CoAs layers is observed. This result, combined with the first-principles calculations and the previous reports of other CoAs-layer-based materials, suggests that the Co$-$Co bondlength plays a crucial role in the emergence of itinerant ferromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Absence of Anomalous Electron-Phonon Coupling in the Temperature Renormalization of the Gap of CsPbBr$_3$ Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites exhibit a fairly linear increase of the bandgap with increasing temperature, when crystallized in a tetragonal or cubic phase. In general, both thermal expansion and electron-phonon interaction effects contribute equally to this variation of the gap with temperature. Herein, we have disentangled both contributions in the case of colloidal CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals (NCs) by means of photoluminescence (PL) measurements as a function of temperature (from 80 K to ambient) and hydrostatic pressure (from atmospheric to ca. 1 GPa). At around room temperature, CsPbBr$_3$ NCs also show a linear increase of the bandgap with temperature with a slope similar to that of the archetypal methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI$_3$) perovskite. This is somehow unexpected in view of the recent observations in mixed-cation Cs$_x$MA$_{1-x}$PbI$_3$ single crystals with low Cs content, for which Cs incorporation caused a reduction by a factor of two in the temperature slope of the gap. This effect was ascribed to an anomalous electron-phonon interaction induced by the coupling with vibrational modes admixed with the Cs translational dynamics inside the cage voids. Thus, no trace of anomalous coupling is found in CsPbBr$_3$ NCs. In fact, we show that the linear temperature renormalization exhibited by the gap of CsPbBr$_3$ NCs is shared with most metal halide perovskites, due to a common bonding/antibonding and atomic orbital character of the electronic band-edge states. In this way, we provide a deeper understanding of the gap temperature dependence in the general case when the A-site cation dynamics is not involved in the electron-phonon interaction.</description>

      <title>The Potential of Geminate Pairs in Lead Halide Perovskite revealed via Time-resolved Photoluminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoluminescence (PL) under continuous illumination is commonly employed to assess voltage losses in solar energy conversion materials. However, the early temporal evolution of these losses remains poorly understood. Therefore, we extend the methodology to time-resolved PL, introducing the concepts of geminate PL, doping PL, and sibling PL to quantify the transient chemical potential of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and key optoelectronic properties. Analyzing the initial PL amplitudes reveals hot charge carrier separation for around 100 nm and is likely limited by the grain size of the triple cation perovskite. The following PL decay is caused by the diffusive separation of non-excitonic geminate pairs and time-resolves a fundamental yet often overlooked energy loss by increasing entropy. For triple-cation halide perovskite, we measure a "geminate correlation energy" of up to 90 meV, persisting for ~ten nanoseconds. This energy is unutilized in standard solar cells and is considered lost in the Shockley-Queisser model. Therefore, this geminate energy could substantially enhance the device's efficiency, particularly under maximum power point and low-illumination conditions.</description>

      <title>The resistivity of rare earth impurities diluted in Lanthanum (Part I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the temperature independent resistivity of rare-earth magnetic (Gd, Tb, Dy) and non-magnetic (Lu) impurities diluted in dhcp Lanthanum. We considered a two-band system where the conduction is entirely due to $s$-electrons while the screening of the charge difference induced by the impurity is made by the $d$-electrons. We obtain an expression of the resistivity using the $T$-matrix formalism from the Dyson equation. As the electronic properties depend strongly on the band structure, we have considered two types of bands structure, a "parabolic" band and a more realistic one calculated by first principles with VASP. We verify that the exchange parameters appearing as cross products strongly affect the magnitude of the spin resistivity term; And that the role of the band structure in resonant scattering or virtual bound states, depends on the band structure. Our study, also includes the influence of the translational symmetry breaking and the excess charge introduced by the {\it rare-earth} impurity on the resitivity.</description>

      <title>LaB6 aided spontaneous conversion of bulk graphite into carbon nanotubes at normal atmospheric conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herein, we report a case study in which we saw the spontaneous conversion of commercial bulk graphite into LaB6 decorated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) under normal atmospheric conditions. The feedstock graphite was used as a hollow cylindrical anode filled with LaB6 powder and partially eroded in a DC electric-arc plasma reactor in pure nitrogen atmosphere. An unusual and spontaneous deformation of the plasma-treated residual anode into a fluffy powder was seen to continue for months when left to ambient atmospheric conditions. The existence of LaB6 decorated multi-walled CNTs at large quantity was confirmed in the as-generated powder by using electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. The as-synthesized CNT-based large-area field emitter showed promising field-emitting properties with a low turn-on electric field of ~1.5 V per micrometer, and a current density of ~1.17 mA per square cm at an applied electric field of 3.24 V per micrometer.</description>

      <title>Multi-Physics Modeling Of Phase Change Memory Operations in Ge-rich Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most widely used active materials for phase-change memories (PCM), the ternary stoichiometric compound Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ (GST), has a low crystallization temperature of around 150$^\circ$C. One solution to achieve higher operating temperatures is to enrich GST with additional germanium (GGST). This alloy crystallizes into a polycrystalline mixture of two phases, GST and almost pure germanium. In a previous work [R. Bayle et al., J. Appl. Phys. 128, 185101 (2020)], this crystallization process was studied using a multi-phase field model (MPFM) with a simplified thermal field calculated by a separate solver. Here, we combine the MPFM and a phase-aware electro-thermal solver to achieve a consistent multi-physics model for device operations in PCM. Simulations of memory operations are performed to demonstrate its ability to reproduce experimental observations and the most important calibration curves that are used to assess the performance of a PCM cell.</description>

      <title>Complexities in the growth and stabilization of polar phase in the Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ thin films grown by Pulsed Laser Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the discovery of ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ based thin films a decade ago, ferroelectric Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ (HZO) thin films are frequently being utilized in the CMOS (Complementary Metal- Oxide Semiconductor) and logic devices, thanks to their large remnant polarization, high retention and endurance. A great deal of effort has been made towards understanding the origin of ferroelectricity in epitaxial HZO thin films and controlling the microstructure at the atomic level which governs the ferroelectric phase. Nevertheless, the HZO films still suffer from fundamental questions, such as (1) the vagueness of interfacial mechanisms between HZO, buffer layer and the substrate which controls the polar phase; (2) the nature of the metastable polar phase responsible for the ferroelectricity, be it orthorhombic or rhombohedral; which are poorly understood. Here, we have addressed these issues by employing the in-situ reflection high energy electron diffraction -- assisted pulsed laser deposition and mapping the asymmetrical polar maps on high quality HZO films grown on functional perovskite oxide substrates. The interface between La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) and the substrate is shown to be quite important, and a slightly rougher interface of the former destabilizes the ferroelectric phase of HZO irrespective of well-controlled growth of the ferroelectric layers. A rhombohedral-like symmetry of HZO unit cell is extracted through the x-ray diffraction asymmetrical polar maps. The ferroelectric measurements on a nearly 7 nm HZO film on STO(001) substrate display a remnant polarization close to 8 uC/cm$^2$. These results highlight the complexities involved at the atomic scale interface in the binary oxides thin films and can be of importance to the HfO$_2$-based ferroelectric community which is still at its infancy.</description>

      <title>Role of Zr in Cu-rich single-phase and nanocomposite Cu-Zr: molecular dynamics and experimental study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-equilibrium atom-by-atom growth of Cu-rich Cu-Zr thin films has been investigated by a combination of magnetron sputter deposition and molecular dynamics simulations. We focus on the role of Zr in the transition from large solid solution crystals through a nanocomposite (around ~5 at.% Zr) to a metallic glass. We find, contrary to the assumption based on equilibrium phase diagram, that in this nonequilibrium case most of the grain refinement and most of the hardness enhancement (from 2.5-3 to 4-5 GPa) takes place in the compositional range (up to ~3 at.% Zr) where many or even most Zr atoms (depending on the sputtering regime) are in the supersaturated solid solution rather than at the grain boundaries. The results are important for the design and understanding of technologically important nanostructured metallic films. In parallel, from the methodology point of view, the results include an early example of modelling the atom-by-atom nanocomposite growth.</description>

      <title>A Journey with THeSeuSS: Automated Python Tool for Modeling IR and Raman Vibrational Spectra of Molecules and Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational spectroscopy is an indispensable analytical tool that provides structural fingerprints for molecules, solids, and interfaces thereof. This study introduces THeSeuSS (THz Spectra Simulations Software) - an automated computational platform that efficiently simulates IR and Raman spectra for both periodic and non-periodic systems. Utilizing DFT and DFTB, THeSeuSS offers robust capabilities for detailed vibrational spectra simulations. Our extensive evaluations and benchmarks demonstrate that THeSeuSS accurately reproduces both previously calculated and experimental spectra, enabling precise comparisons and interpretations of vibrational features across various test cases, including H2O and glycine molecules in the gas phase, as well as solid ammonia and solid ibuprofen. Designed with a user-friendly interface and seamless integration with existing computational chemistry tools, THeSeuSS enhances the accessibility and applicability of advanced spectroscopic simulations, supporting research and development in chemical, pharmaceutical, and material sciences. Future updates aim to expand its methodological diversity by incorporating machine learning techniques to analyze larger and more complex systems, solidifying THeSeuSS's role as an essential tool in the computational chemist's arsenal.</description>

      <title>Structure, magnetic properties, and cycloidal spin ordering in Nd-doped BiFeO$_3$ synthesized by sol-gel method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the structural and magnetic properties of Nd-doped BiFeO$_3$ materials with the formula Bi$_{1-x}$Nd$_x$FeO$_3$ $(x = 0 - 0.2)$ were investigated. Samples were prepared using the sol-gel method and annealed at 823 K for 4 hours. Microstructural studies indicated that nanomaterials with an average grain size of less than 100 nm were produced, with the smallest grain size observed for the solid solution with $x = 0.15$. Rietveld analysis of diffraction patterns revealed a composition-driven transformation from the rhombohedral $(R3c)$ lattice to the orthorhombic $(Pbam)$ structure. The above finding is correlated to M\"ossbauer spectroscopy data, which demonstrated the gradual destruction of the spin cycloid due to the structural transformation to the $Pbam$ structure. The spectra were analyzed using a complex hyperfine magnetic field distribution model reflecting cycloidal spin ordering. Scanning differential calorimetry revealed that for the investigated materials the magnetic ordering temperatures are close to 640 K, independently from the Nd concentration. Magnetic measurements showed the emergence of weak ferromagnetic properties with increasing Nd ions concentration, consistently with M\"ossbauer spectroscopy data.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the structural, mechanical, and electronic properties of novel two-dimensional (2D) pentaoctite (PO) monolayers composed of group-IV elements (PO-C, PO-Si, PO-Ge, and PO-Sn) using first-principles calculations. Stability is explored through phonon spectra and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, confirming that all proposed structures are dynamically and thermally stable. Mechanical analysis shows that PO-C monolayers exhibit exceptional rigidity, while the others demonstrate greater flexibility, making them suitable for applications in foldable materials. The electronic properties show semimetallic behavior for PO-C and metallic behavior for PO-Si, while PO-Ge and PO-Sn possess narrow band gaps, positioning them as promising candidates for semiconductor applications. Additionally, PO-C exhibits potential as an efficient catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with strain engineering further enhancing its catalytic performance. These findings suggest a wide range of technological applications, from nanoelectronics and nanomechanics to metal-free catalysis in sustainable energy production.</description>

      <title>FEAST nonlinear eigenvalue algorithm for $GW$ quasiparticle equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of Green's function in quantum many-body theory often leads to nonlinear eigenvalue problems, as Green's function needs to be defined in energy domain. The $GW$ approximation method is one of the typical examples. In this article, we introduce a method based on the FEAST eigenvalue algorithm for accurately solving the nonlinear eigenvalue $G_0W_0$ quasiparticle equation, eliminating the need for the Kohn-Sham wavefunction approximation. Based on the contour integral method for nonlinear eigenvalue problem, the energy (eigenvalue) domain is extended to complex plane. Hypercomplex number is introduced to the contour deformation calculation of $GW$ self-energy to carry imaginary parts of both Green's functions and FEAST quadrature nodes. Calculation results for various molecules are presented and compared with a more conventional graphical solution approximation method. It is confirmed that the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) from the Kohn-Sham equation is very close to that of $GW$, while the Least Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) shows noticeable differences.</description>

Abstract: In some models, periodic configurations can be shown to be stable under, both, global $\ell^2$ or local perturbations. This is not the case for aperiodic media. The specific class of aperiodic media we are interested, in arise from taking two 2D periodic crystals and stacking them parallel at a relative twist. In periodic media, phonons are generalized eigenvectors for a stability operator acting on $\ell^2$, coming from a mechanical energy. The goal of our analysis is to provide phonons in the given class of aperiodic media with meaning. As rigorously established for the 1D Frenkel-Kontorova model and previously applied by one of the authors, we assume that we can parametrize minimizing lattice deformations w.r.t. local perturbations via continuous stacking-periodic functions, for which we previously derived a continuous energy density functional. Such (continuous) energy densities are analytically and computationally much better accessible compared to discrete energy functionals. In order to pass to an $\ell^2$-based energy functional, we also study the offset energy w.r.t. given lattice deformations, under $\ell^1$-perturbations. Our findings show that, in the case of an undeformed bilayer heterostructure, while the energy density can be shown to be stable under the assumption of stability of individual layers, the offset energy fails to be stable in the case of twisted bilayer graphene. We then establish conditions for stability and instability of the offset energy w.r.t. the relaxed lattice. Finally, we show that, in the case of incommensurate bilayer homostructures, i.e., two equal layers, if we choose minimizing deformations according to the global energy density above, the offset energy is stable in the limit of zero twist angle. Consequently, in this case, one can then define phonons as generalized eigenvectors w.r.t. the stability operator associated with the offset energy.</description>

      <title>On the negative capacitance in ferroelectric heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negative capacitance can be used to overcome the lower limit of subthreshold swing (SS) in field effect transistors (FETs), enabling ultralow-power microelectronics, though the concept of ferroelectric negative capacitance remains contentious. In this work, we analyze the negative capacitance in ferroelectric/dielectric heterostructure rigorously using Landau-Denvonshire theory, identifying three (one) critical dielectric thicknesses for first (second) order ferroelectric phase transition upon which the stability of negative capacitance changes. A critical electric window is also identified, beyond which the ferroelectric negative capacitance cannot be maintained. Between the first and second critical thicknesses, meta-stable negative capacitance exists near zero polarization, yet it will be lost and cannot be recovered when the electric window is broken. Between the second and third critical thicknesses, stable negative capacitance always exists near zero polarization within the electric window regardless of initial polar state, resulting in hysteretic double P-E loop. Beyond the third (first) critical thickness of first (second) order phase transition, P-E loop becomes hysteresis free, though the spontaneous polarization can still be induced at sufficient large electric field. Singularities in the effective dielectric constant is also observed at the critical thickness or electric field. The analysis demonstrates that the negative capacitance of ferroelectric can be stabilized by linear dielectric within a critical electric window, and the negative capacitance can be either hysteresis free or hysteretic for first order ferroelectrics, while it is always hysteresis free for the second order ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Helicity controlled spin Hall angle in the 2D Rashba altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the efficiency of charge-to-spin conversion in two-dimensional Rashba altermagnets, a class of materials that merge characteristics of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Utilizing quantum linear response theory, we quantify the longitudinal and spin Hall conductivities in this system and demonstrate that a substantial enhancement of the spin Hall angle is achieved below the band crossing point through the dual effects of relativistic spin-orbit interaction and nonrelativistic altermagnetic exchange interaction. Additionally, we find that skew scattering and topology-related intrinsic mechanisms are almost negligible in this system, which contrasts with conventional ferromagnetic Rashba systems. Our findings not only advance the understanding of spin dynamics in Rashba altermagnets but also pave the way for novel strategies in manipulating charge-to-spin conversion via the sophisticated control of noncollinear in-plane and collinear out-of-plane spin textures.</description>

      <title>Giant anisotropic anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnetic topological metal NdGaSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between magnetism and strong electron correlation in magnetic materials discerns a variety of intriguing topological features. Here, we report a systematic investigation of the magnetic, thermodynamic, and electrical transport properties in NdGaSi single crystals. The magnetic measurements reveal a magnetic ordering below T_N (11 K), with spins aligning antiferromagnetically in-plane, and it orders ferromagnetically (FM) out-of-plane. The longitudinal resistivity data and heat capacity exhibit a significant anomaly as a consequence of the magnetic ordering at TN. The magnetoresistance study shows significantly different behavior when measured along either direction, resulting from the complex nature of the magnetic structure, stemming from complete saturation of moments in one direction and subsequent spin flop transitions in the other. Remarkably, we have also noticed an unusual anisotropic anomalous Hall response. We have observed a giant anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 1730 ohm-1 cm-1 and 490 ohm-1 cm-1 at 2 K, with B // [001] and B // [100], respectively. Our scaling analysis of AHC reveals that the anomalous Hall effect in the studied compound is dominated by the Berry phase-driven intrinsic mechanism. These astonishing findings in NdGaSi open up new possibilities for antiferromagnetic spintronics in rare-earth-based intermetallic compounds.</description>

      <title>SeeBand: A highly efficient, interactive tool for analyzing electronic transport data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linking the fundamental physics of band structure and scattering theory with macroscopic features such as measurable bulk thermoelectric transport properties is indispensable to a thorough understanding of transport phenomena and ensures more targeted and efficient experimental research. Here, we introduce SeeBand, a highly efficient and interactive fitting tool based on Boltzmann transport theory. A fully integrated user interface and visualization tool enable real-time comparison and connection between the electronic band structure (EBS) and microscopic transport properties. It allows simultaneous analysis of data for the Seebeck coefficient $S$, resistivity $\rho$ and Hall coefficient $R_\text{H}$ to identify suitable EBS models and extract the underlying microscopic material parameters and additional information from the model. Crucially, the EBS can be obtained by directly fitting the temperature-dependent properties of a single sample, which goes beyond previous approaches that look into doping dependencies. Finally, the combination of neural-network-assisted initial guesses and an efficient subsequent fitting routine allows for a rapid processing of big datasets, facilitating high-throughput analyses to identify underlying, yet undiscovered dependencies, thereby guiding material design.</description>

      <title>Mimicking synaptic plasticity with wedged Pt/Co/Pt spin-orbit torque device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We fabricated a wedge-shaped Pt/Co/Pt device with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and manifested that the Co magnetization can be solely switched by spin-orbit torque without any magnetic field. Similar to the synaptic weight, we observed that the state of Co magnetization (presented by the anomalous Hall resistance RH) of the wedged Pt/Co/Pt device can be tuned continuously with a large number of nonvolatile levels by applied pulse currents. Furthermore, we studied the synaptic plasticity of the wedged Pt/Co/Pt device, including the excitatory postsynaptic potentials or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials and spiking-time-dependent plasticity. The work elucidates the promise of the wedged Pt/Co/Pt device as a candidate for a new type of artificial synaptic device that is induced by a spin current and paves a substantial pathway toward the combination of spintronics and synaptic devices.</description>

      <title>Photoactivation of color centers induced by laser irradiation in ion-implanted diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Split-vacancy color centers in diamond are promising solid state platforms for the implementation of photonic quantum technologies. These luminescent defects are commonly fabricated upon low energy ion implantation and subsequent thermal annealing. Their technological uptake will require the availability of reliable methods for the controlled, large scale production of localized individual photon emitters. This task is partially achieved by controlled ion implantation to introduce selected impurities in the host material, and requires the development of challenging beam focusing or collimation procedures coupled with single-ion detection techniques. We report on protocol for the direct optical activation of split-vacancy color centers in diamond via localized processing with continuous wave laser at mW optical powers. We demonstrate the activation of photoluminescent Mg- and Sn-related centers at both the ensemble and single-photon emitter level in ion-implanted, high-purity diamond crystals without further thermal processing. The proposed lithographic method enables the activation of individual color centers at specific positions of a large area sample by means of a relatively inexpensive equipment offering the real-time, in situ monitoring of the process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Langevin dynamics simulations are used to analyze the static and dynamic properties of an XY model adapted to dimers forming on Si(001) surfaces. The numerics utilise high-performance parallel computation methods on GPUs. The static exponent $\nu$ of the symmetry-broken XY model is determined to $\nu = 1.04$. The dynamic critical exponent $z$ is determined to $z=2.13$ and, together with $\nu$, shows the behavior of the Ising universality class. For time-dependent temperatures, we observe frozen domains and compare their size distribution with predictions from Kibble-Zurek theory. We determine a significantly larger quench exponent that shows little dependence on the damping or the symmetry-breaking field.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Phase Diagram of ErB$_4$ as Explored by Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tetragonal $4f$-electron intermetallic ErB$_4$ is characterized by strong Ising anisotropy along the tetragonal $c$ axis. The magnetic moments on the erbium sites can be mapped onto a Shastry-Sutherland (SSL) lattice resulting in geometrical frustration. At zero magnetic field ErB$_4$ exhibits collinear columnar antiferromagnetic (CAFM) order below $T_\text{N} = 15.4$ K. In the presence of a magnetic field parallel to the $c$ axis, ErB$_4$ exhibits a plateau at $1/2$ of the saturation magnetization $M_\text{S}$, which arises at a spin flip transition at $H_1$ $=$ 1.9 T. Fractional magnetization plateaus and other exotic spin phases are a well-established characteristic feature of frustrated spin systems. Monte Carlo simulations propose that ErB$_4$ is an ideal candidate to feature a spin supersolid phase in close vicinity of $H_1$ between the CAFM and $M/M_\text{S}=1/2$ plateau (HP) phase. Here we combine single-crystal neutron diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering to study the magnetic phase diagram and the crystal electric field (CEF) ground state of ErB$_4$. Our measurements as a function of magnetic field find no signature of the spin supersolid phase but allow us to determine the magnetic structure of the HP phase to be of the uuud type consistent with an Ising material. The magnetic moment $\mu_{\mathrm{CEF}}$ $=$ 8.96 $\mu_B$ expected from the CEF configuration determined by our inelastic neutron scattering measurements is also consistent with the ordered moment observed in neutron diffraction showing that the moments are fully ordered and close to the Er$^{3+}$ free ion moment (9.6 $\mu_B$).</description>

Abstract: The effect of Diabatisation is reported in the excited argon isomers using the Diatomic-In-Molecules (DIM) method. In previous work using DIM, the lowest energy isomers of Ar$_N^*$ were shown as Ar$_3^*-$Ar$_{N-3}$, however, using the Hole-Particle-Psedopotential (HPP) method, it was shown that the excitation is localised over dimer not trimer; Ar$_2^*-$Ar$_{N-2}$. In this work we improve the DIM calculations by including previously ignored strongly avoided crossing between 3p4s and 3p4p $^{1,3}\Sigma$ states.</description>

      <title>Learning local and semi-local density functionals from exact exchange-correlation potentials and energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding accurate exchange-correlation (XC) functionals remains the defining challenge in density functional theory (DFT). Despite 40 years of active development, the desired chemical accuracy is still elusive with existing functionals. We present a data-driven pathway to learn the XC functionals by utilizing the exact density, XC energy, and XC potential. While the exact densities are obtained from accurate configuration interaction (CI), the exact XC energies and XC potentials are obtained via inverse DFT calculations on the CI densities. We demonstrate how simple neural network (NN) based local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA), trained on just five atoms and two molecules, provide remarkable improvement in total energies, densities, atomization energies, and barrier heights for hundreds of molecules outside the training set. Particularly, the NN-based GGA functional attains similar accuracy as the higher rung SCAN meta-GGA, highlighting the promise of using the XC potential in modeling XC functionals. We expect this approach to pave the way for systematic learning of increasingly accurate and sophisticated XC functionals.</description>

      <title>Intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, which has been discovered experimentally in Han $et$ $al$ arXiv:2408.15233. We construct a minimal model for the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity, assuming a simplified anisotropic interaction that depends only on the angle between the incoming and outgoing momenta. Despite the absence of Fermi surface nesting, we show that the superconductivity appears near the Van Hove singularity with the maximal $T_c$ near a bifurcation point of the peaks in the density of states. We identify the topological $p+ip$, topological $h+ih$, and the non-topological nodal $f$-wave pairings as the possible states, which are all pair density wave orders due to the intravalley nature. Furthermore, these pair density wave orders require a finite attractive threshold for superconductivity, resulting in narrow superconducting regions, consistent with experimental findings. We discuss the possible pairing mechanisms and point out that the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism is a plausible explanation for the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in the rhombohedral tetralayer graphene.</description>

Abstract: We investigated the interlayer coupling effect in homobilayer structures of MSi2X4 with M = Mo/W and X = N/P/As. Through the combination of first-principles calculations and analytical formulations, the equilibrium interlayer distance, layer energy difference and interlayer hopping strength are obtained for all six MSi2X4 materials, which are found to be insensitive to the type of M atom but differ significantly between X = N and X = P/As. In homobilayers with close to 0{\deg} twist angles, the interlayer charge redistribution introduces a stacking-dependent interlayer electrostatic potential with a magnitude reaching 0.1 eV in MSi2N4, suggesting that it can be an excellent candidate for studying the sliding ferroelectricity. The interlayer hopping strengths are found to be as large as several tens meV at valence band maxima positions K and {\Gamma}, and ~ 1 meV at the conduction band edge K. The resultant layer-hybridizations vary in a large range under different stacking registries, which can be used to simulate honeycomb lattice models with both trivial and non-trivial band topologies.</description>

Abstract: Dielectrics are crucial for technologies like flash memory, CPUs, photovoltaics, and capacitors, but public data on these materials are scarce, restricting research and development. Existing machine learning models have focused on predicting scalar polycrystalline dielectric constants, neglecting the directional nature of dielectric tensors essential for material design. This study leverages multi-rank equivariant structural embeddings from a universal neural network potential to enhance predictions of dielectric tensors. We develop an equivariant readout decoder to predict total, electronic, and ionic dielectric tensors while preserving O(3) equivariance, and benchmark its performance against state-of-the-art algorithms. Virtual screening of thermodynamically stable materials from Materials Project for two discovery tasks, high-dielectric and highly anisotropic materials, identifies promising candidates including Cs2Ti(WO4)3 (band gap $E_g=2.93 \mathrm{eV}$, dielectric constant $\varepsilon=180.90$) and CsZrCuSe3 (anisotropic ratio $\alpha_r = 121.89$). The results demonstrate our model's accuracy in predicting dielectric tensors and its potential for discovering novel dielectric materials.</description>

Abstract: Diffraction is the most common method to solve for unknown or partially known crystal structures. However, it remains a challenge to determine the crystal structure of a new material that may have nanoscale size or heterogeneities. Here we train an architecture of hierarchical random forest models capable of predicting the crystal system, space group, and lattice parameters from one or more unknown 2D electron diffraction patterns. Our initial model correctly identifies the crystal system of a simulated electron diffraction pattern from a 20 nm thick specimen of arbitrary orientation 67% of the time. We achieve a topline accuracy of 79% when aggregating predictions from 10 patterns of the same material but different zone axes. The space group and lattice predictions range from 70-90% accuracy and median errors of 0.01-0.5 angstroms, respectively, for cubic, hexagonal, trigonal and tetragonal crystal systems while being less reliable on orthorhombic and monoclinic systems. We apply this architecture to a 4D-STEM scan of gold nanoparticles, where it accurately predicts the crystal structure and lattice constants. These random forest models can be used to significantly accelerate the analysis of electron diffraction patterns, particularly in the case of unknown crystal structures. Additionally, due to the speed of inference, these models could be integrated into live TEM experiments, allowing real-time labeling of a specimen.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Field-Like Spin-Torques in CrPt$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological semimetal CrPt$_3$ has potential for generating unconventional spin torques due to its ferrimagnetic ordering, topological band structure, and high anomalous Hall effect. CrPt$_3$ exhibits ferrimagnetic behavior only in its chemically ordered phase and is paramagnetic in its chemically disordered phase. By controlling the growth and annealing temperatures, epitaxial films of both chemically ordered and disordered phases of CrPt$_3$ are prepared allowing us to investigate the role of magnetic ordering on unconventional torque generation. We use angle dependent spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance and second harmonic Hall measurements to probe the spin torques generated from epitaxial CrPt$_3$ in CrPt$_3$/Cu/Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$ heterostructures. With current applied along specific directions with respect to the crystal order we reveal unconventional spin torques in both ordered and disordered films. When current flows parallel to the $[1\overline{1}1]$ and $[\overline{1}11]$ directions we observe an unconventional field-like torque that is opposite in sign for the two directions. Our calculations reveal that this unconventional torque originates from an indirect nonlocal spin-orbit torque due to spin scattering at the CrPt$_3$/Cu interface, in addition to symmetry breaking at this interface.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humanity has long sought inspiration from nature to innovate materials and devices. As science advances, nature-inspired materials are becoming part of our lives. Animate materials, characterized by their activity, adaptability, and autonomy, emulate properties of living systems. While only biological materials fully embody these principles, artificial versions are advancing rapidly, promising transformative impacts across various sectors. This roadmap presents authoritative perspectives on animate materials across different disciplines and scales, highlighting their interdisciplinary nature and potential applications in diverse fields including nanotechnology, robotics and the built environment. It underscores the need for concerted efforts to address shared challenges such as complexity management, scalability, evolvability, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical and environmental considerations. The framework defined by classifying materials based on their level of animacy can guide this emerging field encouraging cooperation and responsible development. By unravelling the mysteries of living matter and leveraging its principles, we can design materials and systems that will transform our world in a more sustainable manner.</description>

      <title>Revealing the molecular structures of a-Al2O3(0001)-water interface by machine learning based computational vibrational spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid-water interfaces are crucial to many physical and chemical processes and are extensively studied using surface-specific sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy. To establish clear correlations between specific spectral signatures and distinct interfacial water structures, theoretical calculations using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are required. These MD simulations typically need relatively long trajectories (a few nanoseconds) to achieve reliable SFG response function calculations via the dipole-polarizability time correlation function. However, the requirement for long trajectories limits the use of computationally expensive techniques such as ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations, particularly for complex solid-water interfaces. In this work, we present a pathway for calculating vibrational spectra (IR, Raman, SFG) of solid-water interfaces using machine learning (ML)-accelerated methods. We employ both the dipole moment-polarizability correlation function and the surface-specific velocity-velocity correlation function approaches to calculate SFG spectra. Our results demonstrate the successful acceleration of AIMD simulations and the calculation of SFG spectra using ML methods. This advancement provides an opportunity to calculate SFG spectra for the complicated solid-water systems more rapidly and at a lower computational cost with the aid of ML.</description>

      <title>Targeting the partition function of chemically disordered materials with a generative approach based on inverse variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing atomic-scale properties of chemically disordered materials requires an efficient exploration of their vast configuration space. Traditional approaches such as Monte Carlo or Special Quasirandom Structures either entail sampling an excessive amount of configurations or do not ensure that the configuration space has been properly covered. In this work, we propose a novel approach where generative machine learning is used to yield a representative set of configurations for accurate property evaluation and provide accurate estimations of atomic-scale properties with minimal computational cost. Our method employs a specific type of variational autoencoder with inverse roles for the encoder and decoder, enabling the application of an unsupervised active learning scheme that does not require any initial training database. The model iteratively generates configuration batches, whose properties are computed with conventional atomic-scale methods. These results are then fed back into the model to estimate the partition function, repeating the process until convergence. We illustrate our approach by computing point-defect formation energies and concentrations in (U, Pu)O2 mixed-oxide fuels. In addition, the ML model provides valuable insights into the physical factors influencing the target property. Our method is generally applicable to explore other properties, such as atomic-scale diffusion coefficients, in ideally or non-ideally disordered materials like high-entropy alloys.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Compute-In-Memory on Field-Programmable Ferroelectric Diodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.05259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deluge of sensors and data generating devices has driven a paradigm shift in modern computing from arithmetic-logic centric to data-centric processing. Data-centric processing require innovations at device level to enable novel compute-in-memory (CIM) operations. A key challenge in construction of CIM architectures is the conflicting trade-off between the performance and their flexibility for various essential data operations. Here, we present a transistor-free CIM architecture that permits storage, search and neural network operations on sub-50nm thick Aluminum Scandium Nitride ferroelectric diodes (FeDs). Our circuit designs and devices can be directly integrated on top of Silicon microprocessors in a scalable process. By leveraging the field-programmability, non-volatility and non-linearity of FeDs, search operations are demonstrated with a cell footprint &lt; 0.12 um2 when projected onto 45-nm node technology. We further demonstrate neural network operations with 4-bit operation using FeDs. Our results highlight FeDs as candidates for efficient and multifunctional CIM platforms.</description>

      <title>Second-order nonlocal shifts of scattered wave-packets: What can be measured by Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00375v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scattering of wavepackets with arbitrary energy dispersion on surfaces has been analyzed. Expanding up to second order in scattering shifts, it is found that besides the known Goos-H\"anchen or Imbert-Fedorov spatial offset, as well as the Wigner delay time, new momentum and frequency shifts appear. Furthermore, the width of the scattered wave packet becomes modified as well, which can lead to a shrinking of pulses by multiple scattering. For a model of dielectric material characterized by a longitudinal and transverse dielectric function the shifts are calculated analytically. From the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts one can access the longitudinal and transversal dielectric function. Perfectly aligned crystal symmetry axes with respect to scattering beam shows no Imbert-Fedorov effect. It is found that the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effect are absent for homogeneous materials. Oppositely it is found that the Wigner delay time and the shrinking of the temporal pulse width allows to access the dielectric function independent on the beam geometry.</description>

      <title>Preventing overfitting in infrared ellipsometry using temperature dependence: fused silica as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dispersive linear optical properties of materials are frequently described using oscillator models, where the oscillators represent interactions between light and various material resonances (vibrational, free-carrier, interband, etc.). The state-of-the-art measurement of the complex refractive index is variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), where additional measurement angles and the measured depolarization of light provides much more information compared to simpler measurements such as single-angle reflectance and transmittance. Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art VASE data can be hard to uniquely fit using oscillator models, and the resulting models may be hard to interpret physically. Here, we demonstrate the use of an additional degree of freedom, temperature, to improve the accuracy, uniqueness, and physicality of oscillator models of materials. Our approach relies on the well-understood temperature dependence of material resonances, and in particular vibrational resonances in amorphous SiO2, which are expected to change monotonically from room temperature to hundreds of degrees C. We performed VASE measurements at different temperatures, independently fitted the data at each temperature, and then confirmed that our models are unique and physical by monitoring the temperature dependence of the resulting fitting parameters. Using this technique, we generated highly accurate and precise data sets and material models describing the mid-infrared complex refractive index of three different grades of fused SiO2, which can then be used for modeling of mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.</description>
