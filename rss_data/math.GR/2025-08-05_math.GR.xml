      <title>The Order of the Monster Finite Simple Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the order of the largest of the twenty-six sporadic simple groups known as the Monster, using a straightforward computational approach. The Monster is here defined as a subgroup of the symmetry group of the 196884-dimensional Griess algebra generated by a group of type $2^{1+24}_+.Co_1$ and an additional triality automorphism. Our approach is based on counting arguments for certain idempotents of the Griess algebra called axes. Our proof is self-contained, requiring only established properties of the Conway group as the automorphism group of the Leech lattice, and some of its subgroups.
  Although our approach is conceptually simple, it requires extensive calculation inside a 196884-dimensional matrix group that current computer algebra systems cannot easily handle directly. Instead, we use the software package mmgroup, developed by the second author, which supports fast calculations inside the Monster. To our knowledge, this paper contains the first self-contained computation of the order of the Monster.
  The Monster also acts on the Moonshine module V^#, which is a vertex operator algebra of central charge c=24. We provide a new proof that the Monster is the full automorphism group of the Griess algebra and of the Moonshine module using Borcherds' proof of the Monstrous Moonshine conjectures. In addition, we show that the Monster has exactly two conjugacy classes of involutions. The order of the Baby Monster, the second largest of the sporadic simple groups, is also determined.</description>

      <title>Cyclic orders and actions of Leary--Minasyan groups on coarse $\mathrm{PD}(n)$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for $n \geq 3$, there are torsion-free CAT(0) groups with visual boundaries that embed into $S^n$ but which are not virtually the fundamental group of a compact aspherical $n+1$-manifold. The groups are the CAT(0) and not bi-automatic groups constructed previously by Leary and Minasyan. The obstruction comes from analyzing certain cyclic orders on the boundary of the Bass-Serre tree, in the same manner as Kapovich-Kleiner ruled out actions of Baumslag-Solitar groups on coarse $\mathrm{PD}(3)$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Power Graph Classes and Overfullness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the edge-coloring number of the power graph of a finite group. We characterize which finite groups have overfull power graphs, showing that this occurs if and only if the group is cyclic of odd prime power order. We then show that this classsifies the class of power graphs: The power graph of a finite group is Class 2 if and only if the group is cyclic of odd prime power order.</description>

      <title>Embedding ample semigroups as (2,1,1)-subalgebras of inverse semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01949v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of embedding an ample semigroup in an inverse semigroup as a (2, 1, 1)-type subalgebra is known to be undecidable. In this article, we investigate the problem for certain classes of ample semigroups. We also give examples of semigroups that are left (respectively, right) but not right (respectively, left) ample.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify the structure of subgroups generated by conjugate graph automorphisms of order $3$ of $O_8^+(2)$ and $O_8^+(3)$. As a result, we obtain a correction to a paper by S. Guest which, in turn, plays an important role in proving the solvable analogue of the Baer--Suzuki theorem.</description>

      <title>Irreducible finite-index representations of automorphism groups of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a locally finite tree T where every vertex has degree &gt;= 3, and a closed noncompact subgroup G of the automorphism group Aut(T), with Tits' independence property (P) and with transitive action on the boundary of the tree. We show that G does not have continuous irreducible representations to a locally convex topological vector space over R, C or H that preserve a continuous nondegenerate sesquilinear form of index p &gt; 1. As the representations of index 1 are already classified, this gives a complete classification of continuous irreducible representations of G that preserve a continuous nondegenerate sesquilinear form of finite index.</description>

      <title>Topological Full Groups of Irreducible Edge Shifts have Solvable Conjugacy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve the conjugacy problem for Topological Full Groups of Irreducible Edge Shifts, introduced by Matui in 2015 and later recontextualized as groups of almost automorphisms of trees by Lederle in 2020. The techniques we use work in a larger class of groups, that of Piecewise-Canonical Homeomorphisms of Edge Shifts (which are essentially the prefix-exchange transformations), which also includes the Houghton groups and the Thompson-like group $QV$, for example. We use strand diagrams, first developed by Belk and Matucci in 2014 to solve the conjugacy problem in Thompson's groups $F$, $T$ and $V$. In addition to strand diagrams, to solve for so-called type 3 reductions we will employ certain commutative semigroups of loops.</description>

      <title>On indecomposable involutive solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation whose squaring map is a $p$-cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pioneering work of Rump, which proved Gateva-Ivanova's conjecture concerning the decomposability of square-free solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation, significantly motivated further research into the associated squaring map $T$. This line of inquiry has yielded numerous decomposability theorems based on the underlying structure of $T$. Two seminal questions, posed by Ram\'irez and Vendramin, ask about the existence of certain indecomposable involutive solutions whose squaring maps are transpositions or 3-cycles. In this paper, we explore this problem in a more general setting by examining the case where $T$ is a $p$-cycle, for an arbitrary prime number $p$. Our results provide negative answers to the aforementioned questions under the assumption that the solution is latin or that its size is a prime-power. As a further application, we also present some decomposability theorems for solutions whose permutation groups are nilpotent.</description>

      <title>On the class-breadth conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00952v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The class-breadth conjecture of Leedham-Green, Neumann and Wiegold states that for each $p$-group, $cl(G)\leq b(G) + 1$, where $cl(G)$, $b(G)$ denote the nilpotency class and the breadth of $G$. While several counter-examples to this conjecture have been found for $p = 2$, it is still open in general for $p &gt; 2$. This article is dedicated to the general case $p &gt; 2$ of the conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group with simply connected derived subgroup. Over the complex numbers there exists a local method to study the geometric properties of a point $g$ in the closure of a Jordan class of $G$ in terms of Jordan classes of a maximal rank reductive subgroup $M \leq G$ depending on the point $g$, and further to the closures of certain decomposition classes in Lie($M$). We adapt this method to the case of an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p$, and we give sufficient restrictions on $p$ for it to hold.</description>

      <title>Free dilations of families of $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups and applications to evolution families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16314v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Commuting families of contractions or contractive $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups on Hilbert spaces often fail to admit power dilations resp. simultaneous unitary dilations which are themselves commutative (see [33, 11, 13]). In the \emph{non-commutative} setting, Sz.-Nagy [45] and Bo\.{z}ejko [4] provided means to dilate arbitrary families of contractions. The present work extends this discrete-time result to families $\{T_{i}\}_{i \in I}$ of contractive $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups. We refer to these dilations as continuous-time \emph{free unitary dilations} and present three distinct approaches to obtain them: 1) An explicit derivation applicable to semigroups that arise as interpolations; 2) A full proof with an explicit construction, via the theory of co-generators \`{a} la S\l{}oci\'{n}ski [40, 41] as well as a version for topologised index sets via a reformulation of the Trotter--Kato theorem for co-generators, leading to applications to evolution families; and 3) A second full proof based on the abstract structure of semigroups, which admits a natural reformulation to semigroup defined over topological free products of $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ and leads to various residuality results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a flexible technique to bound the characters of symmetric groups, via the Naruse hook length formula, the Larsen--Shalev character bounds, and appropriate diagram slicings. It allows us to prove a uniform exponential character bound with optimal constant $1/2$. We furthermore prove sharp character bounds for conjugacy classes having a macroscopic number of fixed points, and deduce that the random walks on the associated Cayley graphs exhibit a total variation and $L^2$ cutoff.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a lattice in a simply-connected nilpotent Lie group $N$ whose Lie algebra $\mathfrak{n}$ is
  $p$-filiform. We show that $\Gamma$ is either abelian or 2-step nilpotent if $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to the fundamental
  group of a smooth complex algebraic variety. Moreover as an application of our result, we give a
  required condition of a lattice in a simply-connected nilpotent Lie group of dimension less than or

      <title>Good involutions of conjugation subquandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08090v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Posed by Taniguchi, the classification of quandles with good involutions is a difficult question with applications to surface-knot theory. We address this question for subquandles of conjugation quandles, including all core quandles. We also study good involutions of faithful racks. In particular, we obtain sharp bounds on the number of good involutions of racks in these families.
  As an application of our results, we implement group-theoretic algorithms that compute all good involutions of conjugation quandles and core quandles; we provide data for those up to order 23. As another application, we construct infinite families of connected, noninvolutory symmetric quandles.
  We also classify symmetric and Legendrian racks, quandles, and kei up to order 8 using a computer search. Finally, we exhibit an equivalence of categories between racks and Legendrian racks that induces an equivalence between involutory racks, Legendrian kei, and symmetric kei.</description>

Abstract: The Cremona dimension of a group $G$ is the minimal $n$ such that $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of the Cremona group of birational transformations of an $n$-dimensional rational variety. In this survey article, we give many examples that gives evidence to the conjecture that the Cremona dimension of a finite group over the field of complex numbers is less than or equal to the essential dimension of the group.</description>
