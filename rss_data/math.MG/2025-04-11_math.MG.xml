      <title>The geometry of inconvenience and perverse equilibria in trade networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure bilateral trading costs is one of the key features of international trade. Drawing upon the freeness-of-trade matrix, which allows the modeling of N-state trade costs, we develop a ``geometry of inconvenience'' to better understand how they impact equilbrium outcomes. The freeness-of-trade matrix was introduced in a model by Mossay and Tabuchi, where they essentially proved that if a freeness-of-trade matrix is positive definite, then the corresponding model admits a unique equilibrium. Drawing upon the spectral theory of metrics, we prove the model admits nonunique, perverse, equilibria. We use this result to provide a family of policy relevant bipartite examples, with substantive applications to economic sanctions. More generally, we show how the network structure of the freeness of trade is central to understanding the impacts of policy interventions.</description>

      <title>On the configurations of four spheres supporting the vertices of a tetrahedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A reformulation of the three circles theorem of Johnson with distance coordinates to the vertices of a triangle is explicitly represented in a polynomial system and solved by symbolic computation. A similar polynomial system in distance coordinates to the vertices of a tetrahedron $T \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is introduced to represent the configurations of four spheres of radius $R^*$, which intersect in one point, each sphere containing three vertices of $T$ but not the fourth one. This problem is related to that of computing the largest value $R$ for which the set of vertices of $T$ is an $R$-body. For triangular pyramids we completely describe the set of geometric configurations with the required four balls of radius $R^*$. The solutions obtained by symbolic computation show that triangular pyramids are splitted into two different classes: in the first one $R^*$ is unique, in the second one three values $R^*$ there exist. The first class can be itself subdivided into two subclasses, one of which is related to the family of $R$-bodies.</description>

      <title>Extended Set Difference : Inverse Operation of Minkowski Summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the extended set difference, a generalization of the Hukuhara and generalized Hukuhara differences, defined for compact convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The proposed difference guarantees existence for any pair of such sets, offering a broader framework for set arithmetic. The difference may not be necessarily unique, but we offer a bound on the variety of solutions. The definition of the extended set difference is formulated through an optimization problem, which provides a constructive approach to its computation. The paper explores the properties of this new difference, including its stability under orthogonal transformations and its robustness to perturbations of the input sets. We propose a method to compute this difference through a formulated linear optimization problem.</description>
