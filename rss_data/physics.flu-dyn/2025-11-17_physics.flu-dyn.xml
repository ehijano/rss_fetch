      <title>A validated lumped-element model for bioinspired acoustic flow sensing toward the performance limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow sensing is fundamental to both biological survival and technological innovation. Inspired by biological mechanoreceptors, artificial flow sensors detect subtle fluid motion using slender, viscous-driven structures. Among these, acoustic flow sensors that mimic nature's velocity-sensitive ears have the potential to transform vector sound detection. Yet, despite their potential, understanding of how design parameters determine ultimate sensor performance remains limited. To effectively guide flow sensor design, we develop and experimentally validate a lumped-element model that captures the broadband motion of slender microcantilevers immersed in fluid, combining analytical simplicity with quantitative accuracy. The model predicts flow-induced motion, thermomechanical noise, and the minimum detectable signal level, showing strong agreement with experimental measurements in air over a broad frequency range from 100 Hz to 10,000 Hz. This validated model provides a straightforward theoretical framework for designing high-performance micro- and nanomechanical sensors for flow and vector sound detection.</description>

      <title>Stability of SQG Kolmogorov Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability analysis is performed on surface quasigeostrophic systems subjected to a Kolmogorov-type "shear force" on the boundaries using linear and nonlinear approaches. For a SQG system of semi-infinite depth forced on the upper boundary, the most linearly unstable mode is 2.74 the energy injection length scale. This is contrary to two-dimensional fluid systems, where the linear instability is greatest for long waves. In the presence of damping, the most linearly unstable mode shifts toward shorter length scales. The nonlinear critical Reynolds number across different damping strengths is found to be qualitatively similar to that of Euler 2D systems. For an SQG system of finite thickness being forced on both boundaries, its behaviour approaches that of a semi-infinite SQG system at the large thickness limit. In the small thickness limit, the behaviour of a symmetrically forced fluid layer approaches that of a 2D system, while an antisymmetrically forced fluid layer is not susceptible to both linear and nonlinear instabilities. With ageostrophic effects, an SQG+ system of semi-infinite depth is much more prone to instabilities than an otherwise identical SQG system in the absence of damping due to the instability of long-wave modes. However, damping significantly suppresses such instabilities. With increasing damping, the most linearly unstable mode moves toward a smaller length scale. Contrary to the zero damping case, when the damping is sufficiently large, ageostrophic effects have a small but measurable stabilising effect.</description>

      <title>Subgrid Stress Modelling with Multi-dimensional State Space Sequence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Eddy Simulations (LES) are becoming increasingly viable due to the growth in computational power the last few decades, and subgrid stress modelling plays a large role in the accuracy of LES. A new class of neural network models, S4 and S4ND models, allow for learning a continuous representation of the discrete dataset, which facilitates a principled approach to incorporating grid dependence in neural network subgrid stress modelling. A S4ND Unet neural network architecture is proposed and trained on both forced Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence (HIT) and channel flow, where a priori, it is shown to generalize to grid spacings that are coarser than the training set grid spacings, while simpler artificial neural network (ANN) models fail. A posteriori tests on both forced HIT and channel flow indicate that the S4ND model is more accurate than traditional models and ANN-based models on grid sizes that are in the training set. The S4ND model is also able to generalize to grid sizes that are coarser than the training set a posteriori, and is more accurate than many traditional and neural network subgrid stress models. Finally, the proposed model is also evaluated on flows at increasing Reynolds numbers, where it is seen that the proposed neural network remains stable even at a Reynolds number that is 500,000 times that seen in the training set.</description>

      <title>An efficient discrete unified gas kinetic scheme for strongly inhomogeneous fluids at the nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetic model with multiple integral terms based on the Enskog-Vlasov(EV) equation is widely employed to describe the inhomogeneous fluids at the nanoscale. However, previous studies have mainly focused on one-dimensional cases, partly due to the significant computational cost $O(NN_{\sigma})$ associated with direct computation of integrals, where $N$ is the number of cells in the flow field and $N_\sigma$ is the number of cells in a cube with a side length equal to the molecular diameter $\sigma$. In this study, we propose a discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS) with efficient numerical strategies for integrals to overcome the inefficiency of the direct method, reducing the computational cost to $O(N)$. Both accuracy and efficiency of the proposed DUGKS are assessed through several test cases, including static fluid structures and force-driven flow dynamics in parallel plate channels. As example applications, pressure-driven flow between two flat plates and force-driven flow in a square duct are investigated to highlight distinctive phenomena at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Controlled accelerations for Rayleigh-Taylor instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of turbulent mixing induced by Rayleigh-Taylor instability are heavily dependent on the acceleration experienced by the fluids and the frequency content of the initial interface between them. Both are readily controllable in numerical simulations, but in experimental studies are difficult to influence and adequately diagnose. In this paper we present the CAMPI apparatus, an experimental facility for study of low Atwood number Rayleigh-Taylor instability with highly controllable, complex acceleration histories. The apparatus provides unique and novel capability for the experimental study of variable acceleration Rayleigh-Taylor instability with fully miscible fluids and at a scale suitable for high resolution optical diagnostics. We present experimental results of initially single mode instability evolution through two stepwise acceleration reversals, a case termed Accel-Decel-Accel, demonstrating the ability of the apparatus to accurately generate a prescribed acceleration history. We observe the behaviour predicted by previous numerical studies, with instability growth reaching a terminal velocity in the first episode of acceleration, followed by a shrinking and homogenisation of the mixing region throughout deceleration, and unstable growth from a multi-frequency initial condition during the second acceleration. We present the CAMPI apparatus to the field as a much needed. resource of ground truth data on the behaviour of Rayleigh-Taylor instability across a broad range of regimes.</description>

      <title>Comparative study and critical assessment of phase-field lattice Boltzmann models for laminar and turbulent two-phase flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase field lattice Boltzmann (LB) models have undergone continuous development, resulting in multiple variants widely used for simulating multiphase flows. However, direct performance comparisons remain limited, especially for three-dimensional cases. In this study, we present a systematic comparative analysis of several recent and representative phase-field LB models, covering four major categories: conservative Allen-Cahn, nonlocal Allen-Cahn, hybrid Allen-Cahn, and Cahn-Hilliard models. Their accuracy, numerical stability and mass/volume conservation are assessed through a series of canonical two-phase flow problems. Beyond the commonly tested two-dimensional laminar cases, we extend the evaluation to three-dimensional droplet-laden turbulent flows, which expose more critical limitations of the existing models. The results show that while all models perform satisfactorily in two dimensions, they still suffer from substantial droplet volume loss in turbulence, particularly at high Weber numbers. Overall, conservative Allen-Cahn-based LB models exhibit the most favorable balance of numerical stability, accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Vortex breakdown and its topologies in turbulent flows within a typical swirl combustor geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate vortex breakdown (VB) and its dominant topologies in turbulent, non-reacting flows within a canonical swirl-combustor using large-eddy simulations (LES). A baseline configuration and operating conditions are first used to validate the LES solver; five additional cases with different swirler vane angles are then simulated while keeping all other flow and geometric parameters fixed. The onset of VB is quantified using the generic swirl-strength SNg by detecting internal recirculation zones (IRZs) in the mean flow, thereby excluding highly intermittent VB. Analysis of the mean flow shows that SNg measured within 40 mm downstream of the swirler best represents the flow's swirl strength. A stable VB first appears with a 25{\deg} vane angle (SNg = 0.35). Q-criterion iso-surfaces and velocity time series at vortex-core footprints show a single-helix VC across all investigated vane angles; up to 60{\deg} (SNg = 1.15). Weaker double-helix characteristics appear: they are quadratic self-interaction of the single-helix tone for vane angles &lt;= 50{\deg}, but are quadratically independent in the 60{\deg} case, indicating a distinct helical hydrodynamic mode. Axisymmetric IRZ oscillations interact with helical VC dynamics in the 25{\deg} and 60{\deg} cases. VC precesses as a stable limit-cycle oscillation in 40{\deg}-50{\deg} cases (marginally stable mode), and precession waxes and wanes strongly in 25{\deg} and 60{\deg} cases (stochastic forcing on a slightly stable mode). Alongside a coherent VC strand, a weakly coherent strand originates from the swirler; its precession frequencies match the lowest precession frequencies of coherent strands, corroborating its precession-based origin. Overall, we establish critical values, evaluation locations, and a topology map for predicting and interpreting VB states in isothermal swirl-combustor flows.</description>

      <title>Assessment of a Nonlinear Unsteady Vortex Lattice-Vortex Particle Method for Predicting Helicopter Rotor/Multirotor Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a nonlinear unsteady vortex lattice-vortex particle method (NL-UVLM-VPM) for the efficient prediction of helicopter rotor aerodynamics. The approach couples a nonlinear unsteady vortex lattice method for aerodynamic modeling with a mesh-free vortex particle method for wake evolution. Nonlinear viscous effects, derived from two-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) sectional data, are incorporated through a low-cost viscous-inviscid alpha-coupling algorithm. To stabilize wake development, the Vreman eddy-viscosity subgrid-scale model is integrated with the particle strength exchange (PSE) method within a large eddy simulation (LES) framework, enabling robust and accurate resolution of the wake coherent, transient, and turbulent breakdown regions. The solver further includes a novel adaptive particle conversion technique, reducing computational wall-clock time by nearly 70%, and a multiple-reference-frame kinematics formulation, allowing simulations of complex flight conditions such as forward flight and multi-rotor interactions. Validation against experimental and unsteady RANS (URANS) data for three representative benchmark cases shows good agreement in aerodynamic loads and wake structures. Moreover, the NL-UVLM-VPM achieves comparable accuracy to URANS, with over two orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost, demonstrating its potential as a reliable and efficient tool for rotorcraft aerodynamic studies.</description>

      <title>Influence of Rotation on Fingering Convection in Planetary Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stably stratified layers are thought to develop at the top of the liquid metallic cores of many terrestrial planets. We consider the case where the thermal gradient is stable but the compositional gradient is unstable, a situation particularly relevant to Mercury. The strong contrast between molecular diffusivities of temperature and composition leads to fingering convection. We investigate this process using hydrodynamical simulations in a rotating spherical shell, systematically varying the stratification strength N relative to the rotation rate $\Omega$. In all regimes, the primary fingering mode forms narrow, elongated structures that shift orientation from the rotation axis to the direction of gravity as $N^2/\Omega^2$ exceeds 10. The fingers remain laminar, with transverse scales proportional to thermal stratification but independent of rotation. Fingering convection also drives secondary large-scale flows across most of the explored parameter space, producing diverse dynamics including zonal flows, hemispherical convection, axisymmetric poloidal bands, finger clusters, and toroidal gyres. In the rapidly-rotating regime, laterally inhomogeneous mixing generates zonal flows in thermo-compositional wind balance; zonal flow direction and amplitude depend on $N^2/\Omega^2$, with amplitude weakening for strong stratification $N^2/\Omega^2&gt;10$. In the intermediate regime ($N^2/\Omega^2\sim 1$), axisymmetric or spiraling poloidal bands emerge within the tangent cylinder, gradually overtaking the primary fingers. For stronger stratification, finger clusters and weak, large-scale density anomalies surrounded by toroidal gyres form in the upper domain. These diverse large-scale flows may interact with the dynamo-generated magnetic field in the deeper core, potentially influencing surface magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Laminar boundary layers over small-scale textured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11471v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a model for steady, laminar boundary layers over small-scale textured surfaces. Although the texture is small relative to the boundary-layer thickness, it modifies the flow via a slip length. We use matched asymptotic expansions to simplify the problem, dividing the flow into outer, boundary-layer and inner regions. The far-field behaviour of the inner problem yields a slip boundary condition for the boundary layer. We derive an asymptotic solution valid when the slip length is small. For arbitrary slip lengths, we develop a numerical method combining Chebyshev collocation and finite differences. We apply this framework to canonical small-scale textured surfaces, including superhydrophobic surfaces and riblets, and utilise existing analytical slip formulae. We demonstrate how slip can effect the boundary layer's velocity field, wall shear stress and displacement thickness. Our approach enables computationally inexpensive modelling of small-scale textured surfaces in applications ranging from microfluidics to marine transport.</description>

      <title>Discrete Contact Angles and Electric Field Singularity in Electrowetting: A Multi-Scale Complex Potential Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study constructed a multi-scale theoretical framework to resolve the electric field singularity at the Triple Contact Point in electrowetting. Utilizing conformal transformation and complex analysis, we established the structure for both the global potential and local field solutions, complementing the analysis with numerical methods. Our primary finding is that the contact angle $\theta$ is not continuously adjustable but is restricted to a discrete set of values, constrained by the characteristic exponent $\lambda$. Analysis of the complex potential established $\text{Re}[\lambda] \ge 1$ as the critical condition for a non-singular electric field; conversely, singular solutions ($\text{Re}[\lambda] &lt; 1$) are localized exclusively in the acute-angle regime ($\theta &lt; \pi/2$). The high-order solution region exhibits a degeneracy phenomenon at specific angles, implying the local field structure is geometrically stable and universally applicable for a wide range of permittivity ratios $k$. Furthermore, we determined that the onset of electric field oscillation requires the simultaneous satisfaction of two critical conditions: the geometry must approach a flat boundary ($\theta \to \pi$) and the dielectric ratio must approach homogeneity ($k \to 1$). These findings provide a solid theoretical basis for designing non-singular electric fields and mitigating the common contact angle saturation phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Emergent Synchronization and Defect Dynamics in Confined Chiral Active Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic interactions can generate rich emergent structures in active matter systems. Using large-scale hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate that hydrodynamic coupling alone can drive spontaneous self-organization across a hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales in confined suspensions of torque-driven particles at moderate Reynolds numbers. Spinners first self-assemble into dimers, which crystallize into a hexatic lattice and subsequently undergo a collective tilting instability. The resulting tilted dimers rotate and synchronize through hydrodynamic repulsion, which can be tuned by the Reynolds number. Upon synchronization, the polar director develops splay and bend deformations and nucleates topological defects with charges of $\pm1$. These defects induce long-wavelength concentration gradients and drive crystal vortex dynamics spanning hundreds of particle diameters. Our results reveal a purely hydrodynamic route to synchronization and defect-mediated dynamics in chiral active matter, without explicit alignment rules or interparticle forces.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Rossby number gap in rapidly rotating thermal convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geophysical and astrophysical fluid flows are typically driven by buoyancy and strongly constrained at large scales by planetary rotation. Rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RRRBC) provides a paradigm for experiments and direct numerical simulations (DNS) of such flows, but the accessible parameter space remains restricted to moderately fast rotation rates (Ekman numbers $Ek \gtrsim 10^{-8}$), while realistic $Ek$ for astro-/geophysical applications are orders of magnitude smaller. On the other hand, previously derived reduced equations of motion describing the leading-order behaviour in the limit of very rapid rotation ($Ek\to 0$) cannot capture finite rotation effects, and the physically most relevant part of parameter space with small but finite $Ek$ has remained elusive. Here, we employ the rescaled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (RiNSE) -- a reformulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $Ek\to 0$, recently introduced by Julien et al. (2024) -- to provide full DNS of RRRBC at unprecedented rotation strengths down to $Ek=10^{-15}$ and below, revealing the disappearance of cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry at previously unattainable Ekman numbers ($Ek \approx 10^{-9}$). We also identify an overshoot in the heat transport as $Ek$ is varied at fixed $\widetilde{Ra}= Ra Ek^{4/3}$, associated with dissipation due to ageostrophic motions in the boundary layers. The simulations validate theoretical predictions based on thermal boundary layer theory for RRRBC and show that the solutions of RiNSE agree with the reduced equations at very small $Ek$. These results represent a first foray into the vast, largely unexplored parameter space of very rapidly rotating convection rendered accessible by RiNSE.</description>

Abstract: The pursuit of targeted therapies capable of overcoming biological barriers, including the tenacious blood-brain barrier, has spurred the investigation into stimuli-responsive microagents. This approach could improve therapeutic efficacy, reduce undesirable side effects, and open avenues for treating previously incurable diseases. Intravenously-administered ultrasound-responsive microbubbles are one of the most promising agents, having demonstrated potential in several clinical trials. However, the mechanism by which microbubbles enhance drug absorption remains unclear. Here, we reveal through unprecedented time-resolved side-view visualisations that single microbubbles, upon microsecond-long ultrasound driving, puncture the cell membrane and induce drug uptake via stable cyclic microjets. Our theoretical models successfully reproduce the observed bubble and cell dynamic responses. We find that cyclic jets arise from shape instabilities, warranting recognition as a novel class of jets in bubbles, distinct from classical inertial jets driven by pressure gradients. We also establish a threshold for bubble radial expansion beyond which microjets form and facilitate cellular permeation. Remarkably, these microjets occur at ultrasound pressures below 100kPa due to their unique formation mechanism. We show that the stress generated by microjetting surpasses all previously suggested mechanisms by at least an order of magnitude. In summary, this work elucidates the physics behind microbubble-mediated targeted drug delivery and provides criteria for its effective yet safe application.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of air invasion in one-dimensional compliant fluid networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vascular networks exhibit a remarkable diversity of architectures and transport mechanisms across biological systems. Inspired by embolism propagation in plant xylem, where air invades water-filled conduits under negative pressure, we study air penetration in compliant one-dimensional hydrodynamic networks experiencing mass loss by pervaporation. Using a theoretical framework grounded in biomimetic models, we show that embolism dynamics are shaped by the interplay between network compliance and viscous dissipation. In particular, the competition between two timescales (the pressure diffusion time, $\tau_\mathrm{diff}$, and the pervaporation time, $\tau_\mathrm{pv}$) governs the emergence of complex, history-dependent behaviors. When $\tau_\mathrm{diff} \sim \tau_\mathrm{pv}$, we uncover a nonlinear feedback between the internal pressure field and the embolism front, leading to transient depressurization and delayed interface motion. These results offer a minimal framework for understanding embolism dynamics in slow-relaxing vascular systems and provide design principles for soft microfluidic circuits with tunable, nonlinear response.</description>

      <title>Plane-layer Rayleigh-B\'enard convection up to $Ra=10^{11}$: Near-wall fluctuations and role of initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection through direct numerical simulations in a three-dimensional plane layer of aspect ratio 4 for Rayleigh numbers $10^5 \leq Ra \leq 10^{11}$ and Prandtl number $Pr=0.7$. We summarize the height-dependent statistics of velocity and temperature fluctuations and corresponding scalings with the Rayleigh number. We include an analysis on the role of coherent and incoherent flow regions near the wall for global heat transfer. Furthermore, we investigate the dependence of turbulent transport on a finite-amplitude sinusoidal shear flow added at time $t=0$, which either freely decays in a long transient or remains existent when a steady sinusoidal volume forcing is added. In the latter case, weak logarithmic near-wall layers are formed, however, with von K\'arm\'an and offset constants that differ from standard values. The typical magnitude of both coefficients, and thus a full turbulent boundary layer of velocity and temperature, is re-established only for a switch from sinusoidal to constant pressure gradient driving of the flow. In all cases, except for the constant pressure gradient-driven flow, no enhancement of global turbulent heat and momentum transfer within error bars is detected, even though the sinusoidal amplitude is of the order of the characteristic free-fall velocity.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Stall Characteristics and Modelling of Time-Varying Pitching Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an experimental investigation examining how the complexity of pitching kinematics influences dynamic stall characteristics, including the stall delay and aerodynamic force response. The study examines whether the pitch rate defined at the static stall angle adequately characterises time-varying pitching kinematics for stall onset prediction. We then evaluate the performance of the generalised Goman-Khrabrov model in predicting force responses of nonlinear pitching motions and propose necessary modifications to extend the model's applicability to complex kinematics.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Applicability of the Lattice-Boltzmann Method for Two-Dimensional Turbulence Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lattice-Boltzmann method is a mesoscopic approach for solving hydrodynamic problems involving both laminar and turbulent fluids. Although the suitability for the former cases is supported by a myriad of studies, turbulent flows always give rise to additional challenges that need to be addressed properly. In this paper, we estimate the accuracy of the simulation results obtained via a custom implementation of a Lattice-Boltzmann solver for a two-dimensional turbulent flow. To this end, a two-dimensional flow field filled with randomly located rigid disks was simulated, and the von Karman vortex street generated after the wake of such obstacles was studied. To ensure reproducibility, the implementation underlying these results is provided as supplementary material.</description>
