      <title>Uniqueness of asymptotically cylindrical steady gradient Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Bryant soliton is the unique asymptotically cylindrical steady gradient Ricci soliton, in any dimension $n \geq 3$ and without any curvature assumptions. This generalizes a celebrated theorem of Brendle. We also prove that any steady gradient Ricci soliton asymptotic to a cylinder over the homogeneous lens space $\mathbb{S}^{2m+1}/\mathbb{Z}_k = L_{m,k}$, for $m \geq 1$ and $k \geq 3$, is a noncollapsed Appleton soliton on the complex line bundle $O(-k)$ over $\mathbb{CP}^m$. In dimension 4, our results lead to a classification of steady gradient Ricci soliton singularity models on smooth manifolds which possess a tangent flow at infinity of the form $(SU(2)/\Gamma) \times \mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>Examples of open manifolds with almost quadratic volume growth and infinite Betti numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of examples of complete $(2+n)-$dimensional ($n\ge 2$) open manifolds with positive Ricci curvature, sectional curvature bounded from below and infinite Betti numbers $b_2,b_n$, moreover its volume growth can be arbitrarily close to quadratic volume growth. Compared with some known result of finite topology for manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and lower sectional curvature bound, it makes sense to ask whether complete manifolds with such curvature bounds must be of finite topological type or not provided with at most quadratic volume growth.</description>

      <title>A new class of aesthetic curves based on the self-affinity in equiaffine geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider planar curves in equiaffine geometry and present a family of planar curves characterized by a symmetry called the extendable self-affinity (ESA). The ESA has been recognized through the investigation of the symmetry of the log-aesthetic curve (LAC), which has been studied as a reference for designing aesthetic shapes in CAGD and regarded as an analog of Euler's elastica in similarity geometry. Our new class, characterized by the ESA, includes the quadratic curve and the logarithmic spiral, a special case of the LAC. This implies that the new class can be regarded as an alternate class of ``aesthetic curves" in equiaffine geometry.</description>

      <title>On Losik classes of diffeomorphism pseudogroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a pseudogroup of local diffeomorphisms of an $n$-dimensional smooth manifold $M$. Following Losik we consider characteristic classes of the quotient $M/P$ as elements of the de~Rham cohomology of the second order frame bundles over $M/P$ coming from the generators of the Gelfand-Fuchs cohomology. We provide explicit expressions for the classes that we call Godbillon-Vey-Losik class and the first Chern-Losik class. Reducing the frame bundles we construct bundles over $M/P$ such that the Godbillon-Vey-Losik class is represented by a volume form on a space of dimension $2n+1$, and the first Chern-Losik class is represented by a symplectic form on a space of dimension $2n$. Examples in dimension 2 are considered.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of the asymptotic boundary of translators in $\mathbb H^2\times \mathbb R$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study complete properly immersed translators in the product space $\mathbb H^2\times\mathbb R$, focusing on their asymptotic behavior at infinity. We classify the asymptotic boundary components of these translators under suitable continuity assumptions. Specifically, we prove that if a boundary component lies in the vertical asymptotic boundary, it is of the form $\{p\}\times [T,\infty)$ or $\{p\}\times \mathbb R$, while if it lies in the horizontal asymptotic boundary, it is a complete geodesic. Our approach is inspired by earlier work on minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces in $\mathbb H^2\times\mathbb R$, with a key ingredient being the use of symmetric translators as barriers.</description>

      <title>Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles: Connections and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approach to Carrollian geometry using principal $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles ($\mathbb{R}^\times := \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$) equipped with a degenerate metric whose kernel is the module of vertical vector fields. The constructions allow for non-trivial bundles and a large class of Carrollian manifolds can be analysed in this formalism. Alongside other results, we show that once an $\mathbb{R}^\times$-connection has been chosen, there is a canonical affine connection that is torsionless, but, in general, not compatible with the degenerate metric. The construction of an affine connection is intimately tied to a Kaluza-Klein geometry.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new two-player zero-sum game whose value function approximates the level set formulation for the geometric evolution by mean curvature of a hypersurface. In our approach the game is played with symmetric rules for the two players and probability theory is involved (the game is not deterministic).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the instability of naked singularities arising in the Einstein equations coupled with isothermal perfect fluid. We show that the spherically symmetric self-similar naked singularities of this system, are unstable to trapped surface formation, under $C^{1,\alpha}$ perturbations of an external massless scalar field. We viewed this as a toy model in studying the instability of these naked singularities under gravitational perturbations in the original Einstein--Euler system which is non-spherically symmetric.</description>

      <title>$\eta$-Ricci solitons and $\eta$-Einstein metrics on weak $\beta$-Kenmotsu $f$-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14125v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent interest among geometers in $f$-structures of K. Yano is due to the study of topology and dynamics of contact foliations, which generalize the flow of the Reeb vector field on contact manifolds to higher dimensions. Weak metric structures introduced by V. Rovenski and R. Wolak as a generalization of Hermitian and K\"{a}hler structures, as well as $f$-structures, allow a fresh look at the classical theory. In this paper, we study a new $f$-structure of this kind, called the weak $\beta$-Kenmotsu $f$-structure, as a generalization of K. Kenmotsu's concept. We prove that a weak $\beta$-Kenmotsu $f$-manifold is locally a twisted product of the Euclidean space and a weak K\"{a}hler manifold. Our main results show that such manifolds with $\beta=const$ and equipped with an $\eta$-Ricci soliton structure whose potential vector field satisfies certain conditions are $\eta$-Einstein manifolds of constant scalar curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prescribed Ricci curvature problem involves finding a Riemannian metric g that satisfies the equation ric(g) = T, where T is a fixed symmetric (0, 2)-tensor field on a differential manifold M. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Schouten-like metrics as particular solutions to the prescribed Ricci curvature problem. We classify these metrics on five-dimensional nilpotent Lie groups by establishing a connection with algebraic Schouten solitons. This approach also enables us to classify five-dimensional nilsolitons, providing a comprehensive understanding of their geometric structures and properties.</description>

Abstract: Riemannian four-manifolds in which the triple contraction of the curvature tensor against itself yields a functional multiple of the metric are called weakly Einstein. We focus on weakly Einstein K\"ahler surfaces. We provide several conditions characterizing those K\"ahler surfaces which are weakly Einstein, classify weakly Einstein K\"ahler surfaces having some specific additional properties, and construct new examples.</description>

      <title>Volume spectrum of fiber bundles and the widths of Berger spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish that for a fiber bundle $\pi: E \to B$, which is a Riemannian submersion, the volume spectrum of $E$ is bounded above by the product of the volume spectrum of $B$ and the volume of the largest fiber. Specifically, we prove the following inequality: $$\omega_p(E,g_E) \leq \left( \sup_{b \in B} \operatorname{vol}_{g_E}(\pi^{-1}(b)) \right) \omega_p(B,g_B). $$ Furthermore, we extend this result to the phase transition spectrum. In addition, we also obtain lower bounds for the isoperimetric profile of Riemannian fibrations with totally geodesic, spherical fibers in terms of the isoperimetric profile of the product of the base and a sphere. By exploiting connections between volume spectrum, least area minimal surfaces, and the isoperimetric profile, we employ these bounds to compute the low widths of Berger spheres and product of spheres. Notably, our analysis reveals that for sufficiently small $\tau$, the equatorial sphere $S^2$ in the Berger sphere $S^3_{\tau}$ (a $S^1-$bundle over $S^2(\frac{1}{2})$ with fiber length $2\pi \tau$) attains the Simon-Smith $1,2,3,4$ widths but fails to attain any lower widths, in both the Almgren-Pitts setting and the Allen-Cahn setting.</description>

      <title>Geodesic X-ray transform and streaking artifacts on simple surfaces or on spaces of constant curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The X-ray transform on the plane or on the three-dimensional Euclidean space can be considered as the measurements of CT scanners for normal human tissue. If the human body contains metal regions such as dental implants, stents in blood vessels, metal bones, etc., the beam hardening effect for the energy level of the X-ray causes streaking artifacts in its CT image. More precisely, if there are two strictly convex metal regions contained in the cross-section of normal human tissue, then streaking artifacts occur along the common tangent lines of the two regions. In this paper we study the geodesic X-ray transform and streaking artifacts on nontrapping simple compact Riemannian manifolds with strictly convex boundaries. We show that the streaking artifacts result from the propagation of conormal singularities on the boundary of metal regions along the common tangent geodesics under the strong and seemingly strange assumption that the manifolds are two dimensional or spaces of constant curvature. This condition ensures that every Jacobi field takes the form of the product of a scalar function and parallel transport along the geodesic. Our results clarify the geometric meaning of the theory, which was imperceptible in the known results on the Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Piecewise geodesic Jordan curves II: Loewner energy, projective structures, and accessory parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider Jordan curves on the Riemann sphere passing through $n \ge 3$ given points. We show that in each relative isotopy class of such curves, there exists a unique curve that minimizes the Loewner energy. These curves have the property that each arc between two consecutive points is a hyperbolic geodesic in the domain bounded by the other arcs. This geodesic property lets us define a complex projective structure whose holonomy lies in $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. We show that the quadratic differential comparing this projective structure to the trivial projective structure on the sphere has simple poles whose residues (accessory parameters) are given by the Wirtinger derivatives of the minimal Loewner energy. This is reminiscent of Polyakov's conjecture for Fuchsian projective structures, proven by Takhtajan and Zograf. Finally, we show that the projective structures we obtain are related to Fuchsian projective structures through $\pi$-grafting.</description>

      <title>Tian's theorem for Grassmannian embeddings and degeneracy sets of random sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,\omega)$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold, $(L,h^L)$ be a positive line bundle, and $(E,h^E)$ be a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle of rank $r$ on $X$. We prove that the pullback by the Kodaira embedding associated to $L^p\otimes E$ of the $k$-th Chern class of the dual of the universal bundle over the Grassmannian converges as $p\to\infty$ to the $k$-th power of the Chern form $c_1(L,h^L)$, for $0\leq k\leq r$. If $c_1(L,h^L)=\omega$ we also determine the second term in the semiclassical expansion, which involves $c_1(E,h^E)$. As a consequence we show that the limit distribution of zeros of random sequences of holomorphic sections of high powers $L^p\otimes E$ is $c_1(L,h^L)^r$. Furthermore, we compute the expectation of the currents of integration along degeneracy sets of random holomorphic sections.</description>
