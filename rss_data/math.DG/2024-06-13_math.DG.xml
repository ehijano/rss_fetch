      <title>More Extreme Limits of Manifolds with Positive Scalar Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the example constructed in the paper by Sormani-Tian-Wang to build new examples that satisfy the assumptions of the conjecture by Gromov. Each of these new examples of sequence converges to a limit space with infinitely many poles in $\mathbb{S}^2$. These examples can be used to test various notions of weak scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>V-static metrics and the volume-renormalised mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V-static metrics generalise the notion of static metrics, and stem from the work of Miao and Tam [arXiv:0807.2693], and Corvino, Eichmair and Miao [arXiv:1211.6168] on critical points of the volume functional over the space of compact manifolds with constant scalar curvature. In this article we show that these V-static metrics arise naturally in the context of asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds as critical points of the volume-renormalised mass, recently introduced by Dahl, Kr\"oncke and the author [arXiv:2307.06196].
  In particular, we show that critical points of the volume-renormalised mass over the space of constant scalar curvature asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds without boundary, or satisfying appropriate boundary conditions, are exactly V-static metrics. This is directly analogous to the relationship between critical points of the ADM mass and static metrics for asymptotically flat manifolds.</description>

      <title>Hodge decomposition theorem on compact $d$-K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we will explore the fundamental concepts, including various basic concepts on $d$-complex manifolds, along with several differential operators and examine the relationships between them. A $d$-K\"ahler manifold is a $d$-complex manifold equipped with a metric that satisfies a specific condition. We prove the Hodge decomposition theorem on compact $d$-K\"ahler manifolds, which establishes a crucial relationship between certain de-Rham cohomology groups and Dolbeault cohomology groups on a compact $d$-K\"ahler manifold .</description>

      <title>Existence and partial regularity of Legendrian area-minimizing currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Legendrian integral currents in a contact manifold that locally minimize the mass among Legendrian competitors have a regular set which is open and dense in their support. We apply this to show existence and partial regularity of solutions of the Legendrian Plateau problem in the $n$th Heisenberg group for an arbitrary horizontal $(n-1)$-cycle as prescribed boundary, and of mass-minimizing Legendrian integral currents in any $n$-dimensional homology class of a closed contact $(2n+1)$-manifold. In the case of the Heisenberg group, our result applies to Ambrosio--Kirchheim metric currents with respect to the Carnot--Carath\'eodory distance. Our results do not assume any compatibility between the subriemannian metric and the symplectic form.</description>

      <title>Some applications of canonical metrics to Landau-Ginzburg models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that a given smooth del Pezzo surface or Fano threefold $X$ admits a choice of log Calabi-Yau compactified mirror toric Landau-Ginzburg model (with respect to certain fixed K\"ahler classes and Gorenstein toric degenerations). Here we consider the problem of constructing a corresponding map $\Theta$ from a domain in the complexified K\"ahler cone of $X$ to a well-defined, separated moduli space $\mathfrak{M}$ of polarised manifolds endowed with a canonical metric. We prove a complete result for del Pezzos and a partial result for some special Fano threefolds. The construction uses some fundamental results in the theory of constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics. As a consequence $\mathfrak{M}$ parametrises $K$-stable manifolds and the domain of $\Theta$ is endowed with the pullback of a Weil-Petersson form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show the regularity and uniqueness of the twisted conical K\"ahler-Ricci flow running from a positive closed current with zero Lelong number, which extends the regularizing property of the smooth twisted K\"ahler-Ricci flow, known as Guedj-Zeriahi's existence theorem and Di Nezza-Lu's uniqueness theorem, to the conical singularity case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each nonnegative integer m we show that any closed, oriented topological four-manifold with fundamental group Z_{4m+2} and odd intersection form, with possibly seven exceptions, either admits no smooth structure or admits infinitely many distinct smooth structures up to diffeomorphism. Moreover, we construct infinite families of non-complex irreducible fake projective planes with diverse fundamental groups.</description>

      <title>The conformal limit and projective structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-abelian Hodge correspondence maps a polystable $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$-Higgs bundle on a compact Riemann surface $X$ of genus $g\geq2$ to a connection which, in some cases, is the holonomy of a branched hyperbolic structure. On the other hand, Gaiotto's conformal limit maps the same bundle to a partial oper, i.e., to a connection whose holonomy is that of a branched complex projective structure compatible with $X$.
  In this article, we show how these are both instances of the same phenomenon: the family of connections appearing in the conformal limit can be understood as a family of complex projective structures, deforming the hyperbolic ones into the ones compatible with $X$.
  We also show that, when the Higgs bundle has zero Toledo invariant, this deformation is optimal, inducing a geodesic on Teichm\"uller's metric space.</description>

      <title>Squeezing a fixed amount of gravitational energy to arbitrarily small scales, in $U(1)$ symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.05526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove uniform finite-time existence of solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations in polarized U(1) symmetry which have uniformly positive incoming $H^1$ energy supported on an arbitrarily small set in the 2 + 1 spacetime obtained by quotienting by the U(1) symmetry. We also construct a subclass of solutions for which the energy remains concentrated (along a U(1) family of geodesics) throughout its evolution. These results rely on three innovations: a direct treatment of the 2 + 1 Einstein equations in a null geodesic gauge, a novel parabolic scaling of the Einstein equations in this gauge, and a new Klainerman-Sobolev inequality on rectangular strips.</description>

      <title>A general nonlinear characterization of stochastic incompleteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic incompleteness of a Riemannian manifold $M$ amounts to the nonconservation of probability for the heat semigroup on $M$. We show that this property is equivalent to the existence of nonnegative, nontrivial, bounded (sub)solutions to $\Delta W=\psi(W)$ for one, hence all, general nonlinearity $\psi$ which is only required to be continuous, nondecreasing, with $\psi(0)=0$ and $\psi&gt;0$ in $(0,+\infty)$. Similar statements hold for unsigned (sub)solutions. We also prove that stochastic incompleteness is equivalent to the nonuniqueness of bounded solutions to the nonlinear parabolic equation $\partial_t u =\Delta\phi(u)$ with bounded initial data for one, hence all, general nonlinearity $\phi$ which is only required to be continuous, nondecreasing and nonconstant. Such a generality allows us to deal with equations of both fast-diffusion and porous-medium type, as well as with the one-phase and two-phase classical Stefan problems, which seem to have never been investigated in the manifold setting.</description>

      <title>Gradient Bounds and Liouville theorems for Quasi-linear equations on compact Manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we establish a gradient bound and Liouville-type theorems for solutions to Quasi-linear elliptic equations on compact Riemannian Manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Also, we provide a local splitting theorem when the inequality in the gradient bound becomes equality at some point. Moreover, we prove a Harnack-type inequality and an ABP estimate for the gradient of solutions in domains contained in the manifold.</description>

      <title>Distributions and controllability problems (I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a non-linear real analytic control system of first order $\dot q^i = f^i(t, q, w)$, with controls $w = (w^\alpha)$ in a connected open set $\mathcal{K} \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ and configurations $q = (q^i)$ in $\mathcal{Q} := \mathbb{R}^n$. The set of points in the extended space-time $\mathcal{M} = \mathbb{R} \times \mathcal{Q} \times \mathcal{K}$, which can be reached from a triple $x_o = (t_o , q_o, w_o) \in \mathcal{M}$ through a continuous graph completion $\gamma(s) = \big(t(s), q(t(s)), w(t(s))\big)$ of the graph of a solution $t \to (q(t), w(t))$, $t \in [t_o ,t_o + T]$, with piecewise real analytic controls, is called the {\it $\mathcal{M}$-attainable set of $x_o$ in time $T$}. We prove that if $y_o$ is an $\mathcal{M}$-attainable point of $x_o$, a large set of other nearby $\mathcal{M}$-attainable points of $x_o$ can be determined starting directly from $y_o$ and applying an appropriate ordered composition of flows of vector fields in a distinguished distribution $\mathcal{D}^{II} \subset T \mathcal{M}$, canonically associated with the control system. We then determine sufficient conditions for such neighbouring points to constitute an orbit of the pseudogroup of local diffeomorphisms generated by the vector fields in $\mathcal{D}^{II}$. If such conditions are satisfied and if the tangent spaces of these orbits have maximal rank projections onto $\mathcal{Q}$, the control system is locally accessible and has the small time local controllability property near the state points of equilibrium. These results lead to new proofs of classical local controllability criterions and yield new methods to establish the accessibility and the small time local controllability of non-linear control systems.</description>
