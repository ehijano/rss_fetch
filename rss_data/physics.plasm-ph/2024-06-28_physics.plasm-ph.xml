      <title>Sterilization of Bacteria with Low-Pressure Low-Temperature Plasma Discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study investigates the effectiveness of using low-pressure oxygen plasma, generated by microwave discharge, to sterilize bacterial spores of Bacillus Stearothermophilus and Bacillus Subtilis. Plasma, a highly ionized state of matter consisting of positive ions and free electrons, is created by applying high temperatures or accelerating electrons through an electric field. This method provides an innovative alternative to traditional sterilization techniques, particularly beneficial for heatsensitive materials. In the experiments, microwave at 2.45 GHz with 1000 W and 500 W intensities (990 W and 495 W) were applied in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of $10^{-3}$ Torr. Spores were exposed to the plasma using two types of holders: Petri dishes and centrifuge tubes, for 1, 5, and 10 minutes. The findings revealed that direct exposure to oxygen plasma at a 1000 W microwave power effectively inactivated spores in Petri dishes, especially for B. Subtilis. Conversely, centrifuge tubes did not allow sufficient plasma exposure, leading to the survival of bacteria posttreatment. The inactivation process involves UV induced DNA damage and the erosion of spores' protective layers by oxygen radicals. The study concludes that low-pressure oxygen plasma is a promising technology for sterilizing heat-sensitive materials. Optimal conditions identified include a 1000 W microwave power and exposure times of at least 5 minutes for B. Stearothermophilus and 1 minute for B. Subtilis. Petri dishes proved more effective than centrifuge tubes due to the closer and more direct plasma contact. This method offers a safe and efficient alternative to traditional sterilization techniques, with significant potential for applications in the sterilization of medical devices and other delicate materials.</description>

      <title>Average-atom approach for transport properties of shocked argon in the presence of a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present electron transport calculations of shocked argon based on an average-atom modeling of the plasma, and compare them with measurements, involving both incident and reflected shock waves. Since the corresponding experiments are subject to a 5 T magnetic field, the impact of the latter on the Rankine-Hugoniot equations is taken into account, starting from the magneto-resistive hydrodynamics, and the resistivity tensor is deduced from the Boltzmann equation. The resistivity tensor yields the electrical and Hall resistivities. Our average-atom code Paradisio provides the quantities required for the calculation of electrical resistivity within the Ziman-Evans formalism, as well as for the Hall resistivity. We obtain a good agreement between calculated conductivities and experimental values, both for the incident and reflected shocks. Our values of the Hall constant are compared to experimental values derived from Hall voltage measurements, as well as to theoretical ones based on the quantum statistical linear-relaxation-time approach.</description>

      <title>Design and First Tests of the Trapped Electrons Experiment T-REX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gyrotrons are the only sources used for electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH). Past gyrotron experiments have highlighted some instability issues, leading to restricted operating ranges. One major cause is the possible presence of trapped electrons within the gyrotron's magnetron injection gun (MIG) region, resulting in undesired currents and subsequent operational failures. Hereby, we present the design and initial experimental findings of the TRapped Electrons eXperiment (T-REX), a novel and unique basic plasma experiment constructed at the Swiss Plasma Center to investigate the underlying physics of trapped electron clouds, therefore entering the realm of non-neutral plasmas. The primary objective is to explore the formation and evolution of electron clouds in gyrotron MIG designs. Typical MIG conditions are replicated in T-REX in terms of geometries, electric and magnetic fields, and supported by kinetic simulations via the 2D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code FENNECS. T-REX is characterized by two coaxial electrodes, placed in a vacuum chamber on top of a superconducting magnet, with an applied external radial electric field (0.1 - 2 MV/m), and a nearly axial magnetic field (B&lt;0.4T) inducing azimuthal drifts and confining electrons with energies between 0.1-1 keV. The experimental diagnostics include current, voltage, and Faraday probes, and in future plans imaging via phosphor screen, optical emission spectroscopy, streak camera imaging, and, potentially, electric field distribution via the Stark effect. Moreover, T-REX is also designed to be capable of detecting potential growth of diocotron modes via such diagnostics in combination with a segmented outer electrode. Through T-REX, we aim to gain valuable insights into the trapping and dynamics of electrons within MIG regions, paving the way for improved gyrotron performance and reliability in magnetic fusion reactors.</description>

      <title>Pulsational mode stability in complex EiBI-gravitating polarized astroclouds with (r, q)-distributed electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pulsational mode of gravitational collapse (PMGC) originating from the combined gravito-electrostatic interaction in complex dust molecular clouds (DMCs) is a canonical mechanisms leading to the onset of astronomical structure formation dynamics. A semi-analytic generalized model is formulated to examine the collective effects of polarization force, Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity, and non-thermal (r, q)-distributed electrons on the stability of the PMGC concurrently. The ions are treated with the help of the Maxwellian thermo-statistical distribution law whereas the electrons are modelled with the non-thermal (r, q)-distribution law. The dust species including neutral and negatively charged particles are treated as fluids. A spherical normal mode analysis obtains a quartic linear dispersion relation for the PMGC. The oscillatory and propagation characteristics of the PMGC mode dynamics are investigated on a constructed numerical platform. It found that an increase in the polarization force and positive EiBI parameter significantly enhances the instability resulting in the DMC collapse, and vice versa. The electron non-thermality spectral parameters play a vital role as stabilizing factor. Its reliability and applicability are finally outlined in light of the previous astronomical studies in the same thematic direction.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Impact of openPMD on BIT1, a Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo Code, through Instrumentation, Monitoring, and In-Situ Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo simulations on large-scale systems play a fundamental role in understanding the complexities of plasma dynamics in fusion devices. Efficient handling and analysis of vast datasets are essential for advancing these simulations. Previously, we addressed this challenge by integrating openPMD with BIT1, a Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo code, streamlining data streaming and storage. This integration not only enhanced data management but also improved write throughput and storage efficiency. In this work, we delve deeper into the impact of BIT1 openPMD BP4 instrumentation, monitoring, and in-situ analysis. Utilizing cutting-edge profiling and monitoring tools such as gprof, CrayPat, Cray Apprentice2, IPM, and Darshan, we dissect BIT1's performance post-integration, shedding light on computation, communication, and I/O operations. Fine-grained instrumentation offers insights into BIT1's runtime behavior, while immediate monitoring aids in understanding system dynamics and resource utilization patterns, facilitating proactive performance optimization. Advanced visualization techniques further enrich our understanding, enabling the optimization of BIT1 simulation workflows aimed at controlling plasma-material interfaces with improved data analysis and visualization at every checkpoint without causing any interruption to the simulation.</description>

      <title>Discovering hidden physics using ML-based multimodal super-resolution measurement and its application to fusion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A non-linear complex system governed by multi-spatial and multi-temporal physics scales cannot be fully understood with a single diagnostic, as each provides only a partial view and much information is lost during data extraction. Combining multiple diagnostics also results in imperfect projections of the system's physics. By identifying hidden inter-correlations between diagnostics, we can leverage mutual support to fill in these gaps, but uncovering these inter-correlations analytically is too complex. We introduce a groundbreaking machine learning methodology to address this issue. Our multimodal approach generates super resolution data encompassing multiple physics phenomena, capturing detailed structural evolution and responses to perturbations previously unobservable. This methodology addresses a critical problem in fusion plasmas: the Edge Localized Mode (ELM), a plasma instability that can severely damage reactor walls. One method to stabilize ELM is using resonant magnetic perturbation to trigger magnetic islands. However, low spatial and temporal resolution of measurements limits the analysis of these magnetic islands due to their small size, rapid dynamics, and complex interactions within the plasma. With super-resolution diagnostics, we can experimentally verify theoretical models of magnetic islands for the first time, providing unprecedented insights into their role in ELM stabilization. This advancement aids in developing effective ELM suppression strategies for future fusion reactors like ITER and has broader applications, potentially revolutionizing diagnostics in fields such as astronomy, astrophysics, and medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Material Barriers to the Diffusion of the Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has identified objective (frame-indifferent) material barriers that inhibit the transport of dynamically active vectorial quantities (such as linear momentum, angular momentum and vorticity) in Navier-Stokes flows. In magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), a similar setting arises: the magnetic field vector impacts the evolution of the velocity field through the Lorentz force and hence is a dynamically active vector field. Here, we extend the theory of active material barriers from Navier-Stokes flows to MHD flows in order to locate frame-indifferent barriers to the diffusive transport of the magnetic field in turbulent two-dimensional and three-dimensional MHD flows. From this approach we obtain an algorithm for the automated extraction of such barriers from MHD turbulence data.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Heating and Parallel Heat Flux in Electron-only Magnetic Reconnection with Intense Guide Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-only reconnection is a process recently observed in the Earth's magnetosheath, where magnetic reconnection occurs at electron kinetic scales with only electrons involved. Electron-only reconnection is likely to have a significant impact on the energy conversion and dissipation of turbulence cascades at kinetic scales. This paper investigates electron-only reconnection under different intensities of strong guide fields via two-dimensional fully kinetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations, focusing on electron heating. The simulations are initialized with a force-free current sheet equilibrium under various intensities of strong guide fields. The quadrupolar structures of the out-of-plane magnetic field and asymmetric structures of density are found to become narrower in space as the guide field increases. Electron velocities are considerably larger than ion velocities, and the motion of both species is notably affected by the strength of guide fields. Similarly to previous experiments studies, electron temperature anisotropy along separatrices is observed, which is found to be mainly caused by the variations of parallel temperature. Both regions of anisotropy and parallel temperature increase/decrease along separatrices become thinner with increasing guide fields. Besides, we find a transition from a quadrupolar to a six-polar to an eight-polar structure in temperature anisotropy and parallel temperature as the guide field intensifies. Non-Maxwellian electron velocity distribution functions (EVDFs) at different locations in the three simulations are observed. Our results show that parallel electron velocity varies notably with different guide field intensities and strong parallel electron heat flux is observed.</description>
