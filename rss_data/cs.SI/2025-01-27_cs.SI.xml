      <title>QuanTaxo: A Quantum Approach to Self-Supervised Taxonomy Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A taxonomy is a hierarchical graph containing knowledge to provide valuable insights for various web applications. Online retail organizations like Microsoft and Amazon utilize taxonomies to improve product recommendations and optimize advertisement by enhancing query interpretation. However, the manual construction of taxonomies requires significant human effort. As web content continues to expand at an unprecedented pace, existing taxonomies risk becoming outdated, struggling to incorporate new and emerging information effectively. As a consequence, there is a growing need for dynamic taxonomy expansion to keep them relevant and up-to-date. Existing taxonomy expansion methods often rely on classical word embeddings to represent entities. However, these embeddings fall short in capturing hierarchical polysemy, where an entity's meaning can vary based on its position in the hierarchy and its surrounding context. To address this challenge, we introduce QuanTaxo, an innovative quantum-inspired framework for taxonomy expansion. QuanTaxo encodes entity representations in quantum space, effectively modeling hierarchical polysemy by leveraging the principles of Hilbert space to capture interference effects between entities, yielding richer and more nuanced representations. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets show that QuanTaxo significantly outperforms classical embedding models, achieving substantial improvements of 18.45% in accuracy, 20.5% in Mean Reciprocal Rank, and 17.87% in Wu &amp; Palmer metrics across eight classical embedding-based baselines. We further highlight the superiority of QuanTaxo through extensive ablation and case studies.</description>

      <title>Reddit Rules and Rulers: Quantifying the Link Between Rules and Perceptions of Governance across Thousands of Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rules are a critical component of the functioning of nearly every online community, yet it is challenging for community moderators to make data-driven decisions about what rules to set for their communities. The connection between a community's rules and how its membership feels about its governance is not well understood. In this work, we conduct the largest-to-date analysis of rules on Reddit, collecting a set of 67,545 unique rules across 5,225 communities which collectively account for more than 67% of all content on Reddit. More than just a point-in-time study, our work measures how communities change their rules over a 5+ year period. We develop a method to classify these rules using a taxonomy of 17 key attributes extended from previous work. We assess what types of rules are most prevalent, how rules are phrased, and how they vary across communities of different types. Using a dataset of communities' discussions about their governance, we are the first to identify the rules most strongly associated with positive community perceptions of governance: rules addressing who participates, how content is formatted and tagged, and rules about commercial activities. We conduct a longitudinal study to quantify the impact of adding new rules to communities, finding that after a rule is added, community perceptions of governance immediately improve, yet this effect diminishes after six months. Our results have important implications for platforms, moderators, and researchers. We make our classification model and rules datasets public to support future research on this topic.</description>

      <title>On the Homophily of Heterogeneous Graphs: Understanding and Unleashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homophily, the tendency of similar nodes to connect, is a fundamental phenomenon in network science and a critical factor in the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs). While existing studies primarily explore homophily in homogeneous graphs, where nodes share the same type, real-world networks are often more accurately modeled as heterogeneous graphs (HGs) with diverse node types and intricate cross-type interactions. This structural diversity complicates the analysis of homophily, as traditional homophily metrics fail to account for distinct label spaces across node types. To address this limitation, we introduce the Cross-Type Homophily Ratio, a novel metric that quantifies homophily based on the similarity of target information across different node types. Furthermore, we introduce Cross-Type Homophily-guided Heterogeneous Graph Pruning, a method designed to selectively remove low-homophily crosstype edges, thereby enhancing the Cross-Type Homophily Ratio and boosting the performance of heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). Extensive experiments on five real-world HG datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, which delivers up to 13.36% average relative performance improvement for HGNNs, offering a fresh perspective on cross-type homophily in heterogeneous graph learning.</description>

      <title>Towards Safer Social Media Platforms: Scalable and Performant Few-Shot Harmful Content Moderation Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of harmful content on social media platforms poses significant risks to users and society, necessitating more effective and scalable content moderation strategies. Current approaches rely on human moderators, supervised classifiers, and large volumes of training data, and often struggle with scalability, subjectivity, and the dynamic nature of harmful content (e.g., violent content, dangerous challenge trends, etc.). To bridge these gaps, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to undertake few-shot dynamic content moderation via in-context learning. Through extensive experiments on multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that our few-shot approaches can outperform existing proprietary baselines (Perspective and OpenAI Moderation) as well as prior state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods, in identifying harm. We also incorporate visual information (video thumbnails) and assess if different multimodal techniques improve model performance. Our results underscore the significant benefits of employing LLM based methods for scalable and dynamic harmful content moderation online.</description>

      <title>Re-ranking Using Large Language Models for Mitigating Exposure to Harmful Content on Social Media Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms utilize Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered recommendation algorithms to maximize user engagement, which can result in inadvertent exposure to harmful content. Current moderation efforts, reliant on classifiers trained with extensive human-annotated data, struggle with scalability and adapting to new forms of harm. To address these challenges, we propose a novel re-ranking approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our method dynamically assesses and re-ranks content sequences, effectively mitigating harmful content exposure without requiring extensive labeled data. Alongside traditional ranking metrics, we also introduce two new metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of re-ranking in reducing exposure to harmful content. Through experiments on three datasets, three models and across three configurations, we demonstrate that our LLM-based approach significantly outperforms existing proprietary moderation approaches, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for harm mitigation.</description>

      <title>PASER: A Physics-Inspired Theory for Stimulated Growth and Real-Time Optimization in On-Demand Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative framework for understanding on-demand platforms by quantifying positive network effects, trust, revenue dynamics, and the influence of demand on platform operations at per-minute or even per-second granularity. Drawing inspiration from physics, the framework provides both a theoretical and pragmatic perspective, offering a pictorial and quantitative representation of how on-demand platforms create value. It seeks to demystify their nuanced operations by providing practical, tangible, and highly applicable metrics, platform design templates, and real-time optimization tools for strategic what-if scenario planning. Its model demonstrates strong predictive power and is deeply rooted in raw data. The framework offers a deterministic insight into the workings of diverse platforms like Uber, Airbnb, and food delivery services. Furthermore, it generalizes to model all on-demand service platforms with cyclical operations. It works synergistically with machine learning, game theory, and agent-based models by providing a solid quantitative core rooted in raw data, based on physical truths, and is capable of delivering tangible predictions for real-time operational adjustments. The framework's mathematical model was rigorously validated using highly detailed historical data retrieved with near 100% certainty. Applying data-driven induction, distinct qualities were identified in big data sets via an iterative process. Through analogical thinking, a clear and highly intuitive mapping between the elements, operational principles, and dynamic behaviors of a well-known physical system was established to create a physics-inspired lens for Uber. This novel quantitative framework was named PASER (Profit Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Revenue), drawing an analogy to its physical counterpart, the LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation).</description>

      <title>Bi-directional Curriculum Learning for Graph Anomaly Detection: Dual Focus on Homogeneity and Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes from a graph that are significantly different from normal patterns. Most previous studies are model-driven, focusing on enhancing the detection effect by improving the model structure. However, these approaches often treat all nodes equally, neglecting the different contributions of various nodes to the training. Therefore, we introduce graph curriculum learning as a simple and effective plug-and-play module to optimize GAD methods. The existing graph curriculum learning mainly focuses on the homogeneity of graphs and treats nodes with high homogeneity as easy nodes. In fact, GAD models can handle not only graph homogeneity but also heterogeneity, which leads to the unsuitability of these existing methods. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Bi-directional Curriculum Learning strategy (BCL), which considers nodes with higher and lower similarity to neighbor nodes as simple nodes in the direction of focusing on homogeneity and focusing on heterogeneity, respectively, and prioritizes their training. Extensive experiments show that BCL can be quickly integrated into existing detection processes and significantly improves the performance of ten GAD anomaly detection models on seven commonly used datasets.</description>

      <title>Fast Think-on-Graph: Wider, Deeper and Faster Reasoning of Large Language Model on Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GRAG) is a novel paradigm that takes the naive RAG system a step further by integrating graph information, such as knowledge graph (KGs), into large-scale language models (LLMs) to mitigate hallucination. However, existing GRAG still encounter limitations: 1) simple paradigms usually fail with the complex problems due to the narrow and shallow correlations capture from KGs 2) methods of strong coupling with KGs tend to be high computation cost and time consuming if the graph is dense. In this paper, we propose the Fast Think-on-Graph (FastToG), an innovative paradigm for enabling LLMs to think ``community by community" within KGs. To do this, FastToG employs community detection for deeper correlation capture and two stages community pruning - coarse and fine pruning for faster retrieval. Furthermore, we also develop two Community-to-Text methods to convert the graph structure of communities into textual form for better understanding by LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FastToG, showcasing higher accuracy, faster reasoning, and better explainability compared to the previous works.</description>

      <title>Handling Heterophily in Recommender Systems with Wavelet Hypergraph Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems are pivotal in delivering personalised user experiences across various domains. However, capturing the heterophily patterns and the multi-dimensional nature of user-item interactions poses significant challenges. To address this, we introduce FWHDNN (Fusion-based Wavelet Hypergraph Diffusion Neural Networks), an innovative framework aimed at advancing representation learning in hypergraph-based recommendation tasks. The model incorporates three key components: (1) a cross-difference relation encoder leveraging heterophily-aware hypergraph diffusion to adapt message-passing for diverse class labels, (2) a multi-level cluster-wise encoder employing wavelet transform-based hypergraph neural network layers to capture multi-scale topological relationships, and (3) an integrated multi-modal fusion mechanism that combines structural and textual information through intermediate and late-fusion strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FWHDNN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and scalability in capturing high-order interconnections between users and items.</description>

      <title>Convergence of gradient based training for linear Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for addressing learning problems on graph structures, with a wide range of applications in molecular biology and social networks. However, the theoretical foundations underlying their empirical performance are not well understood. In this article, we examine the convergence of gradient dynamics in the training of linear GNNs. Specifically, we prove that the gradient flow training of a linear GNN with mean squared loss converges to the global minimum at an exponential rate. The convergence rate depends explicitly on the initial weights and the graph shift operator, which we validate on synthetic datasets from well-known graph models and real-world datasets. Furthermore, we discuss the gradient flow that minimizes the total weights at the global minimum. In addition to the gradient flow, we study the convergence of linear GNNs under gradient descent training, an iterative scheme viewed as a discretization of gradient flow.</description>

      <title>Avoiding Overfitting in Variable-Order Markov Models: a Cross-Validation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher$\text{-}$order Markov chain models are widely used to represent agent transitions in dynamic systems, such as passengers in transport networks. They capture transitions in complex systems by considering not only the current state but also the path of previously visited states. For example, the likelihood of train passengers traveling from Paris (current state) to Rome could increase significantly if their journey originated in Italy (prior state). Although this approach provides a more faithful representation of the system than first$\text{-}$order models, we find that commonly used methods$-$relying on Kullback$\text{-}$Leibler divergence$-$frequently overfit the data, mistaking fluctuations for higher$\text{-}$order dependencies and undermining forecasts and resource allocation. Here, we introduce DIVOP (Detection of Informative Variable$\text{-}$Order Paths), an algorithm that employs cross$\text{-}$validation to robustly distinguish meaningful higher$\text{-}$order dependencies from noise. In both synthetic and real$\text{-}$world datasets, DIVOP outperforms two state$\text{-}$of$\text{-}$the$\text{-}$art algorithms by achieving higher precision, recall, and sparser representations of the underlying dynamics. When applied to global corporate ownership data, DIVOP reveals that tax havens appear in 82$\%$ of all significant higher$\text{-}$order dependencies, underscoring their outsized influence in corporate networks. By mitigating overfitting, DIVOP enables more reliable multi$\text{-}$step predictions and decision$\text{-}$making, paving the way toward deeper insights into the hidden structures that drive modern interconnected systems.</description>

      <title>The Paradox of Intervention: Resilience in Adaptive Multi-Role Coordination Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex adaptive networks exhibit remarkable resilience, driven by the dynamic interplay of structure (interactions) and function (state). While static-network analyses offer valuable insights, understanding how structure and function co-evolve under external interventions is critical for explaining system-level adaptation. Using a unique dataset of clandestine criminal networks, we combine empirical observations with computational modeling to test the impact of various interventions on network adaptation. Our analysis examines how networks with specialized roles adapt and form emergent structures to optimize cost-benefit trade-offs. We find that emergent sparsely connected networks exhibit greater resilience, revealing a security-efficiency trade-off. Notably, interventions can trigger a "criminal opacity amplification" effect, where criminal activity increases despite reduced network visibility. While node isolation fragments networks, it strengthens remaining active ties. In contrast, deactivating nodes (analogous to social reintegration) can unintentionally boost criminal coordination, increasing activity or connectivity. Failed interventions often lead to temporary functional surges before reverting to baseline. Surprisingly, stimulating connectivity destabilizes networks. Effective interventions require precise calibration to node roles, connection types, and external conditions. These findings challenge conventional assumptions about connectivity and intervention efficacy in complex adaptive systems across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Condensation for Large-scale Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph condensation has emerged as an intriguing technique to save the expensive training costs of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by substituting a condensed small graph with the original graph. Despite the promising results achieved, previous methods usually employ an entangled paradigm of redundant parameters (nodes, edges, GNNs), which incurs complex joint optimization during condensation. This paradigm has considerably impeded the scalability of graph condensation, making it challenging to condense extremely large-scale graphs and generate high-fidelity condensed graphs. Therefore, we propose to disentangle the condensation process into a two-stage GNN-free paradigm, independently condensing nodes and generating edges while eliminating the need to optimize GNNs at the same time. The node condensation module avoids the complexity of GNNs by focusing on node feature alignment with anchors of the original graph, while the edge translation module constructs the edges of the condensed nodes by transferring the original structure knowledge with neighborhood anchors. This simple yet effective approach achieves at least 10 times faster than state-of-the-art methods with comparable accuracy on medium-scale graphs. Moreover, the proposed DisCo can successfully scale up to the Ogbn-papers100M graph containing over 100 million nodes with flexible reduction rates and improves performance on the second-largest Ogbn-products dataset by over 5%. Extensive downstream tasks and ablation study on five common datasets further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DisCo framework.

Abstract: Millions of online communities are governed by volunteer moderators, who shape their communities by setting and enforcing rules, recruiting additional moderators, and participating in the community themselves. These moderators must regularly make decisions about how to govern, yet measuring the 'success' of governance is complex and nuanced, making it challenging to determine what governance strategies are most successful. Furthermore, prior work has shown that communities have differing values, suggesting that 'one-size-fits-all' approaches to governance are unlikely to serve all communities well. In this work, we assess governance practices on reddit by classifying the sentiment of community members' public discussion of their own moderators. We label 1.89 million posts and comments made on reddit over an 18 month period. We relate these perceptions to characteristics of community governance, and to different actions that community moderators take. We identify types of communities where moderators are perceived particularly positively and negatively, and highlight promising strategies for moderator teams. Amongst other findings, we show that strict rule enforcement is linked to more favorable perceptions of moderators of communities dedicated to certain topics, such as news communities, than others. We investigate what kinds of moderators are associated with improved community perceptions upon their addition to a mod team, and find that moderators who are active community members before and during their mod tenures are seen more favorably. We make our models, anonymized datasets, and code public.</description>

      <title>An egonet-based approach to effective weighted network comparison</title>

Abstract: With the impressive growth of network models in practically every scientific and technological area, we are often faced with the need to compare graphs, i.e., to quantify their (dis)similarity using appropriate metrics. This is necessary, for example, to identify networks with comparable characteristics or to spot anomalous instants in a time sequence of graphs. While a large number of metrics are available for binary networks, the set of comparison methods capable of handling weighted graphs is much smaller. Yet, the strength of connections is often a key ingredient of the model, and ignoring this information could lead to misleading results. In this paper we introduce a family of dissimilarity measures to compare undirected weighted networks. They fall into the class of alignment-free metrics: as such, they do not require the correspondence of the nodes between the two graphs and can also compare networks of different sizes. In short, they are based on the distributions, on the graph, of a few egonet features which are easily defined and computed: the distance between two graphs is then the distance between the corresponding distributions. On a properly defined testbed with a pool of weighted network models with diversified characteristics, the proposed metrics are shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in the model classification task. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed metrics are then demonstrated on two examples. In the first, some "filtering" schemes -- designed to eliminate non-significant links while maintaining most of the total weight -- are evaluated in their ability to produce as output a graph faithful to the original, in terms of the local structure around nodes. In the second example, analyzing a timeline of stock market correlation graphs highlights anomalies associated with periods of financial instability.</description>

      <title>Leveraging heterogeneous spillover in maximizing contextual bandit rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems relying on contextual multi-armed bandits continuously improve relevant item recommendations by taking into account the contextual information. The objective of bandit algorithms is to learn the best arm (e.g., best item to recommend) for each user and thus maximize the cumulative rewards from user engagement with the recommendations. The context that these algorithms typically consider are the user and item attributes. However, in the context of social networks where $\textit{the action of one user can influence the actions and rewards of other users,}$ neighbors' actions are also a very important context, as they can have not only predictive power but also can impact future rewards through spillover. Moreover, influence susceptibility can vary for different people based on their preferences and the closeness of ties to other users which leads to heterogeneity in the spillover effects. Here, we present a framework that allows contextual multi-armed bandits to account for such heterogeneous spillovers when choosing the best arm for each user. Our experiments on several semi-synthetic and real-world datasets show that our framework leads to significantly higher rewards than existing state-of-the-art solutions that ignore the network information and potential spillover.</description>

      <title>Differential impact from individual versus collective misinformation tagging on the diversity of Twitter (X) information engagement and mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11282</link>

Abstract: Fears about the destabilizing impact of misinformation online have motivated individuals and platforms to respond. Individuals have increasingly challenged others' online claims with fact-checks in pursuit of a healthier information ecosystem and to break down echo chambers of self-reinforcing opinion. Using Twitter (now X) data, here we show the consequences of individual misinformation tagging: tagged posters had explored novel political information and expanded topical interests immediately prior, but being tagged caused posters to retreat into information bubbles. These unintended consequences were softened by a collective verification system for misinformation moderation. In Twitter's new feature, Community Notes, misinformation tagging was peer-reviewed by other fact-checkers before revelation to the poster. With collective misinformation tagging, posters were less likely to retreat from diverse information engagement. Detailed comparison demonstrated differences in toxicity, sentiment, readability, and delay in individual versus collective misinformation tagging messages. These findings provide evidence for differential impacts from individual versus collective moderation strategies on the diversity of information engagement and mobility across the information ecosystem.</description>

      <title>DarkGram: A Large-Scale Analysis of Cybercriminal Activity Channels on Telegram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first large-scale analysis of 339 cybercriminal activity channels (CACs). Followed by over 23.8 million users, these channels share a wide array of malicious and unethical content with their subscribers, including compromised credentials, pirated software and media, social media manipulation tools, and blackhat hacking resources such as malware, exploit kits, and social engineering scams. To evaluate these channels, we developed DarkGram, a BERT-based framework that automatically identifies malicious posts from the CACs with an accuracy of 96%. Using DarkGram, we conducted a quantitative analysis of 53,605 posts shared on these channels between February and May 2024, revealing key characteristics of the content. While much of this content is distributed for free, channel administrators frequently employ strategies such as promotions and giveaways to engage users and boost the sales of premium cybercriminal content. Interestingly, these channels sometimes pose significant risks to their own subscribers. Notably, 28.1% of the links shared in these channels contained phishing attacks, and 38% of executable files were bundled with malware. Analyzing how subscribers consume and positively react to the shared content paints a dangerous picture of the perpetuation of cybercriminal content at scale. We also found that the CACs can evade scrutiny or platform takedowns by quickly migrating to new channels with minimal subscriber loss, highlighting the resilience of this ecosystem. To counteract this, we utilized DarkGram to detect emerging channels and reported malicious content to Telegram and affected organizations. This resulted in the takedown of 196 channels over three months. Our findings underscore the urgent need for coordinated efforts to combat the growing threats posed by these channels. To aid this effort, we open-source our dataset and the DarkGram framework.</description>
