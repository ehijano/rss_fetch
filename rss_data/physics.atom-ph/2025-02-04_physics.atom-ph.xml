      <title>Relativistic configuration-interaction and coupled-cluster calculations of Ir$^{17+}$ transition energies and properties for optical clock applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition energies and properties of the Ir$^{17+}$ ion are calculated using the Kramers-restricted configuration-interaction (KRCI) and Fock-space coupled-cluster (FSCC) methods within the Dirac-Coulomb-Gaunt Hamiltonian framework. These calculations show several forbidden optical transitions between the $4f^{13}5s$ ground state and the $4f^{14}$ and $4f^{12}5s^2$ excited states, underscoring their potential as candidates for optical clock applications. Additionally, key properties of the ground and low-lying excited states are reported, including Lande $g_J$ factors, lifetimes, electric dipole polarizabilities, electric quadrupole moments, hyperfine structure constants, relativistic sensitivities, Lorentz-invariance coefficient tensor, and isotope shifts. The excellent agreement between the results from the KRCI and FSCC methods demonstrates the robustness of the calculations and confirms the reliability of the proposed clock transitions.</description>

      <title>A new approach to include electron interaction effects in super transition array opacity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method is presented for the improved calculation of super-shell partition functions which include the repulsive electron-electron interaction energy terms in the Boltzmann factor. Heretofore these interaction terms were approximately treated via the use of Feynman-Jensen inequalities. Such investigations are of particular interest for the super-transition-array approach of hot-plasma radiative opacity.</description>

      <title>Clarifying Self Seed in 391-nm N$_2^{+}$ Air Lasing by Vectorially Structured Light Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single intense near-infrared femtosecond laser beam can generate ultraviolet N$_2^{+}$ lasing at 391 nm in the air, offering a promising tool for remote sensing. One of the key debates regarding its mechanism is whether it is seeded by a self-generated spectral component, such as the second harmonic, which is inevitably produced by the charge gradient in the laser plasma filament. In this study, we generated both radially and azimuthally polarized N$_2^{+}$ lasing at 391 nm, in contrast to that the second harmonic in argon is found near zero at the azimuthal polarization case. By characterizing the spatial phase distribution of the radially polarized 391-nm lasing, we concluded that the phase of the 391-nm lasing aligns with the driving field, thereby ruling out the hypothesis of self-seeding by the second harmonic. Our work also provides a promising method to remotely generate vectorially structured ultraviolet light fields.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Magnetic Evaporative Beamline Cooling for Preparation of Cold Atomic Beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most sensitive direct neutrino mass searches today are based on measurement of the endpoint of the beta spectrum of tritium to infer limits on the mass of the unobserved recoiling neutrino. To avoid the smearing associated with the distribution of molecular final states in the T-He molecule, the next generation of these experiments will need to employ atomic (T) rather than molecular (T$_{2}$) tritium sources. Following production, atomic T can be trapped in gravitational and / or magnetic bottles for beta spectrum experiments, if and only if it can first be cooled to millikelvin temperatures. Accomplishing this cooling presents substantial technological challenges. The Project 8 collaboration is developing a technique based on magnetic evaporative cooling along a beamline (MECB) for the purpose of cooling T to feed a magneto-gravitational trap that also serves as a cyclotron radiation emission spectroscope. Initial tests of the approach are planned in a pathfinder apparatus using atomic Li. This paper presents a method for analyzing the dynamics of the MECB technique, and applies these calculations to the design of systems for cooling and slowing of atomic Li and T. A scheme is outlined that could provide a current of T at the millikelvin temperatures required for the Project 8 neutrino mass search.</description>

      <title>Structural Dynamics and Strong Correlations in Dynamical Quantum Optical Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When placing an ultracold atomic gas inside a cavity, the light-matter coupling is enhanced and nonlinear atomic dynamics are generated, offering a promising platform for quantum simulation of models with short- and long-range interactions. Recently, superradiant self organized phases for ultracold atomic gases inside a cavity, pumped by a blue detuned optical lattice, have been observed. Here, we explore the formation of quantum many-body phases with strongly interacting bosonic atoms inside an optical cavity, subject to transverse blue detuned pumping. We analyze the interplay between superradiant self-organization with superfluid and Mott insulator phases, without the need of including higher lying bands, as the Wannier functions are dynamically linked to the cavity light via backaction. We observe different kinds of structural phase transitions driven by the light inside the cavity and the interplay with atomic collisions. We observe the mode softening at the critical points in the quantum phase transitions which can be measured in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Hybrid sub- and superradiant states in emitter arrays with quantized motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensembles of dipolar emitters which couple collectively to the radiation field display sub- and superradiance. These terms refer to a reduction or an enhancement of photon emission rates due to the interference of emission channels. Arrays of trapped neutral atoms constitute a promising platform for harnessing this phenomenon in technological applications, e.g. for excitation storage, single-photon switches and mirrors. However, vibrational motion of the atoms within their traps leads to position fluctuations that entangle the motion and the internal atomic degrees of freedom, which is expected to affect the collective photon emission. We develop here a theory for collective atom-light coupling in the presence of this quantized motion within the Lamb-Dicke limit. We show the existence of sub- and superradiant states, which are hybrids of electronic and vibrational excitations and explore their properties for analytically and numerically efficiently solvable cases.</description>

      <title>Magic running- and standing-wave optical traps for Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic trapping of ground and Rydberg states, which equalizes the AC Stark shifts of these two levels, enables increased ground-to-Rydberg state coherence times. We measure via photon storage and retrieval how the ground-to-Rydberg state coherence depends on trap wavelength for two different traps and find different optimal wavelengths for a one-dimensional optical lattice trap and a running wave optical dipole trap. Comparison to theory reveals that this is caused by the Rydberg electron sampling different potential landscapes. The observed difference increases for higher principal quantum numbers, where the extent of the Rydberg electron wave function becomes larger than the optical lattice period. Our analysis shows that optimal magic trapping conditions depend on the trap geometry, in particular for optical lattices and tweezers.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Bayesian optimization in deep cooling atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser cooling, which cools atomic and molecular gases to near absolute zero, is the crucial initial step for nearly all atomic gas experiments. However, fast achievement of numerous sub-$\mu$K cold atoms is challenging. To resolve the issue, we propose and experimentally validate an intelligent polarization gradient cooling approach enhanced by optical lattice, utilizing Maximum Hypersphere Compensation Sampling Bayesian Optimization (MHCS-BO). MHCS-BO demonstrates a twofold increase in optimization efficiency and superior prediction accuracy compared to conventional Bayesian optimization. Finally, approximate $10^8$ cold atoms at a temperature of 0.4$\pm$0.2 $\mu$K can be achieved given the optimal parameters within 15 minutes. Our work provides an intelligent protocol, which can be generalized to other high-dimension parameter optimization problems, and paves way for preparation of ultracold atom in quantum experiments.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate trapping of individual rubidium (Rb) and cesium (Cs) atoms in an interleaved array of bright tweezers and dark bottle-beam traps, using a microfabricated optical element illuminated by a single laser beam. This trapping approach is simple and robust compared to common approaches that use active optoelectronic components and multiple laser wavelengths, and can be easily adapted for other atomic species.</description>

      <title>SU(N) magnetism with ultracold molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry are paradigmatic settings for quantum many-body physics. They have been studied for the insights they provide into complex materials and their ability to stabilize exotic ground states. Ultracold alkaline-earth atoms were predicted to exhibit SU($N$) symmetry for $N=2I+1=1,2,\ldots,10$, where $I$ is the nuclear spin. Subsequent experiments have revealed rich many-body physics. However, alkaline-earth atoms realize this symmetry only for fermions with repulsive interactions. In this paper, we predict that ultracold molecules shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields or microwaves exhibit SU($N$) symmetry, which holds because deviations of the s-wave scattering length from the spin-free values are only about 3\% for CaF with static-field shielding and are estimated to be even smaller for bialkali molecules. They open the door to $N$ as large as $32$ for bosons and $36$ for fermions. They offer important features unachievable with atoms, including bosonic systems and attractive interactions.</description>

      <title>Efficient preparation of entangled states in cavity QED with Grover's algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to employ the amplification mechanism of Grover's search algorithm to efficiently prepare entangled states of an ensemble of qubits. The conditional change of sign employed in the algorithm can be implemented by the phase shift of photons scattered on an optical cavity hosting an atomic ensemble. We show that collective Dicke states, GHZ states, and Schr\"odinger cat superpositions of $N$ atoms may be prepared deterministically by few ($\sim N^{1/4}$) photon scattering events without individual addressing of the atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that iteration of a few ( $\sim N^{1/4}$) unitary steps of Grover's algorithm suffices to perfectly prepare a Dicke state of $N$ atoms in a cavity. We also show that a few subsequent Grover steps can be employed to generate GHZ and Cat states. The Grover iteration is physically realized by global qubit rotations and by the phase shift of single photons reflected on the cavity. Our protocols are deterministic and require no individual addressing of the atoms. A detailed error analysis accounting for spatial mode matching of the photon to the cavity, spontaneous emission, mirror scattering, and the finite bandwidth of the photon mode is used to predict the fidelity of the prepared states as a function of system parameters and atom-cavity cooperativity. The fidelity can be increased by heralding on detection of the reflected photon.</description>
