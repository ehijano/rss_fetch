      <title>Inferring Magnetic Field Morphology and Dust Scattering Geometry from Mid-IR Polarimetry: the Extended Aitken Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Aitken method is a useful approach for decomposing mid-IR polarimetry of silicates into emissive and absorptive components along the line-of-sight in astronomical sources. Here we extend this method to include the effects of polarization caused by scattering from graphite or similar particles located along the same sightlines. To illustrate the application of the extended method, we apply it in the reduction and analysis of CanariCam multi-wavelength imaging polarimetry observations of the Egg Nebula, W3 IRS5, and W51 IRS2, and also spectropolarimetry of W3 IRS5. We compare these results to those obtained with the original Aitken method and show that the data are generally fit much better when this third component, i.e., scattering, is incorporated into the analysis. Including scattering in the decomposition of polarimetry produces better results for the emissive and absorptive components, and in particular for the position angle (PA) of those polarization components. The distribution of the difference between absorptive PA and emissive PA is then found to be more peaked at a fixed angle, nearly perpendicular. This supports the theory that mid-IR polarization arises from elongated dust grains aligned along magnetic field lines, since then the PA of emissive and absorptive polarization would be approximately perpendicular. When significant scattering is not present the extended Aitken method produces the same results as the original method.</description>

      <title>A Multi-station Meteor Monitoring (M$^3$) System. I. Design and Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meteors carry important and indispensable information about the interplanetary environment, which can be used to understand the origin and evolution of our solar system. We have developed a Multi-station Meteor Monitoring ($\rm M^3$) system that can observe almost the entire sky and detect meteors automatically, and it determines their trajectories. They are highly extensible to construct a large-scale network. Each station consists of a waterproof casing, a wide field-of-view lens with a CMOS camera, and a supporting computer. The camera has a built-in GPS module for accurately timing the meteoroid entry into the atmosphere (accurate to 1 $\mu$s), which is the most prominent characteristic compared with other existing meteor monitoring devices. We have also developed a software package that can efficiently identify and measure meteors appearing in the real-time video stream and compute the orbits of meteoroids in the solar system via multi-station observations. During the Geminid meteor shower in 2021, the M$^3$ system was tested at two stations ($\sim$55 km apart) in the suburbs of Beijing. The test results show that the astrometric accuracy is about 0.3-0.4 arcmin. About 800 meteors were detected by these two stations. A total of 473 meteors have their orbits calculated by our software, and 377 of them belong to the Geminid meteoroid stream. Our M$^3$ system will be further tested and upgraded, and it will be used to construct a large monitoring network in China in the future.</description>

      <title>AstroMLab 2: AstroLLaMA-2-70B Model and Benchmarking Specialised LLMs for Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual pretraining of large language models on domain-specific data has been proposed to enhance performance on downstream tasks. In astronomy, the previous absence of astronomy-focused benchmarks has hindered objective evaluation of these specialized LLM models. Leveraging a recent initiative to curate high-quality astronomical MCQs, this study aims to quantitatively assess specialized LLMs in astronomy. We find that the previously released AstroLLaMA series, based on LLaMA-2-7B, underperforms compared to the base model. We demonstrate that this performance degradation can be partially mitigated by utilizing high-quality data for continual pretraining, such as summarized text from arXiv. Despite the observed catastrophic forgetting in smaller models, our results indicate that continual pretraining on the 70B model can yield significant improvements. However, the current supervised fine-tuning dataset still constrains the performance of instruct models. In conjunction with this study, we introduce a new set of models, AstroLLaMA-3-8B and AstroLLaMA-2-70B, building upon the previous AstroLLaMA series.</description>

      <title>Converting the ANU 2.3 telescope to fully automated operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operation of the ANU 2.3m telescope transitioned from classically scheduled remote observing to fully autonomous queue scheduled observing in March 2023. The instrument currently supported is WiFeS, a visible-light low-resolution image-slicing integral field spectrograph with a 25''x 38'' field of view (offering precision spectrophotometry free from aperture effects). It is highly suitable for rapid spectroscopic follow-up of astronomical transient events and regular cadence observations. The new control system implements flexible queue scheduling and supports rapid response override for Target-of-Opportunity observations. The ANU 2.3m is the largest optical telescope to have been retro-fitted for autonomous operation to date, and it remains a national facility servicing a broad range of science cases. We present an overview of the automated control system and report on the first six months of continuous operation.</description>

      <title>What is the Role of Large Language Models in the Evolution of Astronomy Research?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ChatGPT and other state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming multiple fields, offering powerful tools for a wide range of applications. These models, commonly trained on vast datasets, exhibit human-like text generation capabilities, making them useful for research tasks such as ideation, literature review, coding, drafting, and outreach. We conducted a study involving 13 astronomers at different career stages and research fields to explore LLM applications across diverse tasks over several months and to evaluate their performance in research-related activities. This work was accompanied by an anonymous survey assessing participants' experiences and attitudes towards LLMs. We provide a detailed analysis of the tasks attempted and the survey answers, along with specific output examples. Our findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in supporting research while also addressing general and research-specific ethical considerations. We conclude with a series of recommendations, emphasizing the need for researchers to complement LLMs with critical thinking and domain expertise, ensuring these tools serve as aids rather than substitutes for rigorous scientific inquiry.</description>

      <title>KISS: instrument description and performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) have been proven as reliable systems for astrophysical observations, especially in the millimetre range. Their compact size enables to optimally fill the focal plane, thus boosting sensitivity. The KISS (KIDs Interferometric Spectral Surveyor) instrument is a millimetre camera that consists of two KID arrays of 316 pixels each coupled to a Martin-Puplett interferometer (MPI). The addition of the MPI grants the KIDs camera the ability to provide spectral information in the 100 and 300 GHz range. In this paper we report the main properties of the KISS instrument and its observations. We also describe the calibration and data analysis procedures used. We present a complete model of the observed data including the sky signal and several identified systematics. We have developed a full photometric and spectroscopic data analysis pipeline that translates our observations into science-ready products. We show examples of the results of this pipeline on selected sources: Moon, Jupiter and Venus. We note the presence of a deficit of response with respect to expectations and laboratory measurements. The detectors noise level is consistent with values obtained during laboratory measurements, pointing to a sub-optimal coupling between the instrument and the telescope as the most probable origin for the problem. This deficit is large enough as to prevent the detection of galaxy clusters, which were KISS main scientific objective. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated the feasibility of this kind of instrument, in the prospect for other KID interferometers (such as the CONCERTO instrument). As this regard, we have developed key instrumental technologies such as optical conception, readout electronics and raw calibration procedures, as well as, adapted data analysis procedures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observed magnitudes of Qianfan spacecraft range from 4 when they are near zenith to 8 when low in the sky. Nearly all of the observations can be modeled with a nadir-facing flat antenna panel and the underside of a zenith-facing solar array, both with Lambertian reflectance properties. These satellites will impact astronomical research unless their brightness is reduced.</description>

      <title>Crater Projection in Linear Pushbroom Camera Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific imaging of the Moon, Mars, and other celestial bodies is often accomplished with pushbroom cameras. Craters with elliptical rims are common objects of interest within the images produced by such sensors. This work provides a framework to analyze the appearance of crater rims in pushbroom images. With knowledge of only common ellipse parameters describing the crater rim, explicit formulations are developed and shown to be convenient for drawing the apparent crater in pushbroom images. Implicit forms are also developed and indicate the orbital conditions under which craters form conics in images. Several numerical examples are provided which demonstrate how different forms of crater rim projections can be interpreted and used in practice.</description>

      <title>Preservaci\'on de la memoria colectiva-cient\'ifica, en la astronom\'ia argentina, desde el Observatorio de La Plata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work describes the rescue and enhancement of several thousand spectrophotometric plates from the La Plata Observatory. These plates and their attached handwritten documents, date from the beginning of the 20th century and contain information on observations made at different observatories around the world. Due to their fragility and the inevitable deterioration produced by the passage of time, they are being cleaned up, recovered and digitized. The information contained in the plates has a high scientific value and, based on a comparison of an old spectrum with a current one, part of the history of the star can be reconstructed. Through the ReTrOH project, we seek to translate the document into an appropriate format, preserve and disseminate that knowledge, and also recover the scientific project and the historical and personal context of the observers. The digitized spectra are available in the virtual repository (SEDICI) of the UNLP.</description>

      <title>Incorporating model accuracy into gravitational-wave Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring the properties of colliding black holes from gravitational-wave observations is subject to systematic errors arising from modelling uncertainties. Although the accuracy of each model can be calculated through comparison to theoretical expectations from general relativity, Bayesian analyses are yet to incorporate this information. As such, a mixture model is typically used where results obtained with different gravitational-wave models are combined with either equal weight, or based on their relative Bayesian evidence. In this work we present a novel method to incorporate the accuracy of multiple models in gravitational-wave Bayesian analyses. By analysing simulated gravitational-wave signals in zero-noise, we show that our technique uses $30\%$ less computational resources, and more faithfully recovers the true parameters than existing techniques. We envisage that this method will become an essential tool within ground-based gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>The anti-glitching gamma-ray pulsar PSR J1522-5735</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. A small number of pulsar glitches have been identified as anti-glitches or spin-down glitches, where the overall contribution to the pulsar's rotation frequency is negative. A notable example of a spin-down glitch was observed in PSR 1522-5735, a radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar discovered by blind searches in the 3-year data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Aims. This work aims to search for PSR 1522-5735's glitches using Fermi-LAT data from over 15 years of observations. Methods. The weighted H-test statistic was applied to identify glitches and evaluate the related changes in pulsar's spin parameters. The timing solution based on these results was further refined by maximization of the unbinned likelihood. The Bayesian information criterion was used to set an appropriate number of parameters in the timing solution to avoid overfitting. Results. The analysis revealed eight glitch events: regular spin-up glitch, spin-up glitch over-recovered to a spin-down and six anti-glitches. These events were radiatively quiet, exhibiting no significant variations in the shape of the pulse profile or energy flux. Conclusions. The results may suggest that an internal mechanism is responsible for spin-down glitch phenomena.</description>

      <title>Perspectives and challenges in bolide infrasound processing and interpretation: A focused review with case studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrasound sensing plays a critical role in the detection and analysis of bolides, offering passive, cost-effective global monitoring capabilities. Key objectives include determining the timing, location, and yield of these events. Achieving these goals requires a robust approach to detect, analyze, and interpret rapidly moving elevated sources such as bolides (also re-entry and space debris). In light of advancements in infrasonic methodologies, there is a need for a comprehensive overview of the characteristics that distinguish bolides from other infrasound sources, and methodologies for bolide infrasound analysis. This paper provides a focused review of key considerations and presents a unified framework to enhance infrasound processing approaches specifically tailored for bolides. Three representative case studies are presented to demonstrate the practical application of infrasound processing methodologies and deriving source parameters, while exploring challenges associated with bolide-generated infrasound. These case studies underscore the effectiveness of infrasound in determining source parameters and highlight interpretative challenges, such as variations in signal period measurements across different studies. Future research should place emphasis on improving geolocation and yield accuracy. This can be achieved through rigorous and systematic analyses of large, statistically significant samples of such events. aiming to resolve interpretative inconsistencies and explore the causes for variability in signal periods and back azimuths. The topic described here is also relevant to space exploration involving planetary bodies with atmospheres, such as Venus, Mars, and Titan.</description>

      <title>On the simultaneity of Forbush decreases: the simultaneous effects of interplanetary parameters and geomagnetic activity indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forbush decreases (Fd) are transient, short-term reductions in the intensity of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth's surface. When this reduction is observed at multiple locations at the same time, it is referred to as simultaneous Forbush decreases (SFd). Identifying Fd events in daily averaged Cosmic ray (CR) raw data is always tedious, but the task has gone minimal through an algorithm (automated Fd detection). We deployed an automated Fd location algorithm on daily-averaged CR data from five neutron monitor stations covering the period 1998 to 2006. We identified 80 days with the most simultaneous events. While there exists extensive research on the subject using a case study approach, the current study is statistical. Whereas most of the previous investigations employed a small sample of Fds manually selected from a single CR station, large samples of Fds, selected after disentangling the Sun's influence on CR data from multiple neutron monitors (MNs) are used. The connection between the Fds and many solar-terrestrial variables is tested. The beautiful and consistent results obtained between the space weather variables and Fds at the five NM stations call the attention of space weather researchers to the need for rigorous, detailed, and accurate cataloging of Fds. Solar cycle oscillation significantly impacts the amplitude and timing of Fds. Its influence should be removed before Fd selection.</description>

      <title>A search for the ultra high energy neutrinos with the low threshold phased array trigger system of the Askaryan Radio Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is an in-ice ultra high energy (UHE, $&gt;10$ PeV) neutrino experiment at the South Pole that aims to detect UHE neutrino-induced radio emission in ice. ARA consists of five independent stations each consisting of a cubical lattice of in-ice antenna clusters with a side length of $\sim$10 m buried at $\sim$200 m below the ice surface. The fifth station of ARA (A5) is special as this station has an additional central string, the phased array (PA), which provides an interferometric trigger that enables ARA to trigger on weak signals that are otherwise buried in noise. Leveraging the low threshold phased array trigger, ARA was the first radio neutrino experiment to demonstrate significant improvement in sensitivity to weak signals. In this contribution, we present initial results from a neutrino search combining information from both the traditional station antennas and the phased array antennas of the A5 station. We show the improved vertex reconstruction achieved with this approach, and leveraging this improvement, we expect to enhance the analysis efficiency beyond what has been achieved previously by ARA. This analysis is the paradigmatic representation of future neutrino searches with the next generation of in-ice neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>The Necessity of Individually Validated Beam Models for an Interferometric Epoch of Reionization Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A first statistical detection of the 21-cm Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is on the horizon, as cosmological volumes of the Universe become accessible via the adoption of low-frequency interferometers. We explore the impact which non-identical instrumental beam responses can have on the calibrated power spectrum and a future EoR detection. All-sky satellite measurements of Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) beams have revealed significant sidelobe deviations from cutting-edge electromagnetic simulations at the ~10% zenith power level. By generating physically motivated deformed beam models, we emulate real measurements of the MWA which inherently encode the imprints of varied beams. We explore two calibration strategies: using a single beam model across the array, or using a full set of deformed beams. Our simulations demonstrate beam-induced leakage of foreground power into theoretically uncontaminated modes, at levels which exceed the expected cosmological signal by factors of over ~1000 between the modes k=0.1-1 $hMpc^{-1}$. We also show that this foreground leakage can be mitigated by including measured models of varied beams into calibration frameworks, reducing the foreground leakage to a sub-dominant effect and potentially unveiling the EoR. Finally, we outline the future steps necessary to make this approach applicable to real measurements by radio interferometers.</description>

      <title>Development of a Machine Learning based Radio source localisation algorithm for Tri-axial antenna configuration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately determining the origin of radio emissions is essential for numerous scientific experiments, particularly in radio astronomy. Conventional techniques, such as the use of antenna arrays encounter significant challenges, specially at very low frequencies, due to factors like the substantial size of the antennas and ionospheric interference. To address these challenges, we employ a space-based single-telescope that utilizes co-located antennas, complemented by goniopolarimetric techniques for precise source localization. This study explores a novel and elementary machine learning (ML) technique as a way to improve and estimate Direction of Arrival (DoA), leveraging a tri-axial antenna arrangement for radio source localization. Employing a simplistic emission and receiving antenna model, our study involves training an artificial neural network (ANN) using synthetic radio signals. These synthetic signals can originate from any location in the sky and cover an incoherent frequency range of 0.3 to 30 MHz, with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between 0 and 60 dB. Then, a large data set was generated to train the ANN model catering to the possible signal configurations and variations. After training, the developed ANN model demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving loss levels in the training ($\sim0.02$), validation ($\sim0.23\%$), and testing ($\sim0.21\%$) phases. The machine learning-based approach remarkably, exhibits substantially quicker inference times ($\sim5$ ms) in contrast to analytically derived Direction of Arrival (DoA) methods, which typically range from 100 ms to a few seconds. This underscores its practicality for real-time applications in radio source localization, particularly in scenarios with limited number of sensors.</description>

      <title>On the rework and development of new Geant4 Cherenkov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent experiment showed that a Cherenkov radiation spectrum from thin radiators possessing frequency dispersion could transform into quasi-monochromatic spectral lines. Simulations based on the standard Geant4 toolkit could not correctly describe the experimental results because Geant4 uses the traditional Frank-Tamm theory developed for an ideal (infinitely thick) radiator. Because of that, our endeavors in this paper are to present a new way of utilizing Cherenkov radiation using new Gneat4 models, while the paper should be used as a helping text to understand the Cherenkov process in Geant4 and what one can expect out of new models. Now, one can analyze quasi-monochromatic Cherenkov spectral lines using Geant4, which is a significant milestone for investigating the possibilities of this technique.</description>

      <title>A Unified Multi-Wavelength Data Analysis Workflow with gammapy. Constraining the Broadband Emission of FSRQ OP 313</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar OP~313 entered an enhanced activity phase in November 2023 and has undergone multiple flares since then which have motivated the organisation of several large multi-wavelength campaigns, including two deep observations from the hard X-ray telescope NuSTAR. The broadband emission from OP~313 during these two observations is investigated under a new unified analysis framework, with data spanning from optical to gamma rays. Traditional methods for analyzing blazar emissions often rely on proprietary software tailored to specific instruments, making it challenging to integrate and interpret data from multi-wavelength campaigns comprehensively. This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing gammapy, an open-source Python package, and common data formats originally developed for gamma-ray instrumentation, to perform a consistent multi-instrument analysis. This enables a forward folding approach that fully incorporates source observations, detector responses, and various instrumental and astrophysical backgrounds. The methodology is applied as an example to recent data collected from the distant quasar OP~313. We present a comprehensive data reconstruction and analysis for instruments including the Liverpool Telescope's IO:O detector, Swift-UVOT, Swift-XRT, NuSTAR, and Fermi-LAT. The resulting spectral analysis is validated against the native tools for each instrument. Additionally, a multi-wavelength phenomenological model of the source emission, encompassing optical to gamma-ray bands, is developed, incorporating absorption components across different energy regimes. We introduce and validate a new unified framework for multi-wavelength forward folding data analysis based on gammapy and open data formats, demonstrating its application to spectral data from the quasar OP~313.</description>

      <title>Implications of in-ice volume scattering for radio-frequency neutrino experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last three decades, several experimental initiatives have been launched with the goal of observing radio-frequency signals produced by ultra-high energy neutrinos (UHEN) interacting in solid media. Observed neutrino event signatures comprise impulsive signals with duration of order the inverse of the antenna+system bandwidth ($\sim$10 ns), superimposed upon an incoherent (typically white noise) thermal noise spectrum. Whereas bulk volume scattering (VS) of radio-frequency (RF) signals is well-studied within the radio-glaciological communities, polar ice-based neutrino-detection experiments have thus far neglected VS in their signal projections. As discussed herein, coherent volume scattering (CVS, for which the phase of the incident signal is preserved during scattering) generated by in-ice neutrino interactions may similarly produce short-duration signal-like power, albeit with a slightly extended time structure, and thereby enhance neutrino detection rates, whereas incoherent (randomized phase) volume scattering (IVS) will persist for O(100 ns), appearing similar to thermal white noise and therefore reducing the measured Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of neutrino signals. Herein, we present the expected voltage profiles resulting from in-ice volume scattering as a function of the molecular scattering cross-section, for both CVS and IVS, and assess their impact on UHEN experiments. VS contributions are currently only weakly constrained by extant data; stronger limits may be obtained with dedicated calibration experiments.</description>

      <title>Generalized flow-composed symplectic methods for post-Newtonian Hamiltonian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the nonseparability of the post-Newtonian (PN) Hamiltonian systems of compact objects, the symplectic methods that admit the linear error growth and the near preservation of first integrals are always implicit as explicit symplectic methods have not been currently found for general nonseparable Hamiltonian systems. Since the PN Hamiltonian has a particular formulation that includes a dominant Newtonian part and a perturbation PN part, we present the generalized flow-composed Runge--Kutta (GFCRK) method with a free parameter $\lambda$ to PN Hamiltonian systems. It is shown that the GFCRK method is symplectic once the underlying RK method is symplectic, and it is symmetric once the underlying RK method is symmetric under the setting $\lambda=1/2$. Numerical experiments with the 2PN Hamiltonian of spinning compact binaries demonstrate the higher accuracy and efficiency of the symplectic GFCRK method than the underlying symplectic RK method in the case of weak PN effect. Meanwhile, the numerical results also support higher efficiency of the symplectic GFCRK method than the semi-explicit mixed symplectic method of the same order.</description>

      <title>Radiopurity of NaI(Tl) crystals for PICOLON dark matter experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dark matter observation claim by the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration has been a long-standing puzzle within the particle physics community. Efforts of other research groups to verify the claim have been insufficient by significant radioactivity of present NaI(Tl) crystals. PICOLON (Pure Inorganic Crystal Observatory for LOw-energy Neut(ra)lino) experiment conducts independent search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) using NaI(Tl) crystals. Our NaI(Tl) crystal manufactured in 2020 (Ingot #85) reached the same purity level as DAMA/LIBRA crystals. In this report, we describe the radiopurity of the new Ingot #94 crystal produced using the same purification technique as Ingot #85. The $\alpha$-ray events were selected by pulse-shape discrimination method. The impurities in the Ingot #94, $^{232}$Th, $^{226}$Ra and $^{210}$Po radioactivity were $4.6\pm 1.2~\mathrm{\mu Bq/kg}$, $7.9\pm 4.4~\mathrm{\mu Bq/kg}$, and $19\pm 6~\mathrm{\mu Bq/kg}$, which are equivalent to those of the DAMA/LIBRA crystals. The background rate in the energy region of 2-6 keV , was 2-5 events/d/kg/keV without applying a veto trigger.</description>

      <title>SNAD catalogue of M-dwarf flares from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the stars in the Universe are M spectral class dwarfs, which are known to be the source of bright and frequent stellar flares. In this paper, we propose new approaches to discover M-dwarf flares in ground-based photometric surveys. We employ two approaches: a modification of a traditional method of parametric fit search and a machine learning algorithm based on active anomaly detection. The algorithms are applied to Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data release 8, which includes the data from the ZTF high-cadence survey, allowing us to reveal flares lasting from minutes to hours. We analyze over 35 million ZTF light curves and visually scrutinize 1168 candidates suggested by the algorithms to filter out artifacts, occultations of a star by an asteroid, and other types of known variable objects. The result of this analysis is the largest catalogue of ZTF flaring stars to date, representing 134 flares with amplitudes ranging from -0.2 to -4.6 magnitudes, including repeated flares. Using Pan-STARRS DR2 colors, we assign a spectral subclass to each object in the sample. For 13 flares with well-sampled light curves and available geometric distances from Gaia DR3, we estimate the bolometric energy. This research shows that the proposed methods combined with the ZTF's cadence strategy are suitable for identifying M-dwarf flares and other fast transients, allowing for the extraction of significant astrophysical information from their light curves.</description>

      <title>Enhancing noise characterization with robust time delay interferometry combination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11305v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time delay interferometry (TDI) is essential for suppressing laser frequency noise and achieving the targeted sensitivity for space-borne gravitational wave (GW) missions. In Paper I, we examined the performance of the fiducial second-generation TDI Michelson configuration versus an alternative, the hybrid Relay, in noise suppression and data analysis. The results showed that both TDI schemes have comparable performances in mitigating laser and clock noises. However, when analyzing chirp signal from the coalescence of massive binary black holes, the Michelson configuration becomes inferior due to its vulnerable T channel and numerous null frequencies. In contrast, the hybrid Relay is more robust in dynamic unequal-arm scenarios. In this work, we further investigate the noise characterization capabilities of these two TDI configurations. Our investigations demonstrate that hybrid Relay achieves more robust noise parameter inference than the Michelson configuration. Moreover, the performance can be enhanced by replacing the T channel of hybrid Relay with a second-generation TDI null stream $C^{12}_3$. The combined three data streams, including two science observables from the hybrid Relay and $C^{12}_3$, could reduce the instabilities of noise spectra in the targeting frequency band and form an optimal dataset for characterizing noises.</description>

      <title>Impact of extragalactic point sources on the low-frequency sky spectrum and cosmic dawn global 21-cm measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contribution of resolved and unresolved extragalactic point sources to the low-frequency sky spectrum is a potentially non-negligible part of the astrophysical foregrounds for cosmic dawn 21-cm experiments. The clustering of such point sources on the sky, combined with the frequency-dependence of the antenna beam, can also make this contribution chromatic. By combining low-frequency measurements of the luminosity function and the angular correlation function of extragalactic point sources, we develop a model for the contribution of these sources to the low-frequency sky spectrum. Using this model, we find that the contribution of sources with flux density $&gt;10^{-6}\,$Jy to the sky-averaged spectrum is smooth and of the order of a few kelvins at 50--$200\,$MHz. We combine this model with measurements of the galactic foreground spectrum and weigh the resultant sky by the beam directivity of the conical log-spiral antenna planned as part of the Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen (REACH) project. We find that the contribution of point sources to the resultant spectrum is $\sim0.4\%$ of the total foregrounds, but still larger by at least an order of magnitude than the standard predictions for the cosmological 21-cm signal. As a result, not accounting for the point-source contribution leads to a systematic bias in 21-cm signal recovery. We show, however, that in the REACH case, this reconstruction bias can be removed by modelling the point-source contribution as a power law with a running spectral index. We make our code publicly available as a Python package labelled epspy.</description>

      <title>Geophysical Observations of the 24 September 2023 OSIRIS-REx Sample Return Capsule Re-Entry</title>

Abstract: Sample Return Capsules (SRCs) entering Earth's atmosphere at hypervelocity from interplanetary space are a valuable resource for studying meteor phenomena. The 24 September 2023 arrival of the OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer) SRC provided an unprecedented chance for geophysical observations of a well-characterized source with known parameters, including timing and trajectory. A collaborative effort involving researchers from 16 institutions executed a carefully planned geophysical observational campaign at strategically chosen locations, deploying over 400 ground-based sensors encompassing infrasound, seismic, distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), and GPS technologies. Additionally, balloons equipped with infrasound sensors were launched to capture signals at higher altitudes. This campaign (the largest of its kind so far) yielded a wealth of invaluable data anticipated to fuel scientific inquiry for years to come. The success of the observational campaign is evidenced by the near-universal detection of signals across instruments, both proximal and distal. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the collective scientific effort, field deployment, and preliminary findings. The early findings have the potential to inform future space missions and terrestrial campaigns, contributing to our understanding of meteoroid interactions with planetary atmospheres. Furthermore, the dataset collected during this campaign will improve entry and propagation models as well as augment the study of atmospheric dynamics and shock phenomena generated by meteoroids and similar sources.</description>

Abstract: While neutrinos are often treated as a background for many dark matter experiments, these particles offer a new avenue for physics: the detection of core-collapse supernovae. Supernovae are extremely energetic, violent and complex events that mark the death of massive stars. During their collapse stars emit a large number of neutrinos in a short burst. These neutrinos carry 99\% of the emitted energy which makes their detection fundamental in understanding supernovae. This paper illustrates how COSINUS (Cryogenic Observatory for SIgnatures seen in Next-generation Underground Searches), a sodium iodide (NaI) based dark matter search, will be sensitive to the next galactic core-collapse supernova. The experiment is composed of two separate detectors which will be sensitive to far and nearby supernovae. The inner core of the experiment will consist of NaI crystals operating as scintillating calorimeters, mainly sensitive to the Coherent Elastic Scattering of Neutrinos (CE$\nu$NS) against the Na and I nuclei. The low mass of the cryogenic detectors gives the experiment a sensitivity to close supernovae below 1kpc without pileup. They will see up to hundreds of CE$\nu$NS events from a supernova happening at 200pc. The crystals reside at the center of a cylindrical 230T water tank, instrumented with 30 photomultipliers. This tank acts as a passive and active shield able to detect the Cherenkov radiation induced by impinging charged particles from ambient and cosmogenic radioactivity. A supernova near the Milky Way Center (10kpc) will be easily detected inducing $\sim$60 measurable events, and the water tank will have a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity to supernovae up to 22kpc, seeing $\sim$10 events. This paper shows how, even without dedicated optimization, modern dark matter experiments will also play their part in the multi-messenger effort to detect the next galactic core-collapse supernova.</description>
