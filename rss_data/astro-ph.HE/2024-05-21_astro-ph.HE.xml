      <title>Simulations of Interacting Binary Systems -- Pathways to Radio Bright GRB Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the association of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with massive stellar death is on firm footing, the nature of the progenitor system and the key ingredients required for a massive star to produce a gamma-ray burst remain open questions. Here, we investigate the evolution of a massive star with a closely orbiting compact object companion using the stellar evolution code MESA. In particular, we examine how the companion influences the angular momentum and circumstellar environment near the end of the massive star life. We find that tidal effects can cause the compact object companion to significantly increase the angular momentum of the massive star, for orbital periods in the range of up to $\sim 4$ days. We model the density profile evolution of the massive star and discuss how tidal interactions may also lead to stripping of the outer stellar envelope in a way that can create an environment around the binary system that deviates from a typical $1/r^{2}$ wind density profile. We show how our results depend on the metallicity of the system, initial spin of the star, mass ratio, as well as accretion and dynamo prescriptions in the simulations. We conclude that these systems may be viable progenitors for radio-bright, long gamma-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>CO Observations of the Type Ia Supernova Remnant 3C 397 by the Nobeyama 45-m Radio Telescope: Possible Evidence for the Single-Degenerated Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new CO observation toward the Type Ia supernova remnant (SNR) 3C 397 using the Nobeyama 45-m radio telescope at an unprecedent angular resolution of $\sim$18''. We newly found that the CO cloud at $V_{\mathrm{LSR}}$ = 55.7-62.2 km s$^{-1}$ (60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud) shows a good spatial correspondence with the radio continuum shell. We also found an expanding gas motion of the 60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud with an expansion velocity of $\sim$3 km s$^{-1}$, which is thought to be formed by the pre-and/or post-supernova feedback. By considering the positions of Galactic spiral arms and the X-ray/HI absorption studies, we concluded that 3C 397 is physically associated with the 60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud rather than the previously known CO cloud at $V_{\mathrm{LSR}}$ $\sim$30 km s$^{-1}$. Given that the previously measured pre-shock density is $\sim$2-5 cm$^{-3}$, the expanding motion of the 60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud was likely formed by the pre-supernova feedback known as optically thick wind. The scenario is consistent with that 3C 397 exploded inside a wind-blown bubble as a single degenerate system.</description>

      <title>Klein-Nishina Corrections to the Spectra and Light Curves of Gamma-ray Burst Afterglows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-wavelength modeling of the synchrotron radiation from relativistic transients such as Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) afterglows is a powerful means of exploring the physics of relativistic shocks and of deriving properties of the explosion, such as the kinetic energy of the associated relativistic outflows. Capturing the location and evolution of the synchrotron cooling break is critical to break parameter degeneracies associated with such modeling. However, the shape of the spectrum above the cooling break, as well as the location and evolution of the break itself can be significantly altered by synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) cooling. We present an observer's guide to applying SSC cooling with and without Klein-Nishina (KN) corrections to GRB afterglow modeling. We provide a publicly available python code to calculate the Compton $Y$-parameter as a function of electron Lorentz factor, from which we compute changes to the electron distribution, along with KN-corrected afterglow spectra and light curves. In this framework, the canonical synchrotron spectral shapes split into multiple sub-regimes. We summarize each new spectral shape and describe its observational significance. We discuss how KN corrections can account for harder spectra and shallower decline rates observed in some GRB X-ray afterglows. Our overall aim is to provide an easy application of SSC+KN corrections into analytical multi-wavelength modeling frameworks for relativistic transients.</description>

      <title>Sub-relativistic Outflow and Hours-Timescale Large-amplitude X-ray Dips during Super-Eddington Accretion onto a Low-mass Massive Black Hole in the Tidal Disruption Event AT2022lri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2022lri, hosted in a nearby ($\approx\!144$ Mpc) quiescent galaxy with a low-mass massive black hole ($10^4\,M_\odot &lt; M_{\rm BH} &lt; 10^6\,M_\odot$). AT2022lri belongs to the TDE-H+He subtype. More than 1 Ms of X-ray data were collected with NICER, Swift, and XMM-Newton from 187 d to 672 d after peak. The X-ray luminosity gradually declined from $1.5\times 10^{44}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ to $1.5\times 10^{43}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ and remains much above the UV and optical luminosity, consistent with a super-Eddington accretion flow viewed face-on. Sporadic strong X-ray dips atop a long-term decline are observed, with variability timescale of $\approx\!0.5$ hr--1 d and amplitude of $\approx\!2$--8. When fitted with simple continuum models, the X-ray spectrum is dominated by a thermal disk component with inner temperature going from $\sim\! 146$ eV to $\sim\! 86$ eV. However, there are residual features that peak around 1 keV, which, in some cases, cannot be reproduced by a single broad emission line. We analyzed a subset of time-resolved spectra with two physically motivated models describing either a scenario where ionized absorbers contribute extra absorption and emission lines or where disk reflection plays an important role. Both models provide good and statistically comparable fits, show that the X-ray dips are correlated with drops in the inner disk temperature, and require the existence of sub-relativistic (0.1--0.3$c$) ionized outflows. We propose that the disk temperature fluctuation stems from episodic drops of the mass accretion rate triggered by magnetic instabilities or/and wobbling of the inner accretion disk along the black hole's spin axis.</description>

      <title>Study of relativistic hot accretion flow around Kerr-like Wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of relativistic, low-angular momentum, inviscid advective accretion flow in a stationary axisymmetric Kerr-like wormhole (WH) spacetime, characterized by the spin parameter ($a_{\rm k}$), the dimensionless parameter ($\beta$), and the source mass ($M_{\rm WH}$). In doing so, we self-consistently solve the set of governing equations describing the relativistic accretion flow around a Kerr-like WH in the steady state, and for the first time, we obtain all possible classes of global accretion solutions for transonic as well as subsonic flows. We study the properties of dynamical and thermodynamical flow variables and examine how the nature of the accretion solutions alters due to the change of the model parameters, namely energy ($\mathcal{E}$), angular momentum ($\lambda$), $a_{\rm k}$, and $\beta$. Further, we separate the parameter space in $\lambda-\mathcal{E}$ plane according to the nature of the flow solutions, and study the modification of the parameter space by varying $a_{\rm k}$ and $\beta$. Moreover, we retrace the parameter space in $a_{\rm k}-\beta$ plane that allows accretion solutions containing multiple critical points. Finally, we calculate the disc luminosity ($L$) considering free-free emissions for transonic solutions as these solutions are astrophysically relevant and discuss the implication of this model formalism in the context of astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Towards solving the origin of circular polarisation in FRB 20180301A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are short-timescale transients of extragalactic origin. The number of detected FRBs has grown dramatically since their serendipitous discovery from archival data. Some FRBs have also been seen to repeat. The polarimetric properties of repeating FRBs show diverse behaviour and, at times, extreme polarimetric morphology, suggesting a complex magneto-ionic circumburst environment for this class of FRB. The polarimetric properties such as circular polarisation behaviour of FRBs are crucial for understanding their surrounding magnetic-ionic environment. The circular polarisation previously observed in some of the repeating FRB sources has been attributed to propagation effects such as generalised Faraday rotation (GFR), where conversion from linear to circular polarisation occurs due to the non-circular modes of transmission in relativistic plasma. The discovery burst from the repeating FRB$~$20180301A showed significant frequency-dependent circular polarisation behaviour, which was initially speculated to be instrumental due to a sidelobe detection. Here we revisit the properties given the subsequent interferometric localisation of the burst, which indicates that the burst was detected in the primary beam of the Parkes/Murriyang 20-cm multibeam receiver. We develop a Bayesian Stokes-Q, U, and V fit method to model the GFR effect, which is independent of the total polarised flux parameter. Using the GFR model we show that the rotation measure (RM) estimated is two orders of magnitude smaller and opposite sign ($\sim$28 rad$\,$m$^{-2}$) than the previously reported value. We interpret the implication of the circular polarisation on its local magnetic environment and reinterpret its long-term temporal evolution in RM.</description>

      <title>Strong magnetic field inside degenerate relativistic plasma and the impacts on the neutrino transport in Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impacts of magnetic field on the neutrino transport inside core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Magnetic field quantizes the momentum of electrons and positrons, resulting in the modification of weak-interaction cross sections and the chemical potentials of electrons and positrons. We include these changes in the leakage scheme of neutrino transport and perform 1D CCSN simulations with GR1D, assuming the postbounce magnetic field strength of $10^{16-17}$ G. The results show that the neutrino opacities are enhanced due to the amplified interaction rates, resulting in a larger neutrinosphere. This further reduces the peak value of neutrino luminosities and their decay rates since neutrinos stay longer inside the neutrinosphere. Meanwhile, the neutrino mean energies are smaller shortly after bounce and reach their peak values at later times. As these neutrino properties are crucial in subsequent nucleosynthesis processes, including the $\nu$p-process, $\nu$-process, and $r$-process, our findings suggest that the magnetic field may leave discernible marks on the abundance pattern of nucleosynthesis in CCSN.</description>

      <title>Possible influence of a cosmic repulsion on large-scale jets: geometric viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic repulsion represented by a small positive value of the cosmological constant changes significantly properties of central gravitational fields at large distances, leading to existence of a static (or turnaround) radius where gravitational attraction of a center is just balanced by cosmic repulsion. Analyzing behavior of radial timelike geodesics in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime near its static radius we show that the particles with specific energy close to unity have tendency to slow down and cluster just below the static radius, forming clumps which, subsequently, start to expand uniformly due to cosmic repulsion. For central masses of $(10^6$-$10^{11}){\rm M_{\odot}}$ and current value of the cosmological constant $1.1\times 10^{-52}\,{\rm m^{-2}}$, this phenomenon takes place at distances of tens to hundreds of kiloparsecs from the center, being comparable with distances in which huge radio-lobes from some active galaxies were observed.</description>

      <title>On non-detection of Gamma-Ray Bursts in three compact binary merger events detected by LIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The joint detection of the gravitational wave (GW) event GW170817 and the short-duration gamma-ray burst (SGRB) event GRB 170817A, marked the beginning of GW multi-messenger astronomy and confirmed that binary neutron star mergers are progenitors of at least some SGRBs. An estimated joint detection rate of 0.3 - 1.7 per year between the LIGO-Hanford, LIGO-Livingston and Virgo GW network at design sensitivity, and the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor was predicted. However, to date, the GW170817/GRB 170817A joint detection has been the only event of its kind so far. Taking into account that SGRBs are narrowly beamed and are emitted perpendicular to the orbital plane of the binary system, we propose that previous mergers involving neutron stars, were orientated such that observation of the emitted SGRB along this narrow jet was not possible. To support this hypothesis we have estimated the inclination of the binary systems for previously detected Binary Neutron Star (BNS) and Black Hole Neutron Star (BHNS) mergers through GW analysis. This analysis was performed using BILBY, a Python based Bayesian inference library, to estimate the inclination of the BNS events GW170817 and GW190425, and the BHNS events GW190917_114630 and GW200115_042309. The results obtained in this study indicate that these binaries may have had inclinations greater than $33^{\circ}$ with respect to the line of sight from Earth, an upper limit on the viewing angle set from observations of GRB 170817A. This then suggests that the observation of the emitted SGRB from these past mergers might not have been possible.</description>

      <title>Magnetized Accretion onto and Feedback from Supermassive Black Holes in Elliptical Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the fueling of supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies from a turbulent cooling medium on galactic scales, taking M87* as a typical case. We find that the mass accretion rate is increased by a factor of $\sim 10$ compared with analogous hydrodynamic simulations. The scaling of $\dot{M} \sim r^{1/2}$ roughly holds from $\sim 10\,\mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{pc}$ ($\sim 10\, r_\mathrm{g}$) with the accretion rate through the event horizon being $\sim 10^{-2}\, M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. The accretion flow on scales $\sim 0.03-3\,\mathrm{kpc}$ takes the form of magnetized filaments. Within $\sim 30\,\mathrm{pc}$, the cold gas circularizes, forming a highly magnetized ($\beta\sim 10^{-3}$) thick disk supported by a primarily toroidal magnetic field. The cold disk is truncated and transitions to a turbulent hot accretion flow at $\sim0.3\,\mathrm{pc}$ ($10^3\,r_\mathrm{g}$). There are strong outflows towards the poles driven by the magnetic field. The outflow energy flux increases with smaller accretor size, reaching $\sim 3\times10^{43}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ for $r_\mathrm{in}=8\,r_\mathrm{g}$; this corresponds to a nearly constant energy feedback efficiency of $\eta\sim0.05-0.1$ independent of accretor size. The feedback energy is enough to balance the total cooling of the M87/Virgo hot halo out to $\sim 50$ kpc. The accreted magnetic flux at small radii is similar to that in magnetically arrested disk models, consistent with the formation of a powerful jet on horizon scales in M87. Our results motivate a subgrid model for accretion in lower-resolution simulations in which the hot gas accretion rate is suppressed relative to the Bondi rate by $\sim (10r_\mathrm{g}/r_\mathrm{B})^{1/2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crust region is a tiny fraction of neutron stars, but it has a variety of physical properties and plays an important role in astronomical observations. One of the properties characterizing the crust is the elasticity. In this review, with the approach of asteroseismology, we systematically examine neutron star oscillations excited by crust elasticity, adopting the Cowling approximation. In particular, by identifying the quasi-periodic oscillations observed in magnetar flares with the torsional oscillations, we make a constraint on the nuclear saturation parameters. In addition, we also discuss how the shear and interface modes depend on the neutron star properties. Once one detects an additional signal associated with neutron star oscillations, one can get a more severe constraint on the saturation parameters and/or neutron star properties, which must be a qualitatively different constraint obtained from terrestrial experiments, and help us to complementarily understand astrophysics and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>TRAPUM search for pulsars in supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae -- I. Survey description and initial discoveries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the description and initial results of the TRAPUM (TRAnsients And PUlsars with MeerKAT) search for pulsars associated with supernova remnants (SNRs), pulsar wind nebulae and unidentified TeV emission. The list of sources to be targeted includes a large number of well-known candidate pulsar locations but also new candidate SNRs identified using a range of criteria. Using the 64-dish MeerKAT radio telescope, we use an interferometric beamforming technique to tile the potential pulsar locations with coherent beams which we search for radio pulsations, above a signal-to-noise of 9, down to an average flux density upper limit of 30 $\mu$Jy. This limit is target-dependent due to the contribution of the sky and nebula to the system temperature. Coherent beams are arranged to overlap at their 50 per cent power radius, so the sensitivity to pulsars is not degraded by more than this amount, though realistically averages around 65 per cent if every location in the beam is considered. We report the discovery of two new pulsars; PSR J1831$-$0941 is an adolescent pulsar likely to be the plerionic engine of the candidate PWN G20.0+0.0, and PSR J1818$-$1502 appears to be an old and faint pulsar that we serendipitously discovered near the centre of a SNR already hosting a compact central object. The survey holds importance for better understanding of neutron star birth rates and the energetics of young pulsars.</description>

      <title>A Fast-cadenced Search for Gamma-Ray Burst Orphan Afterglows with the Deeper, Wider, Faster Programme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relativistic outflows that produce Long GRBs (LGRBs) can be described by a structured jet model where prompt $\gamma$-ray emission is restricted to a narrow region in the jet's core. Viewing the jet off-axis from the core, a population of afterglows without an associated GRB detection can be predicted. In this work, we conduct an archival search for these `orphan' afterglows (OAs) with minute-cadence, deep ($g\sim23$) data from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) taken as part of the Deeper, Wider, Faster programme (DWF). We introduce a method to select fast-evolving OA candidates within DWF data that comprises a machine learning model, based on a realistic synthetic population of OAs. Using this classifier, we recover 51 OA candidates. Of these candidates, 42 are likely flare events from M-class stars. The remaining nine possess quiescent, coincident sources in archival data with angular profiles consistent with a star. Comparing these sources to the expected population of LGRB host galaxies, we conclude that these are likely Galactic events. We calculate an upper limit on the rate of OAs down to $g&lt;22$ AB mag of 2.49 deg$^{-2}$yr$^{-1}$ using our criteria and constrain the parameter space of possible jet structures. We also place an upper limit of the characteristic angle between the $\gamma$-ray emitting region and the jet's half opening angle, assuming a shallow angular jet structure with a power-law index of 0.8. These values are $58.3^{\circ}$ and $56.6^{\circ}$ for a smooth power-law and a power-law with core jet model respectively.</description>

      <title>Optical Variability of Blazars in the Tomo-e Gozen Northern Sky Transient Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the optical variability of 241 BL Lacs and 83 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) from the 4LAC catalog using data from the Tomo-e Gozen Northern Sky Transient Survey, with $\sim$ 50 epochs per blazar on average. We excluded blazars whose optical variability may be underestimated due to the influence of their host galaxy, based on their optical luminosity ($L_O$). FSRQs with $\gamma$-ray photon index greater than 2.6 exhibit very low optical variability, and their distribution of standard deviation of repeated photometry is significantly different from that of the other FSRQs (KS test P value equal to $5 \times 10^{-6}$ ). Among a sample of blazars at any particular cosmological epoch, those with lower $\gamma$-ray luminosity ($L_\gamma$) tend to have lower optical variability, and those FSRQs with $\gamma$-ray photon index greater than 2.6 tend to have low $L_\gamma$. We also measured the structure function of optical variability and found that the amplitude of the structure function for FSRQs is higher than previously measured and higher than that of BL Lacs at multiple time lags. Additionally, the amplitude of the structure function of FSRQs with high $\gamma$-ray photon index is significantly lower than that of FSRQs with low $\gamma$-ray photon index. The structure function of FSRQs of high $\gamma$-ray photon index shows a characteristic timescale of more than 10 days, which may be the variability timescale of the accretion disk. In summary, we infer that the optical component of FSRQs with high $\gamma$-ray photon index may be dominated by the accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Binary neutron star mergers as the source of the highest energy cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that ultrahigh energy cosmic rays are produced in binary neutron star mergers. Interpreting the highest energy events as r-process nuclei eliminates the need for exotic sources, while the observed near-universal maximum rigidity of ultrahigh energy sources can be understood as due to the uniformity of jets generated by the gravitationally-driven dynamo, given the narrow range of total binary neutron star masses. We discuss evidence for this scenario, and its prediction of coincidences between neutrinos above 10 PeV and gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>The TRAPUM Small Magellanic Cloud pulsar survey with MeerKAT: I. Discovery of seven new pulsars and two Pulsar Wind Nebula associations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity of the MeerKAT radio interferometer is an opportunity to probe deeper into the population of rare and faint extragalactic pulsars. The TRAPUM (TRAnsients and PUlsars with MeerKAT) collaboration has conducted a radio-domain search for accelerated pulsars and transients in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). This partially targeted survey, performed at L-band (856-1712 MHz) with the core array of the MeerKAT telescope in 2-h integrations, is twice as sensitive as the latest SMC radio pulsar survey. We report the discovery of seven new SMC pulsars, doubling this galaxy's radio pulsar population and increasing the total extragalactic population by nearly a quarter. We also carried out a search for accelerated millisecond pulsars in the SMC Globular Cluster NGC 121 using the full array of MeerKAT. This improved the previous upper limit on pulsed radio emission from this cluster by a factor of six. Our discoveries reveal the first radio pulsar-PWN systems in the SMC, with only one such system previously known outside our galaxy (the "Crab pulsar twin" in the Large Magellanic Cloud, PSR J0540$-$6919). We associate the 59 ms pulsar discovery PSR J0040$-$7337, now the fastest spinning radio pulsar in the SMC, with the bow-shock Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) of Supernova Remnant DEM S5. We also present a new young pulsar with a 79 ms period, PSR J0048$-$7317, in a PWN recently discovered in a MeerKAT radio continuum image. Using the multi-beam capability of MeerKAT, we localised our pulsar discoveries, and two previous Murriyang discoveries, to a positional uncertainty of a few arcseconds.</description>

      <title>Neutron-superfluid vortices and proton-superconductor flux tubes: Development of a minimal model for pulsar glitches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework that allows us to explore the coupled motion of neutron-superfluid vortices and proton-superconductor flux tubes in a gravitationally collapsed condensate, which describe neutron stars that form pulsars. Our framework uses the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson-Equation (GPPE) for neutron Cooper pairs, the Real-Time-Ginzburg-Landau equation (RTGLE) for proton Cooper pairs, the Maxwell equations for the vector potential ${\bf A}$, and Newtonian gravity and interactions, both direct and induced by the Poisson equation, between the neutron and proton subsystems. For a pulsar we include a crust potential, characterized by an angle $\theta$, and frictional drag. By carrying out extensive direct numerical simulations, we obtain a variety of interesting results. We show that a rotating proton superconductor generates a uniform London magnetic field, which changes the field distribution inside flux tubes. In the absence of any direct interaction between the two species, they interact through the gravitational Poisson equation. The presence of attractive (repulsive) density-density interaction leads to the attraction (repulsion) between neutron vortices and proton flux tubes. The inclusion of the current-current interaction and the complete Maxwell equations allows us to quantify the entrainment effect that leads to induced magnetization of neutron vortices. We show that, with a strong external magnetic field ${\bf B}_{\rm ext}$, proton flux tubes are anchored to the crust, whereas neutron vortices leave the condensate and lead to abrupt changes of the crust angular momentum ${\rm J}_c$. The frictional term in the dynamical equation for $\theta$ yields stick-slip dynamics that leads, in turn, to glitches in the time series of ${\rm J}_c$. By calculating various statistical properties of this time series, we demonstrate that they display self-organised criticality(SOC).</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Diffusion in the Turbulent Interstellar Medium: Effects of Mirror Diffusion and Pitch Angle Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) interact with turbulent magnetic fields in the intestellar medium, generating nonthermal emission. After many decades of studies, the theoretical understanding of their diffusion in the ISM continues to pose a challenge. This study numerically explores a recent prediction termed "mirror diffusion" and its synergy with traditional diffusion mechanism based on gyroresonant scattering. Our study combines 3D MHD simulations of star-forming regions with test particle simulations to analyze CR diffusion. We demonstrate the significance of mirror diffusion in CR diffusion parallel to the magnetic field, when the mirroring condition is satisfied. Our results support the theoretical expectation that the resulting particle propagation arising from mirror diffusion in combination with much faster diffusion induced by gyroresonant scattering resembles a Levy-flight-like propagation. Our study highlights the necessity to reevaluate the diffusion coefficients traditionally adopeted in the ISM based on gyroresonant scattering alone. For instance, our simulations imply a diffusion coefficient $\sim10^{27}cm^2/s$ for particles with a few hundred TeV within regions spanning a few parsecs around the source. This estimate is in agreement with gamma-ray observations, which shows the relevance of our results for understanding of diffuse gamma-ray emission in star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Holographic massive plasma state in Friedman Universe: cosmological fine-tuning and coincidence problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15488v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive particle and antiparticle pair production and oscillation on the horizon form a holographic and massive pair plasma state in the Friedman Universe. Via this state, the Einstein cosmology term (dark energy) interacts with matter and radiation and is time-varying $\tilde\Lambda$ in the Universe's evolution. It is determined by a close set of ordinary differential equations for dark energy, matter, and radiation energy densities. The solutions are unique, provided the initial conditions given by observations. In inflation and reheating, dark energy density decreases from the inflation scale, converting to matter and radiation energy densities. In standard cosmology, matter and radiation energy densities convert to dark energy density, reaching the present Universe. By comparing with $\Lambda$CDM, quintessence and dark energy interacting models, we show that these results can be the possible solutions for cosmological fine-tuning and coincidence problems.</description>

      <title>Energy Extraction from a Kerr Black Hole via Magnetic Reconnection within the Plunging Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection within a highly magnetized plasma has been seen as a viable mechanism to extract the energy from a rotating black hole, as it can generate negative energy plasmoids in the ergoregion. For a typical accreting black hole, the ergoregion is filled with bulk plasma plunging from the innermost-stable-circular orbit (ISCO). In this study, we present an analytical study of the energy extraction via magnetic reconnection process in the plunging region. In contrast to the toroidal plasma, where the magnetic field cannot be derived from the MHD scheme, the magnetic field in the plunging plasma was determined by the ideal-MHD condition. We derive the global magnetic field structure in a fast reconnection model, and we read the expressions for the energies of plasmoids ejected from the reconnection region, for general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes. Then, we demonstrate the behaviors of ejected energies varying with the reconnection locations in the Kerr spacetime, and identify the region where a negative-energy plasmoid can be produced. We find that for a certain magnetization there exists a critical value of the black hole spin, beyond which the energy extraction can occur, and the energy extraction is most efficient for the near-extreme black hole. Moreover, we study the conditions necessary for a plasmoid with positive energy to escape to the infinity, a crucial requirement for effective energy extractions. Considering the escaping conditions, we provide the parameter space in the radius-spin plane in which the energy extraction mechanism is effective.</description>

      <title>Probing the CIV continuum size luminosity relation in active galactic nuclei with photometric reverberation mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reverberation mapping accurately determines virial black hole masses only for redshifts $z &lt;$ 0.2 by utilizing the relationship between the H$\beta$ broad-line region (BLR) size and the 5100 Angstroms continuum luminosity established with $\sim 200$ active galactic nuclei (AGN). For quasars at $z \sim 2-3$ determining the BLR size is time-consuming and limited by seasonal gaps, requiring e.g., $\sim$ 20 years of monitoring of the CIV emission lines. In this work, we demonstrate that an efficient alternative is to use a continuum size-luminosity relation, which can be obtained up to 150 times faster than BLR sizes using photometric reverberation mapping (PRM). We outline the method and its feasibility based on simulations and propose an observational strategy that can be carried out with meter-class telescopes. In particular, we focus on the ESO La Silla 2.2 meter telescope as it is suitable for an efficient PRM campaign. These observations will provide the scaling factor between the accretion disk and the BLR size (for CIV-1350 Angstroms), which is crucial for estimating the masses of black holes at higher redshifts ($z \gtrsim 2-3$).</description>

      <title>AGN energetics and lifetimes from remnant radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy coupling efficiency of active galactic nucleus (AGN) outbursts is known to differ significantly with factors including the jet kinetic power, duration of the outburst, and properties of the host galaxy cluster. As such, constraints on their jet power and lifetime functions are crucial to quantify the role of kinetic-mode AGN feedback on the evolution of galaxies since $z \sim 1$. In this work, we address this issue by measuring the energetics of a sample of 79 low-redshift (0.02 $&lt; z &lt;$ 0.2) remnant radio galaxies compiled from large-sky radio surveys - these objects uniquely probe the full duration of an AGN outburst. The jet kinetic power and outburst duration of each remnant are determined using the RAiSE dynamical model based on the surface brightness distribution observed in multi-frequency radio images. We compare the energetics constrained for this sample to those predicted for mock radio source populations - with various intrinsic functions for jet power and lifetime distributions - to correct for sample selection biases imposed on our sample. The intrinsic jet power and lifetime functions that yield a selection-biased mock population most similar to our observed sample are found using Bayesian inference. Our analysis places robust constraints on assumed power-law indices for the intrinsic jet power and lifetime functions: $p(Q)\propto Q^{-1.49\pm0.07}$ and $p(t_{\mathrm{on}})\propto t_{\mathrm{on}}^{-0.97\pm0.12}$ respectively. We discuss the implication of these findings for feedback-regulated accretion and the self-regulating nature of jet activity. The methodology proposed in this work can be extended to active radio galaxies in future studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of the expansion of the universe on a broad class of objects, including black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, and others. Using metrics that incorporate primordial inhomogeneities, the effects of a hypothetical "center of the universe" on inflation are calculated. Dynamic coordinates for black holes that account for expansions or contractions with arbitrary rates are provided. We consider the possibility that the universe may be bound to evolve into an ultimate state of "total dilution", wherein stable particles are so widely separated that physical communication among them will be impossible for eternity. This is also a scenario of "cosmic virtuality", as no wave-function collapse would occur again. We provide classical models evolving this way, based on the Majumdar-Papapetrou geometries. More realistic configurations, instead, indicate that gravitational forces locally counteract expansion, except in the universe's early stages. We comment on whether quantum phenomena may dictate that total dilution is indeed the cosmos' ultimate destiny.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) has initiated a program to enhance the participation of historically underrepresented institutions and communities in NASA's mission. Currently known as the NASA SMD Bridge Program, its goal is to establish enduring partnerships among these institutions, research-intensive universities, and NASA centers. There are concerns about using "Bridge" in the program's name, with stakeholders suggesting that it might stigmatize students and mislead applicants about its focus. In this white paper, we address these concerns and conclude that a name change that better reflects the mission of this SMD effort is necessary to address these concerns.</description>

      <title>Beyond Earthly Limits: Protection against Cosmic Radiation through Biological Response Pathways</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming phase of space exploration not only includes trips to Mars and beyond, but also holds great promise for human progress. However, the vulnerability of space habitats to cosmic radiation, which consists of Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events, raises important safety concerns for astronauts and other living things that will accompany them. Research exploring the biological effects of cosmic radiation consists of experiments conducted in space itself and in simulated space environments on Earth. Notably, NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory has taken significant steps forward in simulating cosmic radiation by using particle accelerators, marking a notable advancement in this field. Intriguingly, much of the research emphasis thus far has been on understanding how cosmic radiation impacts living organisms, instead of finding ways to help them resist the radiation. In this paper, we briefly talk about current research on the biological effects of cosmic radiation and propose possible protective measures through biological interventions. In our opinion, biological pathways responsible for coping with stressors on Earth offer potential solutions for protection against the stress caused by cosmic radiation. Additionally, we recommend assessing the effectiveness of these pathways through experiments using particle accelerators to simulate the effects of cosmic radiation.</description>

      <title>Feedback-regulated Seed Black Hole Growth in Star-Forming Molecular Clouds and Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in high-redshift luminous quasars may require a phase of rapid accretion, and as a precondition, substantial gas influx toward seed black holes (BHs) from kilo-parsec or parsec scales. Our previous research demonstrated the plausibility of such gas supply for BH seeds within star-forming giant molecular clouds (GMCs) with high surface density ($\sim 10^4\,{\rm {\rm M_\odot}\, pc}^{-2}$), facilitating ``hyper-Eddington'' accretion via efficient feeding by dense clumps which are driven by turbulence and stellar feedback. This article investigates the impacts of feedback from accreting BHs on this process, including radiation, mechanical jets, and highly relativistic cosmic rays. We run a suite of numerical simulations to explore diverse parameter spaces of BH feedback, including the sub-grid accretion model, feedback energy efficiency, mass loading factor, and initial metallicity. Utilizing radiative feedback models inferred from the slim disk, we find that hyper-Eddington accretion is still achievable, yielding BH bolometric luminosities as high as $10^{41}$ -- $10^{44}\,\rm erg/s$, depending on the GMC properties and specific feedback model assumed. We find the maximum possible mass growth of seed BHs ($\Delta M_{\rm BH}^{\rm max}$) is regulated by the momentum deposition rate from BH feedback, $\dot{p}_{\rm feedback}/(\dot{M}_{\rm BH} c)$, which leads to an analytic scaling that agrees well with simulations. This scenario predicts the rapid formation of $\sim 10^4\,\rm M_\odot$ intermediate-massive BHs (IMBHs) from stellar-mass BHs within $\sim \rm Myr$. Furthermore, we examine the impacts of sub-grid accretion models and how BH feedback may influence star formation within these cloud complexes.</description>

Abstract: According to the Banados-SIlk-West (BSW) effect, two particles moving towards a black hole, can collide near the horizon with an unbounded energy in the center of mass frame. This requires one of particles to have fine-tuned parameters in such a way that the time component of generalized momentum is zero $X=0$. Thus the existence of such trjectories is a necessary condition for the BSW effect. However, it is insufficient since the forward-in-time condition requires $X&gt;0$ outside the horizon. We examine this condition for different types of partricles and horizons and find configurations for which the BSW effect is possible. In doing so, we take into account a finite force of unspesified nature exerted on particles. It includes relationships between numbers characterizing the rate with which four-velocity, acceleration and metric functions change near the horizon. For some aforementioned relations, parameters of a system control the sign of $X$, in other cases they are required for $X$ to be real quantity. In the simplest case of free particles the BSW effect for the Kerr or Kerr-Newman black hole is impossible if a fine-tuned particle has a negative energy, so in this sense combination of the Penrose process and the BSW effect is forbidden.</description>

Abstract: It is believed that cores of neutron stars provide a natural laboratory where exotic high baryon density QCD phases may exist.The theoretically well established {\it neutron superfluid phase} is also believed to be found only inside neutron stars. Focus on neutron stars has intensified in recent years with the direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron star (BNS) merger, which has allowed the possibility of directly probing the properties of the interior of a neutron star. A remarkable phenomenon manifested by rapidly rotating neutron stars is in their {\it avatar} as {\it Pulsars}. The accuracy of pulsar timing allowed the first indirect detection of GWs from a BNS system and opened up a few exciting possibilities. Any pulsar deformation, even if incredibly tiny, can leave imprints on the pulses by introducing tiny perturbations of the moment of inertia (MI) tensor components. While the diagonal MI components of the perturbed MI tensor affect the pulse timings, the off-diagonal components lead to the pulsar's wobbling and affecting the pulse profile. This opens up an opportunity to explore various phase transitions inside a pulsar core by induced density fluctuations through the observable effects on the pulse timing and profile. Such perturbations also naturally induce a rapidly changing quadrupole moment of the star, thereby providing a new source of GW emission. Another remarkable possibility arises when we consider the effect of an external GW on a neutron star. With the possibility of detecting any minute changes in its configuration through pulse observations, the neutron star has the potential to perform as a Weber detector of GWs. This brief review focuses on these specific aspects of a pulsar, specifically on the type of physics that can be probed by utilizing the effect of changes in the MI tensor on pulse properties.</description>

Abstract: The geographic South Pole provides unique opportunities to study cosmic particles in the Southern Hemisphere. It represents an optimal location to deploy large-scale neutrino telescopes in the deep Antarctic ice, such as AMANDA or IceCube. In both cases, the presence of an array, constructed to observe extensive air showers, enables hybrid measurements of cosmic rays. While additional neutron monitors can provide information on solar cosmic rays, large detector arrays, like SPASE or IceTop, allow for precise measurements of cosmic rays with energies above several $100\,\rm{TeV}$. In coincidence with the signals recorded in the deep ice, which are mostly due to the high-energy muons produced in air showers, this hybrid detector setup provides important information about the nature of cosmic rays.
  In this review, we will discuss the historical motivation and developments towards measurements of cosmic rays at the geographic South Pole and highlight recent results reported by the IceCube Collaboration. We will emphasize the important contributions by Thomas K. Gaisser and his colleagues that ultimately led to the rich Antarctic research program which today provides crucial insights into cosmic-ray physics.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a second eclipsing, bursting neutron-star low-mass X-ray binary in the globular cluster Terzan 6</title>

Abstract: We have analyzed Chandra and Suzaku observations of the globular cluster Terzan 6, made when the recurrent transient GRS 1747-312 was in quiescence. Our analysis reveals the presence of a second eclipsing, bursting neutron-star low-mass X-ray binary in the central regions of the cluster, in addition to GRS 1747-312. The new source, which we name Terzan 6 X2, is located only ~0.7 arcsec away from GRS 1747-312 in the 2021 Chandra images. The detection of a 5.14 ks-long eclipse in the light curve of X2 at a time not predicted by the ephemeris of GRS 1747-312 confirms that it is an unrelated source. Using the Suzaku light curve from 2009, which in addition to a type-I X-ray burst also showed an eclipse-like feature, we constrain the orbital period to be longer than 16.27 h. The 0.5-10 keV luminosities of X2 vary in the range of ~0.24-5.9x10^34 erg/s on time scales of months to years. We have identified a plausible optical counterpart of X2 in HST F606W and F814W images. This star varied by 2.7 mag in V_606 between epochs separated by years. In the cluster color-magnitude diagram, the variable counterpart lies in the blue-straggler region when it was optically bright, about 1.1-1.7 mag above the main-sequence turn-off. From the orbital period-density relation of Roche-lobe filling stars we find the mass-donor radius to be &gt;0.8 Rsun.</description>

Abstract: Recent astrophysical mass inferences of compact stars HESS J1731-347 and PSR J0952-0607, with extremely small and large masses respectively, as well as the measurement of the neutron skin of Ca in the CREX experiment challenge and constrain the models of dense matter. We examine the concept of hybrid stars - objects containing quark cores surrounded by nucleonic envelopes - as models that account for these new data along with other inferences. We employ a family of 81 nucleonic equations of state (EoSs) with variable skewness and slope of symmetry energy at saturation density and a constant speed-of-sound EoS for quark matter. For each nucleonic EoS, a family of hybrid EoSs is generated by varying the transition density, the energy jump, and the speed of sound. These models are tested against the data from GW170817 and J1731-347, which favor low-density soft EoS and J0592-0607 and J0740+6620, which require high-density stiff EoS. The addition of J0592-0607's mass measurement to the constraints has no significant impact on the parameter space of the admissible EoS, but allows us to explore the potential effect of pulsars more massive than J0740+6620, if such exists. We then examine the occurrence of twin configurations and quantify the ranges of masses and radii that they can possess. It is shown that including J1731-347 data favors EoSs that predict low-mass twins with $M \lesssim 1.3\,M_{\odot}$ that can be realized if the deconfinement transition density is low. If combined with large speed of sound in quark matter such models allow for maximum masses of hybrid stars in $2.0$--$2.6\,M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Search for heavy dark matter from dwarf spheroidal galaxies: leveraging cascades and subhalo models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) has been widely used to search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter signals due to its unparalleled sensitivity in the GeV energy band. The leading constraints for WIMP by Fermi-LAT are obtained from the analyses of dwarf spheroidal galaxies within the Local Group, which are compelling targets for dark matter searches due to their relatively low astrophysical backgrounds and high dark matter content. In the meantime, the search for heavy dark matter with masses above TeV remains a compelling and relatively unexplored frontier. In this study, we utilize 14-year Fermi-LAT data to search for dark matter annihilation and decay signals in 8 classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies within the Local Group. We consider secondary emission caused by electromagnetic cascades of prompt gamma rays and electrons/positrons from dark matter, which enables us to extend the search with Fermi-LAT to heavier dark matter cases. We also update the dark matter subhalo model with informative priors respecting the fact that they reside in subhalos of our Milky Way halo aiming to enhance the robustness of our results. We place constraints on dark matter annihilation cross section and decay lifetime for dark matter masses ranging from $10^3$ GeV to $10^{11}$ GeV, where our limits are more stringent than those obtained by many other high-energy gamma-ray instruments.</description>

      <title>SRG/ART-XC Galactic Plane Survey near Galactic Longitude $l\simeq20^\circ$: Catalog of Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a catalog of sources detected by the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope onboard the SRG space observatory during the observations of the Galactic plane region near a longitude $l\simeq20$ deg (L20 field) in October 2019. The L20 field was observed four times in the scanning mode, which provided a uniform coverage of the sky region with a total area of $\simeq24$ sq. deg with a median sensitivity of $8\times10^{-13}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ (at 50% detection completeness) in the 4$-$12 keV. As a result, we have detected 29 X-ray sources at a statistically significant level, 11 of which have not been detected previously by other X-ray observatories. Preliminary estimates show that four of them can presumably be extragalactic in nature. We also show that the source SRGA J183220.1$-$103508 (CXOGSG J183220.8$-$103510), is most likely a galaxy cluster containing a bright radio galaxy at redshift $z\simeq0.121$.</description>

      <title>Remnant masses from 1D+ core-collapse supernovae simulations: bimodal neutron star mass distribution and black holes in the low-mass gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The explosion of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is an extremely challenging problem, and there are still large uncertainties regarding which stars lead to successful explosions that leave behind a neutron star, and which ones will form a black hole instead. In this paper, we simulate 341 progenitors at three different metallicities using spherically symmetric simulations that include neutrino-driven convection via a mixing-length theory. We use these simulations to improve previously derived explosion criteria based on the density and entropy profiles of the pre-supernova progenitor. We also provide numerical fits to calculate the final mass of neutron stars based on either compactness, the location of the Si/Si-O interface, or the Chandrasekhar mass. The neutron star birth mass distribution derived from our 1D+ simulations is bimodal, contrary to what the most popular 1D CCSN simulations have shown so far. We compare the theoretically derived neutron star mass distributions with the observed ones and discuss potential implications for population synthesis studies. We also analyze the black hole mass distribution predicted by our simulations. To be consistent with current models of matter ejection in failed SNe, a large fraction of the envelope must be expelled, leading to small black holes in the low-mass gap. One black hole in this mass region has recently been observed in the GW230529 event by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Our results naturally agree with this detection, which the most popular prescriptions for explodability and remnant masses are not able to reproduce. In general, we find that the explosion outcome and mass of the remnant strongly depend on the pre-collapse structure of the progenitor. However, their dependence on the initial mass of the star and the mass of the CO core is highly uncertain and non-linear.</description>

      <title>Supernova 1987A's keyhole: A long-lived jet-pair in the final explosion phase of core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I further study the manner by which a pair of opposite jets shape the keyhole morphological structure of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 1997A, now the CCSN remnant (CCSNR) 1987A. By doing so, I strengthen the claim that the jittering-jet explosion mechanism (JJEM) accounts for most, likely all, CCSNe. The keyhole structure comprises a northern low-intensity zone closed with a bright rim on its front and an elongated low-intensity nozzle in the south. This rim-nozzle asymmetry is observed in some cooling flow clusters and planetary nebulae that are observed to be shaped by jets. I build a toy model that uses the planar jittering jets pattern, where consecutive pairs of jets tend to jitter in a common plane, implying that the accreted gas onto the newly born neutron star at the late explosion phase flows perpendicular to that plane. This allows for a long-lived jet-launching episode. This long-lasting jet-launching episode launches more mass into the jets that can inflate larger pairs of ears or bubbles, forming the main jets' axis of the CCSNR that is not necessarily related to a possible pre-collapse core rotation. I discuss the relation of the main jets' axis to the neutron star's natal kick velocity.</description>

      <title>AT2018fyk: Candidate Tidal Disruption Event by a (Super)massive Black Hole Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2018fyk has unusual X-ray, UV, and optical light curves that decay over the first $\sim$600d, rebrighten, and decay again around 1200d. We explain this behavior as a one-off TDE associated with a massive black hole (BH) \emph{binary}. The sharp drop-offs from $t^{-5/3}$ power laws at around 600d naturally arise when one BH interrupts the debris fallback onto the other BH. The BH mass $M_\bullet$ derived from fitting X-ray spectra with a slim disk accretion model and, independently, from fitting the early UV/optical light curves, is smaller by two orders of magnitude than predicted from the $M_\bullet$--$\sigma_*$ host galaxy relation, suggesting that the debris is accreted onto the secondary, with fallback cut off by the primary. Furthermore, if the rebrightening were associated with the primary, it should occur around 5000d, not the observed 1200d. The secondary's mass and dimensionless spin is $M_{\bullet,{\rm s}}=2.7^{+0.5}_{-1.5} \times 10^5 M_\odot$ and $a_{\bullet,{\rm s}}&gt;0.3$ (X-ray spectral fitting), while the primary's mass is $M_{\bullet,{\rm p}}=10^{7.7\pm0.4}M_\odot$ ($M_\bullet$-$\sigma_*$ relation). An intermediate mass BH secondary is consistent with the observed UV/optical light curve decay, i.e., the secondary's outer accretion disk is too faint to produce a detectable emission floor. The time of the first accretion cutoff constrains the binary separation to be $(6.7\pm 1.2) \times 10^{-3}~{\rm pc}$. X-ray spectral fitting and timing analysis indicate that the hard X-rays arise from a corona above the secondary's disk. The early UV/optical emission, suggesting a super-Eddington phase for the secondary, possibly originates from shocks arising from debris circularization.</description>

      <title>Regions of suppressed diffusion around supernova remnants?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of the so-called TeV halos has attracted much attention. The morphology of the emission requires that the region is characterized by severe suppression of the diffusion coefficient. This finding raises many questions as to its origin: 1) is the suppressed diffusion to be attributed to instabilities induced by the same radiating particles? 2) or does it actually show that the diffusion coefficient is small throughout the disc of the Galaxy? In both cases, one would expect that the surroundings of supernova remnants (SNRs) should also show evidence of reduced diffusion coefficient, since most remnants are located in the disc and are expected to be sites of effective particle acceleration. Should we expect the existence of regions of extended $\gamma$-ray emission from these regions as well? Here we investigate the transport of cosmic rays (CRs) escaped from SNRs in order to assess the viability of the idea of having a cocoon of suppressed diffusion around them. A comparison of our results with the $\gamma$-ray emission from the regions around HB9 and W28 does not provide solid evidence of reduced diffusivity. However, if indeed the phenomenon of reduced diffusivity occurs around SNRs surrounded by molecular clouds, our calculations show that the effects on the grammage of Galactic CRs can be significant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic jets from accreting supermassive black holes at cosmological distances can be powerful emitters of $\gamma$-rays. However, the precise mechanisms and locations responsible for the dissipation of energy within these jets, leading to observable $\gamma$-ray radiation, remain elusive. We detect evidence for an intrinsic absorption feature in the $\gamma$-ray spectrum at energies exceeding $10\,$GeV, presumably due to the photon-photon pair production of $\gamma$-rays with low ionization lines at the outer edge of Broad-line region (BLR), during the high-flux state of the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 1424$-$418. The feature can be discriminated from the turnover at higher energies resulting from $\gamma$-ray absorption in the extragalactic background light. It is absent in the low-flux states supporting the interpretation that powerful dissipation events within or at the edge of the BLR evolve into fainter $\gamma$-ray emitting zones outside the BLR, possibly associated with the moving VLBI radio knots. The inferred location of $\gamma$-ray emission zone is consistent with the observed variability time scale of the brightest flare, provided that the flare is attributed to external Compton scattering with BLR photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of a total of 135 bursts from a recently discovered active, repeating fast radio burst, FRB 20240114A with the GMRT over a frequency range of 300$-$750 MHz. The bursts were detected with intrinsic widths ranging from 0.308 to 39.364 ms, a median scattering timescale of 2.059 ms at 400 MHz and 1.372 ms at 650 MHz. The fluences of the detected bursts range from 36.81 mJy ms to 7.47 Jy ms. Both the energy and waiting time distributions of the bursts can be fitted with broken power laws, indicating the presence of two distinct populations of bursts. The energy distributions were modeled via broken power law with $\alpha_{1} = -0.62 \pm 0.01$ and $\alpha_{2} = -1.98 \pm 0.11$, while the waiting time distribution was modeled via a broken power law with $\alpha_{1} = -0.71 \pm 0.01$ and $\alpha_{2} = -2.09 \pm 0.09$. Both the energy and waiting time distributions of FRB 20240114A are comparable to high-energy bursts from magnetars, and giant radio pulses from pulsars, indicating that such objects could be likely progenitors.</description>

      <title>Properties of the Line-of-Sight Velocity Field in the Hot and X-ray Emitting Circumgalactic Medium of Nearby Simulated Disk Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hot, X-ray-emitting phase of the circumgalactic medium of massive galaxies is believed to be the reservoir of baryons from which gas flows onto the central galaxy and into which feedback from AGN and stars inject mass, momentum, energy, and metals. These effects shape the velocity fields of the hot gas, which can be observed via the Doppler shifting and broadening of emission lines by X-ray IFUs. In this work, we analyze the gas kinematics of the hot circumgalactic medium of Milky Way-mass disk galaxies from the TNG50 simulation with synthetic observations to determine how future instruments can probe this velocity structure. We find that the hot phase is often characterized by outflows from the disk driven by feedback processes, radial inflows near the galactic plane, and rotation, though in some systems the velocity field is more disorganized and turbulent. With a spectral resolution of $\sim$1 eV, fast and hot outflows ($\sim$200-500 km s$^{-1}$) can be measured, depending on the orientation of the galaxy on the sky. The rotation velocity of the hot phase ($\sim$100-200 km s$^{-1}$) can be measured using line shifts in edge-on galaxies, and is slower than that of colder gas phases but similar to stellar rotation velocities. By contrast, the slow inflows ($\sim$50-100 km s$^{-1}$) are difficult to measure in projection with these other components, but may be detected in multi-component spectral fits. We find that the velocity measured is sensitive to which emission lines are used. Measuring these flows will constrain theories of how the gas in these galaxies evolves.</description>

      <title>Search for strongly interacting dark matter at Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A small component of dark matter (DM) that is strongly interacting with the standard model sector is consistent with various experimental observations. Despite the small abundance, strongly-interacting DM can lead to pronounced signals in DM direct detection experiments. We study Belle II sensitivity on strongly-interacting DM that has a MeV-GeV mass and couples with electrons. By taking into account the substantial interactions between DM and electrons within detectors, we compute the ``ceiling'' of the mono-photon signature at Belle II, beyond which the mono-photon channel loses its sensitivity, and visible ECL clusters due to DM scatterings assume significance. We study two ECL signatures for strongly-interacting DM: the mono-cluster and the di-cluster channels. To carry out detailed calculations and to compare with other constraints, we consider DM models with light mediators, as they naturally lead to sizable interaction cross sections. We compute exclusion regions for the di-cluster, mono-cluster, and mono-photon channels. We find that Belle II (with currently accumulated data of 362 fb$^{-1}$) can rule out a significant portion of the parameter space above the ceilings of the constraints from various DM direct detection and neutrino experiments, for the vector mediator case with mass $\gtrsim 10$ MeV. Belle II also offers superior constraints on new light particles compared to PBH for the scalar mediator with mass $\gtrsim 10$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for rotating black holes in parity-violating gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been pointed out that one can construct invertible conformal transformations with a parity-violating conformal factor, which can be employed to generate a novel class of parity-violating ghost-free metric theories from general relativity. We obtain exact solutions for rotating black holes in such theories by performing the conformal transformation on the Kerr solution in general relativity, which we dub conformal Kerr solutions. We explore the geodesic motion of a test particle in the conformal Kerr spacetime. While null geodesics remain the same as those in the Kerr spacetime, timelike geodesics exhibit interesting differences due to an effective external force caused by the parity-violating conformal factor.</description>

      <title>Accretion of matter by a Charged dilaton black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering accretion onto a charged dilaton black hole, the fundamental equations governing accretion, general analytic expressions for critical points, critical velocity, critical speed of sound, and ultimately the mass accretion rate are obtained. A new constraint on the dilation parameter coming from string theory is found and the case for polytropic gas is delved into a detailed discussion. It is found that the dialtion and the adiabatic index of accreted material have deep effects on the accretion process.</description>

      <title>Probing ultralight isospin-violating mediators at GW170817</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) signals arising from binary neutron star mergers offer new, sensitive probes to ultralight mediators. Here we analyze the GW signals in the GW170817 event detected by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration to impose constraints on the ultralight isospin-violating mediator that has different couplings to protons and neutrons. Neutron stars, which primarily consist of neutrons, are the ideal places to probe the isospin-violating mediator. Such a mediator can significantly alter the dynamics of the binary neutron star mergers, through both the long-range Yukawa force and the new dipole radiation. We compute the gravitational waveform by taking into account the new physics effects due to the isospin-violating mediator and use the Bayesian inference to analyze the gravitational wave data in the GW170817 event. We find that although the current fifth force experiments (including MICROSCOPE and EW) often provide more stringent constraints than the GW170817 data, in the parameter space where the isospin-violating force is completely screened by the Earth (namely, the Earth is charge neutral under this force), the GW170817 data offer the leading constraints: the upper bound on the neutron coupling is $f_n \lesssim 10^{-19}$ in the mediator mass range of $\simeq(3\times10^{-16},\,5\times10^{-14})$ eV.</description>

      <title>Calibrating gravitational-wave search algorithms with conformal prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In astronomy, we frequently face the decision problem: does this data contain a signal? Typically, a statistical approach is used, which requires a threshold. The choice of threshold presents a common challenge in settings where signals and noise must be delineated, but their distributions overlap. Gravitational-wave astronomy, which has gone from the first discovery to catalogues of hundreds of events in less than a decade, presents a fascinating case study. For signals from colliding compact objects, the field has evolved from a frequentist to a Bayesian methodology. However, the issue of choosing a threshold and validating noise contamination in a catalogue persists. Confusion and debate often arise due to the misapplication of statistical concepts, the complicated nature of the detection statistics, and the inclusion of astrophysical background models. We introduce Conformal Prediction (CP), a framework developed in Machine Learning to provide distribution-free uncertainty quantification to point predictors. We show that CP can be viewed as an extension of the traditional statistical frameworks whereby thresholds are calibrated such that the uncertainty intervals are statistically rigorous and the error rate can be validated. Moreover, we discuss how CP offers a framework to optimally build a meta-pipeline combining the outputs from multiple independent searches. We introduce CP with a toy cosmic-ray detector, which captures the salient features of most astrophysical search problems and allows us to demonstrate the features of CP in a simple context. We then apply the approach to a recent gravitational-wave Mock Data Challenge using multiple search algorithms for compact binary coalescence signals in interferometric gravitational-wave data. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on the future potential of the method for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Observing the Galactic Underworld: Predicting photometry and astrometry from compact remnant microlensing events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isolated black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs) are largely undetectable across the electromagnetic spectrum. For this reason, our only real prospect of observing these isolated compact remnants is via microlensing; a feat recently performed for the first time. However, characterisation of the microlensing events caused by BHs and NSs is still in its infancy. In this work, we perform N-body simulations to explore the frequency and physical characteristics of microlensing events across the entire sky. Our simulations find that every year we can expect $88_{-6}^{+6}$ BH, $6.8_{-1.6}^{+1.7}$ NS and $20^{+30}_{-20}$ stellar microlensing events which cause an astrometric shift larger than 2~mas. Similarly, we can expect $21_{-3}^{+3}$ BH, $18_{-3}^{+3}$ NS and $7500_{-500}^{+500}$ stellar microlensing events which cause a bump magnitude larger than 1~mag. Leveraging a more comprehensive dynamical model than prior work, we predict the fraction of microlensing events caused by BHs as a function of Einstein time to be smaller than previously thought. Comparison of our microlensing simulations to events in Gaia finds good agreement. Finally, we predict that in the combination of Gaia and GaiaNIR data there will be $14700_{-900}^{+600}$ BH and $1600_{-200}^{+300}$ NS events creating a centroid shift larger than 1~mas and $330_{-120}^{+100}$ BH and $310_{-100}^{+110}$ NS events causing bump magnitudes $&gt; 1$. Of these, $&lt;10$ BH and $5_{-5}^{+10}$ NS events should be detectable using current analysis techniques. These results inform future astrometric mission design, such as GaiaNIR, as they indicate that, compared to stellar events, there are fewer observable BH events than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Driven Relativistic Jet in the High-Redshift Blazar OH~471</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context : Understanding the mechanisms that launch and shape powerful relativistic jets from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in high-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) is crucial for probing the co-evolution of SMBHs and galaxies over cosmic time.
  Aims :We study the high-redshift ($z=3.396$) blazar OH~471 to explore the jet launching mechanism in the early Universe.
  Methods : Using multi-frequency radio monitoring observations and high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry imaging over three decades, we study the milliarcsecond structure and long-term variability of OH~471.
  Results : Spectral modelling of the radio flux densities reveals a synchrotron self-absorbed spectrum indicating strong magnetic fields within the compact core. By applying the flux freezing approximation, we estimate the magnetic flux carried by the jet and find that it reaches or exceeds theoretical predictions for jets powered by black hole spin energy via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. This implies that OH~471 was in a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state where the magnetic flux accumulated near the horizon regulates the accretion flow, allowing efficient extraction of black hole rotational energy.
  Conclusions : Our study demonstrates the dominance of MAD accretion in powering the prominent radio flares and relativistic jets observed in the radio-loud AGN OH~471 and statistical studies of large samples of high-redshift AGN will shed light on the role of MAD accretion in launching and accelerating the earliest relativistic jets.</description>

      <title>Stellar X-ray activity and habitability revealed by ROSAT sky survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the homogeneous X-ray catalog from ROSAT observations, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into stellar X-ray activity-rotation relations for both single and binary stars. Generally, the relation for single stars consists of two distinct regions: a weak decay region, indicating a continued dependence of the magnetic dynamo on stellar rotation rather than a saturation regime with constant activity, and a rapid decay region, where X-ray activity is strongly correlated with the Rossby number. Detailed analysis reveals more fine structures within the relation: in the extremely fast rotating regime, a decrease in X-ray activity was observed with increasing rotation rate, referred to as super-saturation, while in the extremely slow rotating region, the relation flattens, mainly due to the scattering of F stars. This scattering may result from intrinsic variability in stellar activities over one stellar cycle or the presence of different dynamo mechanisms. Binaries exhibit a similar relation to that of single stars while the limited sample size prevented the identification of fine structures in the relation for binaries. We calculated the mass loss rates of planetary atmosphere triggered by X-ray emissions from host stars. Our findings indicate that for an Earth-like planet within the stellar habitable zone, it would easily lose its entire primordial H/He envelope (equating to about 1% of the planetary mass).</description>

      <title>Exploring Large-Volume GAGG Scintillators for use in MeV Gamma-Ray Astrophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray astrophysics in the MeV band is an exciting field in astronomy due to its potential for multi-messenger astrophysics. It has, however, remained under-explored when compared to other wavelengths. One reason for this observational gap is the difficulties with measuring these high-energy photons and the requirement of large amounts of detection material. In this work, we investigate the usage of large-volume GAGG scintillators for use as a calorimeter in future MeV telescopes. We developed a $5\times5$ array calorimeter utilizing $1\times1\times6 \ \mathrm{cm}^3$ GAGG crystals with C-series SiPM readout. The calorimeter was tested at the High Intensity Gamma-ray Facility (HIGS) with monoenergetic beams ranging from $2-25 \ \mathrm{MeV}$. Finally, we also investigated larger $1\times1\times8 \ \mathrm{cm}^3$ crystals and characterized their response across their depth when their surface treatment is either polished or frosted.</description>

      <title>Superconducting multi-vortices and a novel BPS bound in chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a novel BPS bound from chiral perturbation theory minimally coupled to electrodynamics at finite isospin chemical potential. At a critical value of the isospin chemical potential, a system of three first-order differential field equations (which implies the second-order field equations) for the gauge field and the hadronic profile can be derived from the requirement to saturate the bound. These BPS configurations represent magnetic multi-vortices with quantized flux supported by a superconducting current. The corresponding topological charge density is related to the magnetic flux density, but is screened by the hadronic profile. Such a screening effect allows to derive the maximal value of the magnetic field generated by these BPS magnetic vortices, being $B_{max}=2,04 \times 10^{14}G$. The solution for a single BPS vortex is discussed in detail, and some physical consequences, together with the comparison with the magnetic vortices in the Ginzburg-Landau theory at critical coupling, are described.</description>
