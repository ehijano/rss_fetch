      <title>A model for positron annihilation in multi-layer systems by solving the diffusion equation using different positron affinities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for solving the positron diffusion equation in multi-layer systems. Our approach incorporates material-specific implantation profiles, diffusion parameters, and positron affinities. It utilizes a Markov chain approach to model annihilation probabilities and provides fitting capabilities for experimental S (lineshape) parameter data. We have implemented this algorithm in Python and made it available for free under the name LIMPID. To demonstrate its performance, we analyze depth-resolved Doppler-Broadening Spectroscopy measurements of a Cu layer on a Si substrate, achieving excellent agreement with the experimental profiles. The LIMPID tool enhances the reproducibility and comparability of positron defect characterization measurements across different research groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a review of experimental and theoretical studies of the spin response of charge carriers to an external magnetic field in bulk semiconductors and semiconductor nanostructures. The linear response is quantitatively characterized by the magnitude of the electron or hole g factor. Various experimental methods for measuring the electron g factor are considered, beginning with historical works and including modern research. A detailed analysis of theoretical methods for calculating the electron and hole g factors in bulk semiconductors and nanostructures of various shapes also includes fundamental work from previous years and the present time.</description>

      <title>An Atomistically Informed Device Engineering (AIDE) Method Realized: A case study in GaAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation-induced defects can have a significant impact on the longevity and performance of semiconductor devices. We present an Atomistically Informed Device Engineering (AIDE) method that integrates first-principles defect properties and experimentally measured parameters into a device model to dynamically simulate the defect chemistry in semiconductors. For a silicon-doped gallium arsenide (GaAs) material, we showcase three capabilities: (i) Fermi level $E_F$ movement including its component electron and hole Fermi levels, (ii) dynamical charge equilibration with the arsenic vacancy serving as an example, and a (iii) diffusion-driven reaction between Coulomb attracted gallium interstitial ($Ga_i$) and arsenic vacancy ($v_{As}$). Governed by charge carrier reactions, the electron and hole Fermi levels remained dissimilar until equilibrium was achieved at $E_F\approx1.32$ eV. The equilibrium Fermi level was verified by successfully identifying $v_{As}^{3-}$ as the most populated charge state within the arsenic vacancy defect. Lastly, a Coulomb attraction, created by the shifted Fermi level and the charge equilibration process, between $Ga_i^{1+}$ and $v_{As}^{3-}$ resulted in the formation of a doubly negative gallium antisite ($Ga_{As}^{2-}$). The AIDE method can access experimentally inaccessible short-time and low-concentration regimes, is generalizable to other more complex systems (e.g., indium gallium arsenide), and, after solving open problems in GaAs, will serve as a virtual experiment to bound estimates for difficult-to-measure physical quantities.</description>

      <title>Dirac semimetal strontium iridate thin films with strong spin-orbit interaction for magnetic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural crystal features, electron transport and magnetotransport of the epitaxial strontium iridate (SrIrO$_3$) and iridate/manganite SrIrO$_3$/La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ heterostructure have been investigated. The influence of epitaxial strain relaxation caused by the lattice mismatch between SrIrO$_3$ films and five substrates: SrTiO$_3$, NdGaO$_3$, (LaAlO$_3$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_2$TaAlO$_6$)$_{0.7}$, LaAlO$_3$, and Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$-PbTiO$_3$ on electron and magnetic transport has been observed. A pronounced impact of strong spin-orbit interaction on characteristics of SrIrO$_3$ films has been revealed by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, magnetoresistance and Hall-resistance measurements at temperatures T = 2-300 K. These findings highlight the tunability of spin-orbit-driven transport phenomena in strain-controlled SrIrO$_3$-based epitaxial systems, relevant for future spintronic oxide heterostructures. The contribution of Kondo scattering on temperature dependence of SrIrO$_3$ films resistance was observed.</description>

      <title>Critical Disconnect Between Structural and Electronic Recovery in Amorphous GaAs during Recrystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of structure and functionality through amorphous to crystalline phase transitions is critical for predicting and designing devices for application in extreme conditions. Here, we consider both aspects of recrystallization of irradiated GaAs. We find that structural evolution occurs in two stages, a low temperature regime characterized by slow, epitaxial front propagation and a high-temperature regime above dominated by rapid growth and formation of dense nanotwin networks. We link aspects of this structural evolution to local ordering, or paracrystallinity, within the amorphous phase. Critically, the electronic recovery of the materials is not commensurate with this structural evolution. The electronic properties of the recrystallized material deviate further from the pristine material than do those of the amorphous phase, highlighting the incongruence between structural and electronic recovery and the contrasting impact of loss of long range order versus localized defects on the functionality of semiconducting materials.</description>

      <title>A Normalized Descriptor for Unbiased Screening of Second-Order Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order nonlinear optical materials enable frequency doubling of light (second-harmonic generation, SHG), which is essential for optoelectronic applications ranging from materials characterization to quantum technologies. However, comparing SHG performance across materials remains challenging as the second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ spans several orders of magnitude and strongly depends on the band gap $E_g$. To address this, we empirically validate a theoretical upper bound on $\chi^{(2)}$ using new databases of \textit{ab initio}-computed nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. We then formulate a normalized descriptor, $\hat{d}$, which expresses the NLO response of a material relative to the band gap-dependent physical limit. We show that $\hat{d}$ exhibits a similar distribution across a wide range of band gap energies. This universality supports the use of $\hat{d}$ as a robust, generalizable descriptor for data-driven and chemistry-informed machine learning models of NLO response, enabling accelerated materials discovery and optimization across broad application frequencies.</description>

      <title>EGMOF: Efficient Generation of Metal-Organic Frameworks Using a Hybrid Diffusion-Transformer Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing materials with targeted properties remains challenging due to the vastness of chemical space and the scarcity of property-labeled data. While recent advances in generative models offer a promising way for inverse design, most approaches require large datasets and must be retrained for every new target property. Here, we introduce the EGMOF (Efficient Generation of MOFs), a hybrid diffusion-transformer framework that overcomes these limitations through a modular, descriptor-mediated workflow. EGMOF decomposes inverse design into two steps: (1) a one-dimensional diffusion model (Prop2Desc) that maps desired properties to chemically meaningful descriptors followed by (2) a transformer model (Desc2MOF) that generates structures from these descriptors. This modular hybrid design enables minimal retraining and maintains high accuracy even under small-data conditions. On a hydrogen uptake dataset, EGMOF achieved over 95% validity and 84% hit rate, representing significant improvements of up to 57% in validity and 14% in hit rate compared to existing methods, while remaining effective with only 1,000 training samples. Moreover, our model successfully performed conditional generation across 29 diverse property datasets, including CoREMOF, QMOF, and text-mined experimental datasets, whereas previous models have not. This work presents a data-efficient, generalizable approach to the inverse design of diverse MOFs and highlights the potential of modular inverse design workflows for broader materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Commutative Algebra Modeling in Materials Science -- A Case Study on Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of important crystalline and highly porous materials whose hierarchical geometry and chemistry hinder interpretable predictions in materials properties. Commutative algebra is a branch of abstract algebra that has been rarely applied in data and material sciences. We introduce the first ever commutative algebra modeling and prediction in materials science. Specifically, category-specific commutative algebra (CSCA) is proposed as a new framework for MOF representation and learning. It integrates element-based categorization with multiscale algebraic invariants to encode both local coordination motifs and global network organization of MOFs. These algebraically consistent, chemically aware representations enable compact, interpretable, and data efficient modeling of MOF properties such as Henry's constants and uptake capacities for common gases. Compared to traditional geometric and graph-based approaches, CSCA achieves comparable or superior predictive accuracy while substantially improving interpretability and stability across data sets. By aligning commutative algebra with the chemical hierarchy, the CSCA establishes a rigorous and generalizable paradigm for understanding structure and property relationships in porous materials and provides a nonlinear algebra-based framework for data-driven material discovery.</description>

      <title>Mysterious Role of Cap Configuration in Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Catalytic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the role of cap structure during the nucleation and growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is essential for achieving chirality-controlled synthesis. In this work, we propose a novel and intuitive algorithm to determine the chirality of nascent carbon caps by tracking the relative shifts of six pentagons within a topological coordinate system. Based on this algorithm, we propose three routes of pentagon shifts for the chirality mutations from armchair (AC) to near-AC caps, namely the transverse shift (n,n) to (n+1,n-1), inward shift (n,n) to (n-1), and outward shift (n,n) to (n+1,n), can occur according to the energy profiles calculated based on the density function theory (DFT), providing a new perspective to explain the experimental abundance of near-AC SWCNTs. After that, we construct 24 representative short caps and long SWCNTs with different chiralities and symmetries, and perform DFT calculations to evaluate their thermodynamic stability and deformation behaviors on flat Ni(111) surfaces and curved Ni55 particle, respectively. The results reveal that cap topology and catalyst curvature together induce dual deformations that significantly influence the formation and interface energies. Notably, AC and near-AC caps exhibit superior flexibility and robust energetic advantages, especially the (6,6) cap with C6v symmetry. A linear correlation between cap-induced deformation and formation energy is established through a defined shape factor, highlighting the interaction between cap structure and catalyst interface as a key driver of chirality selection. This study theoretically reveals the cap evolution mechanism and lays the foundation for the rational design of SWCNT growth strategies.</description>

      <title>Tunable Multistage Refrigeration via Geometrically Frustrated Triangular Lattice Antiferromagnet for Space Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-temperature refrigeration technology constitutes a crucial component in space exploration. The small-scale, low-vibration Stirling-type pulse tube refrigerators hold significant application potential for space cooling. However, the efficient operation of current Stirling-type pulse tube cryocoolers in space cooling applications remains challenging due to the rapid decay of the heat capacity of regenerative materials below 10 K. This study adopts a novel material strategy: using a novel high-spin S = 7/2 magnetic regenerative material, Gd2O2Se, we construct a multistage tunable regenerative material structure to achieve an efficient cooling approach to the liquid helium temperature range. Under substantial geometric frustration from a double-layered triangular lattice, it exhibits two-step specific heat transition peaks at 6.22 K and 2.11 K, respectively. Its ultrahigh specific heat and broad two-step transition temperature range effectively bridge the gap between commercially used high-heat-capacity materials. Experimental verification shows that when Gd2O2Se is combined with Er3Ni and HoCu2 in the Stirling-type pulse tube cryocooler, the cooling efficiency of the pulse tube increases by 66.5 % at 7 K, and the minimum achievable temperature reaches 5.85 K. These results indicate that Gd2O2Se is an ideal magnetic regenerative material for space cooling</description>

      <title>Axial phono-magnetic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axial or circularly polarized phonons are collective lattice vibrations with angular momentum. Over the past decade they have emerged as a promising mechanism for the manipulation of magnetism, in parallel to well established optical protocols. In particular, coherent axial phonons were shown to induce magnetization in materials without spin-ordering, making them a viable tool for ultrafast magnetic switching. The experimental evidence suggests that the size of this magnetization is significant, opening a new research area on the phono-magnetic effect. Remarkably, the coupling of axial phonons to magnetism has been observed a broad class of materials, pointing to a universal nature of the underlying mechanisms. In this review article, we present the recent progress in the field. We give an introduction to the phenomenological perspective and an overview of the experimental evidence for the magnetization emerging from axial phonons, which includes discussing the observations of phonon Zeeman effect, the magneto-optical Kerr effect and the proximity-induced magnetization switching. We present recently proposed microscopic theories for the phono-magnetic effects, based on perturbation theory, adiabatic motion and Floquet theory as well as the emergence of the phonon magnetic moment due to artificial gauge fields or inertial effects. This summary allows us to see correspondences between the seemingly different theoretical approaches, facilitating a more complete perspective of the effect.</description>

      <title>Core-Shell Confinement Blocks Hydride Formation: The Impact of Surface Oxides on Hydrogen Sorption in Nanoporous FeTi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal hydrides remain an intriguing alternative to conventional gaseous and liquid hydrogen storage methods, offering high volumetric storage density and enhanced hydrogen storage safety at ambient conditions. In this regard, the intermetallic compound FeTi is one of the most promising storage materials. However, its widespread industrial application remains challenging due to the need for activation, slow initial kinetics, large hysteresis, and high material costs. In this study, we aim to overcome these limitations by devising an alternative synthesis pathway to prepare nanoporous and ultra-fine porous FeTi with controlled grain and ligament sizes, allowing us to study the obtained well-defined microstructures in detail. In particular, we observe the confinement of the FeTi phase by surface oxides, which can be correlated with the hydrogen sorption properties of the respective material. These experimental results are further supported by an analytical model allowing the calculation of the absorption pressure as a function of microstructure-dependent elastic stresses. Additionally, we show that such stresses also influence the absorption-desorption hysteresis. This study lays the groundwork for the controlled and systematic study of the processing-structure-properties relations in metal hydrides and FeTi in particular, thereby paving the way to cost-effective and efficient hydrogen storage solutions based on metal hydrides.</description>

      <title>Enhancing composition-based materials property prediction by cross-modal knowledge transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal graph neural networks are widely applicable in modeling experimentally synthesized compounds and hypothetical materials with unknown synthesizability. In contrast, structure-agnostic predictive algorithms allow exploring previously inaccessible domains of chemical space. Here we present a universal approach for enhancing composition-based materials property prediction by means of cross-modal knowledge transfer. Two formulations are proposed: implicit transfer involves pretraining chemical language models on multimodal embeddings, whereas explicit transfer suggests generating crystal structures and implementing structure-aware predictors. The proposed approaches were benchmarked on LLM4Mat-Bench and MatBench tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 25 out of 32 cases. In addition, we demonstrated how another modeling aspect of chemical language models - interpretability - benefits from applying a game-theoretic approach, which is able to incorporate high-order feature interactions.</description>

      <title>Development of a magnetic interatomic potential for cubic anti-ferromagnets: the case of NiO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interatomic potentials are essential for molecular dynamics simulations of magnetic materials, yet incorporating magnetic features into potentials for complex antiferromagnets remains challenging. Nickel oxide (NiO), a prototypical cubic antiferromagnet, exemplifies this difficulty. Here we develop a methodology to integrate magnetic properties into interatomic potentials for cubic antiferromagnets by adding a magnetic Hamiltonian which includes both the Heisenberg exchange and N\'eel model. We apply this approach to NiO by constructing two potentials: one based on the Born model of ionic solids and another using a reference-free modified embedded atom method. Both potentials include magnetoelastic interactions and are validated against Density Functional Theory calculations, showing excellent agreement in mechanical and magnetic properties at zero temperature. These models enable large-scale simulations of magnetoelastic phenomena in antiferromagnets and open avenues for molecular dynamics studies involving coupled electric and magnetic fields in metal oxides.</description>

      <title>Statistical imaging of NV centers reveals clustered defect formation in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sharp optical resonances of NV- centers in diamond at cryogenic temperatures offer powerful new capabilities for material characterization, but extracting the most detailed information typically requires careful calibration of individual sensors, limiting scalability. In this work, we use resonant photoluminescence excitation imaging to optically resolve and monitor hundreds of individual NVs across large fields of view, enabling statistical analysis of their spatial distribution with sub-diffraction resolution. This multiplexed, non-destructive approach allows quantum sensors to characterize the material platform they inhabit. Focusing on CVD-grown diamond, we uncover significant deviations from random distributions, including an unexpectedly high occurrence of closely spaced clusters comprising two or more NVs. These findings suggest non-Poissonian formation dynamics and point to spatially correlated defect generation mechanisms. Beyond offering insight into diamond growth and NV center formation, our approach enables the scalable identification of naturally occurring NV clusters - configurations that are promising for entanglement-assisted quantum information protocols and correlated sensing - and establishes a path toward structural and electronic defect analysis in various material hosts at the single-emitter level.</description>

      <title>Structural characterization and bonding energy analysis for plasma-activated bonding of SiCN films: A reactive molecular dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma-activated bonding of SiCN films offers high bonding strength at the hybrid-bonding interface, thereby enhancing mechanical reliability. Although experimental studies have shown that the interfacial bonding properties of SiCN films vary with SiCN composition and plasma treatment parameters, a clear correlation between these parameters and the resulting bonding properties has not yet been established. This study presents an atomistic investigation of SiCN-SiCN plasma-activated bonding with controlled SiCN composition and plasma fluence, which performs O2 plasma surface activation, surface hydroxylation, direct bonding, post-bonding annealing, and debonding using reactive molecular dynamics. The structural characterization of the plasma-activated SiCN surface, including density of various covalent bonds and surface roughness, exhibits composition- and plasma fluence-dependent chemical and morphological modification. Bonding energy evaluated from atomic traction-separation responses in cohesive zone volume elements (CZVE) during debonding simulations shows a positive correlation with the interfacial Si-O-Si density. Since the interfacial Si-O-Si density reflects the combined effects of these chemical and morphological modifications, the dependence of bonding energy on composition and plasma fluence is successfully elucidated by the structural characterization. These results establish an atomic-level material-process-property relationship and offer practical guidance for optimizing SiCN composition and plasma treatment parameters for SiCN-SiCN plasma-activated bonding.</description>

      <title>Topological transition and emergent elasticity of dislocation in skyrmion lattice: Beyond Kittel's magnetic-polar analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic and polar skyrmions exhibit topologically protected quasiparticle behavior, including emergent fields, deformation, and the formation of a densely packed skyrmion lattice, beyond conventional domain configurations described by Kittel's law. Analogous to atomic crystals, lattice defects, especially dislocations and their associated strain fields, are crucial for understanding the lattice behavior of skyrmions; however, their features and roles remain insufficiently understood. Here, we show that magnetic skyrmion dislocations develop a core-split structure due to a significant skyrmion elongation up to 180% of their original length, reaching a topological transition from a single skyrmion to two half-skyrmions. Despite such a distinct structure, the long-range strain fields around the dislocation perfectly obey conventional Volterra's elasticity theory, in contrast to polar skyrmion lattices, where skyrmion deformations cause a breakdown of the elasticity theory. Furthermore, an energetic analysis shows that Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction drives the large skyrmion deformation of the dislocation core. Our findings not only clarify the coexistence of topological core-reconstruction and a robust long-range elastic field of dislocations in magnetic skyrmion lattices, but also reveal that magnetic and electric domains, long regarded as dual and analogous, exhibit fundamental differences when extended into the regime of collective topological quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Real Chern Insulators in Two-Dimensional Altermagnetic Fe$_2$S$_2$O and Fe$_2$Se$_2$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs), recently identified as a third class of collinear magnetic materials, have attracted significant attention in condensed matter physics. Despite this growing interest, the realization of real Chern insulators in intrinsic altermagnetic systems has rarely been reported. In this work, based on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we identify monolayer Fe$_2$S$_2$O and Fe$_2$Se$_2$O as a novel class of two-dimensional altermagnetic real Chern insulators. We demonstrate that these materials possess altermagnetic ground states and host a nontrivial mirror real Chern number, leading to the emergence of symmetry-protected zero-dimensional corner states. Notably, these corner modes are spin-polarized, giving rise to a unique spin-corner coupling effect. We further show that the real Chern insulating phases and their associated corner states remain robust against spin-orbit coupling, as well as under both uniaxial and biaxial strain. Additionally, these materials exhibit pronounced linear dichroism and strong optical absorption. Our findings uncover the novel topological character of Fe$_2$S$_2$O and Fe$_2$Se$_2$O, establishing them as promising platforms for exploring real Chern insulators in altermagnetic systems.</description>

      <title>pH-Responsive Glyphosate Adsorption on Hydroxylated Carbon Nanotubes: From Electronic Structure to Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This computational study investigates glyphosate adsorption mechanisms on hydroxyl-functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as an alternative approach for environmental remediation. Single-walled CNTs with (10,0) zigzag chirality were functionalized with hydroxyl groups at concentrations of 5-25% and evaluated for interactions with glyphosate in five different ionization states (G1-G5) corresponding to pH-dependent protonation. Using semi-empirical tight-binding methods implemented in xTB software, molecular geometry optimization, electronic property calculations, topological analyses via Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM), and molecular dynamics simulations at 300K were performed. Results demonstrate that functionalization significantly enhances adsorption capacity, with binding energies becoming increasingly negative at higher OH concentrations and with more deprotonated glyphosate forms (G4 and G5). Electronic coupling analyses reveal optimized charge reactivity and transport in systems with 20-25% OH functionalization. Topological characterization identified 477 bond critical points, confirming donor-acceptor interactions with strong covalent contributions, particularly in highly functionalized systems. Radial distribution function profiles from molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that functionalization promotes spatial organization on nanotube surfaces, increasing contact regions and reducing molecular mobility. Systems with moderate interactions (CNT+OHx+G1 and CNT+OHx+G3) present environmentally and economically viable solutions, enabling adsorbent regeneration and reuse. The findings indicate that OH-functionalized carbon nanotubes show significant promise for glyphosate detection and capture applications in environmental monitoring and remediation, regardless of the pesticide's ionization state.</description>

      <title>Single photon emitters in hBN: Limitations of atomic resolution imaging and potential sources of error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in identifying the origin of single-photon emission in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), with proposed candidates including boron and nitrogen vacancies as well as carbon substitutional dopants. Because photon emission intensity often increases with sample thickness, hBN flakes used in these studies commonly exceed 30 atomic layers. To identify potential emitters at the atomic scale, annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) is frequently employed. However, due to the intrinsic AA' stacking of hBN with vertically alternating boron and nitrogen atoms, this approach is complicated even in few-layer systems. Here, we demonstrate using STEM image simulations and experiments that, even under idealized conditions, the intensity differences between boron- and nitrogen-dominated columns and carbon substitutions become indistinguishable at thicknesses beyond 17 atomic layers (ca. 6 nm). While vacancy-type defects can remain detectable at somewhat larger thicknesses, also their detection becomes unreliable at thicknesses typically used in photonic studies. We further show that common residual aberrations, particularly threefold astigmatism, can lead to artificial contrast differences between columns, which may result in misidentification of atomic defects. We systematically study the effects of non-radially symmetric aberrations on multilayer hBN and demonstrate that even small residual threefold astigmatism can significantly distort the STEM contrast, leading to misleading interpretations.</description>

      <title>Efficient GPU Parallelization of Electronic Transport and Nonequilibrium Dynamics from Electron-Phonon Interactions in the Perturbo Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) with electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions computed from first principles is widely used to study electronic transport and nonequilibrium dynamics in materials. Calculating the e-ph collision integral is the most important step in the BTE, but it remains computationally costly, even with current MPI+OpenMP parallelization. This challenge makes it difficult to study materials with large unit cells and to achieve high resolution in momentum space. Here, we show acceleration of BTE calculations of electronic transport and ultrafast dynamics using graphical processing units (GPUs). We implement a novel data structure and algorithm, optimized for GPU hardware and developed using OpenACC, to process scattering channels and efficiently compute the collision integral. This approach significantly reduces the overhead for data referencing, movement, and synchronization. Relative to the efficient CPU implementation in the open-source package Perturbo (v2.2.0), used as a baseline, this approach achieves a speed-up of 40 times for both transport and nonequilibrium dynamics on GPU hardware, and achieves nearly linear scaling up to 100 GPUs. The novel data structure can be generalized to other electron interactions and scattering processes. We released this GPU implementation in the latest public version (v3.0.0) of Perturbo. The new MPI+OpenMP+GPU parallelization enables sweeping studies of e-ph physics and electron dynamics in conventional and quantum materials, and prepares Perturbo for exascale supercomputing platforms.</description>

      <title>Intercalation induced quasi-freestanding layer in TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is employed to study the electronic structure of bulk TiSe2 before and after doping with potassium impurities. A splitting in the conduction band into two branches is observed after room-temperature deposition. The splitting energy increases to approximately 130 meV when the sample is cooled to 40 K. One branch exhibits a non-dispersive two-dimensional feature, while other one shows the characteristics of three dimensional bulk band dispersion. Core level spectroscopy suggests that the K impurities predominantly occupy the intercalated sites within the van derWaals gap. The results indicate the formation of a quasi-freestandingTiSe2 layer. Additionally, doping completely suppresses the periodic lattice distortion in the surface region. These findings are further supported by density functional theory calculations, which compare the band structure of monolayer and bulk TiSe2 with experimental data. Thus, the dimensional and intrinsic electronic properties of 1T-TiSe2 can be controlled through the intercalation procedure used in this work.</description>

      <title>Magnetism and Peierls distortion in Dirac semimetal CaMnBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac semimetals of the form $A$Mn$X_2$ ($A =$ alkaline-earth or divalent rare earth; $X =$ Bi, Sb) host conducting square-net Dirac-electron layers of $X$ atoms interleaved with antiferromagnetic Mn$X$ layers. In these materials, canted antiferromagnetism can break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and produce a Weyl semimetallic state. CaMnBi$_2$ was proposed to realize this behavior below $T^{*}\sim 50$ K, where anomalies in resistivity and optical conductivity were reported. We investigate single-crystal CaMnBi$_{2}$ using polarized and unpolarized neutron diffraction, x-ray diffraction, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the underlying crystal and magnetic structures. The results show that the observed anomalies do not originate from spin canting or weak ferromagnetism; no measurable uniform Mn spin canting is detected. Instead, CaMnBi$_2$ undergoes a coupled structural and magnetic symmetry-lowering transition at $T^{*} = 46(2)$ K, from a tetragonal lattice with C-type antiferromagnetism to an orthorhombic phase with unit-cell doubling along the $c$ axis and minimal impact on magnetism. Analysis of superlattice peak intensities and lattice distortion reveals a continuous second-order transition governed by a single order parameter. The refined atomic displacements correspond to a zigzag bond-order-wave (BOW) modulation of Bi-Bi bonds, consistent with an electronically driven Peierls-type instability in the Dirac-electron Bi layer, long anticipated by Hoffmann and co-workers [W.~Tremel and R.~Hoffmann, \textit{J. Am. Chem. Soc.} \textbf{109}, 124 (1987); G.~A.~Papoian and R.~Hoffmann, \textit{Angew. Chem. Int.

      <title>Low-temperature entropies and possible states in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entropy that an insulating magnetic material releases upon cooling can reveal important information about the properties of spin states in that material. In many geometrically frustrated (GF) magnetic compounds, the heat capacity exhibits a low-temperature peak that comes from the spin states continuously connected to the ground states of classical models, such as the Ising model, on the same GF lattice, which manifests in the amount of entropy associated with this heat-capacity peak. In this work, we simulate numerically the values of entropy released by higher-spin triangular-lattice layered systems and materials on SCGO lattices. We also compare the experimentally measured values of entropy in several strongly GF compounds, $NiGa_2S_4$, $FeAl_2Se_4$ and SCGO/BSZCGO, with possible theoretical values inferred from the classical models to which the quantum states of those materials may be connected. This comparison suggests that the lowest-energy states of higher-spin layered triangular-lattice compounds can be described in terms of doublet states on individual magnetic sites. Our analyses demonstrate how the values of entropy can reveal the structure of low-energy magnetic states in GF compounds and call for more accurate thermodynamic measurement in GF magnetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report measurements of the London penetration depth ($\lambda_L$) and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) coherence length ($\xi_0$) in oxygen-doped niobium, with impurity concentrations spanning the "clean" to "dirty" limits. Depth-resolved low-energy muon spin spectroscopy (LE-$\mu$SR) was used to quantify the element's Meissner screening profiles, analyzed within a framework that accounts for nonlocal electrodynamics. The analysis indicates intrinsic length scales of $\lambda_L = 29.1(10)$ nm and $\xi_0 = 39.9(25)$ nm, corresponding to a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter of $\kappa = 0.70(5)$. The obtained $\lambda_L$ and $\kappa$ value are smaller than values commonly used in applications and modeling, indicating that clean niobium lies at the boundary between type-I and type-II superconductivity, supporting the contemporary view that its intrinsic state may be type-I.</description>

Abstract: When liquids are cooled, their dynamics are slowed, and if crystallization is avoided, they will solidify into an amorphous structure referred to as a glass. Experiments show that chemically distinct glass-forming liquids have universal features of the spectrum and temperature dependence of the main structural relaxation. We introduce Randium, a generic energetically coarse-grained model of viscous liquids, and demonstrate that the intrinsic dynamics of viscous liquids emerges. These results suggest that Randium belongs to a universal class of systems whose dynamics capture the essential physics of viscous liquid relaxation, bridging microscopic molecular models and coarse-grained theoretical descriptions.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Skew Scattering Nonreciprocal Magneto-Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In materials with broken inversion symmetry, nonreciprocal magneto-transport (NRMT) manifests as a bilinear dependence of charge conductivity on applied electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields. This phenomenon is deeply rooted in symmetry and electronic quantum geometry, holding promise for novel rectification and detector technologies. Existing experimental studies generally attribute NRMT to Zeeman-driven mechanisms and exhibit quadratic scaling with conductivity. Here, we report a previously unknown NRMT microscopic mechanism - Lorentz skew scattering (LSK) - revealed through the discovery of an unprecedented quartic scaling law of NRMT as well as quantitative agreement between theory and experiment in BiTeBr. LSK emerges from the interplay of Lorentz force and skew scattering, bridging classical field effect to quantum scattering effect on the Fermi surface. We demonstrate that the LSK dominates NRMT in BiTeBr, and elucidate that this dominance over other possible contributions stems from high mobility and strong Rashba splitting. The finding of LSK mechanism is of unique importance because it unveils the leading NRMT effect in high-mobility systems and suggests a universal principle towards strong NRMT by enhancing electronic relaxation time in topological materials, rendering a new designing idea for low-dissipation rectifiers and high-performance quantum electronics.</description>

Abstract: The layered $3d$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) CoTe$_2$ and NiTe$_2$ are topological Dirac Type-II metals. Their $d$-bands do not exhibit the expected correlation-induced band narrowing seen in CoO and NiO. We address this conundrum by quantifying the on-site Coulomb energy $U_{dd}$ via single-particle partial density of states and the two-hole correlation satellite using valence band resonant photoemission spectroscopy (PES), and obtain $U_{dd}$ = 3.0 eV/3.7 eV for CoTe$_2$/NiTe$_2$. Charge-transfer (CT) cluster model simulations of the measured core-level PES and x-ray absorption spectra of CoTe$_2$ and CoO validate their contrasting electronic parameters:$U_{dd}$ and CT energy $\Delta$ are (3.0 eV, -2.0 eV) for CoTe$_2$, and (5.0 eV, 4.0 eV) for CoO, respectively. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for CoTe$_2$$&lt;$CoO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in CoTe$_2$ is not due to $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$-count$\sim$1 by CT from ligand to Co site in CoTe$_2$ is due to a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$. Yet, only because $U_{dd}$$&gt;$$\big|\Delta\big|$, CoTe$_{2}$ becomes a topological metal with $p$$\rightarrow$${p}$ type lowest energy excitations. Similarly, we obtain a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ in NiTe$_2$ compared to NiO. The study reveals the nexus between negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ required for setting up the electronic structure framework for achieving topological behavior via band inversion in correlated metals.</description>

      <title>Graphene-enabled coherent terahertz wave detection and thickness determination</title>

Abstract: Coherent detection and interferometry in the terahertz (THz) regime are key capabilities that enable applications ranging from astronomy to non-destructive testing. Phase-sensitive THz detection is currently achieved using nonlinear crystals or external interferometers and photomixers. However, the former approach requires femtosecond pulsed radiation, and all approaches suffer from a large footprint and sensitive alignment. Here, we demonstrate a graphene-enabled, on-chip, integrated THz detector-interferometer with optical cavity and antenna, exhibiting high sensitivity to the phase of incident THz light. We exploit this by determining the thickness of thin films placed in front of the detector-interferometer, obtaining a strongly sub-wavelength thickness accuracy of $\sim$5 $\mu$m, while we predict that an accuracy of 10 nm is within reach. This is relevant for a range of industrial application domains, including automotive, construction, and health. The detector-interferometer moreover exhibits a record-high external responsivity - without any normalization to a diffraction-limited spot size - of 73 mA/W and a noise-equivalent power of 79 pW$~\rm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. This performance is due to enhanced absorption at the cavity mode around 89 GHz, in agreement with multi-physics simulations. These results pave the way to exploiting coherent wave detection in the THz regime with utility in spectroscopy, next-generation wireless communication, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e modulated quantum spin liquid candidate 1T-TaSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are quantum phases of matter featuring collectively entangled states and emergent fractional many-body excitations. While methods exist to probe three-dimensional quantum spin liquids experimentally, these techniques lack the sensitivity to probe two-dimensional quantum spin liquids. This seriously hampers the study of potential monolayer quantum spin liquid candidates such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and 1T-TaSe$_2$. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) have recently been suggested as promising probes of the quantum spin liquid state, as they can access the spinon spectrum through inelastic tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). In this work, we employ this approach on the quantum spin liquid candidate material 1T-TaSe$_2$ and directly measure its low-energy inelastic excitations. We observe the emergence of a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ reconstruction driven by the substrate, equivalent spectroscopy across all spin sites and coexistence of zero and finite energy excitations. We show that these observations are consistent with a modulated $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ spin liquid ground state. Our results demonstrate that IETS provides a powerful route to obtain atomic-scale insight into the magnetic excitations of two-dimensional materials, allowing to explore the effects of moir\'e modulations on potential quantum liquid phases.</description>

      <title>Coherent Phonon Negative Refraction via Interfacial Momentum Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negative refraction of coherent phonons is crucial for thermal management and quantum information processing, but it remains unrealized because achieving the suitable dispersion for negative refraction simultaneously with long-range coherence is challenging. In this letter, we overcome this limitation by introducing a momentum compensation mechanism mediated by discrete translational symmetry. Interfacial reciprocal lattice vectors provide momentum compensation during phonon tunneling and induce asymmetric mode matching, resulting in negative refraction without requiring strong dispersion anisotropy or a negative-curvature band. Using non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we demonstrate coherent negative refraction of isotropic acoustic phonons in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures. This general mechanism enables active control of phonon flow via interfacial design, paving the way for applications in atomic-scale phonon lenses and directional thermal transport.</description>

Abstract: Automated detection of grain boundaries (GBs) in electron microscope images of polycrystalline materials could help accelerate the nanoscale characterization of myriad engineering materials and novel materials under scientific research. Accurate segmentation of interconnected line networks, such as GBs in polycrystalline material microstructures, poses a significant challenge due to the fragmented masks produced by conventional computer vision (CV) algorithms, including convolutional neural networks. These algorithms struggle with thin masks, often necessitating post-processing for effective contour closure and continuity. Previous approaches in this domain have typically relied on custom post-processing techniques that are problem-specific and heavily dependent on the quality of the mask obtained from a CV algorithm. Addressing this issue, this paper introduces a fast, high-fidelity post-processing technique that is universally applicable to segmentation masks of interconnected line networks. Leveraging domain knowledge about grain boundary connectivity, this method employs conditional random fields and perceptual grouping rules to refine segmentation masks of any image with a discernible grain structure. This approach significantly enhances segmentation mask accuracy by correctly reconstructing fragmented GBs in electron microscopy images of a polycrystalline oxide. The refinement improves the statistical representation of the microstructure, reflected by a 51 % improvement in a grain alignment metric that provides a more physically meaningful assessment of complex microstructures than conventional metrics. This method enables rapid and accurate characterization, facilitating an unprecedented level of data analysis and improving the understanding of GB networks, making it suitable for a range of disciplines where precise segmentation of interconnected line networks is essential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal conductivity, a fundamental parameter characterizing thermal transport in solids, is typically determined by electron and phonon transport. Although other transport properties including electrical conductivity and thermoelectric conversion coefficients have material-specific values, it is known that thermal conductivity can be modulated artificially via phonon engineering techniques. Here, we demonstrate another way of artificially modulating the heat conduction in solids: magnonic thermal transport engineering. The time-domain thermoreflectance measurements using ferromagnetic metal/insulator junction systems reveal that the thermal conductivity of the ferromagnetic metals and interfacial thermal conductance vary significantly depending on the spatial distribution of nonequilibrium spin currents. Systematic measurements of the thermal transport properties with changing the boundary conditions for spin currents show that the observed thermal transport modulation stems from magnon origin. This observation unveils that magnons significantly contribute to the heat conduction even in ferromagnetic metals at room temperature, upsetting the conventional wisdom that the thermal conductivity mediated by magnons is very small in metals except at low temperatures. The magnonic thermal transport engineering offers a new principle and method for active thermal management.</description>

Abstract: We present measurements on in-plane Young's modulus and the Gr\"{u}neisen parameter of multilayer graphene with varying number of layers, obtained through {\it in situ} bulge tests. Accurate determination of their elastic parameters poses a significant experimental challenge due to the substantial differences in mechanical behavior between intra- and inter-layers. To address this, we develop a novel theoretical model with first-principles calculations to investigate thickness-dependent incomplete strain transfer between the layers. Our findings show that the experimentally measured elastic constants, which deviate from computed intrinsic values, fail to fully capture ideal mechanical couplings between layers. As a solution, we propose a new mechanical modulus that integrates the Gr\"{u}neisen parameter and in-plane Young's modulus, providing a more reliable representation of their mechanical properties, independent of unavoidable interlayer effects.</description>

      <title>Atomic resolution imaging of the strength and 3D direction of atomic displacements in functional oxide thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic resolution imaging is key to understanding thin film growth and how a particular set of conditions influences properties. Whilst such imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) has had transformative impact in nanoscience, it forms projection images and provides no direct information about displacements perpendicular to the image plane. In this article we show that it is possible to make atomic resolution maps of the direction and magnitude of La displacements at ~30{\deg} to the imaging plane in a La2CoMnO6 thin film on (111) LSAT (LaAlO3-La(Sr,Ta)O3) using a 4-dimensional STEM (4DSTEM) methodology. This reveals that the La modulation lies preferentially in the interface plane, and is strongly suppressed close to the epitaxial interface, and further reveals how the modulation varies with distance from the interface with unit cell resolution. These details would be completely invisible to all prior techniques in electron microscopy and this sheds light on why this particular substrate in this orientation best promotes double perovskite cation ordering, and the consequent optimal magnetic ordering for this thin film system. The approach used herein of fitting atomic resolution 4DSTEM data to determine crystal parameters opens the door for a new era of atomic-resolution crystallography.</description>

      <title>Elastic tensor-derived properties of composition-dependent disordered refractory binary alloys using DFPT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00127v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elastic tensor provides valuable insight into the mechanical behavior of a material with lattice strain, such as disordered binary alloys. Traditional stress-strain methods have made it possible to compute elastic constants for ordered structures and individually tailored alloy compositions. However, this approach depends on predetermined or iteratively-chosen strain tensors. This poses a significant challenge for systematic, composition-dependent studies of disordered materials with low symmetry. DFPT provides a compelling alternative to stress-strain methods: it allows for an unbiased determination of the elastic tensor, as well as access to local field data derived from the underlying general response function framework. Despite its intrinsic flexibility and efficiency, DFPT has seen limited application to the study of disordered systems. At the same time, there is a growing need for expanded quantum mechanical data to improve predictive modeling of complex disordered material properties. Here we present results for the rigid-ion and relaxed-ion elastic tensors computed using DFPT, for a comprehensive set of structural refractory BCC binary alloys of Mo, Nb, Ta, and W. We map the quantum-driven heterogeneity in elastic properties, and associated relaxation fields at each disordered structure lattice site, by computing the force response internal strain tensor and displacement response internal strain tensors. Derived properties -- the bulk modulus ($B$), shear modulus ($G$), Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), Pugh's ratio ($B/G$), Cauchy pressure and elastic anisotropy -- are reported as a function of composition for all refractory binaries. The DFPT-computed mechanical properties data for the refractory binary alloys at systematically-varied Mo, Nb, Ta, and W compositions are in excellent agreement with available experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 3-dimensional orientation of La atom modulations has been mapped in two thin films of La2CoMnO6 grown on SrTiO3 and LSAT ([La,Sr,Al,Ta] oxide) using a 4D-scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) method based on the recently developed Digital Dark Field method. This images the shifts of diffraction spots and the azimuthal intensity distribution in the First Order Laue Zone, and then uses them to reconstruct and map the 3D crystallography. This clearly shows a flip from out-of-plane modulation with tensile strain on SrTiO3 to in-plane modulation with compressive strain on LSAT. This hitherto unobserved crystallographic change had a significant influence on the out-of-plane lattice parameter which left more room for the full incorporation of the larger CoO6 octahedra in the film grown on LSAT and therefore explained the improved Mn-Co ordering and better properties for this film. Moreover, the method would be applicable to many other systems of epitaxial growth of complex oxides, revealing crystallographic details of crucial importance to properties which are not visible in conventional atomic resolution imaging.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Ion Conduction Enabled by Site Percolation in Random Substitutional Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and safe energy storage technologies are essential for realizing a sustainable and electrified society. Among the key challenges, the design of superionic conductors for all-solid-state batteries often faces a fundamental trade-off between stability and ionic conductivity. Random substitutional crystals, where atomic species are randomly distributed throughout a crystal lattice, present a promising route to overcome this trade-off. Although the importance of cooperative motion in ion conduction has been pointed out, there is a lack of understanding of the relationship between mesoscale structural organization and macroscopic conductivity, limiting the rational design of optimal compositions. Here, we systematically investigate the ionic conductivity of rock salt random substitutional ionic crystals Li$_x$Pb$_{1-2x}$Bi$_x$Te as a function of Li concentration $x$ using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that ionic conductivity increases sharply once the $x$ exceeds a critical threshold, without disrupting the underlying crystal structure. Strikingly, this threshold aligns with the site-percolation threshold predicted by percolation theory. Our findings establish ion percolation as a universal design principle that reconciles the trade-off between conductivity and stability, offering a simple and broadly applicable strategy for the development of robust, high-performance solid electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature properties and the hidden ferroelectric $R3c$ phase of bulk CaTiO$_3$ from second-principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A second-principles effective interatomic potential is introduced for the prototypical perovskite CaTiO$_3$ (CTO), relying on a Taylor polynomial expansion of the Born-Oppenheimer energy surface around the cubic reference structure, in terms of atomic displacements and macroscopic strains. This model captures various phases of bulk CTO and successfully reproduces, in particular, the structure, energy, and dynamical properties of the nonpolar $Pbnm$ ground state as well as of the hidden ferroelectric $R3c$ phase. Finite-temperature simulations suggest that the still debated sequence of structural phase transitions over heating is $Pbnm \ (a^-a^-c^+) \rightarrow C2/m \ (a^-b^-c^0) \rightarrow I4/mcm \ (a^-c^0c^0) \rightarrow Pm\bar{3}m \ (a^0a^0a^0)$, a sequence during which the oxygen-octahedra rotations around the three pseudocubic axes vanish successively. Although never experimentally observed in bulk, the ferroelectric $R3c$ phase appears to be metastable and at an energy only slightly above the $Pbnm$ ground state at zero Kelvin. The simulations confirm that, if induced in some way, the $R3c$ phase remains stable up to about 300 K and shows ferroelectric properties. Furthermore, we find that the minimum energy path connecting the $Pbnm$ and $R3c$ phases involves localized layer-by-layer flipping of octahedral rotations, a mechanism which is shown to be at play during the thermal destabilization process of the $R3c$ phase toward the $Pbnm$ ground state. The proximity of the $R3c$ phase with the $Pbnm$ ground state suggests that the former could be stabilized under electric field. However, due to the large energy barrier, the field required for the $Pbnm$-to-$R3c$ transition appears to be extremely large, consistent with the fact that bulk CTO was never reported to be ferroelectric nor antiferroelectric.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Spin-Lattice Dynamics with Machine-Learning Potentials</title>

Abstract: Atomic-scale modeling of magnetic materials requires precise treatment of coupled spin-lattice degrees of freedom (DOFs). Traditional spin-lattice dynamics (SLD), employing Newtonian equation for lattice evolution and the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for spin, encounters severe limitations with machine-learning potentials (MLPs), including poor energy conservation and excessive computational costs due to non-symplectic integration. In this work, we propose TSPIN, a unified Nos\'e-Hoover chain (NHC) framework that augments the spin-lattice Lagrangian with spin kinetic terms and thermostat/barostat variables, yielding a symplectic Hamiltonian formulation for NVE, NVT, and NPT ensembles. The method integrates spin and lattice dynamics simultaneously, ensuring energy conservation and reducing computational cost. Benchmarks on harmonic models confirm its accuracy, while Fe simulations with the DeepSPIN potential demonstrate superior stability, efficiency, and the ability to capture magnetic phase transition. TSPIN thus provides a general and efficient framework for large-scale simulations of spin-lattice phenomena and multiple-DOF systems.</description>

      <title>Competing Magnetic Phases in Li-Fe-Ge Kagome Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Competing interlayer magnetic interactions in kagome magnets can lead to diverse magnetic phases, which enable various promising topological or quantum material properties. Here, the electronic structure and magnetic properties have been studied using first-principles calculations for the LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$, LiFe$_6$Ge$_4$, and LiFe$_6$Ge$_5$ compounds sharing the kagome Fe$_3$Ge layer motif but with different interlayer arrangements. For LiFe$_6$Ge$_4$ and LiFe$_6$Ge$_5$, the predicted magnetic ground states are collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) states involving a mix of ferromagnetic (FM) and AFM interlayer orientations. Whereas for LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$, an incommensurate cycloidal spin spiral is stabilized as a ground state, being close to a collinear A-type AFM state. The analysis of magnetic RKKY exchange coupling confirms the results of electronic structure calculations. The values of atomic magnetic moments are in good agreement with existing experimental estimations. Our experiments on LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$ single crystals have observed AFM ordering at ~540 K and transition to another magnetic phase, with a small FM component (possibly with spin canting), below ~270 K. Thus, our theory and experiment suggest the existence and sequence of collinear and noncollinear magnetic states in kagome LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$. Our findings provide a platform for exploring various novel magnetic phases and associated unconventional or topological magnetism.</description>

      <title>Electro-thermal Co-design of Vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky Diodes with High-permittivity BaTiO3 Field-plate for High-field and Thermal Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents electrothermal co-design of vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) to enhance both heat dissipation and high field management in high-power applications. Here, we demonstrate device-level thermal management tailored for two vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBD structures that employed different edge termination techniques, such as field-plate and deep etch with sidewall field-plate, where the field-plate was formed with high-permittivity dielectric (BaTiO3). The localized thermal hot spots were detected at the Schottky contact edges near BaTiO3 dielectric based field-plate. However, a substantial reduction of the thermal hotspots was observed by forming the field-plate with BaTiO3 and thermally-conductive AlN insulator, where the AlN can effectively decrease Joule heating at interface and the high permittivity of BaTiO3 contributes to high field reduction. The deep etch and sidewall field-plate SBD structure further reduced accumulated heat and electric field near the critical anode edge by removing lateral depletion regions. We also analyzed thermal transport at dielectric/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 interfaces using Landauer approach that revealed significantly higher thermal boundary conductance (TBC) enabled by AlN compared to BaTiO3, attesting to the superior heat dissipation ability by BaTiO3/AlN field-plate than the BaTiO3-only configuration. Experimental investigation with vertical metal/AlN/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 diodes also extracted a high breakdown field (~11 MV/cm) of AlN, significantly exceeding the material breakdown field of \b{eta}-Ga2O3. This indicates that AlN can be an excellent choice for field-plate dielectric in vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs to provide both enhanced high field sustainability and improved heat dissipation in high-power applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal logic aims to create thermal counterparts to electronic circuits. In this work, we investigate experimentally the response of an analog memory device based on a thin film of an antiferromagnetic metal CuMnAs to bursts of heat pulses generated by the absorption of femtosecond laser pulses at room ambient temperature. When a threshold temperature in the heat-based short-term memory of the device is exceeded, the output of the in-memory logic operations is transferred within the same device to a long-term memory, where it can be retrieved at macroscopic times. The long-term memory is based on magnetoresistive switching from a reference low-resistive uniform magnetic state to high-resistive metastable nanofragmented magnetic states. The in-memory heat-based logic operations and the conversion of the outputs into the electrically-readable long-term magnetoresistive memory were performed at sub-nanosecond time scales, making them compatible with the GHz frequencies of standard electronics. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of rapidly resetting the long-term memory to the reference low-resistive state by heat pulses.</description>

      <title>Are diffusion models ready for materials discovery in unexplored chemical space?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While diffusion models are attracting increasing attention for the design of novel materials, their ability to generate low-energy structures in unexplored chemical spaces has not been systematically assessed. Here, we evaluate the performance of two diffusion models, MatterGen and DiffCSP, against three databases: a ternary oxide set (constructed by a genetic algorithm), a ternary nitride set (constructed by template informatics), and the GNoME database (constructed by a combination of both). We find that diffusion models generally perform stably in well-sampled chemical spaces (oxides and nitrides), but are less effective in uncommon ones (GNoME), which contains many compositions involving rare-earth elements and unconventional stoichiometry. Finally, we assess their size-extrapolation capability and observe a significant drop in performance when the number of atoms exceeds the trained range. This is attributed to the limitations imposed by periodic boundary conditions, which we refer to as the curse of periodicity. This study paves the way for future developments in materials design by highlighting both the strength and the limitations of diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Multiferroic-like Quasiparticles in Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiferroics are materials with coexisting electric and magnetic orders that are of central importance for fundamental research and technological applications. Unfortunately, intrinsic multiferroics that operate at room temperature remain rare due to an apparent incompatibility between magnetism and ferroelectricity. Here we predict that a pure ferroelectric support multiferroic-like quasiparticles, termed ``multiferrons", that simultaneously carry \emph{static} magnetic and electric dipoles. The electric dipole moment emerges from the parity-odd anharmonicity of the ferroelectric dynamics, while the magnetic moment has both paramagnetic and diamagnetic origins generated by circularly polarized transverse fluctuations of the ferroelectric polarization. In contrast to the established ``dynamical multiferroicity" of circularly polarized phonons, which involve only \emph{oscillating} electric dipoles, multiferrons cause, apart from Zeeman and Einstein-de Haas effects, a linear dc Stark response, giant electric-field-tunable second-harmonic generation in the THz-frequency regime, and a finite magnetoelectric cross coupling. Multiferrons open a new route toward nonlinear THz optical applications and offer multiferroic functionalities with simple ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Scale-bridging dislocation plasticity in MgO at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dislocations in ceramics have recently gained renewed research interest, in contrast to the traditional belief that ceramics are inherently brittle. Understanding dislocation mechanics in representative oxides is beneficial for effective dislocation engineering. Here, we use MgO single crystals with mechanically seeded dislocation densities from about 10 to the power of 12 to about 10 to the power of 15 per square meter to investigate the mechanical behavior such as yield and fracture. Micro-pillar compression tests reveal a dislocation density dependent yield strength, mediated by the varying dominating dislocation mechanisms from nucleation to multiplication/motion. In situ TEM compression measurements highlight the dislocation-seeded samples can achieve a much-improved compressive plastic strain beyond about 70%, with a high yield strength of about 2.35 GPa (diameter of about 400 nm), indicating size effect. Complementary bulk compression tests, along with digital image correlation (DIC), demonstrate a consistent dislocation-mediated deformation and a notable size effect, with bulk samples exhibiting much reduced yield strength (about 120 MPa) compared to the nano-/micro-pillars. Using three-dimensional Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (3D-DDD) simulation, we further qualitatively analyze the collective dislocation activities (slip events) and work hardening during compression. This study provides new insights into dislocation-mediated plasticity in MgO, across different length scales, by systematically tuning dislocation density.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field-Controlled THz Modulation in Uniaxial Anisotropic Spin-Valves Emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uniaxial spintronic heterostructures constitute compact THz emitters under femtosecond excitation, with emission amplitude and polarization governed by the applied magnetic field. We demonstrate here efficient magnetically tunable THz amplitude control in ultrathin, exchange-biased Co/Pt/Co/IrMn spin valve heterostructures. Terahertz spintronic magnetometry resolves reversible switching between parallel and antiparallel magnetization states and correlates the high- and low-emission regimes with constructive and destructive interference of charge transients generated by the inverse spin Hall effect in the Pt spacer. A residual low-emission signal is traced to spin-to-charge conversion in IrMn. Phase inversion under front- versus back-side excitation confirms the ISHE origin, while a macrospin Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert model reproduces the field dependence and separates layer-specific contributions. Together, these results define a wafer-compatible spin valve device architecture that enables efficient, low-field THz amplitude control.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast magnetic moment transfer and bandgap renormalization in monolayer FeCl$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The microscopic origin of laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization remains an open question, to which the non-thermal electronic distribution plays a vital role at the initial stage. Herein, we investigate the connection between the non-thermal electronic distribution and the ultrafast spin dynamics as well as the electronic structure evolution in ferromagnetic FeCl$_2$ monolayer using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) with self-consistent Hubbard $U$ correction. Our simulations reveal that femtosecond laser pulses induce ultrafast magnetic moment transfer from Fe to Cl atoms. More importantly, through a comprehensive analysis of orbital-resolved electronic structure, we elucidate the microscopic origin of this transfer, attributing it to specific intra-atomic and inter-atomic charge transfer pathways driven by non-thermal excitations. The extent of demagnetization of Fe atoms exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the laser photon energy, reaching a maximum at the resonant excitation. In addition, the dynamical evolution of the band structure was studied based on the eigenstates of the instantaneous Hamiltonian. Under resonant excitation, the bandgap reduction reaches up to $41\%$ within tens of fs. These findings provide fundamental insights into ultrafast spin control and suggest a strategy to optically engineer the magnetism in two-dimensional magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Flat Chern bands and correlated states in spiral magnet ReAg$_2$Cl$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict the van der Waals monolayer ReAg$_2$Cl$_6$ hosts isolated flat Chern bands at the Fermi level in its $120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic ground state. Their flatness and nontrivial topology arise from the cooperative effect of coplanar spin order and strong spin-orbit coupling within Re $5d$ orbitals-a mechanism distinct from moir\'e systems. The spiral spin texture naturally enlarges the unit cell, reducing carrier densities while preserving sizable interaction scales. Many-body calculations show that fractional fillings can support fractional Chern insulator and charge-density wave states. Remarkably, the mechanism is generic to a broad family of Re-based compounds, with both spin configuration and flat band topology tunable by electrical manipulation. Our findings establish Re-based coplanar antiferromagnets as a robust, tunable, and experimentally accessible platform for flat Chern bands and correlated topological phases potentially at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present PyAtoms, an interactive open-source software that rapidly simulates atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and other scanning probe microscopy (SPM) images of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, moir\'{e} systems, and superlattices. Rooted in a Fourier-space description of ideal atomic lattice images, PyAtoms is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) with robust capabilities for tuning lattice parameters (lattice constants, strain, number of layers, twist angles) and STM imaging parameters (pixels, scan size, scan angle) and provides time estimates for spectroscopic measurements. These capabilities allow users to efficiently plan time-consuming STM experiments. We provide an overview of PyAtoms' current features, describe its underlying mathematical principles, and then demonstrate simulations of several 2D materials including graphene with variable sublattice asymmetry, twisted tri-layer graphene moir\'{e} systems, and several charge- and bond-density wave systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a long-standing apparent conflict between the existence of diamagnetism and causality as expressed through the Kramers-Kronig relations. In essence, using causality arguments, along with a small number of seemingly well-justified assumptions, one can show that diamagnetism is impossible. However, experiments show diamagnetic responses from magnetic media. We present a resolution to this issue, which also explains the absence of observed dia-electric responses in media. In the process, we expose some of the short-comings in earlier analyses that have kept the paradox alive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms involved in the thermomigration of interstitial hydrogen in metals. Using irreversible thermodynamics, we develop a comprehensive mechanistic model to capture the controlling effects. Crucially, through validation against published experimental data, our results demonstrate that an electron-wind effect plays a significant role, particularly for materials in which the thermomigration direction matches the heat flux. These findings provide new insights into the factors that affect the localisation of solutes in metals. Moreover, our results indicate that atomistic models may be inadequate for detailed thermomigration studies due to the omission of electronic effects.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Electron Transfer in the Adiabatic Limit of the Marcus-Inverted Region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, isoenergetic electron transfer is strictly forbidden in the absence of nuclear tunneling. This "forbidden" behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region.</description>
