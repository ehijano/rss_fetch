      <title>Murnaghan-Type Representations for the Positive Elliptic Hall Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new family of graded representations $\widetilde{W}_{\lambda}$ for the positive elliptic Hall algebra $\mathcal{E}^{+}$ indexed by Young diagrams $\lambda$ which generalize the standard $\mathcal{E}^{+}$ action on symmetric functions. These representations have homogeneous bases of eigenvectors for the action of the Macdonald element $P_{0,1} \in \mathcal{E}^{+}$ with distinct $\mathbb{Q}(q,t)$-rational spectrum generalizing the symmetric Macdonald functions. The analysis of the structure of these representations exhibits interesting combinatorics arising from the stable limits of periodic standard Young tableaux. We find an explicit combinatorial rule for the action of the multiplication operators $e_r[X]^{\bullet}$ generalizing the Pieri rule for symmetric Macdonald functions. We will also naturally obtain a family of interesting $(q,t)$ product-series identities which come from keeping track of certain combinatorial statistics associated to periodic standard Young tableaux.</description>

      <title>Courcelle's Theorem: A Self-Contained Proof and a Path-Width Variant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Courcelle's Theorem is an important result in graph theory, proving the existence of linear-time algorithms for many decision problems on graphs whose tree-width is bounded by a constant. The purpose of this text is twofold: to provide an explanation and step-by-step proof of Courcelle's Theorem as applied to graphs of tree-width bounded by a constant, and to show explicitly (on the example of path-width) how to apply the same principles to other graph classes. We present these topics in a way that does not assume any particular knowledge on the part of the reader except a basic understanding of mathematics and possibly the fundamentals of graph theory. Our hope is to make the topic accessible to a broader mathematical audience, to which end we have included extensive explanations and pretty pictures.</description>

      <title>Rigidity matroids and linear algebraic matroids with applications to matrix completion and tensor codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a connection between problems studied in rigidity theory and matroids arising from linear algebraic constructions like tensor products and symmetric products. A special case of this correspondence identifies the problem of giving a description of the correctable erasure patterns in a maximally recoverable tensor code with the problem of describing bipartite rigid graphs or low-rank completable matrix patterns. Additionally, we relate dependencies among symmetric products of generic vectors to graph rigidity and symmetric matrix completion. With an eye toward applications to computer science, we study the dependency of these matroids on the characteristic by giving new combinatorial descriptions in several cases, including the first description of the correctable patterns in an (m, n, a=2, b=2) maximally recoverable tensor code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H_n^{(3)}$ be a 3-uniform linear hypergraph, i.e. any two edges have at most one vertex common. A special hypergraph, {\em wicket}, is formed by three rows and two columns of a $3 \times 3$ point matrix. In this note, we give a new lower bound on the Tur\'an number of wickets using estimates on cap sets.</description>

      <title>NP-completeness of Tiling Finite Simply Connected Regions with a Fixed Set of Wang Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational complexity of tiling finite simply connected regions with a fixed set of tiles is studied in this paper. We show that the problem of tiling simply connected regions with a fixed set of $23$ Wang tiles is NP-complete. As a consequence, the problem of tiling simply connected regions with a fixed set of $111$ rectangles is NP-complete. Our results improve that of Igor Pak and Jed Yang by using fewer numbers of tiles. Notably in the case of Wang tiles, the number has decreased by more than one third from $35$ to $23$.</description>

      <title>Perfect state transfer of Grover walks on unitary Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unitary Cayley graph has vertex set $\Zl_n =\{0,1, \hdots ,n-1\}$, where two vertices $u$ and $v$ are adjacent if $\text{gcd}(u - v, n) = 1$. We focus on the periodicity and perfect state transfer of Grover walk on the unitary Cayley graphs. We completely characterize which unitary Cayley graphs are periodic. From our results, we find infinitely many new periodic graphs. We prove that periodicity is a necessary condition for perfect state transfer on an integral vertex-transitive graph, and we provide a simple criterion to characterize perfect state transfer on circulant graphs in terms of its adjacency spectrum. Using these, we prove only three graphs in a class of unitary Cayley graphs exhibit perfect state transfer. Also, we provide a spectral characterization of the periodicity of Grover walk on any integral regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Almost Symmetric Schur Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a generalization $s_{(\mu|\lambda)}$ of the Schur functions called the almost symmetric Schur functions. These functions simultaneously generalize the finite variable key polynomials and the infinite variable Schur functions. They form a homogeneous basis for the space of almost symmetric functions and are defined using a family of recurrences involving the isobaric divided difference operators and limits of Weyl symmetrization operators. The $s_{(\mu|\lambda)}$ are the $q=t=0$ specialization of the stable limit non-symmetric Macdonald functions $\widetilde{E}_{(\mu|\lambda)}$ defined by the author in previous work. We find a combinatorial formula for these functions simultaneously generalizing well known formulas for the Schur functions and the key polynomials. Further, we prove positivity results for the coefficients of the almost symmetric Schur functions expanded into the monomial basis and into the monomial-Schur basis of the space of almost symmetric functions. The latter positivity result follows after realizing the almost symmetric Schur functions $s_{(\mu|\lambda)}$ as limits of characters of representations of parabolic subgroups in type $GL.$</description>

      <title>Oriented Ramsey numbers of graded digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any graded digraph $D$ on $n$ vertices with maximum degree $\Delta$ has an oriented Ramsey number of at most $C^\Delta n$ for some absolute constant $C &gt; 1$, improving upon a recent result of Fox, He, and Wigderson. In particular, this implies that oriented grids in any fixed dimension have linear oriented Ramsey numbers, and gives a polynomial bound on the oriented Ramsey number of the hypercube.
  We also show that this result is essentially best possible, in that there exist graded digraphs on $n$ vertices with maximum degree $\Delta$ such that their oriented Ramsey number is at least $c^\Delta n$ for some absolute constant $c &gt; 1$.</description>

Abstract: Extending Sparks's theorem, we determine the cardinality of the lattice of $(C_1,C_2)$-clonoids of Boolean functions in the cases where the target clone $C_2$ is the clone of projections. Moreover, we explicitly describe the $(C_1,C_2)$-clonoids of Boolean functions in the cases where the source clone $C_1$ is one of the four clones of monotone functions or contains the discriminator function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the $e$-positivity of all cycle-chord graphs by using the composition method that is developed by Zhou and the author very recently. Our technique is not only applicable to all cycle-chords, but also much simpler than the $(e)$-positivity method that is used for handling cycle-chords with girth at most $4$.</description>

      <title>Burning Hamming graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hamming graph $H(n,q)$ is defined on the vertex set $[q]^n$ and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they differ in precisely one coordinate. Alon \cite{Alon} proved that the burning number of $H(n,2)$ is $\lceil\frac n2\rceil+1$. In this note we show that the burning number of $H(n,q)$ is $(1-\frac 1q)n+O(\sqrt{n\log n})$ for fixed $q\geq 2$ and $n\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Spectral decomposition of hypergraph automorphism compatible matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the relationship between hypergraph automorphisms and the spectral properties of matrices associated with hypergraphs. For an automorphism $f$, an \( f \)-compatible matrices capture aspects of the symmetry, represented by \( f \), within the hypergraph. First, we explore rotation, a specific kind of automorphism and find that the spectrum of any matrix compatible with a rotation can be decomposed into the spectra of smaller matrices associated with that rotation. We show that the spectrum of any \(f\)-compatible matrix can be decomposed into the spectra of smaller matrices associated with the component rotations comprising \( f \). Further, we study a hypergraph symmetry termed unit-automorphism, which induces bijections on the hyperedges, though not necessarily on the vertex set. We show that unit automorphisms also lead to the spectral decomposition of compatible matrices.</description>

      <title>A geometric characterization of known maximum scattered linear sets of $\mathrm{PG}(1,q^n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $\mathbb{F}_q$- linear set $L=L_U$ of $\Lambda=\mathrm{PG}(V, \mathbb{F}_{q^n}) \cong \mathrm{PG}(r-1,q^n)$ is a set of points defined by non-zero vectors of an $\mathbb{F}_q$-subspace $U$ of $V$. The integer $\dim_{\mathbb{F}_q} U$ is called the rank of $L$. In [G. Lunardon, O. Polverino: Translation ovoids of orthogonal polar spaces. Forum Math. 16 (2004)], it was proven that any $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear set $L$ of $\Lambda$ of rank $u$ such that $\langle L \rangle=\Lambda$ is either a canonical subgeometry of $\Lambda$ or there are a $(u-r-1)$-dimensional subspace $\Gamma$ of $\mathrm{PG}(u-1,q^n) \supset \Lambda$ disjoint from $\Lambda$ and a canonical subgeometry $\Sigma \cong \mathrm{PG}(u-1,q)$ disjoint from $\Gamma$ such that $L$ is the projection of $\Sigma$ from $\Gamma$ onto $\Lambda$. The subspace $\Gamma$ is called the vertex of the projection. In this article, we will show a method to reconstruct the vertex $\Gamma$ for a peculiar class of linear sets of rank $u = n(r - 1)$ in $\mathrm{PG}(r - 1, q^n)$ called evasive linear sets. Also, we will use this result to characterize some families of linear sets of the projective line $\mathrm{PG}(1,q^n)$ introduced from 2018 onward, by means of certain properties of their projection vertices, as done in [B. Csajb\'{o}k, C. Zanella: On scattered linear sets of pseudoregulus type in $\mathrm{PG}(1, q^t)$, Finite Fields Appl. 41 (2016)] and in [C. Zanella, F. Zullo: Vertex properties of maximum scattered linear sets of $\mathrm{PG}(1, q^n)$. Discrete Math. 343(5) (2020)].</description>

      <title>Exploring the Influence of Graph Operations on Zero Forcing Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero forcing in graphs is a coloring process where a colored vertex can force its unique uncolored neighbor to be colored. A zero forcing set is a set of initially colored vertices capable of eventually coloring all vertices of the graph. In this paper, we focus on the numbers $z(G; i)$, which is the number of zero forcing sets of size $i$ of the graph $G$. These numbers were initially studied by Boyer et al. where they conjectured that for any graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, $z(G; i) \leq z(P_n; i)$ for all $i \geq 1$ where $P_n$ is the path graph on $n$ vertices. The main aim of this paper is to show that several classes of graphs, including outerplanar graphs and threshold graphs, satisfy this conjecture. We do this by studying various graph operations and examining how they affect the number of zero forcing sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of P-polynomial coherent configurations and show that they can have at most two fibres. We then introduce a class of two-fibre coherent configurations which have two distinguished bases for the coherent algebra, similar to the Bose-Mesner algebra of an association scheme. Examples of these bipartite coherent configurations include the P-polynomial class of distance-biregular graphs, as well as quasi-symmetric designs and strongly regular designs.</description>

      <title>Cornering Robots to Synchronize a DFA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the existence of short synchronizing words in deterministic finite automata (DFAs). In particular, we define a general strategy, which we call the \emph{cornering strategy}, for generating short synchronizing words in well-structured DFAs. We show that a DFA is synchronizable if and only if this strategy can be applied.
  Using the cornering strategy, we prove that all DFAs consisting of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with bidirectional connected edge sets in which each edge $(\mb x, \mb y)$ is labeled $\mb y - \mb x$ are synchronizable. We also give sufficient conditions for such DFAs to have synchronizing words of length at most $(n-1)^2$ and thereby satisfy \v{C}ern\'y's conjecture. Using similar ideas, we generalise a result of Ananichev and Volkov \cite{ananichev2004synchronizing} from monotonic automata to a wider class of DFAs admitting well-behaved partial orders. Finally, we consider how the cornering strategy can be applied to the problem of simultaneously synchronizing a DFA $G$ to an initial state $u$ and a DFA $H$ to an initial state $v$. We do not assume that DFAs $G$ and $H$ or states $u$ and $v$ are related beyond sharing the same edge labels.</description>

      <title>Measurable Brooks's Theorem for Directed Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a descriptive version of Brooks's theorem for directed graphs. In particular, we show that, if $D$ is a Borel directed graph on a standard Borel space $X$ such that the maximum degree of each vertex is at most $d \geq 3$, then unless $D$ contains the complete symmetric directed graph on $d + 1$ vertices, $D$ admits a $\mu$-measurable $d$-dicoloring with respect to any Borel probability measure $\mu$ on $X$, and $D$ admits a $\tau$-Baire-measurable $d$-dicoloring with respect to any Polish topology $\tau$ compatible with the Borel structure on $X$. We also prove a definable version of Gallai's theorem on list dicolorings for directed graphs by showing that any Borel directed graph of bounded degree whose connected components are not Gallai trees is Borel degree-list-dicolorable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the dual $F$-signatures of certain toric rings by using combinatorial techniques. Specifically, we calculate the dual $F$-signatures of Veronese subrings of polynomial rings. Moreover, we give an upper bound for the dual $F$-signatures of Segre products of polynomial rings and show that this upper bound is attained in some cases.</description>

      <title>Fringe trees of Patricia tries and compressed binary search trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of fringe trees in Patricia tries and compressed binary search trees; both cases are random binary trees that have been compressed by deleting vertices of outdegree 1 so that they are random full binary trees. The main results are central limit theorems for the number of fringe trees of a given type, which imply quenched and annealed limit results for the fringe tree distribution; for Patricia tries, this is complicated by periodic oscillations in the usual manner. We also consider extended fringe trees. The results are derived from earlier results for uncompressed tries and binary search trees. In the case of compressed binary search trees, it seems difficult to give a closed formula for the asymptotic fringe tree distribution, but we provide a recursion and give examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix $h\geq 2$, and let $b_1$ , $\ldots$, $b_h$ be not necessarily distinct positive integers with $\gcd = 1$. For any subset $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$, write $r_{A}(n)$ ($n\geq 0$) for the number of solutions $(k_1,\ldots,k_h)\in A^h$ to \[ b_1 k_1 + \cdots + b_h k_h = n. \] For which functions $F$ with $F(n) \leq r_{\mathbb{N}}(n)$ can we find $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that $r_{A}(n)\sim F(n)$? We show that if $F$ is regularly varying, then there exists such an $A$ provided $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} F(n)/\log n = \infty$. If one only requires $r_{A}(n) \asymp F(n)$, we show there exists such an $A$ for every increasing $F$ satisfying $F(2x) \ll F(x)$ and $\liminf\limits_{n\to\infty} F(n)/\log n &gt; 0$.
  Lastly, we give a probabilistic heuristic for the following statement: if $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is such that $\limsup\limits_{n\to\infty} r_{A}(n)/\log n &lt; 1$, then $r_{A}(n) = 0$ for infinitely many $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.04525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rank-$r$ integer matrix $A$ is $\Delta$-modular if the determinant of each $r \times r$ submatrix has absolute value at most $\Delta$. The class of $1$-modular, or unimodular, matrices is of fundamental significance in both integer programming theory and matroid theory. A 1957 result of Heller shows that the maximum number of nonzero, pairwise non-parallel rows of a rank-$r$ unimodular matrix is ${r + 1 \choose 2}$. We prove that, for each sufficiently large integer $r$, the maximum number of nonzero, pairwise non-parallel rows of a rank-$r$ $2$-modular matrix is ${r + 2 \choose 2} - 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1995, Koml\'os, S\'ark\"ozy and Szemer\'edi showed that every large $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $(1/2 + \gamma)n$ contains all spanning trees of bounded degree. We consider a generalization of this result to loose spanning hypertrees in 3-graphs, that is, linear hypergraphs obtained by successively appending edges sharing a single vertex with a previous edge. We show that for all $\gamma$ and $\Delta$, and $n$ large, every $n$-vertex 3-uniform hypergraph of minimum vertex degree $(5/9 + \gamma)\binom{n}{2}$ contains every loose spanning tree $T$ with maximum vertex degree $\Delta$. This bound is asymptotically tight, since some loose trees contain perfect matchings.</description>

      <title>A survey of congruences and quotients of partially ordered sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quotient of a poset $P$ is a partial order obtained on the equivalence classes of an equivalence relation $\theta$ on $P$; $\theta$ is then called a congruence if it satisfies certain conditions, which vary according to different theories. The literature on congruences and quotients of partially ordered sets contains a large and profilerating array of approaches, but little in the way of systematic exposition and examination of the subject. We seek to rectify this by surveying the different theories in the literature and providing philosophical discussion on requirements for notions of congruences of posets. We advocate a pluralist approach which recognises that different types of congruence arise naturally in different mathematical situations. There are some notions of congruence which are very general, whilst others capture specific structure which often appears in examples. Indeed, we finish by giving several examples where quotients of posets appear naturally in mathematics.</description>

Abstract: Extending a result of Christiansen, we prove that every mutli-graph $G=(V,E)$ admits a proper edge colouring $\phi:E\to \{1,2,\dots\}$ which is local, that is, $\phi(e)\le \max\{d(x)+\pi(x),d(y)+\pi(y)\}$ for every edge $e$ with end-points $x,y\in V$, where $d(z)$ (resp.\ $\pi(z)$) denotes the degree of a vertex $z$ (resp.\ the maximum edge multiplicity at $z$). This is derived from a local version of the Fan Equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining a variant of the Farkas lemma with the Flow Decomposition Theorem we show that the regions of any deformation of a graphical arrangement may be bijectively labeled with a set of weighted digraphs containing directed cycles of negative weight only. Bounded regions correspond to strongly connected digraphs. The study of the resulting labelings allows us to add the omitted details in Stanley's proof on the injectivity of the Stanley-Pak labeling of the regions of the extended Shi arrangement and to introduce a new labeling of the regions in the $a$-Catalan arrangement. We also point out that Athanasiadis-Linusson labelings may be used to directly count regions in a class of arrangements properly containing the extended Shi arrangement and the Fuss-Catalan arrangement.</description>

      <title>Topological remarks on end and edge-end spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of ends in an infinite graph $G$ might be modified if we consider them as equivalence classes of infinitely edge-connected rays, rather than equivalence classes of infinitely (vertex-)connected ones. This alternative definition yields to the edge-end space $\Omega_E(G)$ of $G$, in which we can endow a natural (edge-)end topology. For every graph $G$, this paper proves that $\Omega_E(G)$ is homeomorphic to $\Omega(H)$ for some possibly another graph $H$, where $\Omega(H)$ denotes its usual end space. However, we also show that the converse statement does not hold: there is a graph $H$ such that $\Omega(H)$ is not homeomorphic to $\Omega_E(G)$ for any other graph $G$. In other words, as a main result, we conclude that the class of topological spaces $\Omega_E = \{\Omega_E(G) : G \text{ graph}\}$ is strictly contained in $\Omega = \{\Omega(H) : H \text{ graph}\}$.</description>

      <title>Endhered patterns in matchings and RNA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An endhered (end-adhered) pattern is a subset of arcs in matchings, such that the corresponding starting points are consecutive and the same holds for the ending points. Such patterns are in one-to-one correspondence with the permutations. We focus on the occurrence frequency of such patterns in matchings and real-world RNA structures with pseudoknots. We present combinatorial results related to the distribution and asymptotic behavior of the pattern 21, which corresponds to two consecutive stacked bonds frequently encountered in RNA, and the pattern 12, representing the archetypal minimal pseudoknot. We show that in matchings these two patterns are equidistributed, which is quite different from what we can find in real-world RNAs. We also examine the distribution of endhered patterns of size 3, showing how the patterns change under the transformation called endhered twist. Finally, we compute the distributions of endhered patterns of size 2 and 3 in real-world secondary RNA structures with pseudoknots and discuss possible outcomes of our study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.14740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between knot theory and cluster algebras via representation theory. To every knot diagram (or link diagram), we associate a cluster algebra by constructing a quiver with potential. The rank of the cluster algebra is $2n$, where $n$ is the number of crossing points in the knot diagram. We then construct $2n$ indecomposable modules $T(i)$ over the Jacobian algebra of the quiver with potential. For each $T(i)$, we show that the submodule lattice is isomorphic to the corresponding lattice of Kauffman states. We then give a realization of the Alexander polynomial of the knot as a specialization of the $F$-polynomial of $T(i)$, for every $i$. Furthermore, we conjecture that the collection of the $T(i)$ forms a cluster in the cluster algebra whose quiver is isomorphic to the opposite of the initial quiver, and that the resulting cluster automorphism is of order two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the notion of $d$-embedding $\Gamma$ of a (canonical) subgeometry $\Sigma$ and of exterior set with respect to the $h$-secant variety $\Omega_{h}(\mathcal{A})$ of a subset $\mathcal{A}$, $ 0 \leq h \leq n-1$, in the finite projective space $\mathrm{PG}(n-1,q^n)$, $n \geq 3$, in this article we construct a class of non-linear $(n,n,q;d)$-MRD codes for any $ 2 \leq d \leq n-1$. A code $\mathcal{C}_{\sigma,T}$ of this class, where $1\in T \subset \mathbb{F}_q^*$ and $\sigma$ is a generator of $\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb{F}_{q^n}|\mathbb{F}_q)$, arises from a cone of $\mathrm{PG}(n-1,q^n)$ with vertex an $(n-d-2)$-dimensional subspace over a maximum exterior set $\mathcal{E}$ with respect to $\Omega_{d-2}(\Gamma)$. We prove that the codes introduced in [Cossidente, A., Marino, G., Pavese, F.: Non-linear maximum rank distance codes. Des. Codes Cryptogr. 79, 597--609 (2016); Durante, N., Siciliano, A.: Non-linear maximum rank distance codes in the cyclic model for the field reduction of finite geometries. Electron. J. Comb.

Codes Cryptogr. 86, 1175--1184 (2018)] are appropriate punctured ones of $\mathcal{C}_{\sigma,T}$ and solve completely the inequivalence issue for this class showing that $\mathcal{C}_{\sigma,T}$ is neither equivalent nor adjointly equivalent to the non-linear MRD code $\mathcal{C}_{n,k,\sigma,I}$, $I \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q$, obtained in [Otal, K., \"Ozbudak, F.: Some new non-additive maximum rank distance codes.

      <description>arXiv:2402.07779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2022, using methods from ergodic theory, Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson resolved a longstanding conjecture of Erd\H{o}s about sumsets in large subsets of the natural numbers. In this paper, we extend this result to several important classes of amenable groups, including all finitely generated virtually nilpotent groups, and all abelian groups $(G,+)$ with the property that the subgroup $2G := \{g+g : g\in G\}$ has finite index. We prove that in any group $G$ from the above classes, any $A\subset G$ with positive upper Banach density contains a shifted product set of the form $\{tb_ib_j\colon i&lt;j\}$, for some infinite sequence $(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ and some $t\in G$. In fact, we show this result for all amenable groups that posses a property which we call square absolute continuity. Our results provide answers to several questions and conjectures posed in a recent survey of Kra, Moreira, Richter and Robertson.</description>

Abstract: Spiro, Surya and Zeng (Electron. J. Combin. 2023; arXiv:2207.11272) recently studied a semi-restricted variant of the well-known game Rock, Paper, Scissors; in this variant the game is played for $3n$ rounds, but one of the two players is restricted and has to use each of the three moves exactly $n$ times. They find the optimal strategy, and they show that it results in an expected score for the unrestricted player $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$; they conjecture, based on numerical evidence, that the expectation is $\approx 1.46\sqrt{n}$.
  We analyse the result of the strategy further and show that the average is $\sim c \sqrt{n}$ with $c=3\sqrt{3}/2\sqrt{\pi}=1.466$, verifying the conjecture. We also find the asymptotic distribution of the score, and compute its variance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the maximal shifts in the minimal free resolution of the quotients of a polynomial ring by a monomial ideal are subadditive as a function of the homological degree. This answers a question that has received some attention in recent years. To do so, we define and study a new model for the homology of posets, given by the so called synor complex. We also introduce an Eilenberg-Zilber type shuffle product on the simplicial chain complex of lattices.
  Combining these concepts we prove that the existence of a non-zero homology class for a lattice forces certain non-zero homology classes in lower intervals. This result then translates into properties of the minimal free resolution. In particular, it implies a generalization of the original question.</description>
