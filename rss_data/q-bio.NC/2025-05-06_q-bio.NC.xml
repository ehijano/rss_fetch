      <title>Burstiness and interpersonal foraging between human infants and caregivers in the vocal domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vocal responses from caregivers are believed to promote more frequent and more advanced infant vocalizations. However, studies that examine this relationship typically do not account for the fact that infant and adult vocalizations are distributed in hierarchical clusters over the course of the day. These bursts and lulls create a challenge for accurately detecting the effects of adult input at immediate turn-by-turn timescales within real-world behavior, as adult responses tend to happen during already occurring bursts of infant vocalizations. Analyzing daylong audio recordings of real-world vocal communication between human infants (ages 3, 6, 9, and 18 months) and their adult caregivers, we first show that both infant and caregiver vocalization events are clustered in time, as evidenced by positive correlations between successive inter-event intervals (IEIs). We propose an approach informed by flight time analyses in foraging studies to assess whether the timing of a vocal agent's next vocalization is modified by inputs from another vocal agent, controlling for the first agent's previous IEI. For both infants and adults, receiving a social response predicts that the individual will vocalize again sooner than they would have in the absence of a response. Overall, our results are consistent with a view of infant-caregiver vocal interactions as an 'interpersonal foraging' process with inherent multi-scale dynamics wherein social responses are among the resources the individuals are foraging for. The analytic approaches introduced here have broad utility to study communication in other modalities, contexts, and species.</description>

      <title>Bell's Inequalities and Entanglement in Corpora of Italian Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the results of three information retrieval tests on conceptual combinations that we have recently performed using corpora of Italian language. The tests have the form of a 'Bell-type test' and were aimed at identifying 'quantum entanglement' in the combination, or composition, of two concepts. In the first two tests, we studied the Italian translation of the combination 'The Animal Acts', while in the third test, we studied the Italian translation of the combination 'The Animal eats the Food'. We found a significant violation of Bell's inequalities in all tests. Empirical patterns confirm the results obtained with corpora of English language, which indicates the existence of deep structures in concept formation that are language-independent. The systematic violation of Bell's inequalities suggests the presence of entanglement and, indeed, we elaborate here a 'quantum model in Hilbert space' for the collected data. This investigation supports our theoretical hypothesis about entanglement as a phenomenon of 'contextual updating', independently of the nature, micro-physical or conceptual linguistic, of the entities involved. Finally, these findings allow us to further clarify the mutual relationships between entanglement, Cirel'son's bound, and no-signaling in Bell-type situations.</description>

      <title>Cognition without neurons: modelling anticipation in a basal reservoir computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do non-neural organisms, such as the slime mould \textit{Physarum polycephalum}, anticipate periodic events in their environment? We present a minimal, biologically inspired reservoir model that demonstrates simple temporal anticipation without neurons, spikes, or trained readouts. The model consists of a spatially embedded hexagonal network in which nodes regulate their energy through local, allostatic adaptation. Input perturbations shape energy dynamics over time, allowing the system to internalize temporal regularities into its structure. After being exposed to a periodic input signal, the model spontaneously re-enacts those dynamics even in the absence of further input -- a form of unsupervised temporal pattern completion. This behaviour emerges from internal homeodynamic regulation, without supervised learning or symbolic processing. Our results show that simple homeodynamic regulation can support unsupervised prediction, suggesting a pathway to memory and anticipation in basal organisms.</description>

      <title>Heterosynaptic Circuits Are Universal Gradient Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a design principle for the learning circuits of the biological brain. The principle states that almost any dendritic weights updated via heterosynaptic plasticity can implement a generalized and efficient class of gradient-based meta-learning. The theory suggests that a broad class of biologically plausible learning algorithms, together with the standard machine learning optimizers, can be grounded in heterosynaptic circuit motifs. This principle suggests that the phenomenology of (anti-) Hebbian (HBP) and heterosynaptic plasticity (HSP) may emerge from the same underlying dynamics, thus providing a unifying explanation. It also suggests an alternative perspective of neuroplasticity, where HSP is promoted to the primary learning and memory mechanism, and HBP is an emergent byproduct. We present simulations that show that (a) HSP can explain the metaplasticity of neurons, (b) HSP can explain the flexibility of the biology circuits, and (c) gradient learning can arise quickly from simple evolutionary dynamics that do not compute any explicit gradient. While our primary focus is on biology, the principle also implies a new approach to designing AI training algorithms and physically learnable AI hardware. Conceptually, our result demonstrates that contrary to the common belief, gradient computation may be extremely easy and common in nature.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive framework for statistical testing of brain dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive statistical framework for analysing brain dynamics and testing their associations with behavioural, physiological and other non-imaging variables. Based on a generalisation of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) - the Gaussian-Linear HMM - our open-source Python package supports multiple experimental paradigms, including task-based and resting-state studies, and addresses a wide range of questions in neuroscience and related scientific fields. Inference is carried out using permutation-based methods and structured Monte Carlo resampling, and the framework can easily handle confounding variables, multiple testing corrections, and hierarchical relationships within the data. The package includes tools for intuitive visualisation of statistical results, along with comprehensive documentation and step-by-step tutorials to make it accessible for users of varying expertise. Altogether, it provides a broadly applicable, end-to-end pipeline for analysis and statistical testing of functional neural data and its dynamics.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Powered Neural Interfaces for Smart Prosthetics and Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced neural interfaces are transforming applications ranging from neuroscience research to diagnostic tools (for mental state recognition, tremor and seizure detection) as well as prosthetic devices (for motor and communication recovery). By integrating complex functions into miniaturized neural devices, these systems unlock significant opportunities for personalized assistive technologies and adaptive therapeutic interventions. Leveraging high-density neural recordings, on-site signal processing, and machine learning (ML), these interfaces extract critical features, identify disease neuro-markers, and enable accurate, low-latency neural decoding. This integration facilitates real-time interpretation of neural signals, adaptive modulation of brain activity, and efficient control of assistive devices. Moreover, the synergy between neural interfaces and ML has paved the way for self-sufficient, ubiquitous platforms capable of operating in diverse environments with minimal hardware costs and external dependencies. In this work, we review recent advancements in AI-driven decoding algorithms and energy-efficient System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms for next-generation miniaturized neural devices. These innovations highlight the potential for developing intelligent neural interfaces, addressing critical challenges in scalability, reliability, interpretability, and user adaptability.</description>

      <title>Backpropagation through space, time, and the brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16933v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How physical networks of neurons, bound by spatio-temporal locality constraints, can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In machine learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time. However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.</description>

      <title>The Integrated Information Theory needs Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Integrated Information Theory (IIT) might be our current best bet at a scientific explanation of phenomenal consciousness. IIT focuses on the distinctively subjective and phenomenological aspects of conscious experience. Currently, it offers the fundaments of a formal account, but future developments shall explain the qualitative structures of every possible conscious experience. But this ambitious project is hindered by one fundamental limitation. IIT fails to acknowledge the crucial roles of attention in generating phenomenally conscious experience and shaping its contents. Here, we argue that IIT urgently needs an account of attention. Without this account, IIT cannot explain important informational differences between different kinds of experiences. Furthermore, though some IIT proponents celebratedly endorse a double dissociation between consciousness and attention, close analysis reveals that such as dissociation is in fact incompatible with IIT. Notably, the issues we raise for IIT will likely arise for many internalist theories of conscious contents in philosophy, especially theories with primitivist inclinations. Our arguments also extend to the recently popularized structuralist approaches. Overall, our discussion highlights how considerations about attention are indispensable for scientific as well as philosophical theorizing about conscious experience.</description>

      <title>YARE-GAN: Yet Another Resting State EEG-GAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we implement a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) to generate multi-channel resting-state EEG data and assess the quality of the synthesized signals through both visual and feature-based evaluations. Our results indicate that the model effectively captures the statistical and spectral characteristics of real EEG data, although challenges remain in replicating high-frequency oscillations in the frontal region. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Critic's learned representations can be reused for gender classification task, achieving an out-of-sample accuracy, significantly better than a shuffled-label baseline and a model trained directly on EEG data. These findings suggest that generative models can serve not only as EEG data generators but also as unsupervised feature extractors, reducing the need for manual feature engineering. This study highlights the potential of GAN-based unsupervised learning for EEG analysis, suggesting avenues for more data-efficient deep learning applications in neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Joint-Embedding Masked Autoencoder for Self-supervised Learning of Dynamic Functional Connectivity from the Human Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in learning dynamic functional connectivity for distinguishing phenotypes from human brain networks. However, obtaining extensive labeled clinical data for training is often resource-intensive, making practical application difficult. Leveraging unlabeled data thus becomes crucial for representation learning in a label-scarce setting. Although generative self-supervised learning techniques, especially masked autoencoders, have shown promising results in representation learning in various domains, their application to dynamic graphs for dynamic functional connectivity remains underexplored, facing challenges in capturing high-level semantic representations. Here, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Joint Embedding Masked Autoencoder (ST-JEMA), drawing inspiration from the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) in computer vision. ST-JEMA employs a JEPA-inspired strategy for reconstructing dynamic graphs, which enables the learning of higher-level semantic representations considering temporal perspectives, addressing the challenges in fMRI data representation learning. Utilizing the large-scale UK Biobank dataset for self-supervised learning, ST-JEMA shows exceptional representation learning performance on dynamic functional connectivity demonstrating superiority over previous methods in predicting phenotypes and psychiatric diagnoses across eight benchmark fMRI datasets even with limited samples and effectiveness of temporal reconstruction on missing data scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of our approach as a robust representation learning method for leveraging label-scarce fMRI data.</description>
