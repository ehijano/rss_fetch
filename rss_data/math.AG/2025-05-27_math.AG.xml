      <title>The projective analytic spectrum of the double of a module</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the projectivized analytic spectrum of the double of a module, establishing some general properties, and we apply these results to $\mbox{Projan}(\cR((JM(X))_D))$ over the origin in $C\times C$, where $C$ is an irreducible curve in a hypersurface $X$.</description>

      <title>On the boundedness of $k$-algebra homomorphisms between $k$-affinoid algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a complete non-archimedean non-trivial valued field. In this paper, we investigate whether every $k$-algebra homomorphism between $k$-affinoid algebras is automatically bounded. We show that this property holds if and only if either $|k^\times|^\mathbb{Q} = \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$ holds, or $k$ has positive characteristic and is $F$-finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new $L^2$-Hodge theoretic construction of a Frobenius manifold structure on the cohomology of a Calabi-Yau smooth projective hypersurface $V$, using Li-Wen's $L^2$-Hodge theory [9] of a Landau-Ginzburg model with compact critical locus $V$. We also give a precise comparison result between the current construction and Barannikov-Kontsevich's construction [2] of the Frobenius manifold structure on the cohomology of $V$.</description>

      <title>Tropical Geometry Based Edge Detection Using Min-Plus and Max-Plus Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a tropical geometry-based edge detection framework that reformulates convolution and gradient computations using min-plus and max-plus algebra. The tropical formulation emphasizes dominant intensity variations, contributing to sharper and more continuous edge representations. Three variants are explored: an adaptive threshold-based method, a multi-kernel min-plus method, and a max-plus method emphasizing structural continuity. The framework integrates multi-scale processing, Hessian filtering, and wavelet shrinkage to enhance edge transitions while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments on MATLAB built-in grayscale and color images suggest that tropical formulations integrated with classical operators, such as Canny and LoG, can improve boundary detection in low-contrast and textured regions. Quantitative evaluation using standard edge metrics indicates favorable edge clarity and structural coherence. These results highlight the potential of tropical algebra as a scalable and noise-aware formulation for edge detection in practical image analysis tasks.</description>

      <title>Numerical characterization of the hard Lefschetz classes of dimension two, II: supercritical collections of free divisor classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $(n-2)$ free divisor classes on a smooth projective variety of dimension $n$, the product of these free divisor classes induces a Lefschetz type operator acting on the N\'{e}ron-Severi space or the cohomology group of $(1,1)$ classes. We give a characterization of this kernel space, when the collection of these free divisor classes is supercritical. This resolves Shenfeld-van Handel's open problem in this setting. As consequences, we provide an algebro-geometric proof of the characterization of the extremals of the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality for a supercritical collection of rational convex polytopes; we also give a characterization of the extremals of the Khovanskii-Teissier inequality given by the intersection numbers of two arbitrary free divisor classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an irreducible smooth complex projective variety. Let $G$ be a linear algebraic group over $\mathbb{C}$. We define the notion of Lie algebroid valued connection on holomorphic principal $G$--bundles on $X$, and study their basic properties under extension and reduction of structure group. Finally we investigate criterions for existence of a Lie algebroid connection on principal $G$--bundles over smooth complex projective curves.</description>

      <title>Four paths from birational geometry to the elliptic genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article presents four reasons why the elliptic genus is the most general characteristic class that admits a generalization to singular spaces. We prove that the elliptic characteristic class (with an additional factor) is essentially the only characteristic class invariant under certain modifications, such as the Atiyah flop, Grassmannian flops, and modifications of Bott-Samelson resolutions.This result confirms and extends Totaro's result concerning the cobordism ring modulo classical flops. However, our approach is based on local calculus in equivariant cohomology.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Zhou valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize Zhou valuations, originally defined on complex domains, to the framework of general schemes. We demonstrate that an algebraic version of the Jonsson--Musta\c{t}\u{a} conjecture is equivalent to the statement that every Zhou valuation is quasi-monomial. By introducing a mixed version of jumping numbers and Tian functions associated with valuations, we obtain characterizations of a valuation being a Zhou valuation or computing some jumping number using the Tian functions. Furthermore, we establish the correspondence between Zhou valuations in algebraic settings and their counterparts in analytic settings.</description>

      <title>Explicit classes in Habiro cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a cycle description of the Habiro cohomology of a smooth variety $X$
  over the spectrum $B$ of an \'etale $Z[\lambda]$-algebra and construct explicit
  nontrivial cycles using either the Picard-Fuchs equation on $X/B$
  of a hypergeometric motive, or a push-forward of elements
  of the Habiro ring of $X/B$. In particular, we give explicit classes for
  1-parameter Calabi--Yau families.
  The $q$-hypergeometric origin of our cycles imply
  that they generate $q$-holonomic modules that define $q$-deformations of the
  classical Picard-Fuchs equation. We illustrate our theorems with three examples:
  the Legendre family of elliptic
  curves, the $A$-polynomial curve of the figure eight knot, and
  for the quintic three-fold, whose $q$-Picard Fuchs equation appeared in
  its genus $0$-quantum $K$-theory. Our methods give a unified treatment of
  quantum $K$-theory and complex Chern-Simons theory around higher dimensional
  critical loci.</description>

      <title>Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory via K3 surfaces and stability conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach to the Brill-Noether theory of curves endowed with a degree k cover of the projective line via Bridgeland stability conditions on elliptic K3 surfaces. We first develop the Brill-Noether theory on elliptic K3 surfaces via the notion of Bridgeland stability type for objects in their derived category. As a main application, we show that curves on elliptic K3 surfaces serve as the first known examples of smooth k-gonal curves which are general from the viewpoint of Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory. In particular, we provide new proofs of the main non-existence and existence results in Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory. Finally, using degree-k Halphen surfaces, we construct explicit examples of curves defined over number fields which are general from the perspective of Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory.</description>

      <title>Foundations of superstack theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of applications to the construction of moduli spaces of objects in algebraic supergeometry, we start a systematic study of stacks in that context. After defining a superstack as a stack over the \'etale site of superschemes, we define quotient superstacks, and, based on previous literature, we see that, in analogy with superschemes, every superstack has an underlying ordinary stack, which we call its bosonic reduction. Then we progressively introduce more structure, considering algebraic superspaces, Deligne-Mumford superstacks and algebraic superstacks. We study the topology of algebraic superstacks and several properties of morphisms between them. We introduce quasi-coherent sheaves, and the sheaves of relative differentials. An important issue is how to check that an algebraic superstack is Deligne-Mumford, and we generalize to this setting the usual criteria in terms of the unramifiedness of the diagonal of the stack. Two appendices are devoted to collecting the basic definitions of group superschemes and principal superbundles, and to stating and analyzing some properties of morphisms of superschemes, that are at the basis of the study of morphisms of superstacks in the main text.</description>

      <title>An Early History of Toric Ideals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toric ideals are everywhere. They have been in the commutative algebra lexicon since about 1990 when Bernd Sturmfels used the term. The early days of toric ideals and their Gr\"obner bases were full of new results and promising developments in their applications. Bernd has been consistently their biggest promoter through his own work and that of his collaborators and students. This article is a personal and subjective recalling of the first decade of toric ideals when Bernd played a central role.</description>

      <title>On properness of moduli stacks of $D^{\times}$-shtukas over ramified legs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a maximal order $D$ of a central division algebra over a global function field $F$, we prove an explicit sufficient condition for moduli stacks of $D^\times$-shtukas to be proper over a finite field in terms of the local invariants of $D$ and bounds. Our proof is a refinement of E.~Lau's result (Duke Math. J. 140 (2007)), which showed the properness of the leg morphism (or characteristic morphism) away from the ramification locus of $D$. We also establish non-emptiness of Newton and Kottwitz--Rapoport strata for moduli stacks of $B^\times$-shtukas, where $B$ is a maximal order of a central simple algebra over $F$.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Grothendieck polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a skew shape $\lambda/\mu$, we define the hybrid Grothendieck polynomial $${G}_{\lambda/\mu}(\textbf{x};\textbf{t};\textbf{w}) =\sum_{T\in \mathrm{SVRPP}(\lambda/\mu)} \textbf{x}^{\mathrm{ircont}(T)}\textbf{t}^{\mathrm{ceq} (T)}\textbf{w}^{\mathrm{ex}(T)}$$ as a weight generating function over set-valued reverse plane partitions of shape $\lambda/\mu$. It specializes to \begin{itemize}
  \item[(1)] the refined
  stable Grothendieck polynomial introduced by Chan--Pflueger by setting all $t_i=0$;
  \item[(2)] the refined dual stable Grothendieck polynomial introduced by Galashin--Grinberg--Liu by setting all $w_i=0$. \end{itemize}
  We show that ${G}_{\lambda/\mu}(\textbf{x};\textbf{t};\textbf{w})$ is symmetric in the $\textbf{x}$ variables. By building a crystal structure on set-valued reverse plane partitions, we obtain the expansion of ${G}_{\lambda/\mu}(\textbf{x};\textbf{t};\textbf{w})$ in the basis of Schur functions, extending previous work by Monical--Pechenik--Scrimshaw and Galashin. Based on the Schur expansion, we deduce that hybrid Grothendieck polynomials of straight shapes have saturated Newton polytopes. Finally, using Fomin--Greene's theory on noncommutative Schur functions, we give a combinatorial formula for the image of ${G}_{\lambda/\mu}(\textbf{x};\textbf{t};\textbf{w})$ (in the case $t_i=\alpha$ and $w_i=\beta$) under the omega involution on symmetric functions. The formula unifies the structures of weak set-valued tableaux and valued-set tableaux introduced by Lam--Pylyavskyy. Several problems and conjectures are motivated and discussed.</description>

      <title>Universality of span 2-categories and the construction of 6-functor formalisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an $\infty$-category $C$ equipped with suitable wide subcategories $I, P \subset E\subset C$, we show that the $(\infty,2)$-category $\text{S}{\scriptstyle\text{PAN}}_2(C,E)_{P,I}$ of higher (or iterated) spans defined by Haugseng has the universal property that 2-functors $\text{S}{\scriptstyle\text{PAN}}_2(C,E)_{P,I} \to \mathbb D$ correspond precisely to $(I, P)$-biadjointable functors $C^\text{op} \to \mathbb D$, i.e. functors $F$ where $F(i)$ for $i \in I$ admits a left adjoint and $F(p)$ for $p \in P$ admits a right adjoint satisfying various Beck-Chevalley conditions. We also extend this universality to the symmetric monoidal and lax symmetric monoidal settings. This provides a conceptual explanation for - and an independent proof of - the Mann-Liu-Zheng construction of 6-functor formalisms from suitable functors $C^\text{op}\to\text{CAlg}(\text{Cat})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study statistical models that are parametrized by squares of linear forms. All critical points of the likelihood function are real and positive. There is one for each region of the projective hyperplane arrangement. We study the ideal and singular locus of the model, and we give a determinantal presentation for its likelihood correspondence. We characterize tropical degenerations of the MLE, and we describe log-normal polytopes.</description>

      <title>Stratifications and term description over valued fields with analytic structure, uniform Yomdin-Gromov parametrizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a certain strong smooth stratification of sets and a term description of functions, which are definable over valued fields (possibly non algebraically closed) with separated analytic structure. The basic tools are: elimination of valued field quantifiers, term structure of definable functions, Lipschitz cell decomposition with preparation of $RV$-parametrized sets, and a non-Archimedean definable version of Bierstone-Milman's canonical desingularization algorithm, achieved in an earlier paper of ours. As application, we give uniform Yomdin-Gromov parametrizations over Henselian fields $K$ with separated analytic structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1906.09343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the equivariant small quantum $K$-group of a partial flag manifold is a quotient of that of the full flag manifold in a way it respects the Schubert basis. This is a $K$-theoretic analogue of the parabolic version of Peterson's theorem [Lam-Shimozono, Acta Math. {\bf 204} (2010)] that exhibits different shape from the case of quantum cohomology. Our quotient maps send some of the Novikov variables to $1$, and its geometric meaning is unclear in quantum $K$-theory. This paper can be seen as a continuation of [K, Ann. of Math. (to appear), and Forum of Math., Pi {\bf 9} (2021)].</description>

      <title>On Mochizuki's idea of Anabelomorphy and its applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2003.01890v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I coined the term anabelomorphy (pronounced as anabel-o-morphy) as a concise way of expressing Mochizuki's idea of "anabelian way of changing ground field, rings etc." which was he has introduced in his work on his Inter-Universal Teichmuller Theory. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of this idea by studying its ramifications in the more familiar arithmetic contexts such as the theory of Galois representations, automorphic forms and related areas and establish a number of results which are of independent arithmetic interest. I also introduce the notion of anabelomorphically connected number fields in which two number fields are related by the existence of topological isomorphism between the local Galois groups at a finite list of primes of both the number fields and prove some results illustrating arithmetic consequences of this notion. The Introduction provides a detailed discussion and summary of all the results proved in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.04873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the Hodge version of the global Torelli theorem in the framework of irreducible symplectic orbifolds. We also propose a generalization of several results related to the K\"ahler cone and the notion of wall divisors introduced in the smooth case by Mongardi. As an application we propose a definition of the mirror symmetry as an involution on a moduli space; this construction is also new in the smooth case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In projectivized strata of meromorphic $1$-forms on elliptic curves with only one zero, the locus of residueless differentials is a complex curve endowed with a canonical complex projective structure. Drawing on the multi-scale compactification of strata, we provide formulas to compute the genus of these curves and the degree of their natural forgetful map to $\mathcal{M}_{1,1}$. Additionally, we distinguish two non-hyperelliptic components in the residueless locus of the exceptional stratum $\mathcal{H}_{1}(12,-3,-3,-3,-3)$ and hence complete the classification of the connected components of these loci.</description>

Abstract: We study deformations of Calabi-Yau varieties in characteristic $p$ using techniques from derived algebraic geometry. We prove a mixed characteristic analogue of the Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theorem (which states that Calabi-Yau varieties in characteristic $0$ are unobstructed), and we show that ordinary Calabi-Yau varieties admit canonical lifts to characteristic $0$, generalising the Serre-Tate theorem on ordinary abelian varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate an integral Frobenius period map for the framed crystalline prismatization of the $p$-integral model $\mathcal{S}$ of a Shimura variety with good reduction. By analyzing reductions of this map, we derive a period map from the mod $p$ fiber $S$ of $\mathcal{S}$ to the moduli stack of 1-1 truncated local $G$-shtukas in the prismatic topology, which refines the zip period map of $S$ within this topology. Furthermore, we show that the pair $(\mathcal{S}, S)$ is associated with a double $G$-zip. Additionally, we introduce a framework of base reduction diagrams.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a free arrangement of $d$ lines in the complex projective plane, with exponents $d_1\leq d_2$. Let $m$ be the maximal multiplicity of points in $\mathcal{A}$. In this note, we describe first the simple cases $d_1 \leq m$. Then we study the case $d_1=m+1$, and describe which line arrangements can occur by deleting or adding a line to $\mathcal{A}$. When $d \leq 14$, there are only two free arrangements with $d_1=m+2$, namely one with degree $13$ and the other with degree $14$. We study their geometries in order to deepen our understanding of the structure of free line arrangements in general.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we treat faithful actions of simple algebraic groups on irreducible modules and on the associated Grassmannian varieties. By explicit calculation, we show that in each case, with essentially one exception (only in characteristic 2), there is a dense open subset any point of which has stabilizer conjugate to a fixed subgroup, called the generic stabilizer. We provide tables listing generic stabilizers in the cases where they are non-trivial; in addition we decide whether or not there is a dense orbit, or a regular orbit for the action on the module.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a broad lemma, one consequence of which is the higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) of tensors defined by DeLathauwer, DeMoor and Vandewalle (2000). By an analogous application of the lemma, we find a complex orthogonal version of the HOSVD. Kraus' (2010) algorithm used the HOSVD to compute normal forms of almost all $n$-qubit pure states under the action of the local unitary group. Taking advantage of the double cover $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}) \times \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}) \to \operatorname{SO}_4({\mathbb{C}})$, we produce similar algorithms (distinguished by the parity of $n$) that compute normal forms for almost all $n$-qubit pure states under the action of the SLOCC group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in jointly analyzing a foreground dataset, representing an experimental group, and a background dataset, representing a control group. The goal of such contrastive investigations is to identify salient features in the experimental group relative to the control. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a powerful tool for learning independent patterns in a dataset. We generalize it to contrastive ICA (cICA). For this purpose, we devise a new linear algebra based tensor decomposition algorithm, which is more expressive but just as efficient and identifiable as other linear algebra based algorithms. We establish the identifiability of cICA and demonstrate its performance in finding patterns and visualizing data, using synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets, comparing the approach to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Sum of Squares Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing expressive generative models that support exact and efficient inference is a core question in probabilistic ML. Probabilistic circuits (PCs) offer a framework where this tractability-vs-expressiveness trade-off can be analyzed theoretically. Recently, squared PCs encoding subtractive mixtures via negative parameters have emerged as tractable models that can be exponentially more expressive than monotonic PCs, i.e., PCs with positive parameters only. In this paper, we provide a more precise theoretical characterization of the expressiveness relationships among these models. First, we prove that squared PCs can be less expressive than monotonic ones. Second, we formalize a novel class of PCs -- sum of squares PCs -- that can be exponentially more expressive than both squared and monotonic PCs. Around sum of squares PCs, we build an expressiveness hierarchy that allows us to precisely unify and separate different tractable model classes such as Born Machines and PSD models, and other recently introduced tractable probabilistic models by using complex parameters. Finally, we empirically show the effectiveness of sum of squares circuits in performing distribution estimation.</description>

Abstract: We consider Mahler measures of two well-studied families of bivariate polynomials, namely $P_t=x+x^{-1}+y+y^{-1}+\sqrt{t}$ and $Q_t=x^3+y^3+1-\sqrt[3]{t}xy$, where $t$ is a complex parameter. In the cases when the zero loci of these polynomials define CM elliptic curves over number fields, we derive general formulas for their Mahler measures in terms of $L$-values of cusp forms. For each family, we also classify all possible values of $t$ in number fields of degree not exceeding $4$ for which the corresponding elliptic curves have complex multiplication. Finally, for all such values of $t$ in totally real number fields of degree $n=2$ and $n=4$, corresponding to elliptic curves $\mathcal{F}_t$ (resp. $\mathcal{C}_t$), we prove that determinants of $n\times n$ matrices whose entries are Mahler measures corresponding to their Galois conjugates are non-zero rational multiples of $L^{(n)}(\mathcal{F}_t,0)$ (resp. $L^{(n)}(\mathcal{C}_t,0)$).</description>

      <title>Topological Koszulity for Category Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a topological description of Ext groups between simple representations of categories via a nerve type construction. We use it to show that the Koszulity of indiscretely based category algebras is equivalent to the locally bouquet property of this nerve. We also provide a class of functors which preserve the Koszulity of category algebras called almost discrete fibrations. Specializing from categories to posets, we show that the equivalence relations of V. Reiner and D. Stamate in arXiv:0904.1683 [math.AC] are exactly almost discrete fibrations and recover their results. As an application, we classify when a shifted dual collection to a full strong exceptional collection of line bundles on a toric variety is strong.</description>

      <title>On the Resolution of Partial Differential Equations for Lattice Structures on Smooth Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the embedding of lattice structures $L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ into smooth manifolds $M \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ through a rigorous mathematical framework. Building upon the foundational results established in "Embedding of a Discrete Lattice Structure in a Smooth Manifold," this work investigates the existence and solvability of partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the embedding process. The primary aim is to derive and analyze solutions to these PDEs while preserving the geometric and topological properties of $L$ and $M$.
  The solutions are shown to exist under initial boundary conditions, with the geometric structure of $M$ and the discrete topology of $L$ playing crucial roles in ensuring well-posedness and regularity.
  This paper provides a detailed exposition of the mathematical interplay between discrete and continuous spaces, offering novel insights into embedding theory and the geometry of manifolds interacting with discrete substructures.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of type $B$ real permutohedral varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type $A$ and type $B$ permutohedral varieties are classic examples of mathematics, and their topological invariants are well known. This naturally leads to the investigation of the topology of their real loci, known as type $A$ and type $B$ real permutohedral varieties.
  The rational cohomology rings of type $A$ real permutohedral varieties are fully described in terms of alternating permutations. Until now, only rational Betti numbers of type $B$ real permutohedral varieties have been described in terms of $B$-snakes. In this paper, we explicitly describe the multiplicative structure of the cohomology rings of type $B$ real permutohedral varieties in terms of $B$-snakes.</description>

      <title>Polynomial, trigonometric, and tropical activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01247</link>

Abstract: Which functions can be used as activations in deep neural networks? This article explores families of functions based on orthonormal bases, including the Hermite polynomial basis and the Fourier trigonometric basis, as well as a basis resulting from the tropicalization of a polynomial basis. Our study shows that, through simple variance-preserving initialization and without additional clamping mechanisms, these activations can successfully be used to train deep models, such as GPT-2 for next-token prediction on OpenWebText and ConvNeXt for image classification on ImageNet. Our work addresses the issue of exploding and vanishing activations and gradients, particularly prevalent with polynomial activations, and opens the door for improving the efficiency of large-scale learning tasks. Furthermore, our approach provides insight into the structure of neural networks, revealing that networks with polynomial activations can be interpreted as multivariate polynomial mappings. Finally, using Hermite interpolation, we show that our activations can closely approximate classical ones in pre-trained models by matching both the function and its derivative, making them especially useful for fine-tuning tasks. These activations are available in the torchortho library, which can be accessed via: https://github.com/K-H-Ismail/torchortho.</description>
