      <title>The Lieb-Robinson condition and the Fr\'echet topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define various notions of locality for *-automorphisms of the algebra of observables for an infinitely extended quantum spin system and study their relationship. In particular, we show that the ubiquitous characterization which arises from the Lieb-Robinson bound implies but is not equivalent to continuity with respect to the natural Fr\'echet topology of almost local observables, which is a non-commutative analog of the Schwartz space.</description>

      <title>Cancellation Identities and Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a manifest gauge invariant renormalization framework by first introducing a perturbative BRST Feynman graph complex and then combining it with Connes--Kreimer renormalization theory: To this end, we first formalize the cancellation identities of 't Hooft (1971), which were used to prove the absence of gauge anomalies in Quantum Yang--Mills theories. Specifically, we start with some reasonable axioms of (generalized) gauge theories and then present the most general version of cancellation identities ensuring transversality. Then, we construct a perturbative BRST Feynman graph complex, whose cohomology groups consist of transversal invariant linear combinations of Feynman graphs. We prove that the cohomology groups are zero in odd degree and generated by connected combinatorial Green's functions in even degree, with a corresponding number of external ghost edges. Ultimately, we then formulate the renormalization Hopf algebra on these cohomology groups, which directly links to Hopf subalgebras for multiplicative renormalization. Finally, we exemplify the developed theory with Quantum Yang--Mills theory and (effective) Quantum General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Three Dixon-Rosenfeld Planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rosenfeld postulated ``generalized'' projective planes, which exploit a correspondence between rank-one idempotents of Jordan algebras $\mathfrak{J}_3(\mathbb{A})$ and points of projective planes $\mathbb{A}P^2$. The isometry groups of the generalized projective planes (which were later defined rigorously as homogeneous spaces) are entries of the Tits-Freudenthal magic square. Given recent interest in the Dixon algebra $\mathbb{R}\otimes\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}\otimes\mathbb{O}$, we extend Rosenfeld's approach and present three new coset manifolds. These "Dixon-Rosenfeld planes" have isometry algebras that are obtained from Tits' magic formula and involve all tensorial components of the Dixon algebra. We show that these are the only three planes obtainable with Tits' formula that preserve the analogy with Rosenfeld's planes. These non-simple Lie algebras generalize $\mathfrak{f}_{4},\mathfrak{e}_{6},\mathfrak{e}_{7}$ and $\mathfrak{e}_{8}$ for the octonionic plane $\mathbb{O}P^{2}$ and in the octonionic Rosenfeld planes $\left(\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{O}\right)P^{2}$, $\left(\mathbb{H}\otimes\mathbb{O}\right)P^{2}$ and $\left(\mathbb{O}\otimes\mathbb{O}\right)P^{2}$. We finally investigate the relationships between the isometry algebras of the Dixon-Rosenfeld planes and the exceptional Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Symmetry transformation group arising from the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kepler problem in classical mechanics exhibits a rich structure of conserved quantities, highlighted by the Laplace--Runge--Lenz (LRL) vector. Through Noether's theorem in reverse, the LRL vector gives rise to a corresponding infinitesimal dynamical symmetry on the kinematical variables, which is well known in the literature. However, the physically relevant part of the LRL vector is its direction angle in the plane of motion (since its magnitude is just a function of energy and angular momentum). The present work derives the infinitesimal dynamical symmetry corresponding to the direction part of the LRL vector, and obtains the explicit form of the symmetry transformations that it generates. When combined with the rotation symmetries,the resulting symmetry group is shown to be the semi-direct product of $SO(3)$ and $R^3$. This stands in contrast to the $SO(4)$ symmetry group generated by the LRL symmetries and the rotations. As a by-product, the action of the new infinitesimal symmetries on all of the conserved quanties is obtained. The results are given in terms of the physical kinematical variables in the Kepler problem, rather than in an enlarged auxiliary space in which the LRL symmetries are usually stated.</description>

      <title>How Dark is Dark Energy? A Lightcones Comparison Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a geometrical approach that provides a non-perturbative technique, allowing the standard FLRW observer to evaluate a measurable, scale-dependent distance functional between her idealized FLRW past light cone and the actual physical past light cone. From the point of view of the FLRW observer, gathering data from sources at cosmological redshift $\widehat{z}$, this functional generates a geometry--structure--growth contribution ${\Omega_\Lambda(\widehat{z})}$ to the FLRW cosmological constant ${\widehat\Omega_\Lambda}$. This redshift--dependent contribution erodes the interpretation of ${\widehat\Omega_\Lambda}$ as representing constant dark energy. In particular, ${\Omega_\Lambda(\widehat{z})}$ becomes significantly large at very low $\widehat{z}$, where structures dominate the cosmological landscape. At the pivotal galaxy cluster scale, where cosmological expansion decouples from the local gravitation dynamics, we get ${\Omega_\Lambda(\widehat{z})/\widehat\Omega_\Lambda}\,=\,\mathscr{O}(1)$, showing that late--epoch structures provide an effective field contribution to the FLRW cosmological constant that is of the same order of magnitude as its assumed value. We prove that ${\Omega_\Lambda(\widehat{z})}$ is generated by a scale-dependent effective field governed by structure formation and related to the comparison between the idealized FLRW past light cone and the actual physical past light cone. These results are naturally framed in the mainstream FLRW cosmology; they do not require exotic fields and provide a natural setting for analyzing the coincidence problem, leading to an interpretative shift in the current understanding of constant dark energy.</description>

      <title>Generalized Schur limit, modular differential equations and quantum monodromy traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore some aspects of the generalized Schur limit, defined in arXiv:2506.13764. Based on several examples, we conjecture that the generalized Schur limit as a function of $\alpha$ solves a modular linear differential equation of fixed order, with coefficients depending on $\alpha$. We also observe in examples that for Argyres-Douglas theories of type $(A_1,G)$ with $G=A_n,D_n$, the generalized Schur limit for certain negative integer values of $\alpha$, coincides with the trace of higher powers of the quantum monodromy operator. This hints at a more general correspondence between the wall-crossing invariant traces on the Coulomb branch and the generalized Schur limit, which is related to the Higgs branch.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a rigorous topological theory of anomalies on the lattice, which are obstructions to gauging global symmetries and the existence of trivial symmetric states. We also construct $\Omega$-spectra of a class of invertible states and quantum cellular automata, which allows us to classify both anomalies and symmetry protected topological phases up to blend equivalence.</description>

      <title>Generalised 4d Partition Functions and Modular Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the equivalence of a class of generalised Schur partition functions $\mathcal Z_G(q;\alpha)$ of 4d $\mathcal N=2$ superconformal gauge theories to contour integral representations of vector-valued modular forms of the type that arise in 2d rational conformal field theories (RCFT). Concretely, we consider the $USp(2N)$ theory with $2N+2$ fundamental hypermultiplets and analytically prove that $\mathcal Z_{USp(2N)}(q;\alpha)$ satisfies an order-$(N+1)$ modular linear differential equation (MLDE) with vanishing Wronskian index, explaining how the parameter $\alpha$ of the former determines the parameters of the latter. Several connections are made to characters of RCFTs including unitary ones. We then propose a two-parameter extension $\mathcal Z_{USp(2N)}(q;\alpha,\beta)$ of the generalised Schur partition function. Finally, we relate the $\alpha=-k$ specialisation to quantum monodromy traces ${\rm Tr}\,M^k$ and formulate a conjecture linking their $k$-dependence to MLDEs.</description>

      <title>Generalizing fusion rules by shuffle: Symmetry-based classifications of nonlocal systems constructed from similarity transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fusion rings, or symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs), which lie outside the non-negative integer matrix representation (NIM-rep), by combining knowledge from generalized symmetry and that from pseudo-Hermitian systems. By applying the Galois shuffle operation to the SymTFTs, we reconstruct fusion rings that correspond to nonlocal CFTs constructed from the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs by applying the similarity transformations. The resultant SymTFTs are outside of NIM-rep, whereas they are ring isomorphic to the NIM-rep of the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs. We study the consequences of this correspondence between the nonlocal unitary model and local nonunitary models. We demonstrate the correspondence between their classifications of massive or massless renormalization group flows and the discrepancies between their boundary or domain wall phenomena. Our work reveals a new connection between ring isomorphism and similarity transformations, providing the fundamental implications of ring-theoretic ideas in the context of symmetry in physics.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium modeling of lyotropic liquid crystals: from binary simulations to multi-component theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a thermodynamically consistent theoretical framework for lyotropic liquid crystals (LCs) based on the GENERIC (General Equation for the Non-Equilibrium Reversible-Irreversible Coupling) formalism. This formalism ensures conservation of energy and production of entropy, while coupling concentration, momentum balance, and liquid crystalline order. Starting from a binary nematic-isotropic mixture, we derive a theory for these key variables, which is then extended to multi-component systems.
  The binary equations are solved numerically using a Julia-based solver that relies on an upwind finite-difference scheme, enabling stable and efficient simulations capable of handling multiple time scales while satisfying fundamental mathematical constraints. The results of simulations are consistent with experimental observations of topological core defects in chromonic LCs, as well as flow-driven droplet shape transitions under Couette and Poiseuille flows.
  This work provides a platform for simulations of multi-component lyotropic LCs that can be extended to systems with multiple interfaces, active materials, and materials subject to external fields.</description>

      <title>On the Fourier transform of the hyperbola and its role in hyperbolic photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent breakthrough studies of wave hyperbolicity in extremely anisotropic natural materials and artificial composites, we investigate the radiation pattern of a localized emitter in a hyperbolic medium. Since the emission of a point source is associated with the Fourier transform of the iso-frequency contours of a medium, we derive and analyze the properties of the Fourier transform of hyperbolic dispersion, which sheds light into the emission properties in the presence of hyperbolic bands. Our analysis leads to a generalized form of Huygens' principle for hyperbolic waves, connecting to the emergence of negative refraction and focusing with hyperbolic media. We also highlight the occurrence of aliasing artifacts in polariton imaging. More broadly, our findings provide analytical tools to model polariton propagation in materials with extreme anisotropy, and may be applied to several other physical platforms featuring hyperbolic responses, from astrophysics to seismology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the free boundary $q$-Whittaker and Hall--Littlewood processes, two probability measures on sequences of partitions. We prove that a certain observable of the free boundary $q$-Whittaker process exhibits a $(q,t)$ symmetry after a random shift, generalizing a previous result of Imamura, Mucciconi, and Sasamoto, and an extension of that result due to the first author. Our proof is completely different, and as part of our proof, we find contour integral formulas for the free boundary $q$-Whittaker process. We also show a matching between certain observables in the free boundary Hall--Littlewood process and a quasi-open six vertex model, and explain how work of Finn and Vanicat gives an evaluation of a bounded sum over skew Hall--Littlewood functions as a rectangular Koornwinder polynomial.</description>

Abstract: We present the transition probability for the asymmetric simple exclusion process on the half-space for general initial conditions and particle insertion at the boundary. In the limit of total asymmetry, where particles only jump to the right, we show that the transition probability reduces to a single Pfaffian for a large class of initial conditions. We further derive a Fredholm Pfaffian formula for the multipoint distribution of the totally asymmetric model conditioned on the number of particles in the system using a connection with a Pfaffian point process supported on Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns.</description>

      <title>Thouless pumps and universal geometry-induced drift velocity in multi-sliding quasi-periodic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantized Thouless pumps in periodic systems, set by Chern numbers or Wannier-center winding, is by now fairly well established, whereas its quasi-periodic extensions still require further clarification. Here, we develop a general quantitative paradigm for bulk Thouless pumps in continuous models with spacetime quasi-periodicity, applicable to arbitrary spatial dimensions. Within this framework, the bulk pumping turns out to be governed by an emergent long wave-length effective potential. Based on this mechanism, we obtain our main result a universal relation between topological drifting and the geometry of quasi Brillouin zone. Reduced to periodic systems, our result gives an explicit and compact formula which enables us to directly calculate Chern numbers by microscopic data. These proposals are corroborated by simulations of one- and two-dimensional continuous moir\'e-type spacetime quasi-periodic lattices, which exhibit stable, localized, directional drift in excellent agreement with the theory.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization in high-contrast media with random spherical inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spectral properties of partial differential operators modelling composite materials with highly contrasting constituents, comprised of soft spherical inclusions with random radii dispersed in a stiff matrix. Such operators have recently attracted significant interest from the research community, including in the context of stochastic homogenization. In particular, it has been proved that the spectrum of these operators may feature a band-gap structure in the regime where heterogeneities take place on a sufficiently small scale. However, the nature of the limiting (as the small scale tends to zero) spectrum in the above setting is non-classical and not completely understood. In this paper we prove for the first time that Anderson localization occurs near band edges, thus shedding light on the limiting spectral behaviour. Our results rely on recent nontrivial advancements in quantitative unique continuation for PDEs, in combination with assumptions on the model that are standard in the Anderson localization literature, and which we plan to relax in future works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chen-Ning Yang made important contributions to the theory of solvable models in statistical mechanics, including generalizations of the Bethe Ansatz, magnetization in the Ising model, the Lee-Yang circle theorem, and the Yang-Baxter equation. Most famously, Yang made transformative contributions to the current Standard Model of elementary particle interactions. The proposal of Yang and T. D. Lee, that left-right symetry (parity) is violated in weak particle decays, established that the primary currents involved in weak interactions are left handed. The work of Yang and R. L. Mills gave a framework for force carriers coupling to these currents that are non-Abelian generalizations of the electromagnetic photon, which unlike the electrically neutral photon, carry ``charges'' to which they self-couple . Two decades of work by others on quantization and mass-generation mechanisms then culminated in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of a static black hole in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the axial electromagnetic quasinormal modes of a static, asymptotically Anti--de Sitter (AdS) black hole sourced by a nonlinear electrodynamics model of Pleba\'{n}ski type. Starting from the master equation governing axial perturbations, we impose ingoing boundary conditions at the event horizon and normalizable (Dirichlet) behavior at the AdS boundary. Following the approach of Jansen, we recast the radial equation into a linear generalized eigenvalue problem by using an ingoing Eddington--Finkelstein formulation, compactifying the radial domain, and regularizing the asymptotic coefficients. The resulting problem is solved using a Chebyshev--Lobatto pseudospectral discretization. We compute the fundamental quasinormal mode frequencies for both the purely electric ($Q_m=0$) and purely magnetic ($Q_e=0$) sectors, emphasizing the role of the nonlinearity parameter $\beta$ and the effective charge magnitude $Q$. Our results show that increasing either $\beta$ or $Q$ raises both the oscillation frequency $\omega_R$ and the damping rate $-\omega_I$, leading to faster but more rapidly decaying ringdown profiles. Nonlinear electrodynamics breaks the isospectrality between electric and magnetic configurations: magnetic modes are systematically less oscillatory and more weakly damped than their electric counterparts. For sufficiently large $\beta$ and small $Q_m$, the fundamental mode becomes purely imaginary ($\omega_R \approx 0$), in agreement with the absence of a trapping potential barrier in this regime. These findings reveal qualitative signatures of nonlinear electromagnetic effects on black hole perturbations and may have implications for high-field or high-charge astrophysical environments.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the irreducible smooth $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_{2}$-modules recently constructed in arXiv:2404.03855, and demonstrate that these modules admit a Wakimoto-type realization at both critical and non-critical levels. In the critical level case, we identify simple quotients of these modules with the Wakimoto modules whose irreducibility was already established in arXiv:math/0602181, arXiv:1402.6100. We also generalize some Wakimoto modules constructed in arXiv:1409.5354 and identify them as generalized Whittaker modules.</description>

      <title>Fine-Graining and Continuous Space Scaling Limit of the $H^{2|2}$ Model on the Hierarchical Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the exact coarse-graining result of Disertori, Merkl and Rolles~\cite{MR4517733} for the random field of $H^{2|2}$-model to the random Schr\"odinger operator representation of the $H^{2|2}$-model. We also introduce a fine-graining procedure as the reverse operation, and establish an associated exponential martingale property. Applying this fine-graining procedure to the $H^{2|2}$-model on the Dyson hierarchical lattice, we establish its continuous space scaling limit as a non-trivial random measure on $[0,1]$.
  This random measure is almost surely singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure if and only if the Vertex Reinforced Jump Process on the Dyson hierarchical lattice is recurrent. If the process is transient, the random measure almost surely has an absolutely continuous component. The density of this component is everywhere non-trivial and can be identified with the pointwise limit of an exponential martingale associated with the $H^{2|2}$-model on the Dyson hierarchical lattice.</description>

      <title>The Obukhov--Corrsin spectrum of passive scalar turbulence through anomalous regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Obukhov--Corrsin spectrum predicts the distribution of Fourier mass for a passive scalar field advected by a "turbulent" velocity field with spatial regularity $C^\alpha_x$ for $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and subject to a time-stationary forcing. We prove the Obukhov--Corrsin spectrum holds after summing over geometric annuli in Fourier space -- up to logarithmic corrections -- as a consequence of a sharp anomalous regularization result. We then prove this anomalous regularization for a broad class of Kraichnan-type models. The proof of anomalous regularization relies on a Fourier space $\ell^p$ energy equality and a weighted lattice Poincar\'e inequality.</description>

      <title>Positional memory of skyrmions in magnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically and analytically study the transient dynamics of magnetic skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets under a magnetic field gradient. We consider skyrmions in a bilayer with antiferromagnetic coupling between the layers. The skyrmions in the two layers move almost perpendicular to the field gradient and the motion is eventually halted with the two skyrmions at a distance from each other. We find that the skyrmion displacement is proportional to the field gradient, while the time it takes to reach their final position is almost independent of it. Below a critical magnetic field gradient strength, the system displays an unusual 'remembering' dynamics: when the magnetic field gradient is removed, the skyrmions return to their original positions to a high degree of accuracy. We explain this observation and other quantitative features using a moduli space dynamics approximation. We further provide an exact treatment of the dynamics that indicates that deviations from exact memory of the skyrmion position can arise.</description>

      <title>Bright and dark breathers on an elliptic wave in the defocusing mKdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breathers on an elliptic wave background consist of nonlinear superpositions of a soliton and a periodic wave, both traveling with different wave speeds and interacting periodically in the space-time. For the defocusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation, the construction of general breathers has been an open problem since the elliptic wave is related to the elliptic degeneration of the hyperelliptic solutions of genus two. We have found the new representation of eigenfunctions of the Lax operator associated with the elliptic wave, which enables us to solve this open problem and to construct two families of breathers with bright (elevation) and dark (depression) profiles.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for Navier-Stokes at high Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a preconditioner for a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations at high Reynolds number. The preconditioner is based on an augmented Lagrangian approach of the full discretization. Unlike standard grad-div type augmentation, however, we consider augmentation based on divergence-conformity. With this augmentation we introduce two different, well-conditioned, and easy to solve matrices to approximate the trace pressure Schur complement. To introduce a completely algebraic solver, we propose to use multifrontal sparse LU solvers using butterfly compression to solve the trace velocity block. Numerical examples demonstrate that the trace pressure Schur complement is highly robust in mesh spacing and Reynolds number and that the multifrontal inexact LU performs well for a wide range of Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a view towards studying the multitemporal wave equation on affine buildings recently introduced by Anker-R\'emy-Trojan [arXiv:2312.06860], we systematically develop the basic properties of the discrete wave equation on $\mathbb{Z}$ and use this to explain existing results about the wave equation on regular graphs. Furthermore, we explicitly compute the incoming and outgoing translation representations and the scattering operator, in the sense of Lax-Phillips, for regular and biregular trees. Finally, we use the wave equation on biregular graphs to extend a result of Brooks-Lindenstrauss about delocalization of eigenfunctions on regular graphs to the setting of biregular graphs.</description>

      <title>The Gamma-disordered Aztec diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multi-parameter family of random edge weights on the Aztec diamond graph, given by certain Gamma variables, and prove several results about the corresponding random dimer measures.
  Firstly, we show there is no phase transition at the level of the free energy. This provides rigorous backing for the physics predictions of Zeng-Leath-Hwa and later works that dimer models with random weights are in the glassy `super-rough' phase at all temperatures with no phase transition.
  Secondly, we show that the random dimer covers themselves enjoy exact distributional equalities of certain marginals with path locations in new `hybrid' integrable polymers. These reduce to the stationary log-Gamma, strict-weak, and Beta polymer in random environment in certain cases, allowing transfer of known results from integrable polymers to dimers with random weights. As an example application, we prove that the turning points at the boundaries of the Aztec diamond exhibit fluctuations of order $n^{2/3}$, in contrast to the $n^{1/2}$ fluctuations for deterministic weights.
  Underlying all these is a key integrability property of the weights: they are the unique family for which independence is preserved under the shuffling algorithm.</description>

      <title>A characterisation of orthomodular spaces by Sasaki maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a Hilbert space $H$, the set $P(H)$ of one-dimensional subspaces of $H$ becomes an orthoset when equipped with the orthogonality relation $\perp$ induced by the inner product on $H$. Here, an \emph{orthoset} is a pair $(X,\perp)$ of a set $X$ and a symmetric, irreflexive binary relation $\perp$ on $X$. In this contribution, we investigate what conditions on an orthoset $(X,\perp)$ are sufficient to conclude that the orthoset is isomorphic to $(P(H),\perp)$ for some orthomodular space $H$, where \emph{orthomodular spaces} are linear spaces that generalize Hilbert spaces. In order to achieve this goal, we introduce \emph{Sasaki maps} on orthosets, which are strongly related to Sasaki projections on orthomodular lattices. We show that any orthoset $(X,\perp)$ with sufficiently many Sasaki maps is isomorphic to $(P(H),\perp)$ for some orthomodular space, and we give more conditions on $(X,\perp)$ to assure that $H$ is actually a Hilbert space over $\mathbb R$, $\mathbb C$ or $\mathbb H$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use String Field Theory (SFT) to construct a higher analogue of Bunke-Schick's functor $P: \mathbf{Top}^{op} \to \mathbf{Set}$ \cite{BunkeS1} by geometrizing $P.$ We use the projection of SFT onto its massless modes \cite{SFTDiffeo} to construct the category $\C$ whose objects are pairs (which we identify with SFT backgrounds) and whose maps are morphisms of pairs (which are gauge transformations). Using $\C$ and categorical equivalence, for any $CW-$complex $X$ we define the moduli space $G(X)$ of SFT backgrounds which are pairs over $X$ up to gauge equivalence. We use the homotopy theory of the moduli space $G(X)$ to define functors on the category of $CW-$complexes $P_k:\mathbf{CW}^{op} \to \mathbf{Grpd}$ such that $P_0 \simeq P,$ $P_1$ is nontrivial and $P_k(X)$ are always trivial for $k \geq 2.$ Arrows in $P_1(X)$ are shown to be isotopy classes of maps in the mapping class group of $X$ acting on (isomorphism classes of) pairs over $X.$ We discuss applications to Topological T-duality for triples and to modelling doubled geometries and T-folds \cite{HullT}.</description>

Abstract: Any semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ of stochastic matrices induces a semigroup majorization relation $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$ on the set $\Delta_{n-1}$ of probability $n$-vectors. Pick $X,Y$ at random in $\Delta_{n-1}$: what is the probability that $X$ and $Y$ are comparable under $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$? We review recent asymptotic ($n\to\infty$) results and conjectures in the case of majorization relation (when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of doubly stochastic matrices), discuss natural generalisations, and prove a new asymptotic result in the case of majorization, and new exact finite-$n$ formulae in the case of UT-majorization relation, i.e. when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of upper-triangular stochastic matrices.</description>

Abstract: An infinite 3-parametric family of superintegrable and exactly-solvable quantum models on a plane, admitting separation of variables in polar coordinates, marked by integer index $k$ was introduced in Journ Phys A 42 (2009) 242001 and was called in literature the TTW system. In this paper it is conjectured that the Hamiltonian and both integrals of TTW system have hidden algebra $g^{(k)}$ - it was checked for $k=1,2,3,4$ - having its finite-dimensional representation spaces as the invariant subspaces. It is checked that for $k=1,2,3,4$ that the Hamiltonian $H$, two integrals ${\cal I}_{1,2}$ and their commutator ${\cal I}_{12} = [{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_2]$ are four generating elements of the polynomial algebra of integrals of the order $(k+1)$: $[{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_{12}] = P_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, $[{\cal I}_2,{\cal I}_{12}] = Q_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, where $P_{k+1},Q_{k+1}$ are polynomials of degree $(k+1)$ written in terms of ordered monomials of $H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12}$. This implies that polynomial algebra of integrals is subalgebra of $g^{(k)}$. It is conjectured that all is true for any integer $k$.</description>

      <title>Spin conductivity of the XXZ chain in the antiferromagnetic massive regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.05304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a series representation for the dynamical two-point function of the local spin current for the XXZ chain in the antiferromagnetic massive regime at zero temperature. From this series we can compute the correlation function with very high accuracy up to very long times and large distances. Each term in the series corresponds to the contribution of all scattering states of an even number of excitations. These excitations can be interpreted in terms of an equal number of particles and holes. The lowest term in the series comprises all scattering states of one hole and one particle. This term determines the long-time large-distance asymptotic behaviour which can be obtained explicitly from a saddle-point analysis. The space-time Fourier transform of the two-point function of currents at zero momentum gives the optical spin conductivity of the model. We obtain highly accurate numerical estimates for this quantity by numerically Fourier transforming our data. For the one-particle, one-hole contribution, equivalently interpreted as a two-spinon contribution, we obtain an exact and explicit expression in terms of known special functions. For large enough anisotropy, the two-spinon contribution carries most of the spectral weight, as can be seen by calculating the f-sum rule.</description>

      <title>Homogenization theory of random walks among deterministic conductances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08382v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic distribution of random walks on $\mathbb Z^d$ ($d\ge1$) in deterministic reversible environments defined by an assignment of a positive conductance to each edge of $\mathbb Z^d$. We identify a deterministic set of conductance configurations for which the walk obeys an Invariance Principle; i.e., converges in law to a non-degenerate Brownian motion under diffusive scaling of space and time. This set is closed under translations and zero-density perturbations and carries all ergodic conductance laws subject to certain moment conditions. The proofs rely on martingale approximations whose main step is the conversion of averages in time and physical space under the deterministic environment to those in a suitable stochastic counterpart. Our study sets up a framework for "de-randomized homogenization" of other motions in disordered media.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of current for the symmetric simple exclusion process on a semi-infinite line, and on an infinite line with a slow bond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two influential exact results in classical one-dimensional diffusive transport are about current statistics for the symmetric simple exclusion process: one in the stationary state on a finite line coupled with two unequal reservoirs at the boundaries, and the other in the non-stationary state on an infinite line. We present the corresponding result for the intermediate geometry of a semi-infinite line coupled with a single reservoir. This result is obtained using the fluctuating hydrodynamics approach of macroscopic fluctuation theory and confirmed by rare event simulations using a cloning algorithm. We apply our exact result for solving several related challenging problems, namely, the full counting statistics in presence of a defect bond, exclusion process with localized injection, survival of a tagged particle in presence of an absorbing boundary, and the stretched exponential decay in a kinetically constrained model.</description>

      <title>Dynamical random field Ising model at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20457v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of the zero-temperature random field Ising model as the mean of the external field $M$ increases from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. We focus on two types of evolutions: the ground state evolution and the Glauber evolution. For the ground state evolution, we investigate the occurrence of global avalanche, a moment where a large fraction of spins flip simultaneously from minus to plus. In two dimensions, no global avalanche occurs, while in three or higher dimensions, there is a phase transition: a global avalanche happens when the noise intensity is small, but not when it is large. Additionally, we study the zero-temperature Glauber evolution, where spins are updated locally to minimize the Hamiltonian. Our results show that for small noise intensity, in dimensions $d =2$ or $3$, most spins flip around a critical time $c_d = \frac{2 \sqrt{d}}{1 + \sqrt{d}}$ (but we cannot decide whether such flipping occurs simultaneously or not). We also connect this process to polluted bootstrap percolation and solve an open problem on it.</description>

      <title>Free Probability approach to spectral and operator statistics in Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the framework of free probability, we analyze the spectral and operator statistics of the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles, which exhibit a rich phase structure encompassing ergodic, fractal, and localized regimes. Leveraging subordination formulae, we develop a perturbative scheme that yields semi-analytic expressions for the density of states up to second order in system size, in good agreement with numerical results. We compute higher-point correlation functions in the ergodic regime using both numerical and suitable analytic approximations. Our analysis of operator statistics for various spin operators across these regimes reveals close agreement with free probability predictions in the ergodic phase, in contrast to persistent deviations observed in the fractal and localized phases, even at late times. Notably, the fractal phase exhibits partial freeness while retaining memory of the initial spectrum, highlighting the importance of non-localized eigenstates and associated with the late-time dynamics of cumulative out-of-time-ordered-correlators (OTOCs). Employing distance measures and statistical tools such as the $\chi^2$ statistic, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis testing, we define a characteristic time scale-the free time-that marks the onset of the validity of free probability predictions for operator spectral statistics in the ergodic phase. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate consistency across these different approaches.</description>

      <title>The Markov property for $\varphi^4_3$ on the cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the $\varphi^4_3$ model satisfies a version of Segal's axioms in the special case of three-dimensional tori and cylinders. As a consequence, we give the first proof that this model satisfies a Markov property and we characterize its boundary law up to absolutely continuous perturbations. In addition, we use Segal's axioms to give an alternative construction of the $\varphi^4_3$ Hamiltonian on two-dimensional tori as compared with Glimm (Comm. Math. Phys., 1968). We exploit this probabilistic approach to prove novel fundamental spectral properties of the Hamiltonian, such as discrete spectrum and a Perron-Froebenius type result on its ground state. The key technical contributions of this article are the development of tools to analyze $\varphi^4_3$ models with rough boundary conditions. We heavily use the variational approach to $\varphi^4_3$ models introduced in Barashkov and Gubinelli (Duke, 2020) that is based on the Bou\'e-Dupuis formula and dual to Polchinski's continuous renormalization group.</description>

      <title>The Semi-Classical Limit of Quantum Gravity on Corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum and classical systems defined by the quantum corner symmetry group $QCS = \widetilde{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \ltimes H_3$, which arises in the context of quantum gravity. In particular, we relate the quantum observables, defined by representation-theoretic data, to their classical counterparts through generalized Perelomov coherent states and the framework of Berezin quantization. The resulting procedure provides a mathematically well-defined notion of the semi-classical limit of quantum gravity, viewed as the representation theory of the corner symmetry group.</description>

      <title>Non-semisimple CFT/TFT correspondence I: General setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the TFT construction of CFT correlators of [arXiv:hep-th/0204148] to so-called finite logarithmic CFTs for which the algebraic input data is no longer semisimple but still finite. More specifically, starting from the data of a chiral CFT given in the form of a not necessarily semisimple modular tensor category C we use a three dimensional topological field theory with surface defects based on the surgery TFT of [arXiv:1912.02063] to construct a full CFT as a braided monoidal oplax natural transformation.
  We make our construction explicit in the example of the transparent surface defect, resulting in the so-called Cardy case. In particular, we consider topological line defects and their action on bulk fields in these logarithmic CFTs, providing a source of examples for non-invertible and non-semisimple topological symmetries.</description>
