      <title>On sharp stable recovery from clipped and folded measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of vector recovery from random linear measurements which have been either clipped or folded. This is motivated by applications where measurement devices detect inputs outside of their effective range.
  As examples of our main results, we prove sharp lower bounds on the recovery constant for both the declipping and unfolding problems whenever samples are taken according to a uniform distribution on the sphere. Moreover, we show such estimates under (almost) the best possible conditions on both the number of samples and the distribution of the data. We then prove that all of the above results have suitable (effectively) sparse counterparts. In the special case that one restricts the stability analysis to vectors which belong to the unit sphere of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we show that the problem of declipping directly extends the one-bit compressed sensing results of Oymak-Recht and Plan-Vershynin.</description>

      <title>On the existence of weakly malnormal quasiconvex subgroups of hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we prove the existence of weakly malnormal, virtually free, quasiconvex subgroups in any nonelementary hyperbolic group. This extends a result of Ilya Kapovich, where he proved the existence of malnormal quasiconvex subgroups in torsion-free hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <title>On gradient descent-ascent flows in metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient descent-ascent (GDA) flows play a central role in finding saddle points of bivariate functionals, with applications in optimization, game theory, and robust control. While they are well-understood in Hilbert and Banach spaces via maximal monotone operator theory, their extension to general metric spaces, particularly Wasserstein spaces, has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory of GDA flows on the product of two complete metric spaces, formulating them as solutions to a system of evolution variational inequalities (EVIs) driven by a proper, closed functional $\phi$. Under mild convex-concave and regularity assumptions on $\phi$, we prove the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the flows via a novel minimizing-maximizing movement scheme and a minimax theorem on metric spaces. We establish a $\lambda$-contraction property, derive a quantitative error estimate for the discrete scheme, and demonstrate regularization effects analogous to classical gradient flows. Moreover, we obtain an exponential decay bound for the Nikaid\^o--Isoda duality gap along the flow. Focusing on Wasserstein spaces over Hilbert spaces, we show the global existence in time and the exponential convergence of the Wasserstein GDA flow to the unique saddle point for strongly convex-concave functionals. Our framework unifies and extends existing analyses, offering a metric-geometric perspective on GDA dynamics in nonlinear and non-smooth settings.</description>

      <title>Generalized existence of extremizers for the sharp $p$-Sobolev inequality on Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized existence of extremizers for the sharp $p$-Sobolev inequality on noncompact Riemannian manifolds in connection with nonnegative curvature and Euclidean volume growth assumptions. Assuming a nonnegative Ricci curvature lower bound, we show that almost extremal functions are close in gradient norm to radial Euclidean bubbles. In the case of nonnegative sectional curvature lower bounds, we additionally deduce that vanishing is the only possible behavior, in the sense that almost extremal functions are almost zero globally. Our arguments rely on nonsmooth concentration compactness methods and Mosco-convergence results for the Cheeger energy on noncompact varying spaces, generalized to every exponent $p\in (1,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Positive mass and isoperimetry for continuous metrics with nonnegative scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with quasi-local isoperimetric versions of the positive mass theorem on $3$-manifolds endowed with continuous complete metrics having nonnegative scalar curvature in a suitable weak sense. As a corollary, we derive existence results for isoperimetric sets in such low regularity setting. Our main tool is a new local version of the weak inverse mean curvature flow enjoying $C^0$-stable quantitative estimates.</description>

      <title>On the Packing Functions of some Linear Sets of Lebesgue Measure Zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a characterization of Minkowski measurability to study the asymptotics of best packing on cut-out subsets of the real line with Minkowski dimension $d\in(0,1)$. Our main result is a proof that Minkowski measurability is a sufficient condition for the existence of best packing asymptotics on monotone rearrangements of these sets. For each such set, the main result provides an explicit constant of proportionality $p_d,$ depending only on the Minkowski dimension $d,$ that relates its packing limit and Minkowski content. We later use the Digamma function to study the limiting value of $p_d$ as $d\to 1^-.$ For sharpness, we use renewal theory to prove that the packing constant of the $(1/2,1/3)$ Cantor set is less than the product of its Minkowski content and $p_d$. We also show that the measurability hypothesis of the main theorem is necessary by demonstrating that a monotone rearrangement of the complementary intervals of the 1/3 Cantor set has Minkowski dimension $d=\log2/\log3\in(0,1),$ is not Minkowski measurable, and does not have convergent first-order packing asymptotics. The aforementioned characterization of Minkowski measurability further motivates the asymptotic study of an infinite multiple subset sum problem.</description>

      <title>On Mahler's conjecture for even s-concave functions in dimensions 1 and 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish different sharp forms of Mahler's conjecture for $s$-concave even functions in dimensions $n$, for $n=1$ and $2$, for $s&gt;-1/n$, thus generalizing our previous results in \cite{FN} on log-concave even functions in dimension 2, which corresponds to the case $s=0$. The functional volume product of an even $s$-concave function $g$ is \[ \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}g(x)dx\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\mathcal{L}_{s}g(y)dy, \] where $\mathcal{L}_{s}g$ is the $s$-polar function associated to $g$. The analogue of Mahler's conjecture for even $s$-concave functions postulates that this quantity is minimized for the indicatrix of a cube for any $s&gt;-1/n$. In dimension $n=1$, we prove this conjecture for all $s\in(-1,0)$ (the case $s\ge0$ was established by the first author and Mathieu Meyer in \cite[page 17]{FM10}). In dimension $n=2$, we only consider the case $1/s\in\mathbb{Z}$: for $s&gt;0$, we establish Mahler's conjecture for general $s$-concave even functions; for $s&lt;0$, the situation is more involved, we only prove a sharp inequality for $s$-concave functions $g$ such that $g^s$ admits an asymptote in every direction. Notice that this set of functions is quite natural to consider, when $s&lt;0$, since it is the largest subset of $s$-concave functions stable by $s$-duality.</description>
