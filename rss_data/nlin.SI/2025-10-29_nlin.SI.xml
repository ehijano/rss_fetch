      <title>Symmetry Approach to Integration of Ordinary Differential Equations with Retarded Argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review studies on the application of Lie group methods to delay ordinary differential equations (DODEs). For first- and second-order DODEs with a single delay parameter that depends on independent and dependent variables, the group classifications are performed. Classes of invariant DODEs for each Lie subgroup are written out. The symmetries allow us to construct invariant solutions to such equations. The application of variational methods to functionals with one delay yields DODEs with two delays. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches are reviewed. The delay analog of the Legendre transformation, which relates the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches, is also analysed. Noether-type operator identities relate the invariance of delay functionals with the appropriate variational equations and their conserved quantities. These identities are used to formulate Noether-type theorems that give first integrals of second-order DODEs with symmetries. Finally, several open problems are formulated in the Conclusion.</description>

      <title>On existence and properties of roots of third Painlev\'e' transcendents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Separate consideration of properties of roots of Third Painlev\'e transcendents (P_III-functions) is necessary due to irregularity the differential equation defining them reveals on the subset of the phase space where its solution would vanish. Application of the Hamiltonian formalism enables one to replace the mentioned second order differential equation (Third Painlev\'e equation) by two independent systems of two nonlinear first order equations whose structures allow to name them coupled Riccati equations. The existence of P_III-functions vanishing at a given non-zero point then follows, all they being analytic thereat. The set $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{C}$ (or $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{R}$) can be used for their indexing. It proves also to be natural to use as an unknown the third order derivative rather than the original nknown itself. After transformation of the corresponding differential equations to equivalent integral equations the efficient algorithm of the constructing of approximate solutions to Third Painlev\'e equation in vicinity of their non-zero root in the form of truncated power series is obtained. An example of its application is given, its numerical validation presenting results in a graphical form is carried out. The associated approximation applicable in vicinity of a pole of the corresponding P_III-function is given as well. The bounds from below for the distances between a pair of roots of a P_III-function and between a root and a pole representable in terms of elementary functions are derived.</description>
