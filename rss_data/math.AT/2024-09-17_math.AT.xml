      <title>Ring operads and symmetric bimonoidal categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the classical operad pair theory to a new model for $E_\infty$ ring spaces, which we call ring operad theory, and establish a connection with the classical operad pair theory, allowing the classical multiplicative infinite loop machine to be applied to algebras over any $E_\infty$ ring operad. As an application, we show that classifying spaces of symmetric bimonoidal categories are directly homeomorphic to certain $E_\infty$ ring spaces in the ring operad sense. Consequently, this provides an alternative construction from symmetric bimonoidal categories to classical $E_\infty$ ring spaces. We also present a comparison between this construction and the classical approach.</description>

      <title>Preludes to the Eilenberg-Moore and the Leray-Serre spectral sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.10209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Leray-Serre and the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequences are fundamental tools for computing the cohomology of a group or, more generally, of a space. We describe the relationship between these two spectral sequences when both of them share the same abutment. There exists a joint tri-graded refinement of the Leray--Serre and the Eilenberg--Moore spectral sequence. This refinement involves two more spectral sequences, the preludes from the title, which abut to the initial terms of the Leray--Serre and the Eilenberg--Moore spectral sequence, respectively. We show that one of these always degenerates from its second page on and that the other one satisfies a local-to-global property: It degenerates for all possible base spaces if and only if it does so when the base space is contractible.</description>

      <title>Homotopy theoretic properties of open books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.07063v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the homotopy groups of open books in terms of those of their pages and bindings. Under homotopy theoretic conditions on the monodromy we prove an integral decomposition result for the based loop space on an open book, and under more relaxed conditions prove a rational loop space decomposition. The latter case allows for a rational dichotomy theorem for open books, as an extension of the classical dichotomy in rational homotopy theory. As a direct application, we show that for Milnor's open book decomposition of an odd sphere with monodromy of finite order the induced action of the monodromy on the homology groups of its page cannot be nilpotent.</description>

      <title>Vector bundle automorphisms preserving Morse-Bott foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and $\mathcal{F}$ a Morse-Bott foliation on $M$ with a compact critical manifold $\Sigma$. Denote by $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})$ the group of diffeomorphisms of $M$ leaving invariant each leaf of $\mathcal{F}$. Under certain assumptions on $\mathcal{F}$ it is shown that the computation of the homotopy type of $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})$ reduces to three rather independent groups: the group of diffeomorphisms of $\Sigma$, the group of vector bundle automorphisms of some regular neighborhood of $\Sigma$, and the subgroup of $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})$ consisting of diffeomorphisms fixed near $\Sigma$. Examples of computations of homotopy types of groups $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})$ for such foliations are also presented.</description>

      <title>Beyond Signal and Noise: Unraveling Scale Invariance in Neuroscience and Financial Networks with Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is increasingly crucial in investigating the shape of complex data structures across scientific fields, particularly in neuroscience and finance. This study delves into persistent homology, a TDA component initially aimed at differentiating between signal and noise. We explore two methodologies: the conventional cycle length approach and the novel death-birth ratio method proposed by Bobrowski and Skraba. Analyzing rs-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project and daily $S\&amp;P 500$ financial networks, our study compares these methods in identifying significant cycles. A key discovery is a robust relationship between z-score thresholds applied to bar lengths or ratios and behavioural traits in brain networks and market volatility in financial networks. In the brain, this is evident in the strong correlation between significant 1-cycles, brain volumes, and sex-based differences. In financial markets, a fractal pattern emerges, where market volatility negatively correlates with the number of significant cycles, indicating that more complex market topologies are associated with increased stability. Our findings also imply a fractal nature of 1-cycles at both population levels and across multiple days in the stock market. The distribution of significant loops, marked by high z-scores, remains consistent across various z-score thresholds, revealing a scale-invariant, fractal structure in both data sets. Given the scale invariance in these fractal structures, the traditional TDA distinction between signal and noise becomes less meaningful. This suggests that all scales of cycle length are relevant, challenging the conventional approach of segregating signal from noise and broadening the scope of TDA to reveal intricate, scale-invariant relationships in complex systems.</description>
