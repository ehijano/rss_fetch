      <title>MPXGAT: An Attention based Deep Learning Model for Multiplex Graphs Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning has rapidly emerged as a pivotal field of study. Despite its growing popularity, the majority of research has been confined to embedding single-layer graphs, which fall short in representing complex systems with multifaceted relationships. To bridge this gap, we introduce MPXGAT, an innovative attention-based deep learning model tailored to multiplex graph embedding. Leveraging the robustness of Graph Attention Networks (GATs), MPXGAT captures the structure of multiplex networks by harnessing both intra-layer and inter-layer connections. This exploitation facilitates accurate link prediction within and across the network's multiple layers. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation, conducted on various benchmark datasets, confirms that MPXGAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art competing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Conditional Separation as a Binary Relation. A Coq Assisted Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.03018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of d-separation holds a pivotal role in causality theory, serving  as a fundamental tool for deriving conditional independence properties from  causal graphs. Pearl defined the d-separation of two subsets conditionally on  a third one. In this study, we present a novel perspective by showing  i) how the d-separation can be extended beyond acyclic graphs,  possibly infinite, and ii) how it can be  expressed and characterized as a binary relation between vertices. Compared  to the typical perspectives in causality theory, our equivalence opens the  door to more compact and computational proofing techniques, because the  language of binary relations is well adapted to equational reasoning.  Additionally, and of independent interest, the proofs  of the results presented in this paper are checked with the Coq proof  assistant.</description>

      <title>Tightest Admissible Shortest Path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shortest path problem in graphs is fundamental to AI. Nearly all variants of the problem and relevant algorithms that solve them ignore edge-weight computation time and its common relation to weight uncertainty. This implies that taking these factors into consideration can potentially lead to a performance boost in relevant applications. Recently, a generalized framework for weighted directed graphs was suggested, where edge-weight can be computed (estimated) multiple times, at increasing accuracy and run-time expense. We build on this framework to introduce the problem of finding the tightest admissible shortest path (TASP); a path with the tightest suboptimality bound on the optimal cost. This is a generalization of the shortest path problem to bounded uncertainty, where edge-weight uncertainty can be traded for computational cost. We present a complete algorithm for solving TASP, with guarantees on solution quality. Empirical evaluation supports the effectiveness of this approach.</description>

      <title>Effective equation solving, constraints and growth in virtually abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the satisfiability and solutions of group equations when combinatorial, algebraic and language-theoretic constraints are imposed on the solutions. We show that the solutions to equations with length, lexicographic order, abelianisation or context-free constraints added, can be effectively produced in finitely generated virtually abelian groups. Crucially, we translate each of the constraints above into a rational set in an effective way, and so reduce each problem to solving equations with rational constraints, which is decidable and well understood in virtually abelian groups. A byproduct of our results is that the growth series of a virtually abelian group, with respect to any generating set and any weight, is effectively computable. This series is known to be rational by a result of Benson, but his proof is non-constructive.</description>
