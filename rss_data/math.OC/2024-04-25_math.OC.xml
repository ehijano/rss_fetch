      <title>Dynamically Iterated Filters: A unified framework for improved iterated filtering and smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical iterated filters, such as the iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF), iterated unscented Kalman filter (IUKF), and iterated posterior linearization filter (IPLF), have been developed to improve the linearization point (or density) of the likelihood linearization in the well-known extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF). A shortcoming of typical iterated filters is that they do not treat the linearization of the transition model of the system. To remedy this shortcoming, we introduce dynamically iterated filters (DIFs), a unified framework for iterated linearization-based nonlinear filters that deals with nonlinearities in both the transition model and the likelihood, thereby constituting a generalization of the aforementioned iterated filters. We further establish a relationship between the general DIF and the approximate iterated Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. This relationship allows for a Gauss-Newton interpretation, which in turn enables explicit step-size correction, leading to damped versions of the DIFs. The developed algorithms, both damped and non-damped, are numerically demonstrated in three examples, showing superior mean-squared error as well as improved parameter tuning robustness as compared to the analogous standard iterated filters.</description>

      <title>Air-taxi trajectory optimization with aerodynamic and motor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many air-taxi concepts are capable of vertical takeoff and landing, enabling them to fly to and from urban locations. An important capability for these air taxis is the transition between hover and forward flight. We propose a robust methodology for computing optimal takeoff and transition trajectories using surrogate models trained on data from physics-based models. The use of surrogate models reduces the computational complexity and improves the robustness of the trajectory optimization algorithm. We demonstrate the versatility and robustness of the proposed methodology by applying it to 12 trajectory optimization problems that involve air-taxi takeoff and outbound transition. These trajectories are representative of real air-taxi operations, with a variety of constraints derived, in part, from proposed mission requirements.</description>

      <title>A note on the generalised Hessian of the least squares associated with systems of linear inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to point out an erroneous formula for the generalised Hessian of the least squares associated with a system of linear inequalities, that was given in the paper "A finite Newton method for classification" by O.L. Mangasarian (Optim. Methods Softw. 17: 913--929, 2002) and reproduced multiple times in other publications. We also provide sufficient contiditions for the validity of Mangasarian's formula and show that Slater's condition guarantees that some particular elements from the set defined by Mangasarian belong to the generalised Hessian of the corresponding function.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Exchangeable Stochastic Dynamic Teams in Continuous-time, their Mean-Field Limits and Optimality of Symmetric Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of stochastic exchangeable teams comprising a finite number of decision makers (DMs) as well as their mean-field limits involving infinite numbers of DMs. In the finite population regime, we study exchangeable teams under the centralized information structure. For the infinite population setting, we study exchangeable teams under the decentralized mean-field information sharing. The paper makes the following main contributions: i) For finite population exchangeable teams, we establish the existence of a randomized optimal policy that is exchangeable (permutation invariant) and Markovian; ii) As our main result in the paper, we show that a sequence of exchangeable optimal policies for finite population settings converges to a conditionally symmetric (identical), independent, and decentralized randomized policy for the infinite population problem, which is globally optimal for the infinite population problem. This result establishes the existence of a symmetric, independent, decentralized optimal randomized policy for the infinite population problem. Additionally, this proves the optimality of the limiting measure-valued MDP for the representative DM; iii) Finally, we show that symmetric, independent, decentralized optimal randomized policies are approximately optimal for the corresponding finite-population team with a large number of DMs under the centralized information structure. Our paper thus establishes the relation between the controlled McKean-Vlasov dynamics and the optimal infinite population decentralized stochastic control problem (without an apriori restriction of symmetry in policies of individual agents), for the first time, to our knowledge.</description>

      <title>Observer-Based Realization of Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lebesgue-type of dynamic control systems and dimension-keeping semi-tensor product (DK-STP) of matrices are introduced. Using bridge matrices, the DK-STP is used to construct approximated observer-based realization (OR) of linear control systems, as Lebesgue-type control systems, are proposed. A necessary and sufficient condition for the OR-system to have exactly same observer dynamics is obtained. When the exact OR-system does not exist, the extended OR-system, which contains observers of the original system as part of its state variables, is presented. Moreover, the (minimum) feedback (extended) OR-system is also constructed, and its relationship with Kalman's minimum realization is revealed. Finally, the technique developed for linear control systems has been extended to affine nonlinear control systems. The purpose of OR-system is to provide a new technique to deal with large scale complex systems.</description>

      <title>Stability and Bounded Real Lemmas of Discrete-Time MJLSs with the Markov Chain on a Borel Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, exponential stability of discrete-time Markov jump linear systems (MJLSs) with the Markov chain on a Borel space $(\Theta, \mathcal{B}(\Theta))$ is studied, and bounded real lemmas (BRLs) are given. The work generalizes the results from the previous literature that considered only the Markov chain taking values in a countable set to the scenario of an uncountable set and provides unified approaches for describing exponential stability and $H_{\infty}$ performance of MJLSs. This paper covers two kinds of exponential stabilities: one is exponential mean-square stability with conditioning (EMSSy-C), and the other is exponential mean-square stability (EMSSy). First, based on the infinite-dimensional operator theory, the equivalent conditions for determining these two kinds of stabilities are shown respectively by the exponentially stable evolutions generated by the corresponding bounded linear operators on different Banach spaces, which turn out to present the spectral criteria of EMSSy-C and EMSSy. Furthermore, the relationship between these two kinds of stabilities is discussed. Moreover, some easier-to-check criteria are established for EMSSy-C of MJLSs in terms of the existence of uniformly positive definite solutions of Lyapunov-type equations or inequalities. In addition, BRLs are given separately in terms of the existence of solutions of the $\Theta$-coupled difference Riccati equation for the finite horizon case and algebraic Riccati equation for the infinite horizon case, which facilitates the $H_{\infty}$ analysis of MJLSs with the Markov chain on a Borel space.</description>

      <title>Robust Phase Retrieval by Alternating Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a least absolute deviation (LAD) approach to the robust phase retrieval problem that aims to recover a signal from its absolute measurements corrupted with sparse noise. To solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we propose a robust alternating minimization (Robust-AM) derived as an unconstrained Gauss-Newton method. To solve the inner optimization arising in each step of Robust-AM, we adopt two computationally efficient methods for linear programs. We provide a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of these practical algorithms for Robust-AM under the standard Gaussian measurement assumption. These algorithms, when suitably initialized, are guaranteed to converge linearly to the ground truth at an order-optimal sample complexity with high probability while the support of sparse noise is arbitrarily fixed and the sparsity level is no larger than $1/4$. Additionally, through comprehensive numerical experiments on synthetic and image datasets, we show that Robust-AM outperforms existing methods for robust phase retrieval offering comparable theoretical performance</description>

      <title>Modular Forms in Combinatorial Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP), find applications across various domains including logistics, genome sequencing, and robotics. Despite their extensive applications, there have not been significant advancements in deriving optimal solutions for these problems. The lack of theoretical understanding owing to the complex structure of these problems has hindered the development of sophisticated algorithms. This paper proposes an unconventional approach by translating the ATSP into the complex domain, revealing an intrinsic modular nature of the problem. Furthermore, we have exploited modularity conditions to gain deeper insights into both unconstrained and constrained optimal solutions. The theoretical framework laid out in this paper can lead to important results at the intersection of combinatorial optimization and number theory.</description>

      <title>DPO: Differential reinforcement learning with application to optimal configuration search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with continuous state and action spaces remains one of the most challenging problems within the field. Most current learning methods focus on integral identities such as value functions to derive an optimal strategy for the learning agent. In this paper, we instead study the dual form of the original RL formulation to propose the first differential RL framework that can handle settings with limited training samples and short-length episodes. Our approach introduces Differential Policy Optimization (DPO), a pointwise and stage-wise iteration method that optimizes policies encoded by local-movement operators. We prove a pointwise convergence estimate for DPO and provide a regret bound comparable with current theoretical works. Such pointwise estimate ensures that the learned policy matches the optimal path uniformly across different steps. We then apply DPO to a class of practical RL problems which search for optimal configurations with Lagrangian rewards. DPO is easy to implement, scalable, and shows competitive results on benchmarking experiments against several popular RL methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Experimental Design for Large-Scale Inverse Problems via Multi-PDE-constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate parameter dependent electro-chemical numerical models for lithium-ion batteries are essential in industrial application. The exact parameters of each battery cell are unknown and a process of estimation is necessary to infer them. The parameter estimation generates an accurate model able to reproduce real cell data. The field of optimal input/experimental design deals with creating the experimental settings facilitating the estimation problem. Here we apply two different input design algorithms that aim at maximizing the observability of the true, unknown parameters: in the first algorithm, we design the applied current and the starting voltage. This lets the algorithm collect information on different states of charge, but requires long experimental times (60 000 s). In the second algorithm, we generate a continuous current, composed of concatenated optimal intervals. In this case, the experimental time is shorter (7000 s) and numerical experiments with virtual data give an even better accuracy results, but experiments with real battery data reveal that the accuracy could decrease hundredfold. As the design algorithms are built independent of the model, the same results and motivation are applicable to more complex battery cell models and, moreover, to other applications.</description>

      <title>Internal and String Stability of an Observer-based Controller for Vehicle Platooning under the MPF Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.09497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the internal stability and string stability of a vehicle platoon under the constant time headway spacing (CTHS) policy and the multiple-predecessor-following (MPF) vehicle-to-vehicle information flow topology. More specifically, we depart from the conventional Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller design for such systems and we propose the design of an observer-based controller. For designing our observer-based controller, we first design a distributed observer, with which each follower estimates their position, speed and acceleration error with respect to the leader. The observer is designed by means of constructing an observer matrix whose parameters should be determined. Next, we simplify the design of the matrix of the observer in such a way that the design boils down to choosing a single scalar value; this design further simplifies the structure of the controller, whose simplicity enables the derivation of string stability conditions by means of a frequency response method. Subsequently, the string stability conditions for a given time headway, are transformed to conditions for the controller parameters. We obtain controller parameters that satisfy the stability conditions by designing a novel heuristic search algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the search algorithm by incorporating a bisection-like algorithm, which allows to obtain (within some deviation tolerance) the minimum available value of the time headway. Finally, we provide insights about how to finalize the observer-based controller parameters from above algorithms to avoid the peaking phenomenon. The performance of the proposed observer-based controller is demonstrated via illustrative examples. Additionally, a comparison with a widely-used PID controller for MPF topology shows that our proposed observer-based controller has better convergence performance.</description>

      <title>Input Regularization for Integer Optimal Control in BV with Applications to Control of Poroelastic and Poroviscoelastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09564v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit a class of integer optimal control problems for which a trust-region method has been proposed and analyzed in arXiv:2106.13453v3 [math.OC]. While the algorithm proposed in arXiv:2106.13453v3 [math.OC] successfully solves the class of optimization problems under consideration, its convergence analysis requires restrictive regularity assumptions. There are many examples of integer optimal control problems involving partial differential equations where these regularity assumptions are not satisfied. In this article we provide a way to bypass the restrictive regularity assumptions by introducing an additional partial regularization of the control inputs by means of mollification and proving a $\Gamma$-convergence-type result when the support parameter of the mollification is driven to zero. We highlight the applicability of this theory in the case of fluid flows through deformable porous media equations that arise in biomechanics. We show that the regularity assumptions are violated in the case of poro-visco-elastic systems, and thus one needs to use the regularization of the control input introduced in this article. Associated numerical results show that while the homotopy can help to find better objective values and points of lower instationarity, the practical performance of the algorithm without the input regularization may be on par with the homotopy.</description>

      <title>Safe Zeroth-Order Optimization Using Quadratic Local Approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16659v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses black-box smooth optimization problems, where the objective and constraint functions are not explicitly known but can be queried. The main goal of this work is to generate a sequence of feasible points converging towards a KKT primal-dual pair. Assuming to have prior knowledge on the smoothness of the unknown objective and constraints, we propose a novel zeroth-order method that iteratively computes quadratic approximations of the constraint functions, constructs local feasible sets and optimizes over them. Under some mild assumptions, we prove that this method returns an $\eta$-KKT pair (a property reflecting how close a primal-dual pair is to the exact KKT condition) within $O({1}/{\eta^{2}})$ iterations. Moreover, we numerically show that our method can achieve faster convergence compared with some state-of-the-art zeroth-order approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is also illustrated by applying it to nonconvex optimization problems in optimal control and power system operation.</description>

      <title>The alternating simultaneous Halpern-Lions-Wittmann-Bauschke algorithm for finding the best approximation pair for two disjoint intersections of convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two nonempty and disjoint intersections of closed and convex subsets, we look for a best approximation pair relative to them, i.e., a pair of points, one in each intersection, attaining the minimum distance between the disjoint intersections. We propose an iterative process based on projections onto the subsets which generate the intersections. The process is inspired by the Halpern-Lions-Wittmann-Bauschke algorithm and the classical alternating process of Cheney and Goldstein, and its advantage is that there is no need to project onto the intersections themselves, a task which can be rather demanding. We prove that under certain conditions the two interlaced subsequences converge to a best approximation pair. These conditions hold, in particular, when the space is Euclidean and the subsets which generate the intersections are compact and strictly convex. Our result extends the one of Aharoni, Censor and Jiang ["Finding a best approximation pair of points for two polyhedra", Computational Optimization and Applications 71 (2018), 509--523] who considered the case of finite-dimensional polyhedra.</description>

      <title>On stability and state-norm estimation of switched systems under restricted switching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the analysis of input/output-to-state stability (IOSS) and construction of state-norm estimators for continuous-time switched nonlinear systems under restricted switching. Our contributions are twofold. First, given a family of systems, possibly containing unstable dynamics, a set of admissible switches between the subsystems and admissible minimum and maximum dwell times on the subsystems, we identify a class of switching signals that obeys the given restrictions and preserves IOSS of the resulting switched system. Second, we design a class of state-norm estimators for switched systems under our class of stabilizing switching signals. These estimators are switched systems themselves with two subsystems -- one stable and one unstable. The key apparatus for our analysis is multiple Lyapunov-like functions. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the results.</description>

      <title>Projection-based Prediction-Correction Method for Distributed Consensus Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the realm of industrial technology, optimization methods play a pivotal role and are extensively applied across various sectors, including transportation engineering, robotics, and machine learning. With the surge in data volumes, there is an increasing demand for solving large-scale problems, which in turn has spurred the development of distributed optimization methods. These methods rely on the collaborative efforts of numerous dispersed devices to achieve the collective goals of the system. This study focuses on the exploration of distributed consensus optimization problems with convex set constraints within networks. The paper introduces a novel Adaptive Projection Prediction-Correction Method (PPCM), inspired by the proximal point algorithm and incorporating the theory of variational inequalities. As a contraction algorithm with notable convergence performance, PPCM is particularly suited for decentralized network environments. Moreover, the selection of parameters for this method is both straightforward and intuitive, avoiding the complexities of intricate parameter tuning. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and empirical testing have validated the effectiveness of PPCM. When applied to problems such as distributed linear least squares, logistic regression, and support vector machines, PPCM demonstrates superior performance, achieving computation speeds over ten times faster than built-in Python functions while maintaining high precision. In conclusion, this research provides a valuable distributed consensus optimization technique, both theoretically and practically.</description>

      <title>Distributed online constrained convex optimization with event-triggered communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the distributed online convex optimization problem with time-varying inequality constraints over a network of agents, where each agent collaborates with its neighboring agents to minimize the cumulative network-wide loss over time. To reduce communication overhead between the agents, we propose a distributed event-triggered online primal-dual algorithm over a time-varying directed graph. With several classes of appropriately chose decreasing parameter sequences and non-increasing event-triggered threshold sequences, we establish dynamic network regret and network cumulative constraint violation bounds. Finally, a numerical simulation example is provided to verify the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A new dual spectral projected gradient method for log-determinant semidefinite programming with hidden clustering structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new efficient method for a sparse Gaussian graphical model with hidden clustering structures by extending a dual spectral projected gradient (DSPG) method proposed by Nakagaki et al.~(2020). We establish the global convergence of the proposed method to an optimal solution, and we show that the projection onto the feasible region can be solved with a low computational complexity by the use of the pool-adjacent-violators algorithm. Numerical experiments on synthesis data and real data demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. The proposed method takes 0.91 seconds to achieve a similar solution to the direct application of the DSPG method which takes 4361 seconds.</description>

      <title>Optimal Acceleration for Minimax and Fixed-Point Problems is Not Unique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, accelerated algorithms using the anchoring mechanism for minimax optimization and fixed-point problems have been proposed, and matching complexity lower bounds establish their optimality. In this work, we present the surprising observation that the optimal acceleration mechanism in minimax optimization and fixed-point problems is not unique. Our new algorithms achieve exactly the same worst-case convergence rates as existing anchor-based methods while using materially different acceleration mechanisms. Specifically, these new algorithms are dual to the prior anchor-based accelerated methods in the sense of H-duality. This finding opens a new avenue of research on accelerated algorithms since we now have a family of methods that empirically exhibit varied characteristics while having the same optimal worst-case guarantee.</description>

      <title>Controlgym: Large-Scale Control Environments for Benchmarking Reinforcement Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce controlgym, a library of thirty-six industrial control settings, and ten infinite-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE)-based control problems. Integrated within the OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium (Gym) framework, controlgym allows direct applications of standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like stable-baselines3. Our control environments complement those in Gym with continuous, unbounded action and observation spaces, motivated by real-world control applications. Moreover, the PDE control environments uniquely allow the users to extend the state dimensionality of the system to infinity while preserving the intrinsic dynamics. This feature is crucial for evaluating the scalability of RL algorithms for control. This project serves the learning for dynamics &amp; control (L4DC) community, aiming to explore key questions: the convergence of RL algorithms in learning control policies; the stability and robustness issues of learning-based controllers; and the scalability of RL algorithms to high- and potentially infinite-dimensional systems. We open-source the controlgym project at https://github.com/xiangyuan-zhang/controlgym.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Solution Operator Learning for Mean-Field Games via Sampling-Invariant Parametrizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning has witnessed many innovative frameworks that solve high dimensional mean-field games (MFG) accurately and efficiently. These methods, however, are restricted to solving single-instance MFG and demands extensive computational time per instance, limiting practicality. To overcome this, we develop a novel framework to learn the MFG solution operator. Our model takes a MFG instances as input and output their solutions with one forward pass. To ensure the proposed parametrization is well-suited for operator learning, we introduce and prove the notion of sampling invariance for our model, establishing its convergence to a continuous operator in the sampling limit. Our method features two key advantages. First, it is discretization-free, making it particularly suitable for learning operators of high-dimensional MFGs. Secondly, it can be trained without the need for access to supervised labels, significantly reducing the computational overhead associated with creating training datasets in existing operator learning methods. We test our framework on synthetic and realistic datasets with varying complexity and dimensionality to substantiate its robustness.</description>

      <title>Risk-Calibrated Human-Robot Interaction via Set-Valued Intent Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tasks where robots must anticipate human intent, such as navigating around a cluttered home or sorting everyday items, are challenging because they exhibit a wide range of valid actions that lead to similar outcomes. Moreover, zero-shot cooperation between human-robot partners is an especially challenging problem because it requires the robot to infer and adapt on the fly to a latent human intent, which could vary significantly from human to human. Recently, deep learned motion prediction models have shown promising results in predicting human intent but are prone to being confidently incorrect. In this work, we present Risk-Calibrated Interactive Planning (RCIP), which is a framework for measuring and calibrating risk associated with uncertain action selection in human-robot cooperation, with the fundamental idea that the robot should ask for human clarification when the risk associated with the uncertainty in the human's intent cannot be controlled. RCIP builds on the theory of set-valued risk calibration to provide a finite-sample statistical guarantee on the cumulative loss incurred by the robot while minimizing the cost of human clarification in complex multi-step settings. Our main insight is to frame the risk control problem as a sequence-level multi-hypothesis testing problem, allowing efficient calibration using a low-dimensional parameter that controls a pre-trained risk-aware policy. Experiments across a variety of simulated and real-world environments demonstrate RCIP's ability to predict and adapt to a diverse set of dynamic human intents.</description>

      <title>Prelimit Coupling and Steady-State Convergence of Constant-stepsize Nonsmooth Contractive SA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Q-learning, we study nonsmooth contractive stochastic approximation (SA) with constant stepsize. We focus on two important classes of dynamics: 1) nonsmooth contractive SA with additive noise, and 2) synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning, which features both additive and multiplicative noise. For both dynamics, we establish weak convergence of the iterates to a stationary limit distribution in Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, we propose a prelimit coupling technique for establishing steady-state convergence and characterize the limit of the stationary distribution as the stepsize goes to zero. Using this result, we derive that the asymptotic bias of nonsmooth SA is proportional to the square root of the stepsize, which stands in sharp contrast to smooth SA. This bias characterization allows for the use of Richardson-Romberg extrapolation for bias reduction in nonsmooth SA.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Weighted Moving Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exponentially weighted moving model (EWMM) for a vector time series fits a new data model each time period, based on an exponentially fading loss function on past observed data. The well known and widely used exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) is a special case that estimates the mean using a square loss function. For quadratic loss functions EWMMs can be fit using a simple recursion that updates the parameters of a quadratic function. For other loss functions, the entire past history must be stored, and the fitting problem grows in size as time increases. We propose a general method for computing an approximation of EWMM, which requires storing only a window of a fixed number of past samples, and uses an additional quadratic term to approximate the loss associated with the data before the window. This approximate EWMM relies on convex optimization, and solves problems that do not grow with time. We compare the estimates produced by our approximation with the estimates from the exact EWMM method.</description>
