      <title>Beyond Sequence: Impact of Geometric Context for RNA Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of RNA properties, such as stability and interactions, is crucial for advancing our understanding of biological processes and developing RNA-based therapeutics. RNA structures can be represented as 1D sequences, 2D topological graphs, or 3D all-atom models, each offering different insights into its function. Existing works predominantly focus on 1D sequence-based models, which overlook the geometric context provided by 2D and 3D geometries. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of incorporating explicit 2D and 3D geometric information into RNA property prediction, considering not only performance but also real-world challenges such as limited data availability, partial labeling, sequencing noise, and computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce a newly curated set of RNA datasets with enhanced 2D and 3D structural annotations, providing a resource for model evaluation on RNA data. Our findings reveal that models with explicit geometry encoding generally outperform sequence-based models, with an average prediction RMSE reduction of around 12% across all various RNA tasks and excelling in low-data and partial labeling regimes, underscoring the value of explicitly incorporating geometric context. On the other hand, geometry-unaware sequence-based models are more robust under sequencing noise but often require around 2-5x training data to match the performance of geometry-aware models. Our study offers further insights into the trade-offs between different RNA representations in practical applications and addresses a significant gap in evaluating deep learning models for RNA tasks.</description>

      <title>DeltaDock: A Unified Framework for Accurate, Efficient, and Physically Reliable Molecular Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular docking, a technique for predicting ligand binding poses, is crucial in structure-based drug design for understanding protein-ligand interactions. Recent advancements in docking methods, particularly those leveraging geometric deep learning (GDL), have demonstrated significant efficiency and accuracy advantages over traditional sampling methods. Despite these advancements, current methods are often tailored for specific docking settings, and limitations such as the neglect of protein side-chain structures, difficulties in handling large binding pockets, and challenges in predicting physically valid structures exist. To accommodate various docking settings and achieve accurate, efficient, and physically reliable docking, we propose a novel two-stage docking framework, DeltaDock, consisting of pocket prediction and site-specific docking. We innovatively reframe the pocket prediction task as a pocket-ligand alignment problem rather than direct prediction in the first stage. Then we follow a bi-level coarse-to-fine iterative refinement process to perform site-specific docking. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DeltaDock. Notably, in the blind docking setting, DeltaDock achieves a 31\% relative improvement over the docking success rate compared with the previous state-of-the-art GDL model. With the consideration of physical validity, this improvement increases to about 300\%.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Language Models Are Versatile Protein Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces diffusion protein language model (DPLM), a versatile protein language model that demonstrates strong generative and predictive capabilities for protein sequences. We first pre-train scalable DPLMs from evolutionary-scale protein sequences within a generative self-supervised discrete diffusion probabilistic framework, which generalizes language modeling for proteins in a principled way. After pre-training, DPLM exhibits the ability to generate structurally plausible, novel, and diverse protein sequences for unconditional generation. We further demonstrate the proposed diffusion generative pre-training makes DPLM possess a better understanding of proteins, making it a superior representation learner, which can be fine-tuned for various predictive tasks, comparing favorably to ESM2 (Lin et al., 2022). Moreover, DPLM can be tailored for various needs, which showcases its prowess of conditional generation in several ways: (1) conditioning on partial peptide sequences, e.g., generating scaffolds for functional motifs with high success rate; (2) incorporating other modalities as conditioner, e.g., structure-conditioned generation for inverse folding; and (3) steering sequence generation towards desired properties, e.g., satisfying specified secondary structures, through a plug-and-play classifier guidance.
