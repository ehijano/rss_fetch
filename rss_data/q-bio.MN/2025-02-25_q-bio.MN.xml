      <title>What is a chemostat? Insights from hybrid dynamics and stochastic thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the microscopic scale, open chemical reaction networks are described by stochastic reactions that follow mass-action kinetics and are coupled to chemostats. We show that closed chemical reaction networks -- with specific stoichiometries imposed by mass-action kinetics -- behave like open ones in the limit where the abundances of a subset of species become macroscopic, thus playing the role of chemostats. We prove that this limit is thermodynamically consistent by recovering the local detailed balance condition of open chemical reaction networks and deriving the proper expression of the entropy production rate. In particular, the entropy production rate features two contributions: one accounting for the dissipation of the stochastic reactions, the other for the dissipation of continuous reactions controlling the chemostats. Finally, we illustrate our results for two prototypical examples.</description>

      <title>Finding Influential Cores via Normalized Ricci Flows in Directed and Undirected Hypergraphs with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological and social systems are naturally represented as edge-weighted directed or undirected hypergraphs since they exhibit group interactions involving three or more system units as opposed to pairwise interactions that can be incorporated in graph-theoretic representations. However, finding influential cores in hypergraphs is still not as extensively studied as their graph-theoretic counter-parts. To this end, we develop and implement a hypergraph-curvature guided discrete time diffusion process with suitable topological surgeries and edge-weight re-normalization procedures for both undirected and directed weighted hypergraphs to find influential cores. We successfully apply our framework for directed hypergraphs to seven metabolic hypergraphs and our framework for undirected hypergraphs to two social (co-authorship) hypergraphs to find influential cores, thereby demonstrating the practical feasibility of our approach. In addition, we prove a theorem showing that a certain edge weight re-normalization procedure in a prior research work for Ricci flows for edge-weighted graphs has the undesirable outcome of modifying the edge-weights to negative numbers, thereby rendering the procedure impossible to use. To the best of our knowledge, this seems to be one of the first articles that formulates algorithmic approaches for finding core(s) of (weighted or unweighted) directed hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Complexity reduction by symmetry: uncovering the minimal regulatory network for logical computation in bacteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry principles play an important role in geometry, and physics, allowing for the reduction of complicated systems to simpler, more comprehensible models that preserve the system's features of interest. Biological systems are often highly complex and may consist of a large number of interacting parts. Using symmetry fibrations, the relevant symmetries for biological "message-passing" networks, we introduce a scheme, called Complexity Reduction by Symmetry or ComSym, to reduce the gene regulatory networks of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis bacteria to core networks in a way that preserves the dynamics and uncovers the computational capabilities of the network. Gene nodes in the original network that share isomorphic input trees are collapsed by the fibration into equivalence classes called fibers, whereby nodes that receive signals with the same "history" belong to one fiber and synchronize. Then we reduce the networks to its minimal computational core via k-core decomposition. This computational core consists of a few strongly connected components or "signal vortices", in which signals can cycle through. While between them, these "signal vortices" transmit signals in a feedforward manner. These connected components perform signal processing and decision making in the bacterial cell by employing a series of genetic toggle-switch circuits that store memory, plus oscillator circuits. These circuits act as the central computation device of the network, whose output signals then spread to the rest of the network. Our reduction method opens the door to narrow the vast complexity of biological systems to their minimal parts in a systematic way by using fundamental theoretical principles of symmetry.</description>
