      <title>Complex Chern-Simons Theory with $k=8\mathbb{N} and An Improved Spinfoam Model with Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an improvement to the four-dimensional spinfoam model with cosmological constant ($\Lambda$-SF model) in loop quantum gravity. The original $\Lambda$-SF model, defined via ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory on graph-complement 3-manifolds, produces finite amplitudes and reproduces curved 4-simplex geometries in the semi-classical limit. However, extending the model to general simplicial complexes necessitated ad hoc, non-universal phase factors in face amplitudes, complicating systematic constructions. We resolve this issue by redefining the vertex amplitude using a novel set of phase space coordinates that eliminate the extraneous phase factor, yielding a universally defined face amplitude. Key results include: (1) The vertex amplitude is rigorously shown to be well-defined for Chern-Simons levels $k \in 8\mathbb{N}$, compatible with semi-classical analysis ($k \to \infty$). (2) The symplectic structure of the Chern-Simons phase space is modified to accommodate ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ holonomies, relaxing quantization constraints to $\mathrm{Sp}(2r,\mathbb{Z}/4)$. (3) Edge amplitudes are simplified using constraints aligned with colored tensor models, enabling systematic gluing of 4-simplices into complexes dual to colored graphs. (4) Stationary phase analysis confirms consistency of critical points with prior work, recovering Regge geometries with curvature determined by $\Lambda$. These advancements streamline the spinfoam amplitude definition, facilitating future studies of colored group field theories and continuum limits of quantum gravity. The results establish a robust framework for 4D quantum gravity with non-zero $\Lambda$, free of previous ambiguities in face amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Reconstruction of Spinfoam Critical Points with A Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a geometrical reconstruction of the critical points of the spinfoam amplitude for a 4D Lorentzian model with a non-zero cosmological constant. By establishing the correspondence between the moduli space of ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ flat connections on the graph-complement 3-manifold $S^3\backslash \Gamma_5$ and the geometry of a constantly curved 4-simplex, we demonstrate how the critical points encode discrete curved geometries. The analysis extends to 4-complexes dual to colored graphs, aligning with the improved spinfoam model recently introduced. Central to this reconstruction are translating the geometry of constantly curved 4-simplices into Fock-Goncharov coordinates and spinors, which translate the geometry data into holonomies and symplectic structures, thereby defining the critical points of the spinfoam amplitude. This framework provides an algorithmic foundation for computing quantum gravity corrections and opens avenues for applications in quantum cosmology and black hole physics, where the cosmological constant plays a pivotal role.</description>

      <title>One-Dimensional Relativistic Self-Gravitating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the oldest problems in physics is that of calculating the motion of $N$ particles under a specified mutual force: the $N$-body problem. Much is known about this problem if the specified force is non-relativistic gravity, and considerable progress has been made by considering the problem in one spatial dimension. Here, I review what is known about the relativistic gravitational $N$-body problem. Reduction to one spatial dimension has the feature of the absence of gravitational radiation, thereby allowing for a clear comparison between the physics of one-dimensional relativistic and non-relativistic self-gravitating systems. After describing how to obtain a relativistic theory of gravity coupled to $N$ point particles, I discuss in turn the two-body, three-body, four-body, and $N$-body problems. Quite general exact solutions can be obtained for the two-body problem, unlike the situation in general relativity in three spatial dimensions for which only highly specified solutions exist. The three-body problem exhibits mild forms of chaos, and provides one of the first theoretical settings in which relativistic chaos can be studied. For $N\geq 4$, other interesting features emerge. Relativistic self-gravitating systems have a number of interesting problems awaiting further investigation, providing us with a new frontier for exploring relativistic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>The curious case of operators with spectral density increasing as $\Omega(E)\sim e^{\,\mathrm{Const.}\, E^2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a putative model of black holes as quantum objects we consider what types of operators would have a corresponding spectrum. We find that there are indeed such operators, but of a rather unusual types, and for which the wave functions are only barely localized. We point out a tension between such almost delocalized states and black holes as compact objects.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Fermionic Field Entanglement in Schwarzschild Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore entanglement harvesting using two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors linearly coupled to the scalar density
  of a massless spin-1/2 field in 1+1 Schwarzschild spacetime. We consider different vacua, including the Boulware, Hartle Hawking-Israel (HHI), and Unruh vacua, and investigate various configurations depending on the choice of 2-bein in the
  interaction Hamiltonian. We find that the transition rate of the static UDW detector exhibits the expected Planckian
  behavior in the HHI state, while the Unruh state leads to the Helmholtz free energy density of a bosonic or fermionic
  thermal bath corresponding to the static or conformal 2-bein respectively. Further, we observe that the anti-Hawking
  effect enhances the entanglement between the two detectors while the gravitational redshift and Hawking radiation
  decreases it. In particular, due to the presence of the anti-Hawking effect, the mutual information and concurrence
  near the event horizon can be non-zero even for static detectors with static 2-bein, which is in contrast with the case
  of scalar field. We also show that the near-horizon entanglement properties for static detectors in the HHI state have
  similar behaviour with those in Minkowski vacua for uniformly accelerated detectors in Rindler spacetime. Conclusions
  are discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic phase transition and Joule-Thomson expansion of a quantum corrected black hole in anti-de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamics in the extended phase space of a quantum corrected black hole (BH) proposed recently is presented in this work. Our study shows that the phase transition behavior of the BH is analogous to that of conventional Schwarzschild BH in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space; however, a critical temperature exists such that when the BH temperature exceeds this critical value, the small BH phase and the large BH phase become separated, and no phase transition occurs. Due to the introduction of the quantum parameter $\xi$, the BH equation of state splits into two branches. One branch reduces to the Schwarzschild-AdS case as $\xi\to0$, with its phase transition pressure lower than the critical pressure; another branch's phase transition pressure is greater than the critical pressure. We further investigate the temperature curve and the isobaric heat capacity of the BH. The results show that the $T-r_{+}$ phase transition and heat capacity behavior are very similar to those of the Schwarzschild-AdS BH, with the small BH phase exhibiting a negative heat capacity (unstable phase) and the large BH phase exhibiting a positive heat capacity (stable phase). Furthermore, owing to the corrected first law, the Gibbs free energy curve becomes smooth near the phase transition point. Moreover, we examine the Joule-Thomson expansion of the BH. The constant mass expansion process of the BH is divided into two stages: in the earlier stage, the BH pressure increases until it reaches a maximum; in the later stage, the pressure gradually decreases. Consequently, the inversion curve is also divided into two branches: one corresponding to the inversion point that may be experienced during the earlier stage and the other corresponding to the inversion point during the later stage. In addition, each expansion stage has a minimum inversion mass, below which any BH (in each respective stage) has no inversion point.</description>

      <title>A post-Newtonian approach to neutron star oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors are expected to constrain the properties of extreme density matter via observations of static and dynamical tides in binary neutron star inspirals. The required modelling is straightforward in Newtonian gravity -- where the tide can be represented in terms of a sum involving the star's oscillation modes -- but not yet fully developed in general relativity -- where the mode-sum approach is problematic. As a step towards more realistic models, we are motivated to explore the post-Newtonian (pN) approach to the problem (noting that the modes should still provide an adequate basis for a tidal expansion up to 2pN order). Specifically, in this paper we develop the pN framework for neutron star oscillations and explore to what extent the results remain robust for stars in the strong-field regime. Our numerical results show that the model is accurate for low-mass stars ($\lesssim 0.8M_{\odot}$), but becomes problematic for more massive stars. However, we demonstrate that the main issues can be resolved (at the cost of abandoning the consistency of the pN expansion) allowing us to extend the calculation into the neutron star regime. For canonical neutron stars ($\approx 1.4M_\odot$) our adjusted formulation provides the fundamental mode of the star with an accuracy comparable to that of the relativistic Cowling approximation. For lower mass stars, our approach is significantly better.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of a non-singular black hole model with effective quantum corrections motivated by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). The effective geometry has a transition surface that connects trapped and anti-trapped regions with the same mass. There is a minimum mass for which the horizon temperature and Komar energy are zero, and the black hole stops its Hawking evaporation. For horizons above this limit, we present the grey-body factors, emission spectra, and the mass loss rate, solving a one-dimensional Schrdinger-type equation with an effective short-range potential barrier for massless fields of spins 0, 1/2, 1 and 2.</description>

      <title>Bound and Scattering States in a Spacetime with Dual Topological Defects: Cosmic String and Global Monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the relativistic quantum motion of scalar bosons in the presence of mixed topological defects: cosmic strings and global monopoles. The Klein-Gordon equation with generalized Coulomb potentials is analyzed in this background. The effects of these topological defects on the equations of motion, phase shifts, and the S-matrix are examined in detail. Bound state solutions are derived from the poles of the S-matrix. We provide analytical expressions for the energy spectrum of bound states, with particular attention to how the parameters of scalar and vector potentials affect the behavior of the system. Furthermore, we explore particular cases involving pure scalar, vector, and mixed scalar-vector potentials, showing how these scenarios impose particular conditions on the existence of bound states. Our results indicate that the solutions obtained associated with scattering and bound states depend significantly on the parameters of the topological defects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in supersymmetric field theory is that supersymmetry transformations on field variables generally form an algebra only on-shell, i.e. upon imposing the field equations. We show that this issue is defused in a manifestly relational - and thus automatically invariant - formulation of supersymmetric field theory, achieved through the application of the Dressing Field Method of symmetry reduction, a systematic tool to exhibit the gauge-invariant content of general-relativistic gauge field theories.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Lunar Corner-Cube Retroreflectors: A Wave-Optics Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision corner-cube retroreflectors (CCRs) are critical for advanced lunar laser ranging (LLR) because they enable sub-millimeter-scale measurements of the Earth-Moon distance -- a level of precision essential for rigorous tests of relativistic gravitation and for advancing our understanding of lunar geophysics. In this work, we develop a comprehensive two-dimensional Fourier-optics model for single CCRs with apertures ranging from 80-110 mm. Our model incorporates realistic thermal-mechanical wavefront errors, detailed diffraction effects, and velocity aberration offsets. Our analysis reveals a strong coupling between aperture size and aberration angular offset: while larger CCRs deliver high on-axis flux under near-ideal conditions, their narrow diffraction lobes suffer significant flux loss at moderate aberration offsets, thereby favoring smaller apertures with broader main lobes. Furthermore, comparisons between solid fused-silica and hollow silicon-carbide (SiC) CCRs show that hollow designs not only achieve competitive or superior photon return -- particularly at 1064 nm, where phase errors are relatively reduced -- but also offer nearly an order-of-magnitude mass reduction for the same aperture sizes. These results establish a robust quantitative framework for optimizing CCR designs to perform at the sub-millimeter level under realistic lunar conditions and underscore the advantages of precision hollow SiC CCRs for next-generation LLR operations.</description>

      <title>Graviton stimulated emission in squeezed vacuum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of gravitons in a squeezed vacuum state in a thermal radiation background. Unlike traditional treatments that rely on the Boltzmann equation, we employ the Heisenberg equation and average it over general quantum states. In contrast to the usual Boltzmann-based descriptions, our approach captures the subtleties arising from quantum coherence in different number eigenstates, which is essential for soft graviton modes in the squeezed vacuum state. Our new method successfully reproduces the previous one-loop results within the in-in formalism when the expansion parameter is small and deviates significantly as the parameter increases, indicating that our results extend beyond the one-loop in-in formalism. We examine the implications of graviton emission effects stimulated by quantum coherence in both flat and expanding backgrounds. In the flat background, it is found that backreaction of radiation on the spacetime dynamics is crucial for significant stimulated emission. In the expanding background, to avoid the subtleties associated with superhorizon modes, we investigate the effect of emission within the horizon immediately after reheating and find a significant effect. We examined the IR graviton evolution from a symmetry perspective and propose a regularization prescription to eliminate the secular growth problem.</description>

      <title>Universal profile for cosmic birefringence tomography with radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to tomographically probe cosmic birefringence using radio galaxies. We show that the redshift evolution of the cosmic birefringence angle induced by a slow-rolling pseudoscalar field, which is a candidate for dynamical dark energy, is independent of the detailed model of the pseudoscalor field. This universal profile evolves predominantly at $z\lesssim10$. In contrast, if the origin is a dark matter-like pseudscalor field, the resulting birefringence angle tends to be negligible in the low-redshift regime. This new insight provides a strong motivation to independently test the cosmic birefringence using polarized astrophysical sources such as radio galaxies. We find that a sample size of $\order{10^5-10^6}$ is required to distinguish the profiles, which is achievable with ongoing and upcoming radio surveys such as ASKAP or SKA.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity realizations of quintom dark energy after DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the realization of quintom scenario for dynamical dark energy within modified gravity theories that can efficiently fit the recent observational datasets. Starting from a general effective field theory formulation of dark energy in metric-affine geometry, we derive the background action in unitary gauge and we demonstrate how both $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ gravity can naturally realize quintom behavior through appropriate forms and parameter choices. Additionally, using the Gaussian process reconstruction of the latest DESI DR2 BAO data combined with SNe and CMB observations, we extract the reconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state parameter, showing that it exhibits quintom-type evolution, crossing the phantom divide from below. Moreover, through detailed parameter estimations and application of information criteria, we compare the model with the quadratic one. Our results show that, due to its rich structure, modified gravity stands as one of the main candidates for the realization of the data-favoured dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as powerful probes in cosmology. An optimized method for extracting the cosmic baryon density from localized FRBs, based on maximizing the joint likelihood function of the extragalactic dispersion measure ($\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{ext}}$), was proposed by Macquart et al. [Nature 581, 391 (2020)]. In this Letter, we identify a crucial term that was omitted in their derivation of the probability density function (PDF) for $\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{ext}}$. Using simulated FRB data, we demonstrate that neglecting this term leads to a systematic bias in the inferred cosmic baryon density, with deviations exceeding the $1\sigma$ confidence level. This highlights the importance of the missing term for the reliable cosmological application of FRBs. Furthermore, employing a sample of 88 real localized FRBs, we find that the baryon density derived using the original PDF by Macquart et al. is inconsistent with the Planck 2018 CMB data, while our corrected PDF yields a result in excellent agreement. We conclude that the omitted term is essential and must be included in order to obtain accurate cosmological constraints from FRB observations.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianity of Tensor Induced Density Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Gaussianity of second-order matter density perturbations induced by primordial gravitational waves (GWs). These tensor-induced scalar modes arise from local fluctuations in the GWs energy density, which is quadratic in tensor perturbations. The resulting second-order density contrast follows a chi-squared distribution, naturally exhibiting significant non-Gaussianity. We compute the bispectrum of these tensor-induced scalar modes and analyze its dependence on various primordial GWs power spectra, including scale-invariant, blue-tilted, Gaussian-bump, and monochromatic sources. We find that the bispectrum shape is inherently sensitive to the underlying GWs spectrum by construction. In particular, Gaussian-bump and monochromatic sources produce a strong signal peaking in the equilateral configuration, similar to the effect of scalar-induced tensor modes. Our findings reveal a new way to probe primordial GWs via galaxy surveys and highlight a unique feature of tensor-induced density perturbations, otherwise mimicking linear ones on sub-horizon scales.</description>

      <title>Towards a de Sitter quintom-like cosmology from a reduction of a 7-dimensional $BF$ theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we analyze a 7-dimensional $BF$ theory that, upon dimensional reduction, transforms into an effective 4-dimensional action in which a generic metric is involved. A constraint is imposed in such a way that this is the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric characterized by a scale factor $a(t)=\mathrm{exp}(H_0 t)$ with a Hubble constant $H_{0}=67.70 \,\rm [km\, s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}]$. We also compute the barotropic parameter $\omega \equiv p/\rho$ from our solutions. Three different scenarios are explored, in which the model transitions from quintessence to phantom regimes, crossing the theoretical phantom divide line. Consequently, the effective action represents a quintom-like scenario. Moreover, we derive some analytic solutions for the scale factor by treating it as a dynamical variable in the effective action. In this case, different outcomes are obtained, where the model can transit from a cosmological constant to a quintessence regime; however, it cannot cross the theoretical phantom divide line. However, this simplistic model successfully captures distinct phases of cosmic expansion.</description>

Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories have shown promise in many sectors of cosmology. However, recent constraints from the speed of gravitational waves have put severe limits on the breadth of models such classes of theories can realize. In this work, we explore the possibility of a string-like Horndeski Lagrangian that is equipped with two dilaton fields. This is an interesting low-energy effective string theory that has a healthy general relativity limit. The evolution of a two-dilation coupled cosmology is not well-known in the literature. We explore the tensor perturbations in order to assess the behavior of the model again the speed of gravitational wave constraint. Our main result is that this model exhibits of a class of cosmological theories that is consistent with this observational constraint.</description>

      <title>Flux-balance laws for spinning bodies under the gravitational self-force</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10343v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of an extended, but still weakly gravitating body in general relativity can often be determined by a set of conserved quantities. Much like for geodesic motion, a sufficient number of conserved quantities allows the motion to be solved by quadrature. Under the gravitational self-force (relaxing the "weakly gravitating" assumption), the motion can then be described in terms of the evolution these "conserved quantities". This evolution can be calculated using the (local) self-force on the body, but such an approach is computationally intensive. To avoid this, one often uses flux-balance laws: relationships between the average evolution (capturing the dissipative dynamics) and the values of the field far away from the body, which are far easier to compute. In the absence of spin, such a flux-balance law has been proven in [Isoyama et al., 2019] for any of the conserved action variables appearing in a Hamiltonian formulation of geodesic motion in the Kerr spacetime. In this paper, we derive a corresponding flux-balance law, to linear order in spin, directly relating average rates of change to the flux of a conserved current through the horizon and out to infinity. In the absence of spin, this reproduces results consistent with those in [Isoyama et al., 2019]. To linear order in spin, we construct flux-balance laws for four of the five constants of motion for spinning bodies in the Kerr spacetime, although not in a practical form. However, this result provides a promising path towards deriving the flux-balance law for the (generalized) Carter constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight vectors can extract energy and angular momentum from a Kerr black hole (BH) due to superradiant instability, resulting in the formation of a BH-condensate system. In this work, we carefully investigate the evolution of this system numerically with multiple superradiant modes. Simple formulas are obtained to estimate important timescales, maximum masses of different modes, as well as the BH mass and spin at various times. Due to the coexistence of modes with small frequency differences, the BH-condensate system emits gravitational waves with a unique beat signature, which could be directly observed by current and projected interferometers. Besides, the current BH spin-mass data from the binary BH merger events already exclude the vector mass in the range $5\times 10^{-15}\ \mathrm{eV} &lt;\mu&lt; 9\times 10^{-12}\ \mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Exact cosmological solutions with magnetic field in the theory of gravity with non-minimal kinetic coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate anisotropic and homogeneous cosmological models in the scalar-tensor theory of gravity with non-minimal kinetic coupling of a scalar field to the curvature given by the function $\eta\cdot(\phi/2)\cdot G_{\mu\nu}\,\nabla^\mu \nabla^\nu \phi$ in the Lagrangian. We assume that the space-times are filled a global unidirectional magnetic field that minimally interacts with the scalar field. We limit ourselves to the period before and during primary inflation. The Horndeski theory allows anisotropy to grow over time. The question arises about isotropization. In the theory under consideration, a zero scalar charge imposes a condition on the anisotropy level, namely its dynamics develops in a limited region. This condition uniquely determines a viable branch of solutions of the field equations. The magnetic energy density that corresponds to this branch is a bounded function of time. The sign of parameter $l=1+\varepsilon\eta \Lambda/\mu$ determines the properties of cosmological models, where $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant, $\mu=M^2_{PL}$ is the Planck mass squared. The sign $\varepsilon=\pm 1$ defines the canonical scalar field and the phantom field, respectively. An inequality $\varepsilon/\eta&gt;0$ is a necessary condition for isotropization of models, but not sufficient. The model with $l&gt;0$ has the necessary properties: isotropization during expansion, rapid transition to inflationary expansion ($a(t)\propto e^{\sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon}{3\eta}}\cdot t}$), absence of ghost and Laplace instabilities. In other cases $l\ngtr 0$, the model has various disadvantages. Constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the conditions for avoidance of ghost and Laplacian instabilities lead to the inequalities: $\Lambda&gt;0$, $\eta&gt;0$, $\varepsilon=1$, $1&lt;\Lambda\eta/\mu&lt;1.049$.</description>

      <title>A mechanism to generate varying speed of light via Higgs-dilaton coupling: Theory and cosmological applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We allow the Higgs field $\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\chi$ of the background spacetime via the coupling $\chi^2\,\Phi^\dagger\Phi$. Upon spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to $\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass and particle masses dependent on $\chi$, we present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary alongside the dynamical field $\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$, the prevailing value $\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for physical processes occurring in this region as $l\propto\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and $\tau\propto\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\textit anisotropic$ relation $\tau^{-1}\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods, resulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time cosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications to the Lema\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are capable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\textit{through a declining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus avoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension without requiring a dynamical dark energy component.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning solutions to singular ordinary differential equations: from special functions to spherical accretion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singular regular points often arise in differential equations describing physical phenomena such as fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and gravitation. Traditional numerical techniques often fail or become unstable near these points, requiring the use of semi-analytical tools, such as series expansions and perturbative methods, in combination with numerical algorithms; or to invoke more sophisticated methods. In this work, we take an alternative route and leverage the power of machine learning to exploit Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a modern approach to solving ordinary differential equations with singular points. PINNs utilize deep learning architectures to approximate solutions by embedding the differential equations into the loss function of the neural network. We discuss the advantages of PINNs in handling singularities, particularly their ability to bypass traditional grid-based methods and provide smooth approximations across irregular regions. Techniques for enhancing the accuracy of PINNs near singular points, such as adaptive loss weighting, are used in order to achieve high efficiency in the training of the network. We exemplify our results by studying four differential equations of interest in mathematics and gravitation -- the Legendre equation, the hypergeometric equation, the solution for black hole space-times in theories of Lorentz violating gravity, and the spherical accretion of a perfect fluid in a Schwarzschild geometry.</description>

Abstract: We analyze all possible symmetry reductions of Lagrangians that yield fully equivalent field equations for any 4-dimensional metric theory of gravity. Specifically, we present a complete list of infinitesimal group actions obeying the principle of symmetric criticality, identify the corresponding invariant metrics (and $l$-chains), discuss relations among them, and analyze simplifications allowed by the residual diffeomorphism group and Noether identities before and after variation of the reduced Lagrangian. We employ rigorous treatment of the symmetry reduction by Fels and Torre and use the Hicks classification of infinitesimal group actions by means of Lie algebras pairs of isometries and their isotropy subalgebras. The classification is recast in the coordinates in which the well-known symmetries and geometries are easily recognizable and relatable to each other. The paper is accompanied by a code for the symmetry reduction of Lagrangians that we developed in \texttt{xAct} package of \textsc{Mathematica}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Working in momentum space and at linear order in the gravitational coupling, we derive the most general class of energy-momentum tensors associated with a given multipolar structure of the spacetime in arbitrary dimensions, and built out of a mass and an angular momentum, at any order in the spin expansion. In this formalism, we are able to derive directly the full multipolar structure of any solution from the multipole expansion of the energy-momentum tensor, in complete analogy to Newtonian gravity. In particular, we identify the recurrence relations that allow obtaining the multipolar structure of the Kerr and the Myers-Perry black hole solutions, defining source multipoles in a General Relativity context for the first time. For these solutions, we are able to resum the energy-momentum tensor in momentum space at all orders in the angular momentum, and compute its real-space version. In the Kerr case we exactly obtain the matter source found by Israel, namely an equatorial, pressureless thin disk rotating at superluminal speed. For Myers-Perry in five dimensions, the matter distribution is a three-ellipsoid in four spatial dimensions with nontrivial stresses. Remarkably, for any dimensions, the matter configuration is a lower-dimensional distribution which has the same singularity structure as the fully non-linear black-hole solution. Our formalism underscores the advantage of working in momentum space to generate nontrivial matter sources for non-linear spacetimes, and could be used to construct regular non-exotic matter configurations that source spinning black hole solutions or horizonless compact objects with the same multipolar structure as black holes.</description>

Abstract: In the generalized matter-geometry coupling theory, we investigate the physical characteristics and causality of some new cosmological models for a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic spacetime filled with stiff, radiation, dust, and curvature fluid sources. We obtain a particular cosmological model corresponding to each source fluid, called Models I, II, III, and IV, respectively. We make observational constraints on each model using the joint analysis of $31$ Cosmic Chronometer (CC) Hubble dataset and $1701$ Pantheon+SH0ES datasets to estimate the current values of model parameters. Using these statistical results, we have analyzed the information criteria, effective EoS parameter, causality of the models, and viability of this generalized gravity theory. Subsequently, we investigate the effective equation of state and deceleration parameter for each model. We found that all models in the late-time universe exhibit transit-phase acceleration, and Models I and II show both the early as well as late-time accelerating phase of the expanding universe. We found the current values of the deceleration parameter in the range $-0.8857\le q_{0}\le-0.4279$ with transition redshift $0.4867\le z_{t}\le0.839$ and the effective EoS parameter in the range $-0.9238\le\omega_{eff}\le-0.6186$. We analyzed the square sound speed condition $c_{s}^{2}\le c^{2}$ for each model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution in the context of a self-interacting Kalb-Ramond field coupled with a global monopole. By incorporating the effects of Lorentz-violating term $\ell$ and the monopole charge $\eta$ in the KR field, we derive the modified gravitational field equations and analyze the resulting black hole spacetime. The obtained solution exhibits deviations from the Schwarzschild metric with topological defect, as it is influenced by the monopole charge and self-interaction potential. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the black hole, including its Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat, revealing novel stability conditions. Additionally, we perform solar system tests such as perihelion precession, gravitational redshift, light deflection, and time delay of signals to impose constraints on the Lorentz-violating parameter and monopole charge. Our findings suggest that these parameters have to be significantly small, although there are different constraints imposed by individual tests, ranging from $10^{-9}\leq|\ell|\leq 10^{-4}$ and $10^{-9}\leq\eta\leq 10^{-6}\, \mathrm{m}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Extending Israel-Stewart theory: Causal bulk viscosity at large gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a class of relativistic fluid models for cold and dense matter with bulk viscosity, whose equilibrium equation of state is polytropic. These models reduce to Israel-Stewart theory for small values of the viscous stress $\Pi$. However, when $\Pi$ becomes comparable to the equilibrium pressure $P$, the evolution equations "adjust" to prevent the onset of far-from-equilibrium pathologies that would otherwise plague Israel-Stewart. Specifically, the equations of motion remain symmetric hyperbolic and causal at all times along any continuously differentiable flow, and across the whole thermodynamic state space. This means that, no matter how fast the fluid expands or contracts, the hydrodynamic equations are always well-behaved (away from singularities). The second law of thermodynamics is enforced exactly. Near equilibrium, these models can accommodate an arbitrarily complicated dependence of the bulk viscosity coefficient $\zeta$ on both density and temperature.</description>

      <title>$\tt GrayHawk$: A public code for calculating the Gray Body Factors of massless fields around spherically symmetric Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and describe $\tt GrayHawk$, a publicly available Mathematica-based tool designed for the efficient computation of gray-body factors for spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat black holes. This program provides users with a rapid and reliable means to compute gray-body factors for massless fields with spin \(s = 0, 1/2, 1, 2\) in modes specified by the angular quantum number \(l\), given a black hole metric and the associated parameter values. $\tt GrayHawk$ is preloaded with seven different black hole metrics, offering immediate applicability to a variety of theoretical models. Additionally, its modular structure allows users to extend its functionality easily by incorporating alternative metrics or configurations. This versatility makes $\tt GrayHawk$ a powerful and adaptable resource for researchers studying black hole physics and Hawking radiation. The codes described in this work are publicly available at https://github.com/marcocalza89/GrayHawk.</description>

      <title>The impact of local noise recorded at the ET candidate sites on the signal to noise ratio of CBC gravitational wave signals for the ET triangle configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02166v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an evaluation of how site dependent noise can affect the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals in the future 3rd generation gravitational wave (GW) detector Einstein Telescope (ET). The design of ET is currently pushing the scientific community to study its scientific potential with respect to known, and possibly unexpected, GW signals using its design sensitivity curves. However, local ambient noise may have an impact on the ET sensitivity at low frequency and therefore affect the SNR of CBC signals at low frequency. Therefore, we study the impact of ambient noise on the ET sensitivity curve at the two sites candidate to host ET - Sardinia, in Italy, and the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (EMR) at the Netherlands-Belgium border - and infer the impact on the ET sensitivity curve and how the SNR of CBC signals at low frequencies is affected. We find that Sardinia shows results which are on par, if not better, than the design case. On the other hand, ambient noise for the current EMR sensitivity curve in Terziet causes a higher degradation of the SNR performances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of Palatini gravity, $F(R,X)$ models, with X the inflaton kinetic term, are characterized by the appealing property of generating asymptotically flat inflaton potentials. In this paper, we study the case of a Jordan frame potential which is positive and bounded, specifically, natural inflation. We compute the CMB observables and show that for a wide class of $F(R,X)$ theories, including the quadratic one, natural inflation is still viable.</description>

      <title>First law of de Sitter thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The de Sitter state has a special symmetry: it is homogeneous, and its curvature is constant in space. Since all the points in the de Sitter space are equivalent, this state is described by local thermodynamics. This state has the local temperature $T=H/\pi$ (which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature), the local entropy density, the local energy density, and also the local gravitational degrees of freedom -- the scalar curvature ${\cal R}$ and the effective gravitational coupling $K$. On the other hand, there is the cosmological horizon, which can be also characterized by the thermodynamic relations. We consider the connections between the local thermodynamics and the thermodynamics of the cosmological horizon. In particular, there is the holographic connection between the entropy density integrated over the Hubble volume and the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of the horizon, $S_{\rm volume}=S_{\rm horizon}=A/4G$. We also consider the first law of thermodynamics in these two approaches. In the local thermodynamics, on the one hand, the first law is valid for an arbitrary volume $V$ of de Sitter space. On the other hand, the first law is also applicable to the thermodynamics of the horizon. In both cases, the temperature is the same. This consideration is extended to the contracting de Sitter with its negative entropy, $S_{\rm volume}=S_{\rm horizon}=-A/4G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a procedure for locating black hole horizons in Kerr-Schild spacetimes in the double copy paradigm. Using only single- and zeroth-copy data on flat spacetime, our procedure predicts the existence of trapped surfaces in the double-copy gravitational solution. We show explicitly how this procedure locates the horizon of the Schwarzschild black hole and the general Myers-Perry black hole.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and induced gravitational waves from logarithmic non-Gaussianity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black hole (PBH) based on numerical relativity simulations and peak theory as well as the corresponding scalar induced gravitational wave (SIGW) signals in the presence of \emph{logarithmic non-Gaussianities} which has recently been confirmed in a wide class of inflation models. Through numerical calculations, we find certain parameter spaces of the critical thresholds for the type A PBH formation and reveal a maximum critical threshold value. We also find that there is a region where no PBH is produced from type II fluctuations contrary to a previous study. We then confirm that SIGW signals originated from the logarithmic non-Gaussianity are detectable in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna if PBHs account for whole dark matter. Finally, we discuss the SIGW interpretation of the nHz stochastic gravitational wave background reported by the recent pulsar timing array observations. We find that PBH overproduction is a serious problem for most of the parameter space, while this tension might still be alleviated in the non-perturbative regime.</description>

      <title>Galaxy infall models for arbitrary velocity directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For most galaxies in the cosmos, our knowledge of their motion is limited to line-of-sight velocities from redshift observations. To determine the radial velocity between two galaxies the minor and major infall models were established by Karachentsev and Kashibadze (2006). Regardless of the background cosmology, our derivations reveal that these infall models approximate the total radial velocity between two galaxies by two different projections employing different information about the system. For galaxies having small angular separations $\theta$, all infall models agree that the radial velocity is the difference of their line-of-sight components. Applying these models to ca. $500$ halos of the Illustris-3 simulation, we find the perpendicular and tangential velocity parts to be non-negligible for more than 90% of all, more than 5000 infalling subhalos. Thus, even for $\theta &lt; 10$ deg, the infall-model velocities deviate from the true radial velocity. Only for 30% we found the true one lay between the minor and major infall velocity. However, the infall models yield robust upper and lower bounds to the true radial velocity dispersion. Observed under $\theta &lt; 10$ deg the velocity dispersion inferred from the sole difference of line-of-sight velocity components even coincides with the true one, justifying this approach for high-redshift groups and clusters. Based on these findings, we predict the radial velocity dispersion of the M81-group from the minor infall model (upper bound) $\sigma_{\mathrm{r,min}} = (193 \pm 42)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$, from the major infall model (lower bound) $\sigma_{\mathrm{r,maj}} = (129 \pm 64) ~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$ and $\sigma_\mathrm{r,\Delta v} = (102 \pm 36)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$ from the line-of-sight-velocity difference.</description>

      <title>Minimax surfaces and the holographic entropy cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study and prove properties of the minimax formulation of the HRT holographic entanglement entropy formula, which involves finding the maximal-area surface on a timelike hypersurface, or time-sheet, and then minimizing over the choice of time-sheet. In this formulation, the homology condition is imposed at the level of the spacetime: the homology regions are spacetime volumes rather spatial regions. We show in particular that the smallest minimax homology region is the entanglement wedge. The minimax prescription suggests a way to construct a graph model for time-dependent states, a weighted graph on which min cuts compute HRT entropies. The existence of a graph model would imply that HRT entropies obey the same inequalities as RT entropies, in other words that the RT and HRT entropy cones coincide. Our construction of a graph model relies on the time-sheets obeying a certain ``cooperating'' property, which we show holds in some examples and for which we give a partial proof; however, we also find scenarios where it may fail.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the Ricci-flat metrics in four dimensions that are stationary and algebraically special, together with the locally asymptotically flat conditions in the Bondi-Sachs framework. The Einstein equation is reduced to Laplacian equation on the celestial sphere. The solutions consist of two pairs of arbitrary holomorphic and antiholomorphic functions analogous to the Virasoro modes. We show that the higher modes of one pair of the (anti-)holomorphic function contain an infinite tower of soft hairs from the perspective of the asymptotic supertranslation charges. Within our general ansatz, we obtain the complete set of algebraic Petrov type-D solutions of five parameters. We show that the type-D solution is diffeomorphism to the Kerr-Taub-NUT solution.</description>

      <title>Autocorrelation signatures in time-resolved black hole flare images: secondary peaks and convergence structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong gravitational field of a black hole bends light, forming multi-level images, yet extracting precise spacetime information from them remains challenging. In this study, we investigate how gravitational lensing leaves unique and detectable signatures in black hole movies using autocorrelation analysis. By examining the two-dimensional autocorrelation of a movie depicting a hotspot orbiting a Kerr black hole, as viewed by a near-axis observer, we identify a persistent secondary peak structure induced by gravitational lensing. Notably, these secondary peaks converge to a fixed point in the time-angle lag domain, largely independent of the hotspot's orbital radius. This key property suggests that combining future black hole flare observations with advanced autocorrelation analysis could effectively disentangle lensing effects from orbital dynamics, enabling direct measurement of black hole parameters. Our findings establish autocorrelation as a powerful tool for probing spacetime geometry, offering new insights into gravitational physics through time-resolved black hole images.</description>
