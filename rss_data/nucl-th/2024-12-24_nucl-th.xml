      <title>B(E2) strength in 36,38Ca and in mirror nuclei 36S, 38Ar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, B(E2, 0+_1 \rightarrow 2+_1) transition strength have been measured in 36Ca and 38Ca. Surprisingly, the measured value in 36Ca: B(E2) = 131(20) e2fm4, is significantly larger than in 38Ca, where B(E2) = 101(11) e2fm4, whereas an opposite tendency of B(E2) values is seen in the mirror nuclei 36S and 38Ar. The resonance 2+_1 in 36Ca lies 465 keV above the proton emission threshold and its description requires inclusion of the coupling to the continuum. In this work, we are analyzing B(E2) values in 36Ca, 36S, 38Ca, and 38Ar using the real-energy continuum shell model, the so-called shell model embedded in the continuum, in the (1s1/2 0d3/2 0f7/2 1p3/2) model space with the monopole adjusted effective interaction ZBM-IO.</description>

      <title>Nuclear structure properties of $^{193-200}$Hg isotopes within large-scale shell model calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale shell-model calculations have been performed to study the nuclear structure properties of Hg isotopes with mass varying from $A=193$ to $A=200$. The shell-model calculations are carried out in the 50 $\leq Z \leq$ 82 and 82 $ \leq N \leq$ 126 model space using monopole-based truncation. We present detailed studies on low-energy excitation spectra, energy systematics, and collective properties of Hg isotopes, such as reduced transition probabilities, quadrupole, and magnetic moments along the isotopic chain. The evolution of wave function configurations with spin is analyzed in the case of even-$A$ Hg isotopes. The shell-model results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data and predictions are made where experimental data are unavailable. The shapes of Hg isotopes are also investigated through the energy-surface plots.</description>

      <title>Reaction mechanism of quasi-free knockout processes in exotic RI beam era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasi-free nucleon knockout reaction has been revealed the single-particle nature of nuclei. Thanks to the advances in experimental techniques and reaction theory, various new aspects of nuclei are being revealed by knockout reactions. In this article, we review the basic concept of the quasi-free knockout reaction, and recent achievements in the SEASTAR project using the MINOS system. We also present our new findings on the low-energy nucleon knockout reaction and the $\alpha$ knockout reaction. The combination of the (microscopic) structure theory, reaction theory and experiments will be the key to a complete understanding of the $\alpha$ formation and its universality in the coming decades. Noble clusters, e.g., $d$, $t$, $^{3}$He, etc. are in the scope of the ONOKORO project. The implementation of the two (and more) nucleon correlation in the reaction theory is essential to connect the properties of such clusters and the reaction observables. A new framework, CDCCIA, is introduced for this purpose, which will also be applicable to the two-nucleon knockout reactions, e.g., $(p,3p)$, $(p,2pn)$, and $(p,p2n)$.</description>

      <title>Radiative Energy Loss in a Dynamically Evolving Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical formalism for calculating first-order in opacity radiative energy loss, incorporating the spatial and temporal temperature evolution of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in a finite-size QCD medium with dynamical (i.e., moving) constituents. The derived expressions allow for the inclusion of arbitrary temperature profiles, enabling detailed calculations of radiative energy loss across various evolution scenarios. This advancement is crucial for utilizing high-$p_\perp$ observables to constrain QGP properties through precision QGP tomography.</description>

      <title>Effects of a first-order QCD phase transition on the enhancement of light nucleus yield ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model to describe the baryon density fluctuations of quark matter along the isentropic trajectories corresponding to different $s/\rho_B$ values extracted from Au+Au collisions at energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7-200$ GeV, we investigate the effects of the two-phase coexistence region during a first-order phase transition on the light nucleus yield ratio $N_t \times N_p/N_d^2$. The results indicate that the second-order scalar density moment $y_2$, used to quantify density fluctuations, rapidly increases to form a peak when the isentropic trajectories pass through the coexistence region. We extract the yield ratios $N_t\times N_p/N_d^2$ at chemical freeze-out from the isentropic trajectories at different collision energies and found the significant enhancements at 19.6 GeV and 27 GeV. This is similar to the trends observed by the STAR experiment, suggesting that the enhancements in the yield ratios $N_t\times N_p/N_d^2$ observed in the STAR experiment should be attributed to the density fluctuations generated in the first-order phase transition region.</description>

      <title>Axion effects on quark matter and quark-matter cores in massive hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a three-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to describe the charge-parity violating effects through axion field, we investigate the axion effects on quark matter and quark-matter cores in massive hybrid stars. The properties of quark matter vary with the scaled axion field $a/f_a$ in a periodic manner, with a period of $2\pi$. Within the range from 0 to $\pi $, axion field decrease the baryon chemical potential of the first-order phase transition, leading to an increase in normalized pressure and stiffening of the quark matter equation of state. The effect of axions on hybrid star matter that includes the hadron-quark phase transition is contrary to expectations. The axion field shifts the onset of the hadron-quark mixed phase to lower densities but slightly softens the equation of state of the mixed phase matter, which also results in a slight decrease in the maximum mass and corresponding radius of the hybrid stars. However, we also find that the lowering of the onset of the mixed phase significantly increases the radius and mass of the quark-matter core in the hybrid star. Therefore, our results indicate with axion effects, a sizable quark-matter core can appear in $2M_{\odot}$ massive neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Selection Rules for $^{24}\mathrm{Mg}$ in a $6\alpha$ Cluster Model with $\mathcal{D}_{4h}$ Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of a macroscopic $\alpha$-cluster model, the structural properties and the spectroscopy of the $^{24}\mathrm{Mg}$ nucleus are investigated. Special attention is devoted to the electromagnetic selection rules imposed by the point-symmetry group $\mathcal{D}_{4h}$ that leaves invariant the adopted $6\alpha$ equilibrium configuration, a square bipyramid. The analysis entails the application of group-theoretical identities and character tables, in a way familiar to quantum chemists. The results show that the occurrence of interband E0, E2, and M1, M2, M3 transitions is strictly regulated by the transformation properties of the excited vibrational modes to which the states in the process belong. Unlike the $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ nucleus in the $\mathcal{D}_{3h}$-symmetric $3\alpha$ arrangement, M1 transition channels are active between states corresponding to a single quantum of vibrational excitation. Conversely, the measured E1 strengths in the $^{24}\mathrm{Mg}$ spectrum are attributable to the excitation of single-nucleon degrees of freedom, as E1 transitions are forbidden by the model. The present investigation is a only part of a wider work, encompassing the spectrum and the whole electromagnetic properties of this nucleus in the considered $\mathcal{D}_{4h}$-symmetric configuration, in preparation.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation for hadronic light-by-light scattering: $\eta$ and $\eta'$ poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pseudoscalar-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering are determined by the respective transition form factors (TFFs) into two virtual photons. These TFFs constitute complicated functions of the photon virtualities that, in turn, can be reconstructed in a dispersive approach from their discontinuities. In this work, we present such an analysis for the $\eta^{(\prime)}$ TFFs, implementing a number of constraints from both experiment and theory: normalizations from the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\gamma\gamma$ decay widths, unitarity constraints from the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$ spectra, chiral symmetry for the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to2(\pi^+\pi^-)$ amplitudes, vector-meson couplings, singly-virtual data from $e^+e^-\to e^+e^-\eta^{(\prime)}$, and the asymptotic behavior predicted by the light-cone expansion. In particular, we account for the leading left-hand-cut singularity by including effects from the $a_2$ resonance, necessitating the solution of an inhomogeneous Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es problem via a carefully chosen path deformation. The resulting TFFs allow us to evaluate the $\eta^{(\prime)}$-pole contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\mu^{\eta\text{-pole}}=14.7(9)\times 10^{-11}$ and $a_\mu^{\eta'\text{-pole}}=13.5(7)\times 10^{-11}$, completing a dedicated program for the lowest-lying pseudoscalar intermediate states in a dispersive approach to hadronic light-by-light scattering, $a_\mu^{\text{PS-poles}}=91.2^{+2.9}_{-2.4}\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Neutrino-Nucleus Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino-nucleus scattering cross sections are critical theoretical inputs for long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. However, robust modeling of these cross sections remains challenging. For a simple but physically motivated toy model of the DUNE experiment, we demonstrate that an accurate neural-network model of the cross section -- leveraging Standard Model symmetries -- can be learned from near-detector data. We then perform a neutrino oscillation analysis with simulated far-detector events, finding that the modeled cross section achieves results consistent with what could be obtained if the true cross section were known exactly. This proof-of-principle study highlights the potential of future neutrino near-detector datasets and data-driven cross-section models.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Constraints on Covariant Density Functional Equations of State of Compact Stars with New NICER Mass-Radius Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in astrophysical observations of compact stars, particularly the new and updated NICER constraints, have provided mass-radius ($M$-$R$) data for pulsars spanning masses from 1 to $2\,M_{\odot}$. These data offer a unique opportunity to test modern theories of dense matter using multi-messenger constraints. Covariant density functional (CDF) models of nuclear matter, which capture a broad range of nuclear and astrophysical phenomena, provide a robust theoretical framework to interpret these observations. This study applies the Bayesian framework to a class of CDF models with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings, specifically those based on nucleonic degrees of freedom. By incorporating the latest multi-messenger constraints, we impose tighter limits on the parameter space of these models and assess their consistency with observational data. Our analysis advances previous efforts by refining the density-dependence parameterization and integrating recent $M$-$R$ ellipses. This enables more stringent evaluations of dense matter models in light of new astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>The southern shore of the island of inversion studied via quasi-free scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron-rich nuclei exhibit a variety of intriguing features associated with nuclear structure evolution, deformation, and other phenomena. Particularly interesting is the region in the chart of nuclides around Z = 12 and N = 20, commonly referred to as "Island of Inversion", which is profoundly influenced by these features. Recent cutting-edge experiments performed at SAMURAI/RIBF have investigated the structure of the most neutron-rich O and F isotopes, including 27,28O and 28-30F, utilizing quasi-free scattering and invariant-mass spectroscopy techniques. This experimental campaign manifests the breakdown of the N = 20 magicity for O and F isotopes, placing them within the "Island of Inversion", as is discussed in this review article. The results are further supported by theoretical analyses employing state-of-the-art shell-model and ab-initio calculations. These nuclei serve as corner stones for the study of weak binding and continuum coupling, deformation, and halo formation. Signatures for the establishment of a superfluid regime in 28O and 29F are found. Future experimental and theoretical studies are needed to examine details.</description>

      <title>The Island of Inversion at N=40</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of the structure of atomic nuclei largely derives from the nuclear shell model, which has proven widely successful. Further test to our interpretation of the nuclear properties is provided by the study of shell evolution. Increasing experimental information has shown that the nuclear energy shells change when going towards the most exotic nuclei, in turn making some shell closures disappear while others arise. In particular, the N=40 sub-shell closure has been the subject of extensive research due to the emergence of a so-called Island of Inversion, where deformed intruder configurations dominate the wave function of the ground state. An overview of recent experimental results in the N=40 Island of Inversion, particularly those performed with the combination of the MINOS hydrogen target and the DALI2 gamma-ray array at the RIBF are discussed.</description>

      <title>Competition of the shell closure and deformations across the doubly magic \textsuperscript{78}Ni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of the neutron-rich isotope \textsuperscript{78}Ni, long postulated to be doubly magic, have been extensively explored through recent experimental and theoretical studies. Confirmations of robust shell closures at $Z=28$ and $N=50$ as well as hints of competing deformations in neighboring isotopes have been obtained. Innovations of a thick liquid hydrogen target system with vertex reconstructions and the in-beam $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy technique have facilitated detailed investigations into the nuclear structure of these extreme systems. Proton knockout reactions conducted at relativistic energies have provided the first experimental evidence of shape coexistence at the cornerstone nucleus \textsuperscript{78}Ni and its vicinity. As the nuclear structure around \textsuperscript{78}Ni influences the description of very neutron-rich systems and r-process nucleosynthesis, these findings underscore the importance of further investigations. This review encapsulates the recent results concerning the nuclear structure at the vicinity of \textsuperscript{78}Ni on both experimental and theoretical aspects. It outlines prospective research directions that could further illuminate this complex and intriguing area of the nuclear chart.</description>

      <title>Deformation from zinc to zirconium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive gamma-ray spectroscopy of very neutron-rich nuclei of isotopes between the Ni and Sn isotopic chains was facilitated by the high luminosity LH2 target system, MINOS. Results show a persistence of deformation when going beyond the N = 60 threshold of the transition between spherical to deformed ground states at N &lt; 60 and N &gt; 60, respectively. Close to 78Ni, a more detailed image of the N &gt; 50 Zn isotopes shows an erosion of the N = 50 shell closure, with core-breaking effects needed from theoretical models to replicate observation. As well as the experimental results indicating collective effects, the projected generator coordinate method is discussed in detail within the context of the neutron-rich Ge isotopes.</description>

Abstract: We present a study using the distillation method to analyze the spectra of nucleon, nucleon-pion, and nucleon-pion-pion states in the positive-parity sector, as well as nucleon and nucleon-pion states in the negative-parity sector. The study uses seven domain-wall fermion ensembles with varying pion masses ($m_\pi = 139 - 279~\text{MeV}$), lattice spacings ($a^{-1} = 1.730~\text{GeV}$ and $a^{-1}=2.359~\text{GeV}$) and volumes ($m_\pi L = 3.8 - 7.5$). To address the large number of contractions in this project, we implemented an algorithm to automate the contraction of nucleon-pion correlation functions that contain an arbitrary number of pions. In the positive parity sector, we extrapolate the nucleon mass to the physical point. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the distillation method for baryonic quantities with a focus on multi-hadronic states and establishes a foundation for future work.</description>

      <title>Shell Migration at N = 32, 34 around Ca Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutron numbers N = 32 and 34 are new magic numbers suggested in neutron-rich $pf$-shell nuclei. In this article, we discuss the experimental observables and state-of-the-art theoretical calculations that characterize and explain the shell evolution leading to new magic numbers. Particular focus shall be afforded to the experimental progress of the shell migration study at and beyond N = 32, 34 in Ar, K, Ca, and Sc isotopes at the RIBF using direct reactions with liquid hydrogen targets over the past ten years. The results prove the double magicity of \ts{52,54}Ca, and support the persistence of the N = 34 subshell closure below Z = 20 with a sharp weakening beyond Z = 20. Future measurements of intruder bands of N = 32, 34 nuclei and shell evolution towards N = 40 are discussed within the context of an upgraded RIBF facility and the development of novel detection systems.</description>

      <title>Reexamining constraints on neutron star properties from perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11125v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The implications of perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations on neutron stars are carefully examined. While pQCD calculations above baryon chemical potentials $\mu_B\simeq2.4$ GeV demonstrate the potential of ruling out a wide range of neutron star equations of state (EOSs), such constraints only affect the most massive neutron stars in the vicinity of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit, resulting in constraints that are orthogonal to current or expected astrophysical bounds. In the most constraining scenario, pQCD considerations favor low values of the squared speed sound $C_s$ at high $\mu_B$ relevant for the most massive neutron stars, but leave predictions of the radii and tidal deformabilities almost unchanged. Such considerations become irrelevant if the maximum speed of sound squared inside neutron stars does not exceed about $C_{s,\mathrm{max}}\simeq0.5$, or if pQCD breaks down below $\mu_B\simeq2.9$ GeV. Furthermore, the large pQCD uncertainties preclude any meaningful bounds on the neutron star EOS at the moment. Interestingly, if pQCD predictions for the pressure at around $\mu_B\simeq2.5$ GeV are refined and found to be low ($\lesssim 1.5$ GeV/fm$^3$), evidence for a soft neutron star inner core EOS in combination with the existence of two-solar-mass pulsars would indicate the presence of color superconductivity beyond neutron star densities. We point out that two-solar-mass pulsars place robust upper bounds on this non-perturbative effect and require the pairing gap to be less than $\Delta_\mathrm{CFL}\lesssim500$ MeV at $\mu_B\simeq2.5$ GeV.</description>

      <title>On the exact solution for the Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18499v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For almost 75 years, the general solution for the Schr\"odinger equation was assumed to be generated by an exponential or a time-ordered exponential known as the Dyson series. We study the unitarity of a solution in the case of a singular Hamiltonian and provide a new methodology that is not based on the assumption that the underlying space is $L^{2}(\mathbb{R})$. Then, an alternative operator for generating the time evolution that is manifestly unitary is suggested, regardless of the choice of Hamiltonian. The new construction involves an additional positive operator that normalizes the wave function locally and allows us to preserve unitarity, even when dealing with infinite dimensional or non-normed spaces. Our considerations show that Schr\"odinger and Liouville equations are, in fact, two sides of the same coin and together they provide a unified description for unbounded quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-independent interactions of Dirac Fermionic Dark Matter in the composite Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to recent measurements, dark matter magnetic dipole moment is strongly constrained. In the composite Higgs models the magnetic dipole moment of the Dirac dark matter fermion and its mass can be suppressed by the approximate U(1) symmetry. We consider E_6 inspired composite Higgs model (E_6CHM) with U(1) symmetry violating operators, which give rise to dark matter's mass and coupling constant to Higgs boson. The dependence of the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section on the E_6CHM parameters is explored. We argue that there are regions of the parameter space which are still safe from all current constraints and may lead to spectacular LHC signatures.</description>

      <title>Emergent Canonical Spin Tensor in the Chiral-Symmetric Hot QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin tensor is fundamental to relativistic spin hydrodynamics, but its definition is ambiguous due to the pseudogauge symmetry. We show that this ambiguity can be solved in interacting field theories. We prove that the mean-field limit of a modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with spin-spin interactions is equivalent to nondissipative spin hydrodynamics with a canonical spin tensor.</description>

      <title>How the Contact Can Produce Snowballs from Hell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A loosely bound hadronic molecule produced by a relativistic heavy-ion collision has been described as a "snowball in hell" since it emerges from a hadron gas whose temperature is orders of magnitude larger than the binding energy of the molecule. This remarkable phenomenon can be explained in terms of a novel thermodynamic variable called the "contact" that is conjugate to the binding momentum of the molecule. The production rate of the molecule can be expressed in terms of the contact density at the kinetic freezeout of the hadron gas. It approaches a nonzero limit as the binding energy goes to 0.</description>

      <title>Medium modifications of heavy-flavor jet angularities in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical study of heavy-flavor jet angularities ($\lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha}$) in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 5.02 TeV. The initial production of heavy-flavor jets is carried out using the POWHEG+PYTHIA8 prescription, while the jet evolution in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is described by the SHELL transport model. In p+p collisions, we observe narrower angularity distributions for D$^0$-tagged jets compared to inclusive jets, consistent with the ALICE preliminary results. We then demonstrate that jet quenching in the QGP slightly widens the angularity distribution of D$^0$-tagged jets in Pb+Pb collisions relative to that in p+p collisions for jet transverse momentum of $10 &lt; p_{\rm T,jet} &lt; 20$ GeV/c, while the angularity distributions of inclusive and D$^0$-tagged jets become narrower in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p at $p_{\rm T,jet} &gt; 20$ GeV/c due to the strong influence of the selection bias. Additionally, by comparing the average angularities $\langle \lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha} \rangle$ of inclusive, D$^0$-tagged and B$^0$-tagged jets with varying $\alpha$ and $\kappa$, we show that the larger the quark mass is, the lower the jet's $\langle \lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha} \rangle$ values are. As a result of the slenderer initial distribution, we predict that as compared to inclusive jets, the heavy-flavor jets, especially the B$^0$-tagged ones, will suffer stronger modifications of $\langle \lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha} \rangle$ in Pb+Pb relative to p+p at $10 &lt; p_{\rm T,jet} &lt; 20$ GeV/c. For a larger jet radius, a more significant broadening of jet angularities is predicted because of the enhanced contributions of the wide-angle particles.</description>

      <title>Hadron-quark hybrid model, modular transformation and Roberge-Weiss transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11598v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of modular transformations, we reformulate the recently proposed hadron-quark hybrid model when the imaginary baryonic chemical potential is introduced. As a result, we can consider the torus, which is characterized by the complex number densities of baryons (antibaryons) and quarks (antiquarks). We apply this model to analyze the Roberge-Weiss transition. It is shown that the torus vanishes at the baryonic chemical potential where the Roberge-Weiss transition appears because the number density of baryons (antibaryons) is not linearly independent of the number density of quarks (antiquarks). When the temperature T is lower than the Roberge-Weiss transition temperature TRW, the torus shrinks smoothly to the one-dimensional object at the Roberge-Weiss transition point, but the discontinuity does not appear. On the other hand, the discontinuity of the geometrical object appears when T&gt;TRW. We also calculate the modulus of the torus and transform it into the fundamental region. The transformed moduli are symmetric below TRW, but the symmetry is broken above TRW.</description>

      <title>Screening masses of positive- and negative-parity hadron ground-states, including those with strangeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector $\times$ vector contact interaction (SCI) at nonzero temperature, we compute the screening masses of flavour-SU(3) ground-state $J^P=0^\pm$, $1^\pm$ mesons, and $J^P=1/2^\pm$, $3/2^\pm$ baryons. We find that all correlation channels allowed at $T=0$ persist when the temperature increases, even above the QCD phase transition. The results for mesons qualitatively agree with those obtained from the contemporary lattice-regularised quantum chromodynamics (lQCD) simulations. One of the most remarkable features is that each parity-partner-pair degenerates when $T&gt;T_c$, with $T_c$ being the critical temperature. For each pair, the screening mass of the negative parity meson increases monotonously with temperature. In contrast, the screening mass of the meson with positive parity is almost invariant on the domain $T\lesssim T_c/2$; when $T$ gets close to $T_c$, it decreases but soon increases again and finally degenerates with its parity partner, which signals the restoration of chiral symmetry. We also find that the $T$-dependent behaviours of baryon screening masses are quite similar to those of the mesons. For baryons, the dynamical, nonpointlike diquark correlations play a crucial role in the screening mass evolution. We further calculate the evolution of the fraction of each kind of diquark within baryons respective to temperature. We observe that, at high temperatures, only $J=0$ scalar and pseudoscalar diquark correlations can survive within $J^P=1/2^\pm$ baryons.</description>
