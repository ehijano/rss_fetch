      <title>Inverter-Based Differential Amplifiers With Back-Gate Feedback Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feeding the common-source amplifier output to the back-gate terminal in fully depleted silicon on insulator (FD-SOI) technology exploits the linearizing effect of negative feedback. Analysis and simulation results in 22 nm FD-SOI show that back-gate feedback sets the overall gain approximately independent of the load, contributes no additional noise, and improves linearity by the back-gate voltage gain. Third-order intercept point (IP3) enhancement is at least $60\times$ compared to without feedback in inverter-based, or complementary common-source, differential amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Physics-Informed Learning to Model Synchro-Waveform Dynamics of Grid-Integrated Inverter-Based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverter-based resources (IBRs) exhibit fast transient dynamics during network disturbances, which often cannot be properly captured by phasor and SCADA measurements. This shortcoming has recently been addressed with the advent of waveform measurement units (WMUs), which provide high-resolution, time-synchronized raw voltage and current waveform samples from multiple locations in the power system. However, transient model learning based on synchro-waveform measurements remains constrained by the scarcity of network disturbances and the complexity of the underlying nonlinear dynamics of IBRs. We propose to address these problems by developing a data-efficient physics-informed machine learning (PIML) framework for synchro-waveform analytics that estimates the IBR terminal current response from only a few network disturbance signatures. Here, the physics of the electrical circuits are used to compensate for limited data availability by constraining the learning process through known circuit relationships. Two cases are considered, with known and unknown circuit parameters. In the latter case, the framework jointly learns the transient dynamics of the IBRs and the parameters of the electrical circuit. Case studies using WMU disturbance data across multiple sampling rates shows consistently lower current estimation error with substantially fewer training events than a purely data-driven baseline.</description>

      <title>RIS-Enabled Spoofing Against Adversary Sensing: CRB-Maximizing Design and Decoying Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the capability of a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS), when transparently covering a User Equipment (UE), to deceive an adversary monostatic radar system. A compact RIS kernel model that explicitly links the radar's angular response to the RIS phase profile is introduced, enabling an analytical investigation of the Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation accuracy with respect to the kernel's power. This model is also leveraged to formulate an RIS-based spoofing design with the dual objective to enforce strict nulls around the UE's true reflection AoA and maximize the channel gain towards a decoy direction. The RIS's deception capability is quantified using point-wise and angle-range robust criteria, and a configuration-independent placement score guiding decoy selection is proposed. Selected numerical results confirm deep nulls at the true reflection AoA together with a pronounced decoy peak, rendering maximum-likelihood sensing at the adversary radar unreliable.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Task Clustering for Federated Cooperative Multi-Task Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication (SemCom) prioritizes task execution over accurate symbol reconstruction and is well-suited to emerging intelligent applications. Cooperative multi-task SemCom (CMT-SemCom) further improves task execution performance. However, [1] demonstrates that cooperative multi-tasking can be either constructive or destructive. Moreover, the existing CMT-SemCom framework is not directly applicable to distributed multi-user scenarios, such as non-terrestrial satellite networks, where each satellite employs an individual semantic encoder. In this paper, we extend our earlier CMT-SemCom framework to distributed settings by proposing a federated learning (FL) based CMT-SemCom that enables cooperative multi-tasking across distributed users. Moreover, to address performance degradation caused by negative information transfer among heterogeneous tasks, we propose a semantic-aware task clustering method integrated in the FL process to ensure constructive cooperation based on an information-theoretic approach. Unlike common clustering methods that rely on high-dimensional data or feature space similarity, our proposed approach operates in the low-dimensional semantic domain to identify meaningful task relationships. Simulation results based on a LEO satellite network setup demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and performance gain over unclustered FL and individual single-task SemCom.</description>

      <title>ME-WARD: A multimodal ergonomic analysis tool for musculoskeletal risk assessment from inertial and video data in working plac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents ME-WARD (Multimodal Ergonomic Workplace Assessment and Risk from Data), a novel system for ergonomic assessment and musculoskeletal risk evaluation that implements the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) method. ME-WARD is designed to process joint angle data from motion capture systems, including inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based setups, and deep learning human body pose tracking models. The tool's flexibility enables ergonomic risk assessment using any system capable of reliably measuring joint angles, extending the applicability of RULA beyond proprietary setups. To validate its performance, the tool was tested in an industrial setting during the assembly of conveyor belts, which involved high-risk tasks such as inserting rods and pushing conveyor belt components. The experiments leveraged gold standard IMU systems alongside a state-of-the-art monocular 3D pose estimation system. The results confirmed that ME-WARD produces reliable RULA scores that closely align with IMU-derived metrics for flexion-dominated movements and comparable performance with the monocular system, despite limitations in tracking lateral and rotational motions. This work highlights the potential of integrating multiple motion capture technologies into a unified and accessible ergonomic assessment pipeline. By supporting diverse input sources, including low-cost video-based systems, the proposed multimodal approach offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for ergonomic assessments, paving the way for broader adoption in resource-constrained industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Development of an end-to-end hardware and software pipeline for affordable and feasible ergonomics assessment in the automotive industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An end-to-end hardware-software pipeline is introduced to automatize ergonomics assessment in industrial workplaces. The proposed modular solution can interoperate with commercial systems throughout the ergonomics assessment phases involved in the process. The pipeline includes custom-designed Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, two real-time worker movement acquisition tools, inverse kinematics processing and Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) report generation. It is based on free tools such as Unity3D and OpenSim to avoid the problems derived from using proprietary technologies, such as security decisions being made under "black box" conditions. Experiments were conducted in an automotive factory in a workplace with WMSDs risk among workers. The proposed solution obtained comparable results to a gold standard solution, reaching measured joint angles a 0.95 cross-correlation and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) lower than 10 for elbows and 12 for shoulders between both systems. In addition, the global RULA score difference is lower than 5% between both systems. This work provides a low-cost solution for WMSDs risk assessment in the workplace to reduce musculoskeletal disorders and associated sick leave in industry, impacting the health of workers in the long term. Our study can ease further research and popularize the use of wearable systems for ergonomics analysis allowing these workplace prevention systems to reach different industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Reliable Quasi-Static Post-Fall Floor-Occupancy Detection Using Low-Cost Millimetre-Wave Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the population ages rapidly, long-term care (LTC) facilities across North America face growing pressure to monitor residents safely while keeping staff workload manageable. Falls are among the most critical events to monitor due to their timely response requirement, yet frequent false alarms or uncertain detections can overwhelm caregivers and contribute to alarm fatigue. This motivates the design of reliable, whole end-to-end ambient monitoring systems from occupancy and activity awareness to fall and post-fall detection. In this paper, we focus on robust post-fall floor-occupancy detection using an off-the-shelf 60 GHz FMCW radar and evaluate its deployment in a realistic, furnished indoor environment representative of LTC facilities. Post-fall detection is challenging since motion is minimal, and reflections from the floor and surrounding objects can dominate the radar signal return. We compare a vendor-provided digital beamforming (DBF) pipeline against a proposed preprocessing approach based on Capon or minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming. A cell-averaging constant false alarm rate (CA-CFAR) detector is applied and evaluated on the resulting range-azimuth maps across 7 participants. The proposed method improves the mean frame-positive rate from 0.823 (DBF) to 0.916 (Proposed).</description>

      <title>Doppler-Domain Respiratory Amplification for Semi-Static Human Occupancy Detection Using Low-Resolution SIMO FMCW Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar-based sensing is a promising privacy-preserving alternative to cameras and wearables in settings such as long-term care. Yet detecting quasi-static presence (lying, sitting, or standing with only subtle micro-motions) is difficult for low-resolution SIMO FMCW radar because near-zero Doppler energy is often buried under static clutter. We present Respiratory-Amplification Semi-Static Occupancy (RASSO), an invertible Doppler-domain non-linear remapping that densifies the slow-time FFT (Doppler) grid around 0 m/s before adaptive Capon beamforming. The resulting range-azimuth (RA) maps exhibit higher effective SNR, sharper target peaks, and lower background variance, making thresholding and learning more reliable. On a real nursing-home dataset collected with a short-range 1Tx-3Rx radar, RASSO-RA improves classical detection performance, achieving AUC = 0.981 and recall = 0.920/0.947 at FAR = 1%/5%, outperforming conventional Capon processing and a recent baseline. RASSO-RA also benefits data-driven models: a frame-based CNN reaches 95-99% accuracy and a sequence-based CNN-LSTM reaches 99.4-99.6% accuracy across subjects. A paired session-level bootstrap test confirms statistically significant macro-F1 gains of 2.6-3.6 points (95% confidence intervals above zero) over the non-warped pipeline. These results show that simple Doppler-domain warping before spatial processing can materially improve semi-static occupancy detection with low-resolution radar in real clinical environments.</description>

      <title>S-MDMA: Sensitivity-Aware Model Division Multiple Access for Satellite-Ground Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite-ground semantic communication (SemCom) is expected to play a pivotal role in convergence of communication and AI (ComAI), particularly in enabling intelligent and efficient multi-user data transmission. However, the inherent bandwidth constraints and user interference in satellite-ground systems pose significant challenges to semantic fidelity and transmission robustness. To address these issues, we propose a sensitivity-aware model division multiple access (S-MDMA) framework tailored for bandwidth-limited multi-user scenarios. The proposed framework first performs semantic extraction and merging based on the MDMA architecture to consolidate redundant information. To further improve transmission efficiency, a semantic sensitivity sorting algorithm is presented, which can selectively retain key semantic features. In addition, to mitigate inter-user interference, the framework incorporates orthogonal embedding of semantic features and introduces a multi-user reconstruction loss function to guide joint optimization. Experimental results on open-source datasets demonstrate that S-MDMA consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving robust and high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions and user configurations.</description>

      <title>Over-The-Air Extreme Learning Machines with XL Reception via Nonlinear Cascaded Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently envisioned goal-oriented communications paradigm calls for the application of inference on wirelessly transferred data via Machine Learning (ML) tools. An emerging research direction deals with the realization of inference ML models directly in the physical layer of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems, which, however, entails certain significant challenges. In this paper, leveraging the technology of programmable MetaSurfaces (MSs), we present an eXtremely Large (XL) MIMO system that acts as an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) performing binary classification tasks completely Over-The-Air (OTA), which can be trained in closed form. The proposed system comprises a receiver architecture consisting of densely parallel placed diffractive layers of XL MSs followed by a single reception radio-frequency chain. The front layer facing the MIMO channel consists of identical unit cells of a fixed NonLinear (NL) response, while the remaining layers of elements of tunable linear responses are utilized to approximate OTA the trained ELM weights. Our numerical investigations showcase that, in the XL regime of MS elements, the proposed XL-MIMO-ELM system achieves performance comparable to that of digital and idealized ML models across diverse datasets and wireless scenarios, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of embedding OTA learning capabilities into future communication systems.</description>

      <title>Ampli-Flection for 6G: Active-RIS-Aided Aerial Backhaul with Full 3D Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel aerial backhaul architecture that employs an aerial active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to achieve energy-efficient, {full 3D coverage including UAV-BSs and ground users in 6G wireless networks}. Unlike prior aerial-RIS approaches limited to {2D coverage with only servicing ground users} or passive operation, the proposed design integrates an active-RIS onto a high-altitude aerial platform, enabling reliable line-of-sight links and overcoming multiplicative fading through amplification. In a scenario with UAV-BSs deployed to handle sudden traffic surges in urban areas, the aerial-active-RIS both reflects and amplifies backhaul signals to overcome blockage. We jointly optimize the aerial platform placement, array partitioning, and RIS phase configuration to maximize UAV-BS energy-efficiency. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method significantly outperforms benchmarks, demonstrating its strong potential to deliver resilient backhaul connectivity with comprehensive 3D coverage in 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Iterative Token Detection and Masked Transmission for Wireless Token Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of large-scale language models has established tokens as compact and meaningful units for natural-language representation, which motivates token communication over wireless channels, where tokens are considered fundamental units for wireless transmission. We propose a context-aware token communication framework that uses a pretrained masked language model (MLM) as a shared contextual probability model between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx). At Rx, we develop an iterative token detection method that jointly exploits MLM-guided contextual priors and channel observations based on a Bayesian perspective. At Tx, we additionally introduce a context-aware masking strategy which skips highly predictable token transmission to reduce transmission rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework substantially improves reconstructed sentence quality and supports effective rate adaptation under various channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Enhanced Near-Field Flexible Beamforming: Performance Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an emerging wireless communication technology, movable antennas (MAs) offer the ability to adjust the spatial correlation of steering vectors, enabling more flexible beamforming compared to fixed-position antennas (FPAs). In this paper, we investigate the use of MAs for two typical near-field beamforming scenarios: beam nulling and multi-beam forming. In the first scenario, we aim to jointly optimize the positions of multiple MAs and the beamforming vector to maximize the beam gain toward a desired direction while nulling interference toward multiple undesired directions. In the second scenario, the objective is to maximize the minimum beam gain among all the above directions. However, both problems are non-convex and challenging to solve optimally. To gain insights, we first analyze several special cases and show that, with proper positioning of the MAs, directing the beam toward a specific direction can lead to nulls or full gains in other directions in the two scenarios, respectively. For the general cases, we propose a discrete sampling method and an alternating optimization algorithm to obtain high-quality suboptimal solutions to the two formulated problems. Furthermore, considering the practical limitations in antenna positioning accuracy, we analyze the impact of position errors on the performance of the optimized beamforming and MA positions, by introducing a Taylor series approximation for the near-field beam gain at each target. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Digital Twin Framework for Calibrated Sim-to-Real FMCW Radar Occupancy Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning robust radar perception models directly from real measurements is costly due to the need for controlled experiments, repeated calibration, and extensive annotation. This paper proposes a lightweight simulation-to-real (sim2real) framework that enables reliable Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar occupancy detection and people counting using only a physics-informed geometric simulator and a small unlabeled real calibration set. We introduce calibrated domain randomization (CDR) to align the global noise-floor statistics of simulated range-Doppler (RD) maps with those observed in real environments while preserving discriminative micro-Doppler structure. Across real-world evaluations, ResNet18 models trained purely on CDR-adjusted simulation achieve 97 percent accuracy for occupancy detection and 72 percent accuracy for people counting, outperforming ray-tracing baseline simulation and conventional random domain randomization baselines.</description>

      <title>Integrated Channel Estimation and Sensing for Near-Field ELAA Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of uplink channel estimation for near-filed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, where a base station (BS), equipped with an extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA), serves multiple users over the same time-frequency resource block. A non-orthogonal pilot transmission scheme is considered to accommodate a larger number of users that can be supported by ELAA systems without incurring an excessive amount of training overhead. To facilitate efficient multi-user channel estimation, we express the received signal as a third-order low-rank tensor, which admits a canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) model for line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios and a block term decomposition (BTD) model for non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. An alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm and a non-linear least squares (NLS) algorithm are employed to perform CPD and BTD, respectively. Channel parameters are then efficiently extracted from the recovered factor matrices. By exploiting the geometry of the propagation paths in the estimated channel, users' positions can be precisely determined in LoS scenarios. Moreover, our uniqueness analysis shows that the proposed tensor-based joint multi-user channel estimation framework is effective even when the number of pilot symbols is much smaller than the number of users, revealing its potential in training overhead reduction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves markedly higher channel estimation accuracy than compressed sensing (CS)-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Hybrid RIS Assisted MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (HRIS) enhance wireless systems by combining passive reflection with active signal amplification. However, jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming with the HRIS reflection and amplification coefficients to maximize spectral efficiency (SE) is a non-convex problem, and conventional iterative solutions are computationally intensive. To address this, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that learns a direct mapping from channel state information to the near-optimal transmit beamforming and HRIS configurations. The DRL model is trained offline, after which it can compute the beamforming and HRIS configurations with low complexity and latency. Simulation results demonstrate that our DRL-based method achieves 95% of the SE obtained by the alternating optimization benchmark, while significantly lowering the computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Channel Charting: An LSTM-AE-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of the sixth-generation (6G) communication system, Channel State Information (CSI) plays a crucial role in improving network performance. Traditional Channel Charting (CC) methods map high-dimensional CSI data to low-dimensional spaces to help reveal the geometric structure of wireless channels. However, most existing CC methods focus on learning static geometric structures and ignore the dynamic nature of the channel over time, leading to instability and poor topological consistency of the channel charting in complex environments. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel time-series channel charting approach based on the integration of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Auto encoders (AE) (LSTM-AE-CC). This method incorporates a temporal modeling mechanism into the traditional CC framework, capturing temporal dependencies in CSI using LSTM and learning continuous latent representations with AE. The proposed method ensures both geometric consistency of the channel and explicit modeling of the time-varying properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional CC methods in various real-world communication scenarios, particularly in terms of channel charting stability, trajectory continuity, and long-term predictability.</description>

      <title>Dualband OFDM Delay Estimation for Multi-Target Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated localization and communication systems aim to reuse communication waveforms for simultaneous data transmission and localization, but delay resolution is fundamentally limited by the available bandwidth. In practice, large contiguous bandwidths are difficult to obtain due to hardware constraints and spectrum fragmentation. Aggregating non-contiguous narrow bands can increase the effective frequency span, but a non-contiguous frequency layout introduces challenges such as elevated sidelobes and ambiguity in delay estimation. This paper introduces a point-spread-function (PSF)-centric framework for dual-band OFDM delay estimation. We model the observed delay profile as the convolution of the true target response with a PSF determined by the dual-band subcarrier selection pattern, explicitly linking band configuration to resolution and ambiguity. To suppress PSF-induced artifacts, we adapt the RELAX algorithm for dual-band multi-target delay estimation. Simulations demonstrate improved robustness and accuracy in dual-band scenarios, supporting ILC under fragmented spectrum.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Radar Fusion with Quantization: CRB-Rate Trade-offs and ADC Dynamic Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements have underscored the relevance of low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Nevertheless, their specific impact on hybrid radar fusion (HRF) remains largely unexplored. In HRF systems, where uplink (UL) paths carry direct and reflected signals in the same frequency band, the reflected signal is often significantly weaker, making HRF performance particularly sensitive to ADC resolution. To study this effect, we use the quantized Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) to measure sensing accuracy. This work derives an upper bound on the quantized CRB for angle of arrival (AoA) estimation and explores CRB-rate trade-offs through two formulated optimization problems. Simulation results indicate that HRF becomes infeasible when the dynamic range of the received signal exceeds the dynamic range supported by the ADC, which is inherently limited by its resolution. Furthermore, the UL communication rate does not increase significantly when the ADC resolution is raised beyond a certain threshold. These observations highlight a fundamental trade-off between sensing and communication performance: while HRF performance benefits from higher ADC resolutions, the corresponding gains in communication rate plateau. This trade-off is effectively characterized using CRB-rate boundaries derived through simulation.</description>

      <title>Synchronization and Localization in Ad-Hoc ICAS Networks Using a Two-Stage Kuramoto Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enable Integrated Communications and Sensing (ICAS) in a peer-to-peer vehicular network, precise synchronization in frequency and phase among the communicating entities is required. In addition, self-driving cars need accurate position estimates of the surrounding vehicles. In this work, we propose a joint, distributed synchronization and localization scheme for a network of communicating entities. Our proposed scheme is mostly signal-agnostic and therefore can be applied to a wide range of possible ICAS signals. We also mitigate the effect of finite sampling frequencies, which otherwise would degrade the synchronization and localization performance severely.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Fuzzing for Vulnerability Assessment of 5G Traffic Steering Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic Steering (TS) dynamically allocates user traffic across cells to enhance Quality of Experience (QoE), load balance, and spectrum efficiency in 5G networks. However, TS algorithms remain vulnerable to adversarial conditions such as interference spikes, handover storms, and localized outages. To address this, an AI-driven fuzz testing framework based on the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is proposed to systematically expose hidden vulnerabilities. Using NVIDIA Sionna, five TS algorithms are evaluated across six scenarios. Results show that AI-driven fuzzing detects 34.3% more total vulnerabilities and 5.8% more critical failures than traditional testing, achieving superior diversity and edge-case discovery. The observed variance in critical failure detection underscores the stochastic nature of rare vulnerabilities. These findings demonstrate that AI-driven fuzzing offers an effective and scalable validation approach for improving TS algorithm robustness and ensuring resilient 6G-ready networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantization of real-valued bandlimited signals on graphs, focusing on low-bit representations. We propose iterative noise-shaping algorithms for quantization, including sampling approaches with and without vertex replacement. The methods leverage the spectral properties of the graph Laplacian and exploit graph incoherence to achieve high-fidelity approximations. Theoretical guarantees are provided for the random sampling method, and extensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>MambaNet: Mamba-assisted Channel Estimation Neural Network With Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Mamba-assisted neural network framework incorporating self-attention mechanism to achieve improved channel estimation with low complexity for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms, particularly for configurations with a large number of subcarriers. With the integration of customized Mamba architecture, the proposed framework handles large-scale subcarrier channel estimation efficiently while capturing long-distance dependencies among these subcarriers effectively. Unlike conventional Mamba structure, this paper implements a bidirectional selective scan to improve channel estimation performance, because channel gains at different subcarriers are non-causal. Moreover, the proposed framework exhibits relatively lower space complexity than transformer-based neural networks. Simulation results tested on the 3GPP TS 36.101 channel demonstrate that compared to other baseline neural network solutions, the proposed method achieves improved channel estimation performance with a reduced number of tunable parameters.</description>

      <title>Joint Uplink-Downlink Fronthaul Bit Allocation in Fronthaul-Limited Massive MU-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper optimizes the fronthaul bit allocation in massive multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems operating with limited-capacity fronthaul links. We consider an advanced antenna system (AAS) controlled by a centralized baseband unit (BBU). In the AAS, multiple antenna elements together with their radio units are integrated into a single unit. In this setup, a key challenge is allocating fronthaul bits between uplink channel state information (CSI) quantization and downlink precoding matrix quantization. We formulate the problem of maximizing the sum spectral efficiency (SE) for a given fronthaul capacity. We develop an SE expression for this scenario based on the hardening bound. We compute the expression in closed form for maximum ratio transmission, which reveals the relative impact of the two types of quantization distortion. We then formulate a bit split optimization problem and propose an algorithm that exactly solves it.
  Numerical results demonstrate how the relative importance of assigning bits to CSI and precoding varies depending on the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Building a Bridge between the Two Schools: Realizing a Practical Path to Include Literacy-based Skills within the STEM Curricula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing students as well-rounded professionals is increasingly important for our modern society. Although there is a great consensus that technical and professional ("soft") skills should be developed and intertwined in the core of computer science subjects, there are still few examples of alike teaching methodologies at technical schools. This contribution investigates the integration of technical and professional skills while teaching specialized curricula in computer science. We propose a broadly applicable, step-by-step methodology that connects core technical concepts (e.g., information entropy, network security) with fine arts practices such as music, video production, gaming, and performing arts (e.g., Oxford-style debates). The methodology was applied in several computer science courses at technical universities, where quantitative and qualitative assessments, including student questionnaires and exam scores, showed improved learning outcomes and increased student engagement compared to traditional methods. The results indicate that this art-based integration can effectively bridge the historical divide between the two schools of thought, offering a practical direction for educators. Within this context, we also identify open issues that will guide future research on topics such as instructor engagement, female motivation in technical subjects, and scalability of these approaches.</description>

      <title>Bayesian quantum sensing using graybox machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensors offer significant advantages over classical devices in spatial resolution and sensitivity, enabling transformative applications across materials science, healthcare, and beyond. Their practical performance, however, is often constrained by unmodelled effects, including noise, imperfect state preparation, and non-ideal control fields.
  In this work, we report the first experimental implementation of a graybox modelling strategy for a solid-state open quantum system. The graybox framework integrates a physics-based system model with a data-driven description of experimental imperfections, achieving higher fidelity than purely analytical (whitebox) approaches while requiring fewer training resources than fully deep-learning models. We experimentally validate the method on the task of estimating a static magnetic field using a single-spin quantum sensor, performing Bayesian inference with a graybox model trained on prior experimental data. Using roughly 10,000 training datapoints, the graybox model yields several orders of magnitude improvement in mean squared error over the corresponding physics-only model. These results are broadly applicable to a wide range of quantum sensing platforms, not limited to single-spin systems, and are particularly valuable for real-time adaptive protocols, where model inaccuracies can otherwise lead to suboptimal control and degraded performance.</description>

      <title>Curvelet-Regularized SPDE Inversion on Piecewise-Planar Fractures with Trace-Graph Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a sparse-to-dense reconstruction layer for fractured media in which sparse point measurements are mapped onto piecewise-planar fracture supports inferred from 3D trace polylines. Each plane is discretized in local coordinates and estimated via a convex objective that combines a grid SPDE/GMRF quadratic prior with an $\ell_1$ penalty on undecimated discrete curvelet coefficients, targeting anisotropic, fracture-aligned structure that is poorly represented by isotropic smoothness alone. We further define an along-fracture distance through trace-network geodesics and express connectivity-driven regularization as a quadratic form $z^\top P^\top L_G P z$, where $L_G$ is a graph Laplacian on the trace network and $P$ maps plane grids to graph nodes; plane intersections are handled by linear consistency constraints sampled along intersection lines. The resulting optimization admits efficient splitting: sparse linear solves for the quadratic block and coefficient-wise shrinkage for the curvelet block, with standard ADMM convergence under convexity. We specify reproducible synthetic benchmarks, baselines, ablations, and sensitivity studies that isolate directional sparsity and connectivity effects, and provide reference code to generate the figures and quantitative tables.</description>

      <title>ToS: A Team of Specialists ensemble framework for Stereo Sound Event Localization and Detection with distance estimation in Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound event localization and detection with distance estimation (3D SELD) in video involves identifying active sound events at each time frame while estimating their spatial coordinates. This multimodal task requires joint reasoning across semantic, spatial, and temporal dimensions, a challenge that single models often struggle to address effectively. To tackle this, we introduce the Team of Specialists (ToS) ensemble framework, which integrates three complementary sub-networks: a spatio-linguistic model, a spatio-temporal model, and a tempo-linguistic model. Each sub-network specializes in a unique pair of dimensions, contributing distinct insights to the final prediction, akin to a collaborative team with diverse expertise. ToS has been benchmarked against state-of-the-art audio-visual models for 3D SELD on the DCASE2025 Task 3 Stereo SELD development set, consistently outperforming existing methods across key metrics. Future work will extend this proof of concept by strengthening the specialists with appropriate tasks, training, and pre-training curricula.</description>

      <title>RPNT: Robust Pre-trained Neural Transformer -- A Pathway for Generalized Motor Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain decoding aims to interpret and translate neural activity into behaviors. As such, it is imperative that decoding models are able to generalize across variations, such as recordings from different brain sites, distinct sessions, different types of behavior, and a variety of subjects. Current models can only partially address these challenges and warrant the development of pretrained neural transformer models capable to adapt and generalize. In this work, we propose RPNT - Robust Pretrained Neural Transformer, designed to achieve robust generalization through pretraining, which in turn enables effective finetuning given a downstream task. In particular, RPNT unique components include 1) Multidimensional rotary positional embedding (MRoPE) to aggregate experimental metadata such as site coordinates, session name and behavior types; 2) Context-based attention mechanism via convolution kernels operating on global attention to learn local temporal structures for handling non-stationarity of neural population activity; 3) Robust self-supervised learning (SSL) objective with uniform causal masking strategies and contrastive representations. We pretrained two separate versions of RPNT on distinct datasets a) Multi-session, multi-task, and multi-subject microelectrode benchmark; b) Multi-site recordings using high-density Neuropixel 1.0 probes. The datasets include recordings from the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and from the primary motor cortex (M1) regions of nonhuman primates (NHPs) as they performed reaching tasks. After pretraining, we evaluated the generalization of RPNT in cross-session, cross-type, cross-subject, and cross-site downstream behavior decoding tasks. Our results show that RPNT consistently achieves and surpasses the decoding performance of existing decoding models in all tasks.</description>

      <title>Phase-Rotated Symbol Spreading for Scalable Rydberg Atomic-MIMO Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems using Rydberg atomic (RA) receivers face significant scalability challenges in signal detection due to their nonlinear signal models. This letter proposes phase-rotated symbol spreading (PRSS), which transmits each symbol across two consecutive time slots with an optimal {\pi}/2 phase offset. PRSS enables reconstruction of an effective linear signal model while maintaining spectral efficiency and facilitating the use of conventional RF-MIMO detection algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that PRSS achieves greater than 2.5 dB and 10 dB bit error rate improvements compared to current single-transmission methods when employing optimal exhaustive search and low-complexity sub-optimal detection methods, respectively.</description>

      <title>Neural-Inspired Multi-Agent Molecular Communication Networks for Collective Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular Communication (MC) is a pivotal enabler for the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). However, current research often relies on super-capable individual agents with complex transceiver architectures that defy the energy and processing constraints of realistic nanomachines. This paper proposes a paradigm shift towards collective intelligence, inspired by the cortical networks of the biological brain. We introduce a decentralized network architecture where simple nanomachines interact via a diffusive medium using a threshold-based firing mechanism modeled by Greenberg-Hastings (GH) cellular automata. We derive fixed-point equations for steady-state populations via mean-field analysis and validate them against stochastic simulations. We demonstrate that the network undergoes a second-order phase transition at a specific activation threshold. Crucially, we show that both pairwise and collective mutual information peak exactly at this critical transition point, confirming that the system maximizes information propagation and processing capacity at the edge of chaos.</description>

      <title>Physics-Integrated Inference for Signal Recovery in Non-Gaussian Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance room-temperature sensing is often limited by non-stationary $1/f$ fluctuations and non-Gaussian stochasticity. In spintronic devices, thermally activated N\'eel switching creates heavy-tailed noise that masks weak signals, defeating linear filters optimized for Gaussian statistics. Here, we introduce a physics-integrated inference framework that decouples signal morphology from stochastic transients using a hierarchical 1D CNN-GRU topology. By learning the temporal signatures of N\'eel relaxation, this architecture reduces the Noise Equivalent Differential Temperature (NEDT) of spintronic Poisson bolometers by a factor of six (233.78 mK to 40.44 mK), effectively elevating room-temperature sensitivity toward cryogenic limits. We demonstrate the framework's universality across the electromagnetic and biological spectrum, achieving a 9-fold error suppression in Radar tracking, a 40\% uncertainty reduction in LiDAR, and a 15.56 dB SNR enhancement in ECG. This hardware-inference coupling recovers deterministic signals from fluctuation-dominated regimes, enabling near-ideal detection limits in noisy edge environments.</description>

      <title>A Heterogeneous Massive MIMO Technique for Uniform Service in Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional cellular networks struggle with poor quality of service (QoS) for cell-edge users, while cell-free (CF) systems offer uniform QoS but incur high roll-out costs due to acquiring numerous access point (AP) sites and deploying a large-scale optical fiber network to connect them. This paper proposes a cost-effective heterogeneous massive MIMO architecture that integrates centralized co-located antennas at a cell-center base station with distributed edge APs. By strategically splitting massive antennas between centralized and distributed nodes, the system maintains high user fairness comparable to CF systems but reduces infrastructure costs substantially, by minimizing the required number of AP sites and fronthaul connections. Numerical results demonstrate its superiority in balancing performance and costs compared to cellular and CF systems.</description>

      <title>An Unsupervised Tensor-Based Domain Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a tensor-based domain alignment (DA) algorithm designed to align source and target tensors within an invariant subspace through the use of alignment matrices. These matrices along with the subspace undergo iterative optimization of which constraint is on oblique manifold, which offers greater flexibility and adaptability compared to the traditional Stiefel manifold. Moreover, regularization terms defined to preserve the variance of both source and target tensors, ensures robust performance. Our framework is versatile, effectively generalizing existing tensor-based DA methods as special cases. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances DA conversion speed but also significantly boosts classification accuracy. This positions our method as superior to current state-of-the-art techniques, making it a preferable choice for complex domain adaptation tasks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stage Structured Estimators for Information Freshness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of the contemporary literature on information freshness solely focuses on the analysis of freshness for martingale estimators, which simply use the most recently received update as the current estimate. While martingale estimators are easier to analyze, they are far from optimal, especially in pull-based update systems, where maximum aposteriori probability (MAP) estimators are known to be optimal, but are analytically challenging. In this work, we introduce a new class of estimators called $p$-MAP estimators, which enable us to model the MAP estimator as a piecewise constant function with finitely many stages, bringing us closer to a full characterization of the MAP estimators when modeling information freshness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02155v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the challenging task of target detection in sea clutter is addressed. We analyze the statistical properties of the signals which have been received from the scene and based on that, we model the amplitude of the signals that have been reflected from the background sea clutter according to several well-known probability distribution functions. Next, by exploiting the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence metric as a goodness-of-fit test, we will demonstrate that among the proposed probability distributions, the Weibull distribution can model the statistical properties of the background sea clutter with higher accuracy. Subsequently, we utilize the aforementioned information to design an adaptive threshold based on the Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm to detect the energy of the targets which have been buried in the sea clutter. Thorough analysis of the experimental data gathered from the Canadian RADARSAT-1 satellite demonstrates the overall effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit and Pinching Beamforming for Pinching Antenna Systems (PASS): Optimization-Based or Learning-Based?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel pinching antenna system (PASS)-enabled downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) framework is proposed. PASS consists of multiple waveguides spanning over thousands of wavelength, which equip numerous low-cost dielectric particles, named pinching antennas (PAs), to radiate signals into free space. The positions of PAs can be reconfigured to change both the large-scale path losses and phases of signals, thus facilitating the novel pinching beamforming design. A sum rate maximization problem is formulated, which jointly optimizes the transmit and pinching beamforming to adaptively achieve constructive signal enhancement and destructive interference mitigation. To solve this highly coupled and nonconvex problem, both optimization-based and learning-based methods are proposed. 1) For the optimization-based method, a majorization-minimization and penalty dual decomposition (MM-PDD) algorithm is developed, which handles the nonconvex complex exponential component using a Lipschitz surrogate function and then invokes PDD for problem decoupling. 2) For the learning-based method, a novel Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-guided dual learning (KDL) approach is proposed, which enables KKT solutions to be reconstructed in a data-driven manner by learning dual variables. Following this idea, a KDL-Transformer algorithm is developed, which captures both inter-PA/inter-user dependencies and channel-state-information (CSI)-beamforming dependencies by attention mechanisms. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) The proposed PASS framework significantly outperforms conventional massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system even with a few PAs. ii) The proposed KDL-Transformer can improve over 20% system performance than MM-PDD algorithm, while achieving a millisecond-level response on modern GPUs.</description>

      <title>Efficient UAV Coverage in Large Convex Quadrilateral Areas with Elliptical Footprints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant attention for improving wireless communication, especially in emergencies or as a complement to existing cellular infrastructure. This letter addresses the problem of efficiently covering a large convex quadrilateral using multiple UAVs, where each UAV generates elliptical coverage footprints based on its altitude and antenna tilt. The challenge is approached using circle-packing techniques within a unit square to arrange UAVs in an optimal configuration. Subsequently, a homography transformation is applied to map the unit square onto the quadrilateral area, ensuring that the UAVs' elliptical footprints cover the entire region. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, providing insight into coverage density and optimal altitude configurations for different placement scenarios. The results highlight the scalability and potential for improving UAV-based communication systems, focusing on maximizing coverage efficiency in large areas with irregular shapes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we expand the cooperative multi-task semantic communication framework (CMT-SemCom) introduced in [1], which divides the semantic encoder on the transmitter side into a common unit (CU) and multiple specific units (SUs), to a more applicable design. Our proposed system model addresses real-world constraints by introducing a general design that operates over rate-limited wireless channels. Further, we aim to tackle the rate-limit constraint, represented through the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, by employing the density ratio trick alongside the implicit optimal prior method (IoPm). By applying the IoPm to our multi-task processing framework, we propose a hybrid learning approach that combines deep neural networks with kernelized-parametric machine learning methods, enabling a robust solution for the CMT-SemCom. Our framework is grounded in information-theoretic principles and employs variational approximations to bridge theoretical foundations with practical implementations. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed system's effectiveness in rate-constrained multi-task SemCom scenarios, highlighting its potential for enabling intelligence in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS): A Tutorial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07572v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASS) present a breakthrough among the flexible-antenna technologies, and distinguish themselves by facilitating large-scale antenna reconfiguration, line-of-sight creation, scalable implementation, and near-field benefits, thus bringing wireless communications from the last mile to the last meter. A comprehensive tutorial is presented in this paper. First, the fundamentals of PASS are discussed, including PASS signal models, hardware models, power radiation models, and pinching antenna activation methods. Building upon this, the information-theoretic capacity limits achieved by PASS are characterized, and several typical performance metrics of PASS-based communications are analyzed to demonstrate its superiority over conventional antenna technologies. Next, the pinching beamforming design is investigated. The corresponding power scaling law is first characterized. For the joint transmit and pinching design in the general multiple-waveguide case, 1) a pair of transmission strategies is proposed for PASS-based single-user communications to validate the superiority of PASS, namely sub-connected and fully connected structures; and 2) three practical protocols are proposed for facilitating PASS-based multi-user communications, namely waveguide switching, waveguide division, and waveguide multiplexing. A possible implementation of PASS in wideband communications is further highlighted. Moreover, the channel state information acquisition in PASS is elaborated with a pair of promising solutions. To overcome the high complexity and suboptimality inherent in conventional convex-optimization-based approaches, machine-learning-based methods for operating PASS are also explored, focusing on selected deep neural network architectures and training algorithms. Finally, several promising applications of PASS in next-generation wireless networks are highlighted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of dense, mission-driven aerial networks supporting the low-altitude economy presents unique communication challenges, including extreme channel dynamics and severe cross-tier interference. Traditional reactive communication paradigms are ill-suited to these environments, as they fail to leverage the network's inherent predictability. This paper introduces predictive communication, a novel paradigm transforming network management from reactive adaptation to proactive optimization. The approach is enabled by fusing predictable mission trajectories with stable, large-scale radio environment models (e.g., radio maps). Specifically, we present a hierarchical framework that decomposes the predictive cross-layer resource allocation problem into three layers: strategic (routing), tactical (timing), and operational (power). This structure aligns decision-making timescales with the accuracy levels and ranges of available predictive information. We demonstrate that this foresight-driven framework achieves an order-of-magnitude reduction in cross-tier interference, laying the groundwork for robust and scalable low-altitude communication systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tactile Internet (TI) requires ultra-low latency and reliable haptic signal transmission, yet packet loss and delay remain unresolved challenges. We present a novel prediction framework that integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) with a ResNet-based Neural Network, where GP acts as an oracle to recover signals lost or heavily delayed. To further optimize performance, we introduce Shapley Feature Values (SFV), a principled feature selection mechanism that isolates the most informative inputs for prediction. This GP+SFV framework achieves 95.72% accuracy, surpassing the state-of-the-art LeFo method by 11.1%, while simultaneously relaxing TI's rigid delay constraints. Beyond accuracy, SFV operates as a modular accelerator: when paired with LeFo, it reduces inference time by 27%, and when paired with GP, by 72%. These results establish GP+SFV as both a high-accuracy and high-efficiency solution, paving the way for practical and reliable haptic communications in TI systems.</description>

      <title>Random Access for LEO Satellite Communication Systems via Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating contention-based random access procedures into low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) systems poses new challenges, including long propagation delays, large Doppler shifts, and a large number of simultaneous access attempts. These factors degrade the efficiency and responsiveness of conventional random access schemes, particularly in scenarios such as satellite-based internet of things and direct-to-device services. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based random access framework designed for LEO SatCom systems. The framework incorporates an early preamble collision classifier that uses multi-antenna correlation features and a lightweight 1D convolutional neural network to estimate the number of collided users at the earliest stage. Based on this estimate, we introduce an opportunistic transmission scheme that balances access probability and resource efficiency to improve success rates and reduce delay. Simulation results under 3GPP-compliant LEO settings confirm that the proposed framework achieves higher access success probability, lower delay, better physical uplink shared channel utilization, and reduced computational complexity compared to existing schemes.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Cellular Malignancy Using Electrical Impedance Signatures and Supervised Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bioelectrical properties of cells such as relative permittivity, conductivity, and characteristic time constants vary significantly between healthy and malignant cells across different frequencies. These distinctions provide a promising foundation for diagnostic and classification applications. This study systematically reviewed 33 scholarly articles to compile datasets of quantitative bioelectric parameters and evaluated their utility in predictive modeling. Three supervised machine learning algorithms- Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were implemented and tuned using key hyperparameters to assess classification performance. Model effectiveness was evaluated using accuracy and F1 score as performance metrics. Results demonstrate that Random Forest achieved the highest predictive accuracy of ~ 90% when configured with a maximum depth of 4 and 100 estimators. These findings highlight the potential of integrating bioelectrical property analysis with machine learning for improved diagnostic decision-making. Similarly, for KNN and SVM, the F1 score peaked at approximately 78% and 76.5%, respectively. Future work will explore incorporating additional discriminative features, leveraging stimulated datasets, and optimizing hyperparameter through advanced search strategies. Ultimately, hardware prototype with embedded micro-electrodes and real-time control systems could pave the path for practical diagnostic tools capable of in-situ cell classification.</description>

      <title>Discrete Mode Decomposition Meets Shapley Value: Robust Signal Prediction in Tactile Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tactile Internet (TI) requires ultra-low latency and high reliability to ensure stability and transparency in touch-enabled teleoperation. However, variable delays and packet loss present significant challenges to maintaining immersive haptic communication. To address this, we propose a predictive framework that integrates Discrete Mode Decomposition (DMD) with Shapley Mode Value (SMV) for accurate and timely haptic signal prediction. DMD decomposes haptic signals into interpretable intrinsic modes, while SMV evaluates each mode's contribution to prediction accuracy, which is well-aligned with the goal-oriented semantic communication. Integrating SMV with DMD further accelerates inference, enabling efficient communication and smooth teleoperation even under adverse network conditions.
  Extensive experiments show that DMD+SMV, combined with a Transformer architecture, outperforms baseline methods significantly. It achieves 98.9% accuracy for 1-sample prediction and 92.5% for 100-sample prediction, as well as extremely low inference latency: 0.056 ms and 2 ms, respectively. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework has strong potential to ease the stringent latency and reliability requirements of TI without compromising performance, highlighting its feasibility for real-world deployment in TI systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Dynamic Resource Allocation in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider power allocation and antenna activation of cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems. We first derive closed-form expressions for the system spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) as functions of the power allocation coefficients and the number of active antennas at the access points (APs). Then, we aim to enhance the EE through jointly optimizing antenna activation and power control. This task leads to a non-convex and mixed-integer design problem with high-dimensional design variables. To address this, we propose a novel DRL-based framework, in which the agent learns to map large-scale fading coefficients to AP activation ratio, antenna coefficient, and power coefficient. These coefficients are then employed to determine the number of active antennas per AP and the power factors assigned to users based on closed-form expressions. By optimizing these parameters instead of directly controlling antenna selection and power allocation, the proposed method transforms the intractable optimization into a low-dimensional learning task. Our extensive simulations demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed scheme. Specifically, in a CFmMIMO system with 40 APs and 20 users, it achieves a 50% EE improvement and 3350 times run time reduction compared to the conventional sequential convex approximation method.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Feature Distillation with Mamba-Transformer Network for Brain Tumor Segmentation with Incomplete Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing brain tumor segmentation methods usually utilize multiple Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities in brain tumor images for segmentation, which can achieve better segmentation performance. However, in clinical applications, some modalities are often missing due to resource constraints, resulting in significant performance degradation for methods that rely on complete modality segmentation. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal feature distillation with Mamba-Transformer hybrid network (MMTSeg) for accurate brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities. We first employ a Multimodal Feature Distillation (MFD) module to distill feature-level multimodal knowledge into different unimodalities to extract complete modality information. We further develop an Unimodal Feature Enhancement (UFE) module to model the semantic relationship between global and local information. Finally, we built a Cross-Modal Fusion (CMF) module to explicitly align the global correlations across modalities, even when some modalities are missing. Complementary features within and across modalities are refined by the Mamba-Transformer hybrid architectures in both the UFE and CMF modules, dynamically capturing long-range dependencies and global semantic information for complex spatial contexts. A boundary-wise loss function is employed as the segmentation loss of the proposed MMTSeg to minimize boundary discrepancies for a distance-based metric. Our ablation study demonstrates the importance of the proposed feature enhancement and fusion modules in the proposed network and the Transformer with Mamba block for improving the performance of brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets demonstrate that the proposed MMTSeg framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods when modalities are missing.</description>

      <title>Joint Bayesian Parameter and Model Order Estimation for Low-Rank Probability Mass Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obtaining a reliable estimate of the joint probability mass function (PMF) of a set of random variables from observed data is a significant objective in statistical signal processing and machine learning. Modelling the joint PMF as a tensor that admits a low-rank canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) has enabled the development of efficient PMF estimation algorithms. However, these algorithms require the rank (model order) of the tensor to be specified beforehand. In real-world applications, the true rank is unknown. Therefore, an appropriate rank is usually selected from a candidate set either by observing validation errors or by computing various likelihood-based information criteria, a procedure which is computationally expensive for large datasets. This paper presents a novel Bayesian framework for estimating the joint PMF and automatically inferring its rank from observed data. We specify a Bayesian PMF estimation model and employ appropriate prior distributions for the model parameters, allowing for tuning-free rank inference via a single training run. We then derive a deterministic solution based on variational inference (VI) to approximate the posterior distributions of various model parameters. Additionally, we develop a scalable version of the VI-based approach by leveraging stochastic variational inference (SVI) to arrive at an efficient algorithm whose complexity scales sublinearly with the size of the dataset. Numerical experiments involving both synthetic data and real movie recommendation data illustrate the advantages of our VI and SVI-based methods in terms of estimation accuracy, automatic rank detection, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Communicate Less, Synthesize the Rest: Latency-aware Intent-based Generative Semantic Multicasting with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have recently shown great success in synthesizing multimedia signals with high perceptual quality, enabling highly efficient semantic communications in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop an intent-aware generative semantic multicasting framework utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. In the proposed framework, the transmitter decomposes the source signal into multiple semantic classes based on the multi-user intent, i.e. each user is assumed to be interested in details of only a subset of the semantic classes. To better utilize the wireless resources, the transmitter sends to each user only its intended classes, and multicasts a highly compressed semantic map to all users over shared wireless resources that allows them to locally synthesize the other classes, namely non-intended classes, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. The signal retrieved at each user is thereby partially reconstructed and partially synthesized utilizing the received semantic map. We design a communication/computation-aware scheme for per-class adaptation of the communication parameters, such as the transmission power and compression rate, to minimize the total latency of retrieving signals at multiple receivers, tailored to the prevailing channel conditions as well as the users' reconstruction/synthesis distortion/perception requirements. The simulation results demonstrate significantly reduced per-user latency compared with non-generative and intent-unaware multicasting benchmarks while maintaining high perceptual quality of the signals retrieved at the users.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a constrained parameter update law is derived in the context of adaptive control. The parameter update law is based on constrained optimization technique where a Lagrangian is formulated to incorporate the constraints on the parameters using inverse Barrier function. The constrained parameter update law is used to develop a adaptive tracking controller and the overall stability of the adaptive controller along with the constrained parameter update law is shown using Lyapunov analysis and development in stability of constrained primal-dual dynamics. The performance of the constrained parameter update law is tested in simulation for keeping the parameters within constraints and convergence to true parameters.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Bayesian Tensor Reconstruction: An Approximate Message Passing Solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD) is a fundamental model for tensor reconstruction. Although the Bayesian framework allows for principled uncertainty quantification and automatic hyperparameter learning, existing methods do not scale well for large tensors because of high-dimensional matrix inversions. To this end, we introduce CP-GAMP, a scalable Bayesian CPD algorithm. This algorithm leverages generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) to avoid matrix inversions and incorporates an expectation-maximization routine to jointly infer the tensor rank and noise power. Through multiple experiments, for synthetic 100x100x100 rank 20 tensors with only 20% elements observed, the proposed algorithm reduces runtime by 82.7% compared to the state-of-the-art variational Bayesian CPD method, while maintaining comparable reconstruction accuracy.</description>

      <title>uPVC-Net: A Universal Premature Ventricular Contraction Detection Deep Learning Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introduction: Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) are common cardiac arrhythmias originating from the ventricles. Accurate detection remains challenging due to variability in electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms caused by differences in lead placement, recording conditions, and population demographics. Methods: We developed uPVC-Net, a universal deep learning model to detect PVCs from any single-lead ECG recordings. The model is developed on four independent ECG datasets comprising a total of 8.3 million beats collected from Holter monitors and a modern wearable ECG patch. uPVC-Net employs a custom architecture and a multi-source, multi-lead training strategy. For each experiment, one dataset is held out to evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Results: uPVC-Net achieved an AUC between 97.8% and 99.1% on the held-out datasets. Notably, performance on wearable single-lead ECG data reached an AUC of 99.1%. Conclusion: uPVC-Net exhibits strong generalization across diverse lead configurations and populations, highlighting its potential for robust, real-world clinical deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Band-limited functions are fundamental objects that are widely used in systems theory and signal processing. In this paper we refine a recent nonparametric, nonasymptotic method for constructing simultaneous confidence regions for band-limited functions from noisy input-output measurements, by working in a Paley-Wiener reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Kernel norm bounds are tightened using a uniformly-randomized Hoeffding's inequality for small samples and an empirical Bernstein bound for larger ones. We derive an approximate threshold, based on the sample size and how informative the inputs are, that governs which bound to deploy. Finally, we apply majority voting to aggregate confidence sets from random subsamples, boosting both stability and region size. We prove that even per-input aggregated intervals retain their simultaneous coverage guarantee. These refinements are also validated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Networks of Causal Abstractions: A Sheaf-theoretic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to improve explainability, robustness, and trustworthiness by leveraging causal models. Recent work has shown that sheaf-theoretic approaches offer a principled framework for representing and aligning causal knowledge across collections of subjective and imperfect causal models connected by relational structures. In this work, we introduce the causal abstraction network (CAN), a general sheaf-theoretic framework for representing, learning, and reasoning across collections of mixture causal models (MCMs). CAN formalizes causal abstraction relations among subjective MCMs operating at different levels of granularity, while remaining agnostic to explicit causal graphs, functional mechanisms, interventional data, or jointly sampled observations. At the theoretical level, we provide a categorical formulation of MCMs and characterize key properties of CANs, including consistency, smoothness, and the existence of global sections, which are related to spectral properties of an associated combinatorial Laplacian. At the methodological level, we address the problem of learning consistent CANs from data by exploiting the compositionality of causal abstractions and necessary conditions for their existence. The learning task decomposes into local problems on the network edges, for which we propose efficient solutions in Gaussian and Gaussian mixture settings. We validate the proposed learning methods on synthetic data and illustrate the practical relevance of the CAN framework through a financial application, demonstrating both recovery and counterfactual reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Data-Augmented Deep Learning for Downhole Depth Sensing and Validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate downhole depth measurement is essential for oil and gas well operations, directly influencing reservoir contact, production efficiency, and operational safety. Collar correlation using a casing collar locator (CCL) is fundamental for precise depth calibration. While neural network has achieved significant progress in collar recognition, preprocessing methods for such applications remain underdeveloped. Moreover, the limited availability of real well data poses substantial challenges for training neural network models that require extensive datasets. This paper presents a system integrated into a downhole toolstring for CCL log acquisition to facilitate dataset construction. Comprehensive preprocessing methods for data augmentation are proposed, and their effectiveness is evaluated using baseline neural network models. Through systematic experimentation across diverse configurations, the contribution of each augmentation method is analyzed. Results demonstrate that standardization, label distribution smoothing, and random cropping are fundamental prerequisites for model training, while label smoothing regularization, time scaling, and multiple sampling significantly enhance model generalization capabilities. Incorporating the proposed augmentation methods into the two baseline models results in maximum F1 score improvements of 0.027 and 0.024 for the TAN and MAN models, respectively. Furthermore, applying these techniques yields F1 score gains of up to 0.045 for the TAN model and 0.057 for the MAN model compared to prior studies. Performance evaluation on real CCL waveforms confirms the effectiveness and practical applicability of our approach. This work addresses the existing gaps in data augmentation methodologies for training casing collar recognition models under CCL data-limited conditions, and provides a technical foundation for the future automation of downhole operations.</description>

      <title>Airy Beamforming for Radiative Near-Field MU-XL-MIMO: Overcoming Half-Space Blockage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The move to next-generation wireless communications with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) brings the communications into the radiative near-field (RNF) region, where distance-aware focusing is feasible. However, high-frequency RNF links are highly vulnerable to blockage in indoor environments dominated by half-space obstacles (walls, corners) that create knife-edge shadows. Conventional near-field focused beams offer high gain in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios but suffer from severe energy truncation and effective-rank collapse in shadowed regions, often necessitating the deployment of auxiliary hardware such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) to restore connectivity. We propose a beamforming strategy that exploits the auto-bending property of Airy beams to mitigate half-space blockage without additional hardware. The Airy beam is designed to ``ride'' the diffraction edge, accelerating its main lobe into the shadow to restore connectivity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a Green's function-based RNF multi-user channel model that analytically reveals singular-value collapse behind knife-edge obstacles; (ii) an Airy analog beamforming scheme that optimizes the bending trajectory to recover the effective channel rank; and (iii) an Airy null-steering method that aligns oscillatory nulls with bright-region users to suppress interference in mixed shadow/bright scenarios. Simulations show that the proposed edge-riding Airy strategy achieves a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement of over 20 dB and restores full-rank connectivity in shadowed links compared to conventional RNF focusing, virtually eliminating outage in geometric shadows and increasing multi-user spectral efficiency by approximately 35\% under typical indoor ELAA configurations. These results demonstrate robust RNF multi-user access in half-space blockage scenarios without relying on RIS.</description>

Abstract: We address real-time sampling and estimation of autoregressive Markovian sources in dynamic yet structurally similar multi-hop wireless networks. Each node caches samples from others and communicates over wireless collision channels, aiming to minimize time-average estimation error via decentralized policies. Due to the high dimensionality of action spaces and complexity of network topologies, deriving optimal policies analytically is intractable. To address this, we propose a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for policy optimization. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our proposed policies are transferable, allowing a policy trained on one graph to be effectively applied to structurally similar graphs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) our proposed policy outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) the trained policies are transferable to larger networks, with performance gains increasing with the number of agents; (iii) the graphical training procedure withstands non-stationarity, even when using independent learning techniques; and (iv) recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity.</description>
