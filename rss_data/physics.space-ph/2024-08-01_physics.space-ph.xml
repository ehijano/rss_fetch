      <title>Whistler waves in the young solar wind: statistics of amplitude and propagation direction from Parker Solar Probe Encounters 1-11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the interplanetary space solar wind plasma, whistler waves are observed in a wide range of heliocentric distance (from ~20 solar radii (RS) to Jupiter's orbit). They are known to interact with solar wind suprathermal electrons (strahl and halo) and to regulate the solar wind heat flux through scattering the strahl electrons. We present the results of applying the technique to determine the whistler wave propagation direction to the spectral data continuously collected by the FIELDS instruments aboard Parker Solar Probe (PSP). The technique was validated based on the results obtained from burst mode magnetic and electric field waveform data collected during Encounter 1. We estimated the effective length of the PSP electric field antennas (EFI) for a variety of solar wind conditions in the whistler wave frequency range and utilized these estimates for determining the whistler wave properties during PSP Encounters 1-11. Our findings show that (1) the enhancement of the whistler wave occurrence rate and wave amplitudes observed between 25-35 RS is predominantly due to the sunward propagating whistler waves population associated with the switchback-related magnetic dips; (2) the anti-sunward or counter-propagating cases are observed at 30-40 RS; (3) between 40-50 RS, sunward and anti-sunward whistlers are observed with comparable occurrence rates; and (4) almost no sunward or counter-propagating whistlers were observed at heliocentric distances above 50 RS.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Fully-formed Forward--Reverse Shock Pair Due to the Interaction Between Two Coronal Mass Ejections at 0.5 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report direct observations of a fast magnetosonic forward--reverse shock pair observed by Solar Orbiter on March 8, 2022 at the short heliocentric distance of 0.5 au. The structure, sharing some features with fully-formed stream interaction regions (SIRs), is due to the interaction between two successive coronal mass ejections (CMEs), never previously observed to give rise to a forward--reverse shock pair. The scenario is supported by remote observations from the STEREO-A coronographs, where two candidate eruptions compatible with the in-situ signatures have been found. In the interaction region, we find enhanced energetic particle activity, strong non-radial flow deflections and evidence of magnetic reconnection. At 1~au, well radially-aligned \textit{Wind} observations reveal a complex event, with characteristic observational signatures of both SIR and CME--CME interaction, thus demonstrating the importance of investigating the complex dynamics governing solar eruptive phenomena.</description>
