      <title>Generalized Macdonald functions and quantum toroidal gl(1) algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Macdonald operator is known to coincide with a certain element of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra in the Fock representation of levels $(1,0)$. A generalization of this operator to higher levels $(r,0)$ can be built using the coproduct structure, it is diagonalized by the generalized Macdonald symmetric functions, indexed by $r$-tuple partitions and depending on $r$ alphabets. In this paper, we extend to the generalized case some of the known formulas obeyed by ordinary Macdonald symmetric functions, such as the $e_1$-Pieri rule or the identity relating them to Whittaker vectors obtained by Garsia, Haiman, and Tesler. We also propose a generalization of the five-term relation, and the Fourier/Hopf pairing. In addition, we prove the factorized expression of the generalized Macdonald kernel conjectured previously by Zenkevich.</description>

      <title>Kullback-Leibler Potential for Non-Ergodic Replication Dynamics:An Information-Theoretic Second Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to quantify and visualize the degradation of fidelity (information degradation) that inevitably accompanies the replication of information within the framework of information thermodynamics and to propose an information-theoretic formulation of the second law based on this phenomenon. While previous research in information thermodynamics has focused on the thermodynamic costs associated with information "erasure'' or "measurement'' through concepts such as Landauer's principle and mutual information, little systematic discussion has addressed the inherently irreversible nature of "replication'' itself and the accompanying degradation of information structure. In this study, we construct a mathematical model of information replication using a discrete Markov model and Gaussian convolution, and quantify changes in information at each replication step: Shannon entropy, cross-entropy, and the Kullback--Leibler divergence (KLD). The monotonic decrease of KLD exhibits a Lyapunov-like property, which can be interpreted as a potential analogous to the free energy in the process by which a nonequilibrium system converges to a particular steady state. Furthermore, we extend this framework to the potential applicability to biological information processes such as DNA replication, showing that the free energy required for degradation and repair can be expressed in terms of KLD. This contributes to building a unified information-thermodynamic framework for operations such as replication, transmission, and repair of information.</description>

      <title>Optimal Remainder Estimates in the Quantization of Complex Projective Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Berezin-Toeplitz quantization of complex projective spaces $\mathbb{CP}^{d-1}$ and obtain full asymptotic expansions of the Berezin transformation and of products of Toeplitz operators. In each case, the remainder is controlled by the next term of the expansion, either through a positivity-preserving transformation or via an operator inequality. This leads to bounds which are optimal in terms of the required regularity and feature sharp or asymptotically sharp constants.</description>

      <title>W-algebras as conformal extensions of affine VOAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a criterion for a vertex operator superalgebra homomorphism from an affine vertex algebra to another vertex superalgebra to be conformal, and an additional criterion that guarantees that this homomorphism is surjective. This situation is applied to W-algebras and W-superalgebras and we list all cases where our criterion applies. This gives many new examples of W-algebras that collapse to affine vertex algebras or are conformal extensions. In particular, we provide many examples of simple W-algebras at non-admissible levels that collapse to admissible level affine vertex algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the group version of a Lie-Leibniz triple. We define a Lie group-rack triple whose tangent structure is a Lie-Leibniz triple. This triple is a generalization of an augmented Lie rack. We show that any finite-dimensional Lie-Leibniz triple can be integrated to a local Lie group-rack triple by generalizing the integration procedure of an augmented Leibniz algebra into an augmented Lie rack.</description>

      <title>No-go theorem for single time-reversal invariant symmetry-protected Dirac fermions in 3+1d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a general method, known as anomaly-matching, to derive new no-go theorems of fermionic lattice models. For our main result, we show that time-reversal invariant 3+1d lattice systems (such as Dirac and Weyl semimetals) can never admit a lone low-energy symmetry-protected Dirac fermion (or node), i.e., it must always come in higher muliplets or be fine-tuned. This theorem holds for both non-interacting and interacting systems as long as the electromagnetic $U(1)_{V,{\rm UV}}$ symmetry is a normal subgroup of the microscopic symmetry group $G_{\mathrm{UV}}$; a condition that is ubiquitous in physical $U(1)_{V,{\rm UV}}$ preserving lattice models. To show that our theorems are tight, we also explore both well-known and new systems that are converses of the no-go theorem, obtained by forfeiting certain assumptions such as a broken time-reversal symmetry (magnetic Weyl semimetal), a non-compact non-on-site $U(1)$ (almost local Dirac node model), no-symmetry protection (fine-tuned Dirac semimetal), or multiple low-energy Dirac nodes (time-reversal invariant Weyl and Dirac semimetals). We will also explicitly demonstrate that, while this theorem strictly prohibits single time-reversal invariant symmetry-protected Dirac node, it does allow for other odd numbers of Dirac nodes under certain circumstances, such as three Dirac nodes in the Fu-Kane-Mele diamond lattice model. This is akin to the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem for an odd number of differently-charged chiral fermions, whose lattice realizations are allowed if certain anomaly cancellation conditions are met.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics in a split Hilbert space: Quantum impurity at the edge of a one-dimensional superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a thermodynamic description of a single magnetic impurity at the edge of a superconducting wire. The impurity exhibits four phases $\unicode{x2014}$ Kondo, Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) I and II, and local moment $\unicode{x2014}$ a phase diagram richer than in the gapless case, contrary to the expectation that the effects of impurities in gapped hosts are less consequential. We derive the impurity contribution to free energy $F_{\rm imp}(T)$ and entropy in each phase: in Kondo phase, the entropy flows monotonically from $\ln 2$ (UV) to 0 (IR) with critical exponents same as that of the conventional Kondo model; in YSR phases, thermal activation of a midgap bound state produces entropy overshoots above $\ln 2$, saturating to $\ln 2$ at high $T$ and approaching either 0 or $\ln 2$ at low $T$ depending on whether impurity is screened or not; in the local-moment phase the impurity remains effectively decoupled, with entropy near $\ln 2$, with some intermediate-temperature features that progressively fade as $\delta \to 0$. These behaviors, including the entropy overshoots in the YSR and local-moment phases, stem from a splitting of the Hilbert space into distinct excitation towers: one in the Kondo phase, two in YSR~I, and three in YSR~II and the local-moment phase. Resolving these tower structures and thereby going beyond conventional TBA yields closed-form analytic expressions for the impurity contribution to the free energy and entropy across the entire phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics in a split Hilbert space: Quantum impurity at the edge of the Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the isotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain with a single edge-coupled impurity of arbitrary exchange strength $J$. The model exhibits four impurity phases. For antiferromagnetic couplings ($J&gt;0$): a \textit{Kondo phase} at weak $J$, where the impurity is screened by many-body excitations and the impurity entropy decreases monotonically from $\ln 2$ at $T \to \infty$ to $0$ at $T\to 0$; and an \textit{antiferromagnetic bound-mode (ABM) phase} at strong $J$, where the impurity screened by an exponentially localized bound mode drives $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T)$ nonmonotonically, with undershoots below zero at intermediate temperatures, while tending to $\ln 2$ as $T \to \infty$ and to $0$ as $T \to 0$. For ferromagnetic couplings ($J&lt;0$): a local-moment (LM) phase at weak $|J|$, where the impurity remains unscreened with $S_{\mathrm{imp}}\to \ln 2$ as $T \to 0$ but exhibits shallow undershoots at intermediate scales; and a \textit{ferromagnetic bound-mode (FBM) phase} at strong $|J|$, where $S_{\mathrm{imp}}=\ln 2$ in both UV and IR limits, yet develops an intermediate-temperature undershoot. We provide an analytic understanding of this behavior, showing that the undershoots originate from the fractionalization of the Hilbert space into several towers of states: for antiferromagnetic couplings this occurs only at strong $J$, driven by boundary-localized bound modes, while for ferromagnetic couplings undershoots occur for all $J&lt;0$, becoming deeper with increasing $|J|$ and vanishing as $J\to 0^{-}$. These bound modes screen the impurity. Incorporating the bound modes and edge states provides a complete analytic understanding of this phenomenon and yields closed expressions for the impurity contribution to free energy and entropy that are valid across all phases. These are checked and found to be in excellent agreement with tensor network and exact diagonalization results.</description>

      <title>On a non-geometric approach to noncommutative gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we generalize the non-geometrical construction of gauge theories, due to S. Deser, to a noncommutative setting. We show that in a free theory, along with the usual local N\"{o}ther current, there is another conserved current, which is non-local. Using the latter as a source for self-interaction, after a well-defined consistency procedure, we arrive at noncommutative gauge theories. In the non-abelian case, the standard restriction, namely that the theory should be $U(N)$ in the fundamental representation, emerges as a consequence of the requirement that the non-local current be Lie algebra valued.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Jaynes-Cummings model with time-dependent coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model stands as a fully quantized, fundamental framework for exploring light-matter interactions, a timely reflection on a century of quantum theory. The time-dependent Jaynes-Cummings (TDJC) model introduces temporal variations in certain parameters, which often require numerical methods. However, under the resonance condition, exact solutions can be obtained, offering insight into a variety of physical scenarios. In this work, we study the resonant TDJC model considering different modulations of the atom-field coupling. The model is presented and an analytical solution derived in a didactic way, allowing us to examine how time-dependent couplings affect atomic population inversion and atom-field entanglement. We also consider an atom traversing a partially cooled cavity, which induces periodicity and reveals the combined effects of atomic motion and thermal fluctuations. The Bloch vector is used to analyze the dynamics of the system, including the atomic state purity, and reveals phenomena such as atomic dipole alignment with the field due to the oscillating coupling, as well as atomic population trapping, which arises by increasing the initial mean thermal photon number.</description>

      <title>Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics II:Reduction of a complex system to a simple one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium thermodynamics far from equilibrium is investigated in terms of a generalized ``Nambu dynamics'' (termed Nambu non-equilibrium thermodynamics (NNET)); NNET consists of Nambu dynamics with multiple Hamiltonians and an entropy causing dissipation.
  It is shown that a general complex non-linear non-equilibrium system far from equilibrium can be reduced to a simple NNET, on the basis of an existence proposition of NNET. This proposition is, however, proved only formally, so that there may exist various obstacles to destroy it.
  Non-equilibrium thermodynamics studied in this article is quite general, including the case in which the product of dynamical and affinity forces forms a higher-order mixed tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any Leray-Hopf weak solution to 3D Navier-Stokes equations with initial values u0 2 H1=2(R3) belong to L1(0; 1; H1=2(R3)) and thus it is regular. For the proof, flrst, we construct a supercritical space, the norm of which is compared to the homogeneous Sobolev H_ 1=2-norm in that it has inverse logarithmic weight very sparsely in the frequency domain. Then we obtain the energy estimates of high frequency parts of the solution which involve the supercritical norm on the right-hand side. Finally, we superpose the energy norm of high frequency parts of the solution to get estimates of the critical norms of the weak solution via the re-scaling argument.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the Teleparallel Robertson-Walker (TRW) $F(T)$ gravity solutions for a Chaplygin gas, and then for any polytropic gas cosmological source. We use the TRW $F(T)$ gravity field equations (FEs) for each $k$-parameter value case and the relevant gas equation of state (EoS) to find the new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. For flat $k=0$ cosmological case, we find analytical solutions valid for any cosmological scale factor. For curved $k=\pm 1$ cosmological cases, we find new approximated teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions for slow, linear, fast and very fast universe expansion cases summarizing by a double power-law function. All the new solutions will be relevant for future cosmological applications on dark matter, dark energy (DE) quintessence, phantom energy, Anti-deSitter (AdS) spacetimes and several other cosmological processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the lens hyperbolic gamma solution to the star-star relation and the flipping relation from three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories on $S^3_b/\mathbb{Z}_r$. We explore that a certain limit of the star-star relation yields the latter symmetry transformation, which exchanges the edge interactions of two outer spins with a centrally sited spin. Furthermore, we obtain more solutions to the flipping relation in terms of the hyperbolic gamma, basic hypergeometric, and the Euler gamma functions.</description>

      <title>Conformally covariant probabilities, operator product expansions, and logarithmic correlations in two-dimensional critical percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large-scale behavior of two-dimensional critical percolation is expected to be described by a conformal field theory (CFT). Moreover, this putative CFT is believed to be of the logarithmic type, exhibiting logarithmic corrections to the most commonly encountered behavior of CFT correlations. While constructing a full-fledged percolation CFT is still an open problem, in this paper we prove various CFT features of the scaling limit of two-dimensional critical percolation. In particular, we provide the first rigorous proof of the emergence of logarithmic singularities in the scaling limit of connection probabilities. More precisely, we study several connectivity events, including arm-events and the events that a vertex is pivotal or belongs to the percolation backbone, whose probabilities have conformally covariant scaling limits and can be interpreted as CFT correlation functions. For some of these probabilities, we prove asymptotic expansions that can be regarded as CFT operator product expansions (OPEs). Our analysis identifies various logarithmic singularities and explains the geometric mechanism that produces them. In follow-up work, the results of this paper are used to define a percolation energy field and its logarithmic partner.</description>

      <title>Moments of characteristic polynomials and their derivatives for $SO(2N)$ and $USp(2N)$ and their application to one-level density in families of elliptic curve $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the ratios theorems, we calculate the leading order terms in $N$ for the following averages of the characteristic polynomial and its derivative: $\left&lt; \left|\Lambda_A(1 )\right| ^{r} \frac{ \Lambda_A'(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi}) }{ \Lambda_A(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi})} \right&gt;_{SO(2N)}$ and $\left&lt; \left|\Lambda_A(1 )\right| ^{r} \frac{ \Lambda_A'(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi}) }{ \Lambda_A(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi})} \right&gt;_{USp(2N)}$. Our expression, derived for integer $r$, permits analytic continuation in $r$ and we conjecture that this agrees with the above averages for non-integer exponents. We use this result to obtain an expression for the one level density of the `excised ensemble', a subensemble of $SO(2N)$, to next-to-leading order in $N$. We then present the analogous calculation for the one level density of quadratic twists of elliptic curve $L$-functions, taking into account a number theoretical bound on the central values of the $L$-functions. The method we use to calculate the above random matrix averages uses the contour integral form of the ratios theorems, which are a key tool in the growing literature on averages of characteristic polynomials and their derivatives, and as we evaluate the next-to-leading term for large matrix size $N$, this leads to some multi-dimensional contour integrals that are slightly asymmetric in the integration variables, which might be useful in other work.</description>

      <title>On Universal Deformations of Compressible Cauchy Elastic Solids Reinforced by Inextensible Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal deformations are those that can be maintained in the absence of body forces and with boundary tractions alone, for all materials within a given constitutive class. We study the universal deformations of compressible isotropic Cauchy elastic solids reinforced by a single family of inextensible fibers. We consider straight fibers parallel to the Cartesian Z-axis in the reference configuration and derive the associated universality constraints, which depend explicitly on the geometry of the deformed fibers. We study universal deformations in two cases: (i) deformed fibers are straight lines, and (ii) deformed fibers have non-vanishing curvature. For case (i), we provide a complete classification. The universality constraints reduce to geometric restrictions on the orthogonal surfaces, which must be planes, circular cylinders, or spheres. This gives one inhomogeneous universal deformation family: the non-isochoric Family Z1 of combined bending and stretching deformations. In addition, Family 0Z consists of homogeneous deformations that respect the inextensibility constraint. We further show that if all principal invariants are constant and deformed fibers remain straight, then only homogeneous universal deformations are possible. For case (ii), when deformed fibers have non-vanishing curvature, the universality constraints become significantly more complex. The existence of universal deformations in this case remains an open problem. In particular, we demonstrate that Family 5 universal deformations of incompressible elasticity, when restricted to satisfy the inextensibility constraint, are no longer universal in fiber-reinforced solids. Finally, we prove that the universal deformations of Cauchy and hyperelastic solids with the same fiber reinforcement coincide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.04676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the Cauchy problem on the Boltzmann equation in the whole space. The goal is to construct global-in-time bounded mild solutions near Maxwellians with the perturbation admitting a polynomial tail in large velocities. The proof is based on the Caflisch's decomposition together with the $L^2- L^\infty$ interplay technique developed by Guo. The full range of both hard and soft potentials under the Grad's cutoff assumption can be covered. The main difficulty to be overcome in case of the whole space is the polynomial time decay of solutions which is much slower than the exponential rate in contrast with the torus case.</description>

      <title>Generalized Charges, Part II: Non-Invertible Symmetries and the Symmetry TFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a d-dimensional quantum field theory (QFT) $\mathfrak{T}$, with a generalized symmetry $\mathcal{S}$, which may or may not be invertible. We study the action of $\mathcal{S}$ on generalized or $q$-charges, i.e. $q$-dimensional operators. The main result of this paper is that $q$-charges are characterized in terms of the topological defects of the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) of $\mathcal{S}$, also known as the ``Sandwich Construction''. The SymTFT is a $(d+1)$-dimensional topological field theory, which encodes the symmetry $\mathcal{S}$ and the physical theory in terms of its boundary conditions. Our proposal applies quite generally to any finite symmetry $\mathcal{S}$, including non-invertible, categorical symmetries. Mathematically, the topological defects of the SymTFT form the Drinfeld Center of the symmetry category $\mathcal{S}$. Applied to invertible symmetries, we recover the result of Part I of this series of papers. After providing general arguments for the identification of $q$-charges with the topological defects of the SymTFT, we develop this program in detail for QFTs in 2d (for general fusion category symmetries) and 3d (for fusion 2-category symmetries).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the singular limit of a chemotaxis model of bacterial collective motion recently introduced in arXiv:2009.11048 [math.AP]. The equation models aggregation-diffusion phenomena with advection that is discontinuous and depends sharply on the gradient of the density itself. The quasi-linearity of the problem poses major challenges in the construction of the solution and complications arise in the proof of regularity. Our method overcomes these obstacle by relying solely on entropy inequalities and the theory of monotone operators. We provide existence, uniqueness and smoothing estimates in any dimensional space.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of Dyson Brownian motion on the circle and multiradial SLE(0+)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show a finite-time large deviation principle (LDP) for "Dyson type" diffusion processes, including Dyson Brownian motion on the circle, for a fixed number of particles as the coupling parameter $\beta=8/\kappa$ tends to $\infty$. We also characterize the large-time behavior of finite-energy and zero-energy systems. Interestingly, the latter correspond to the Calogero-Moser-Sutherland integrable system.
  We use these results to derive an LDP in the Hausdorff metric for multiradial Schramm-Loewner evolution, SLE$_\kappa$, as $\kappa \to 0$, with good rate function being the multiradial Loewner energy. Here, the main difficulty is that the curves have a common target point, preventing the configurational (global) approach. Our proof thus requires topological results in Loewner theory: using a derivative estimate for the radial Loewner map in terms of the energy of its driving function, we show that finite-energy multiradial Loewner hulls are disjoint unions of simple curves, except possibly at their common endpoint.</description>

      <title>Quantum Zeno Effect in Noisy Integrable Quantum Circuits for Impurity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the open quantum system dynamics (in the Trotterized limit) of integrable quantum circuits in the presence of onsite dephasing noise with a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity interacting at the edge. Using a combination of Bethe Ansatz (BA) and exact diagonalization (ED), we study the dynamics of both the bulk and the impurity for the XXX (Heisenberg) and the XX qubit chains in the presence and absence of bulk noise. In the absence of noise, we show that the impurity exhibits two distinct phases, the bound mode phase where the impurity keeps oscillating in time, and the Kondo phase where it decays with Kondo time $t_K$. Turning on the bulk dephasing noise, we find for the two models that in the long time limit in both regimes the quantum Zeno effect takes place where the dynamics of the impurity magnetization slows down as the noise strength $\gamma$ increases. The impurity magnetization in the bound mode regime shows the opposite effect, decaying faster as the noise strength increases for short times ($t \ll 1/\gamma$). We show that the bulk KPZ dynamics of the XXX model is converted to diffusive dynamics as in the XX case studied before by V. Alba, driving both systems to the Zeno effect for the impurity in the long time limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the context of wavefunctions of integrable many-body systems, rational multivariable Baker-Akhiezer (BA) functions were introduced by O. Chalykh, M. Feigin and A. Veselov and, in the case of the trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider system, can be associated with a reduction of the Macdonald symmetric polynomials at $t=q^{-m}$ with integer partition labels substituted by arbitrary complex numbers. A parallel attempt to describe wavefunctions of the bispectral trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider problem was made by M. Noumi and J. Shiraishi who proposed a power series that reduces to the Macdonald polynomials at particular values of parameters. It turns out that this power series also reduces to the BA functions at $t=q^{-m}$, as we demonstrate in this letter. This makes the Macdonald polynomials, the BA functions and the Noumi-Shiraishi (NS) series a closely tied {\it triad} of objects, which have very different definitions, but are straightforwardly related with each other. In particular, theory of the BA functions provides a nice system of simple linear equations, while the NS functions provide a nice way to represent the multivariable BA function explicitly with arbitrary number of variables.</description>

      <title>Travel Time Reliability in Stochastic Kinematic Flow Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the time-dependent relationship between the mean and variance of travel time on a single corridor under rush hour like congestion patterns. To model this phenomenon, we apply the LWR ((Lighthill &amp; Whitham, 1955), (Richards, 1956)) theory on a homogenous freeway with a discontinuous bottleneck at its downstream end, assuming a uni-modal demand profile with a stochastic peak. We establish conditions for typical counterclockwise hysteresis loops under these assumptions. It is demonstrated that shapes of the fundamental diagram which always produce a counterclockwise loop can be interpreted as an indication of aggressive driving behavior, while deviations may occur under defensive driving. This classification enables a detailed explanation of the qualitative physical mechanisms behind this pattern, as well as an analysis of the causes for quantitatively limited deviations. Some of the mathematical properties of the LWR model identified in our analysis have not yet been addressed in the literature and we critically examine the extent to which these reflect actual traffic flow behavior. Our considerations are supported by numerical experiments. The obtained results aim to improve the fundamental understanding of the physical causes of this hysteresis pattern and to facilitate its better estimation in traffic planning and control.</description>

      <title>Accumulation of Charge on an Extremal Black Hole's Event Horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically analyze the behavior of a charged scalar field on a fixed extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om background. We find an extension of the Aretakis instability characterized by an accumulation of charge on the extremal event horizon. In particular, when the charge coupling to the scalar field is sufficiently large, the charge density on the horizon asymptotes to a nonzero constant at late times. By constructing monochromatic initial data at the onset of charged superradiance, we give evidence supporting the claim that this instability is connected to the presence of a nearly zero-damped mode. Throughout this work, we employ a numerical integration scheme in compactified double-null coordinates, which allows us to capture the asymptotic behavior of the matter at the boundaries of the spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We investigate normalized solutions for doubly nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on the real line with a defocusing standard nonlinearity and a focusing nonlinear point interaction of $\delta$--type at the origin. We provide a complete characterization of existence and uniqueness for normalized solutions and for energy ground states for every value of the nonlinearity powers. We show that the interplay between a defocusing standard and a focusing point nonlinearity gives rise to new phenomena with respect to those observed with single nonlinearities, standard combined nonlinearities, and combined focusing standard and pointwise nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>An alternative interpretation of the Grioli gyroscope suspension points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of all possible regular precessions of a heavy asymmetric body with a fixed point not coinciding with the center of mass. The calculations are done in terms of the rotation matrix, by writing the Euler-Poisson equations with all involved vectors parameterized in the Laboratory frame. It is shown that a regular precession is possible if the suspension point is chosen on the straight lines (lying in the principal plane) which are frontiers of the regions where, as the distance from the center of mass increases, the interchange of the intermediate and largest moments of inertia occurs. Like the spin of an electron in quantum mechanics, the frequency of regular precession in classical mechanics turns out to be rigidly fixed by two values, i.e., quantized.</description>

      <title>Quantum i.i.d. Steady States in Open Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how a quantum many-body state is maintained stably as a nonequilibrium steady state is of fundamental and practical importance for exploration and exploitation of open quantum systems. We establish a general equivalent condition for an open quantum many-body system governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad dynamics under local drive and/or dissipation to have a quantum independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) steady state. We present a sufficient condition for a system to have a quantum i.i.d. steady state by identifying a set of operators that commute with arbitrary quantum i.i.d. states. In particular, a set of quantum i.i.d. states is found to be an invariant subset of time evolution superoperators for systems that satisfy the sufficient condition. These findings not only identify a class of models with exactly solvable steady states but also lead to a no-go theorem that precludes quantum entanglement and spatial correlations in a broad class of quantum many-body steady states in a dissipative environment.</description>

      <title>Competing color superconductivity and color Kondo effect in quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy between two coherent states in relativistic Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A numerical setup for investigating the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy between two coherent states is presented for a scalar massive Quantum Field Theory in ($1+1$)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. These states are constructed using smeared Weyl operators compactly supported in two diamond regions belonging to the right Rindler wedge. Using this setup, we verified the known properties of the relative entropy, namely: positivity, increase with the size of the spacetime regions considered, decrease with the increase of the mass parameter. A linear increase with respect to the spatial distance between the two diamond regions is also observed.</description>
