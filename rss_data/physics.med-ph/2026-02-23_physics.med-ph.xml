      <title>Simple non-invasive methods for obtaining the intensity and timing of arterial pulse waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contraction of the left ventricle of the heart increases aortic root blood pressure (P), diameter (D) and blood velocity (U). When contraction diminishes, all three properties decrease. These perturbations propagate down the systemic arteries as the S wave and D wave, respectively. Peak carotid artery S-wave intensity is diminished and delayed in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). A clinical trial demonstrated that these changes can be used to detect HFrEF with high sensitivity and specificity. Assessment of wave intensity and timing conventionally requires high-frequency, temporally and spatially coincident measurement of changes in P and U or D and U over the cardiac cycle. The practical difficulty of making such measurements accurately and noninvasively limits clinical utility. Here we test simpler methods by using numerical models of wave propagation and data from the clinical trial. We show that methods based on measuring only one of P, D or U can provide good surrogates for the full P-U and D-U methods. The best results were obtained when using measurement of D to assess wave timing. That gave Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROCs) indistinguishable from those based on the full D-U method, with areas under the ROC of up to 0.905 when timing was anchored to the ECG rather than to other waves. Measuring vessel diameter over the cardiac cycle is technically simple and would be a cost-effective way of screening for HFrEF in primary care. Other metrics, similarly measured, might also allow screening for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).</description>

      <title>Prompt Gamma Timing in Carbon Therapy: First Experimental Results with the TIARA Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of range monitoring for particle therapy, this study presents the first experimental results obtained with the TIARA detector using carbon-ion beams at the CNAO clinical center in Pavia, Italy. TIARA is based on the Prompt Gamma Timing (PGT) technique, which measures the time of flight (TOF) between incident ions and prompt gamma rays (PGs) emitted during nuclear interactions in the target. While the TIARA prototype has previously been validated with protons, carbons present a more challenging scenario due to their higher linear energy transfer, nuclear fragmentation products, and the continuous beam time structure of synchrotron accelerators. Experiments were performed by irradiating PMMA targets of different thicknesses with 200 MeV/u carbon beams. A coincidence time resolution of 279$\pm$35 ps FWHM was achieved, outperforming results previously obtained with protons at the same facility. A range accuracy of 4.74$\pm$0.36 mm at a 2$\sigma$ confidence level was measured at clinical intensity, when considering 5600 detected PGs, corresponding to the grouping of four irradiation spots of 2.4$\cdot$10$^6$ ions each. Overall, the results demonstrate that PGT-based range monitoring remains viable for carbon-ion beams, although increased background from secondary protons indicates that detector configuration adaptations are required.</description>
