      <title>On identities in connected topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1957, Nemytskii proved the following fact: if in a locally compact or in an Abelian connected group there is a neighborhood of the identity in which some identity holds, then it holds in the entire group. The following question was also posed there: Let G be a connected topological group. In some neighborhood of the identity of the group G the identity $x^3=1$ holds. Is it true that then the identity $x^3=1$ holds in the entire group $G$? The same question is posed for the identity $gx^2 = x^2g$, where $g$ is a fixed element of the group. Platonov formulated the following generalized formulation of the Mytselsky problem: for a topological connected group, is it true that if the identity holds in a neighborhood of the identity, then the identity holds everywhere? In this paper, a negative answer to Platonov's question is given, the following theorem is proven: if $n &gt; 1010$ is odd, then there exists a connected topological group in which the identity $x^n=1$ holds in some neighborhood of unity, but not in the entire group.</description>

      <title>Compact subspaces of the space of separately continuous functions with the cross-uniform topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two natural topologies on the space $S(X\times Y,Z)$ of all separately continuous functions defined on the product of two topological spaces $X$ and $Y$ and ranged into a topological or metric space $X$. These topologies are the cross-open topology and the cross-uniform topology. We show that these topologies coincides if $X$ and $Y$ are pseudocompacts and $Z$ is a metric space. We prove that a compact space $K$ embeds into $S(X\times Y,Z)$ for infinite compacts $X$, $Y$ and a metrizable space $Z\supseteq\mathbb{R}$ if and only if the weight of $K$ is less than the sharp cellularity of both spaces $X$ and $Y$.</description>

      <title>Nullhomotopic and Generating Knight's Tours on Non-Orientable Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate closed knight's tours on M\"obius strip and Klein bottle chess boards. In particular, we characterize the board dimensions that admit tours that are nullhomotopic and the board dimensions that admit tours that realize generators of the fundamental groups of each of the surfaces.</description>

      <title>Menger and consonant sets in the Sacks model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using an iterated Sacks forcing and topological games, we prove that the existence of a totally imperfect Menger set in the Cantor cube with cardinality continuum, is independent from ZFC. We also analyze structures of Hurewicz or consonant subsets of the Cantor cube in the Sacks model.</description>

      <title>The class and dynamics of $\alpha$-balanced Polish groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each ordinal $\alpha&lt;\omega_1$, we introduce the class of $\alpha$-balanced Polish groups. These classes form a hierarchy that completely stratifies the space between the class of Polish groups admitting a two-side-invariant metric (TSI) and the class of Polish groups admitting a complete left-invariant metric (CLI). We establish various closure properties, provide connections to model theory, and we develop a boundedness principle for CLI groups by showing that $\alpha$-balancedness is an initial segment of a regular coanalytic rank.
  In the spirit of Hjorth's turbulence theory we also introduce "generic $\alpha$-unbalancedness": a new dynamical condition for Polish $G$-spaces which serves as an obstruction to classification by actions of $\alpha$-balanced Polish groups. We use this to provide, for each $\alpha&lt;\omega_1$, an action of an $\alpha$-balanced Polish group whose orbit equivalence relation is strongly generically ergodic against actions of any $\beta$-balanced Polish group with $\beta&lt;\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Discrete Microlocal Morse Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish several results combining discrete Morse theory and microlocal sheaf theory in the setting of finite posets and simplicial complexes. Our primary tool is a computationally tractable description of the bounded derived category of sheaves on a poset with the Alexandrov topology. We prove that each bounded complex of sheaves on a finite poset admits a unique (up to isomorphism of complexes) minimal injective resolution, and we provide algorithms for computing minimal injective resolution of an injective complex, as well as several useful functors between derived categories of sheaves. For the constant sheaf on a simplicial complex, we give asymptotically tight bounds on the complexity of computing the minimal injective resolution using those algorithms. Our main result is a novel definition of the discrete microsupport of a bounded complex of sheaves on a finite poset. We detail several foundational properties of the discrete microsupport, as well as a microlocal generalization of the discrete homological Morse theorem and Morse inequalities.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibility of extending operations of topological and semitopological algebras to their Stone-\v{C}ech compactification and factorization of continuous functions through homomorphisms to metrizable algebras are investigated. Most attention is paid to pseudocompact and compact algebras.</description>

      <title>The Macias topology on integral domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript a recent topology on the positive integers generated by the collection of $\{\sigma_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ where $\sigma_n:=\{m: \gcd(n,m)=1\}$ is generalized over integral domains. Some of its topological properties are studied. Properties of this topology on infinite principal ideal domains that are not fields are also explored, and a new topological proof of the infinitude of prime elements is obtained (assuming the set of units is finite or not open), different from those presented in the style of H. Furstenberg. Finally, some problems are proposed.</description>
