      <title>Finding radio transients with anomaly detection and active learning based on volunteer classifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we explore the applicability of unsupervised machine learning algorithms to the task of finding radio transients. Facilities such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will provide huge volumes of data in which to detect rare transients; the challenge for astronomers is how to find them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of anomaly detection algorithms using 1.3 GHz light curves from the SKA precursor MeerKAT. We make use of three sets of descriptive parameters ('feature sets') as applied to two anomaly detection techniques in the Astronomaly package and analyse our performance by comparison with citizen science labels on the same dataset. By using transients found by volunteers as our ground truth, we demonstrate that anomaly detection techniques can recall over half of the radio transients in the 10 per cent of the data with the highest anomaly scores. We find that the choice of anomaly detection algorithm makes a minimal (sub-one per cent) level difference, but that feature set choice is crucial, especially when considering available resources for human inspection and/or follow-up. Active learning, where human labels are given for just 2 per cent of the data, improves recall by up to 10 percentage points, depending on the feature-model pair. The best performing feature-model pairs result in a factor of 5 times fewer sources requiring vetting by experts. This is the first effort to apply anomaly detection techniques to finding radio transients and shows great promise for application to other datasets, and as a real-time transient detection system for upcoming large surveys.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{synax}$: A Differentiable and GPU-accelerated Synchrotron Simulation Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce synax, a novel library for automatically differentiable simulation of Galactic synchrotron emission. Built on the JAX framework, synax leverages JAX's capabilities, including batch acceleration, just-in-time compilation, and hardware-specific optimizations (CPU, GPU, TPU). Crucially, synax uses JAX's automatic differentiation (AD) mechanism, enabling precise computation of derivatives with respect to any model parameters. This feature facilitates powerful inference algorithms, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and gradient-based optimization, which enables inference over models that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive. In its initial release, synax supports synchrotron intensity and polarization calculations down to GHz frequencies, alongside several models of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), cosmic ray (CR) spectra, and thermal electron density fields. We demonstrate the transformative potential of AD for tasks involving full posterior inference using gradient-based techniques or Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) optimization. Notably, we show that GPU acceleration brings a twenty-fold enhancement in efficiency, while HMC achieves a two-fold improvement over standard random walk Metropolis-Hastings (RWMH) when performing inference over a four-parameter test model. HMC still works on a more complex, 16-parameter model while RWMH fails to converge. Additionally, we showcase the application of synax in optimizing the GMF based on the Haslam 408 MHz map, achieving residuals with a standard deviation below 1 K.</description>

      <title>Estimating Atmospheric Wind Speeds From Gemini Planet Imager AO Telemetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Earth's atmosphere is comprised of turbulent layers that result in speckled and blurry images from ground-based visible and infrared observations. Adaptive Optics (AO) systems are employed to measure the perturbed wavefront with a wavefront sensor (WFS) and correct for these distortions with a deformable mirror. Therefore, understanding and characterising the atmosphere is crucial for the design and functionality of AO systems. One parameter for characterizing the atmosphere is the atmospheric coherence time, which is a function of the effective wind velocity of the atmosphere. This parameter dictates how fast the AO system needs to correct for the atmosphere. If not fast enough, phenomena such as the wind butterfly effect can occur, hindering high-contrast coronographic imaging. This effect is a result of fast, strong, high-altitude turbulent layers. This paper presents two methods for estimating the effective wind velocity, using pseudo-open loop WFS slopes. The first method uses a spatial-temporal covariance map and the second uses the power spectral density of the defocus term. We show both simulated results and preliminary results from the Gemini Planet Imager AO telemetry.</description>

      <title>Domain adaptation in application to gravitational lens finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next decade is expected to see a tenfold increase in the number of strong gravitational lenses, driven by new wide-field imaging surveys. To discover these rare objects, efficient automated detection methods need to be developed. In this work, we assess the performance of three domain adaptation techniques -- Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA), Wasserstein Distance Guided Representation Learning (WDGRL), and Supervised Domain Adaptation (SDA) -- in enhancing lens-finding algorithms trained on simulated data when applied to observations from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. We find that WDGRL combined with an ENN-based encoder provides the best performance in an unsupervised setting and that supervised domain adaptation is able to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between lenses and common similar-looking false positives, such as spiral galaxies, which is crucial for future lens surveys.</description>

      <title>Design of a custom wideband camera for MISTRAL imager-spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MISTRAL is a visible and near infrared imager and spectrograph working with the $1.93m$ telescope at L'Observatoire de Haute-Provence. The goal of the present project is to design and build one custom lens covering the entire working band 370-1000 nm with an enhanced throughput and resolution. The proposed design has the focal length of 100 mm with f/#=2 and consists of 5 lenses with 2 aspheres. It is capable to work in spectroscopy or direct imaging mode with the spectral resolving power up to R590-1675 or energy concentration of 84% within 1 pixel. The throughput varies from 79 to 98% in the main band of 400-1000 nm with a commercial AR coating and could be yet improved with a custom one. We also demonstrate that with this image quality can be maintained in a &lt;10% margin with practically reachable tolerances.</description>

      <title>Optical design options for Pollux: UV spectropolarimeter project for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pollux is a project of UV spectropolarimeter proposed as a European contribution for the planned NASA-led Habitable Worlds Observatory. In the present study we consider design options for four spectral channels. The two main channels operate in the range of 118-472 nm. We consider a few design options depending on the hosting telescope size and the approach to correct the aberrations in the camera part and show that the resolving power of R &gt; 90 000 is reachable. In addition, we study 2 other channels: a visible and near infrared spectropolarimeter, which could reach up to 1050 nm or 1800 nm depending on the detector choice, and a far UV channel operating in the range of 100-120 nm. We also provide two design options with different resolution and main disperser type for these channels.</description>

      <title>HARMONI at ELT: tolerance analysis and expected as-build imaging performance of the infrared spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HARMONI is the first light visible and near-IR integral field spectrograph for the ELT. It covers a large spectral range from 470nm to 2450nm with resolving powers from 3300 to 18000 and spatial sampling from 60mas to 4mas. It can operate in two Adaptive Optics modes - SCAO (including a High Contrast capability) and LTAO - or with NOAO. The project is preparing for Final Design Reviews. The integral field spectrograph is a key sub-system of HARMONI instrument, which forms the 2D spectral image and projects it onto the scientific detector. It has 40 operational modes with different platescales and gratings covering the band of 811-2450 nm with three resolution grades. In each of this configurations the as-built spectrograph wave-front error is strictly limited. We perform the sensitivity analysis for measurable and unknown errors and build the errors budget on this basis. Then we correct the values for the actual technological limits and perform a three-stage Monte-Carlo analysis combined with simulation of a few specific effect as the holographic grating wavefront error. Eventually, we show that it is possible to reach the target image quality in terms of the wavefront error and spectral resolution for the entire sub-system with practically feasible tolerances on design parameters.</description>

      <title>Application of convolutional neural networks for extensive air shower separation in the SPHERE-3 experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new SPHERE-3 telescope is being developed for cosmic rays spectrum and mass composition studies in the 5--1000~PeV energy range. Registration of extensive air showers using reflected Cherenkov light method applied in the SPHERE detector series requires a good trigger system for accurate separation of events from the background produced by starlight and airglow photons reflected from the snow. Here we present the results of convolutional networks application for the classification of images obtained from Monte Carlo simulation of the detector. Detector response simulations include photons tracing through the optical system, silicon photomultiplier operation and electronics response and digitization process. The results are compared to the SPHERE-2 trigger system performance.</description>

      <title>SynCOM: A tool for simulating coronal outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SynCOM is a package of procedures written in IDL (Interactive Data Language) that simulates transient solar wind flows. Each function within SynCOM handles specific tasks, such as initializing parameters, generating synthetic profiles, creating Gaussian blobs to represent solar wind features, and producing high-resolution images of the solar corona. This modular design allows users to call or customize individual functions independently, providing flexibility to adjust simulations to different observational or solar wind conditions. The software architecture is designed to facilitate SynCOM, which effectively creates synthetic datasets for testing and verifying feature tracking algorithms. It also takes advantage of the robust capabilities of the IDL for high-performance scientific computing</description>

      <title>Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center (MMDC): A Tool for Retrieving and Modeling Multi-temporal, Multi-wavelength and Multi-messenger Data from Blazar Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center (MMDC) is a web-based tool designed for accessing and retrieving multiwavelength and multimessenger data from blazar observations.MMDC facilitates the construction and interactive visualization of time-resolved multi-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars by integrating: \textit{(i)} archival data from over 80 catalogs and databases, \textit{(ii)} optical data from all-sky survey facilities such as ASAS-SN, ZTF, and Pan-STARRS, and \textit{(iii)} newly analyzed datasets in the optical/UV band from \textit{Swift}-UVOT, in the X-ray band from \textit{Swift}-XRT and NuSTAR observations, and the high-energy $\gamma$-ray band from \textit{Fermi}-LAT observations. MMDC distinguishes itself from other online platforms by the large quantity of available data. For instance, it includes data from all blazar observations by \textit{Swift} and NuSTAR, as well as the results of detailed spectral analysis in the $\gamma$-ray band during different emission states, covering the period from 2008 to 2023. Another important distinguishing feature of MMDC is its ability to enable precise, self-consistent theoretical modeling of the observed data using machine learning algorithms trained on leptonic and lepto-hadronic models, which consider the injection of particles and all relevant cooling processes. MMDC is an innovative tool which significantly enhances blazar research by providing a comprehensive framework for data accessibility, analysis, and theoretical interpretation, thereby advancing our understanding of blazar emissions and the underlying astrophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Generating X-ray transit profiles with batman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an adaptation of the exoplanet transit model code batman, in order to permit the generation of X-ray transits. Our underlying extended coronal model assumes an isothermal plasma that is radially symmetric. While this ignores the effect of bright, active regions, observations of transits in X-rays will require averaging across multiple epochs of data for the foreseeable future, significantly reducing the importance of more complex modelling. Our publicly available code successfully generates the predicted W-shaped transit profile in X-rays due to the optically thin nature of the emission, which concentrates the expected observational emission around the limb of the photospheric stellar disc. We provide some examples based on the best known X-ray transit target, HD 189733b, and examine the effect of varying the planet size, coronal temperature, and impact parameter on the resulting transit profile. We also derived scaling relationships for how the overall transit detectability is affected by changing these parameters. Over most of the parameter space, we find that the detectability scales linearly with the cross-sectional area of the planet in X-rays. The relationship with increasing coronal temperature is less fixed, but averages out to a power law with slope $-1/4$ except when the impact parameter is high. Indeed, varying impact parameter has little effect on detectability at all until it approaches unity.</description>

      <title>Supersonic turbulence simulations with GPU-based high-order Discontinuous Galerkin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the numerical performance of a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) hydrodynamics implementation when applied to the problem of driven, isothermal supersonic turbulence. While the high-order element-based spectral approach of DG is known to efficiently produce accurate results for smooth problems (exponential convergence with expansion order), physical discontinuities in solutions, like shocks, prove challenging and may significantly diminish DG's applicability to practical astrophysical applications. We consider whether DG is able to retain its accuracy and stability for highly supersonic turbulence, characterized by a network of shocks. We find that our new implementation, which regularizes shocks at sub-cell resolution with artificial viscosity, still performs well compared to standard second-order schemes for moderately high Mach number turbulence, provided we also employ an additional projection of the primitive variables onto the polynomial basis to regularize the extrapolated values at cell interfaces. However, the accuracy advantage of DG diminishes significantly in the highly supersonic regime. Nevertheless, in turbulence simulations with a wide dynamic range that start with supersonic Mach numbers and can resolve the sonic point, the low numerical dissipation of DG schemes still proves advantageous in the subsonic regime. Our results thus support the practical applicability of DG schemes for demanding astrophysical problems that involve strong shocks and turbulence, such as star formation in the interstellar medium. We also discuss the substantial computational cost of DG when going to high order, which needs to be weighted against the resulting accuracy gain. For problems containing shocks, this favours the use of comparatively low DG order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: orbitize! is a package for Bayesian modeling of the orbital parameters of resolved binary objects from time series measurements. It was developed with the needs of the high-contrast imaging community in mind, and has since also become widely used in the binary star community. A generic orbitize! use case involves translating relative astrometric time series, optionally combined with radial velocity or astrometric time series, into a set of derived orbital posteriors. This paper is published alongside the release of orbitize! version 3.0, which has seen significant enhancements in functionality and accessibility since the release of version 1.0 (Blunt et al., 2020).</description>

Abstract: We report the results of an extensive set of simulations exploring the sensitivity of the BlackCAT CubeSat to long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). BlackCAT is a NASA APRA-funded CubeSat mission for the detection and real-time sub-arcminute localization of high-redshift ($z\gtrsim 3.5$) GRBs. Thanks to their luminous and long-lived afterglow emissions, GRBs are uniquely valuable probes of high-redshift star-forming galaxies and the intergalactic medium. In addition, each detected GRB with a known redshift serves to localize a region of high-redshift star formation in three dimensions, enabling deep follow-on searches for host galaxies and associated local and large-scale structures. We explore two distinct models for the GRB redshift distribution and luminosity function, both consistent with Swift observations. We find that, for either model, BlackCAT is expected to detect a mean of 42 bursts per year on-orbit, with 6.7% to 10% of these at $z&gt;3.5$. BlackCAT bursts will be localized to $r_{90} \lesssim 55^{\prime\prime}$ precision and reported to the community within seconds. Due to the mission orbit and pointing scheme, bursts will be located in the night sky and well-placed for deep multiwavelength follow-up observations. BlackCAT is on schedule to achieve launch readiness in 2025.</description>
