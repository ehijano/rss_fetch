      <title>A Parametric Rate-Distortion Model for Video Transcoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the surge in video streaming applications has been fueled by the increasing accessibility of the internet and the growing demand for network video. As users with varying internet speeds and devices seek high-quality video, transcoding becomes essential for service providers. In this paper, we introduce a parametric rate-distortion (R-D) transcoding model. Our model excels at predicting transcoding distortion at various rates without the need for encoding the video. This model serves as a versatile tool that can be used to achieve visual quality improvement (in terms of PSNR) via trans-sizing. Moreover, we use our model to identify visually lossless and near-zero-slope bitrate ranges for an ingest video. Having this information allows us to adjust the transcoding target bitrate while introducing visually negligible quality degradations. By utilizing our model in this manner, quality improvements up to 2 dB and bitrate savings of up to 46% of the original target bitrate are possible. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our model in video transcoding rate distortion prediction.</description>

      <title>Arena: A Patch-of-Interest ViT Inference Acceleration System for Edge-Assisted Video Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of edge computing has made real-time intelligent video analytics feasible. Previous works, based on traditional model architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, etc.), employ various strategies to filter out non-region-of-interest content to minimize bandwidth and computation consumption but show inferior performance in adverse environments. Recently, visual foundation models based on transformers have shown great performance in adverse environments due to their amazing generalization capability. However, they require a large amount of computation power, which limits their applications in real-time intelligent video analytics. In this paper, we find visual foundation models like Vision Transformer (ViT) also have a dedicated acceleration mechanism for video analytics. To this end, we introduce Arena, an end-to-end edge-assisted video inference acceleration system based on ViT. We leverage the capability of ViT that can be accelerated through token pruning by only offloading and feeding Patches-of-Interest (PoIs) to the downstream models. Additionally, we employ probability-based patch sampling, which provides a simple but efficient mechanism for determining PoIs where the probable locations of objects are in subsequent frames. Through extensive evaluations on public datasets, our findings reveal that Arena can boost inference speeds by up to $1.58\times$ and $1.82\times$ on average while consuming only 54% and 34% of the bandwidth, respectively, all with high inference accuracy.</description>

      <title>Seeing Text in the Dark: Algorithm and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localizing text in low-light environments is challenging due to visual degradations. Although a straightforward solution involves a two-stage pipeline with low-light image enhancement (LLE) as the initial step followed by detector, LLE is primarily designed for human vision instead of machine and can accumulate errors. In this work, we propose an efficient and effective single-stage approach for localizing text in dark that circumvents the need for LLE. We introduce a constrained learning module as an auxiliary mechanism during the training stage of the text detector. This module is designed to guide the text detector in preserving textual spatial features amidst feature map resizing, thus minimizing the loss of spatial information in texts under low-light visual degradations. Specifically, we incorporate spatial reconstruction and spatial semantic constraints within this module to ensure the text detector acquires essential positional and contextual range knowledge. Our approach enhances the original text detector's ability to identify text's local topological features using a dynamic snake feature pyramid network and adopts a bottom-up contour shaping strategy with a novel rectangular accumulation technique for accurate delineation of streamlined text features. In addition, we present a comprehensive low-light dataset for arbitrary-shaped text, encompassing diverse scenes and languages. Notably, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on this low-light dataset and exhibits comparable performance on standard normal light datasets. The code and dataset will be released.</description>

      <title>State Space Model for New-Generation Network Alternative to Transformers: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the post-deep learning era, the Transformer architecture has demonstrated its powerful performance across pre-trained big models and various downstream tasks. However, the enormous computational demands of this architecture have deterred many researchers. To further reduce the complexity of attention models, numerous efforts have been made to design more efficient methods. Among them, the State Space Model (SSM), as a possible replacement for the self-attention based Transformer model, has drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this paper, we give the first comprehensive review of these works and also provide experimental comparisons and analysis to better demonstrate the features and advantages of SSM. Specifically, we first give a detailed description of principles to help the readers quickly capture the key ideas of SSM. After that, we dive into the reviews of existing SSMs and their various applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, graph, multi-modal and multi-media, point cloud/event stream, time series data, and other domains. In addition, we give statistical comparisons and analysis of these models and hope it helps the readers to understand the effectiveness of different structures on various tasks. Then, we propose possible research points in this direction to better promote the development of the theoretical model and application of SSM. More related works will be continuously updated on the following GitHub: https://github.com/Event-AHU/Mamba_State_Space_Model_Paper_List.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Understand Visual Anomalies? Uncovering LLM Capabilities in Zero-shot Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are markedly proficient in deriving visual representations guided by natural language. Recent explorations have utilized LVLMs to tackle zero-shot visual anomaly detection (VAD) challenges by pairing images with textual descriptions indicative of normal and abnormal conditions, referred to as anomaly prompts. However, existing approaches depend on static anomaly prompts that are prone to cross-semantic ambiguity, and prioritize global image-level representations over crucial local pixel-level image-to-text alignment that is necessary for accurate anomaly localization. In this paper, we present ALFA, a training-free approach designed to address these challenges via a unified model. We propose a run-time prompt adaptation strategy, which first generates informative anomaly prompts to leverage the capabilities of a large language model (LLM). This strategy is enhanced by a contextual scoring mechanism for per-image anomaly prompt adaptation and cross-semantic ambiguity mitigation. We further introduce a novel fine-grained aligner to fuse local pixel-level semantics for precise anomaly localization, by projecting the image-text alignment from global to local semantic spaces. Extensive evaluations on the challenging MVTec and VisA datasets confirm ALFA's effectiveness in harnessing the language potential for zero-shot VAD, achieving significant PRO improvements of 12.1% on MVTec AD and 8.9% on VisA compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot VAD approaches.</description>

      <title>Quality of Experience Oriented Cross-layer Optimization for Real-time XR Video Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended reality (XR) is one of the most important applications of beyond 5G and 6G networks. Real-time XR video transmission presents challenges in terms of data rate and delay. In particular, the frame-by-frame transmission mode of XR video makes real-time XR video very sensitive to dynamic network environments. To improve the users' quality of experience (QoE), we design a cross-layer transmission framework for real-time XR video. The proposed framework allows the simple information exchange between the base station (BS) and the XR server, which assists in adaptive bitrate and wireless resource scheduling. We utilize the cross-layer information to formulate the problem of maximizing user QoE by finding the optimal scheduling and bitrate adjustment strategies. To address the issue of mismatched time scales between two strategies, we decouple the original problem and solve them individually using a multi-agent-based approach. Specifically, we propose the multi-step Deep Q-network (MS-DQN) algorithm to obtain a frame-priority-based wireless resource scheduling strategy and then propose the Transformer-based Proximal Policy Optimization (TPPO) algorithm for video bitrate adaptation. The experimental results show that the TPPO+MS-DQN algorithm proposed in this study can improve the QoE by 3.6% to 37.8%. More specifically, the proposed MS-DQN algorithm enhances the transmission quality by 49.9%-80.2%.</description>

      <title>BERT-like Pre-training for Symbolic Piano Music Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.05223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a benchmark study of symbolic piano music classification using the masked language modelling approach of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). Specifically, we consider two types of MIDI data: MIDI scores, which are musical scores rendered directly into MIDI with no dynamics and precisely aligned with the metrical grid notated by its composer and MIDI performances, which are MIDI encodings of human performances of musical scoresheets. With five public-domain datasets of single-track piano MIDI files, we pre-train two 12-layer Transformer models using the BERT approach, one for MIDI scores and the other for MIDI performances, and fine-tune them for four downstream classification tasks. These include two note-level classification tasks (melody extraction and velocity prediction) and two sequence-level classification tasks (style classification and emotion classification). Our evaluation shows that the BERT approach leads to higher classification accuracy than recurrent neural network (RNN)-based baselines.</description>

      <title>Audio is all in one: speech-driven gesture synthetics using WavLM pre-trained model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of co-speech gestures for digital humans is an emerging area in the field of virtual human creation. Prior research has made progress by using acoustic and semantic information as input and adopting classify method to identify the person's ID and emotion for driving co-speech gesture generation. However, this endeavour still faces significant challenges. These challenges go beyond the intricate interplay between co-speech gestures, speech acoustic, and semantics; they also encompass the complexities associated with personality, emotion, and other obscure but important factors. This paper introduces "diffmotion-v2," a speech-conditional diffusion-based and non-autoregressive transformer-based generative model with WavLM pre-trained model. It can produce individual and stylized full-body co-speech gestures only using raw speech audio, eliminating the need for complex multimodal processing and manually annotated. Firstly, considering that speech audio not only contains acoustic and semantic features but also conveys personality traits, emotions, and more subtle information related to accompanying gestures, we pioneer the adaptation of WavLM, a large-scale pre-trained model, to extract low-level and high-level audio information. Secondly, we introduce an adaptive layer norm architecture in the transformer-based layer to learn the relationship between speech information and accompanying gestures. Extensive subjective evaluation experiments are conducted on the Trinity, ZEGGS, and BEAT datasets to confirm the WavLM and the model's ability to synthesize natural co-speech gestures with various styles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the new task of generating Illustrated Instructions, i.e., visual instructions customized to a user's needs. We identify desiderata unique to this task, and formalize it through a suite of automatic and human evaluation metrics, designed to measure the validity, consistency, and efficacy of the generations. We combine the power of large language models (LLMs) together with strong text-to-image generation diffusion models to propose a simple approach called StackedDiffusion, which generates such illustrated instructions given text as input. The resulting model strongly outperforms baseline approaches and state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs; and in 30% of cases, users even prefer it to human-generated articles. Most notably, it enables various new and exciting applications far beyond what static articles on the web can provide, such as personalized instructions complete with intermediate steps and pictures in response to a user's individual situation.</description>

      <title>A Survey on 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (GS) has recently emerged as a transformative technique in the realm of explicit radiance field and computer graphics. This innovative approach, characterized by the utilization of millions of learnable 3D Gaussians, represents a significant departure from mainstream neural radiance field approaches, which predominantly use implicit, coordinate-based models to map spatial coordinates to pixel values. 3D GS, with its explicit scene representation and differentiable rendering algorithm, not only promises real-time rendering capability but also introduces unprecedented levels of editability. This positions 3D GS as a potential game-changer for the next generation of 3D reconstruction and representation. In the present paper, we provide the first systematic overview of the recent developments and critical contributions in the domain of 3D GS. We begin with a detailed exploration of the underlying principles and the driving forces behind the emergence of 3D GS, laying the groundwork for understanding its significance. A focal point of our discussion is the practical applicability of 3D GS. By enabling unprecedented rendering speed, 3D GS opens up a plethora of applications, ranging from virtual reality to interactive media and beyond. This is complemented by a comparative analysis of leading 3D GS models, evaluated across various benchmark tasks to highlight their performance and practical utility. The survey concludes by identifying current challenges and suggesting potential avenues for future research in this domain. Through this survey, we aim to provide a valuable resource for both newcomers and seasoned researchers, fostering further exploration and advancement in applicable and explicit radiance field representation.</description>
