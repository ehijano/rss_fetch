      <title>$\mathcal{F}$-harmonic 3-forms and the Type IIA flow on 6-dimensional symplectic Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of $\mathcal{F}$-harmonic forms and the long-time behavior of the Type IIA flow on certain nilpotent and solvable symplectic Lie algebras (and corresponding nilmanifolds and solvmanifolds). In particular, we demonstrate that the Type IIA flow in these cases are very useful to detect desired geometric structures including Lagrangian torus fibrations and harmonic almost complex structures.</description>

      <title>Planarity and convexity for pinched ancient solutions of mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a parabolically scale-invariant variation of the planarity estimate in \cite{Na22} for higher codimension mean curvature flow, borrowing ideas from work of Brendle--Huisken--Sinestrari \cite{BHS}. Additionally, we prove convexity for pinched complete ancient solutions of the mean curvature flow in codimension one. Then we put these estimates together to characterize certain pinched complete ancient solutions and shrinkers in higher codimension. We include some discussion of future research directions in this area of mean curvature flow.</description>

      <title>On the eta invariant of (2,3,5) distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Rumin complex associated with a generic rank two distribution on a closed 5-manifold. The Rumin differential in middle degrees gives rise to a self-adjoint differential operator of Heisenberg order two. We study the eta function and the eta invariant of said operator, twisted by unitary flat vector bundles. For (2,3,5) nilmanifolds this eta invariant vanishes but the eta function is nontrivial, in general. We establish a formula expressing the eta function of (2,3,5) nilmanifolds in terms of more elementary functions.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Einstein structures and Hitchin's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove (Theorem 1.1.) that a class of quasi-Einstein structures on closed manifolds must admit a Killing vector field. This extends the rigidity theorem obtained in \cite{DL23} for the extremal black hole horizons and completes the classification of compact quasi-Einstein surfaces in this class. We also explore special cases of the quasi-Einstein equations related to integrability and the Hitchin equations, as well as to Einstein-Weyl structures and Kazdan-Warner type PDEs. This leads to novel explicit examples of quasi-Einstein structures on (non-compact) surfaces and on $S^2 \times S^1$.</description>

      <title>Cohomology for Linearized Boundary-Value Problems on General Riemannian Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for casting the solvability and uniqueness conditions of linearized geometric boundary-value problems in cohomological terms. The theory is designed to be applicable without assumptions on the underlying Riemannian structure and provides tools to study the emergent cohomology explicitly. To achieve this generality, we extend Hodge theory to sequences of Douglas--Nirenberg systems that interact via Green's formulae, overdetermined ellipticity, and a condition we call the order-reduction property, replacing the classical requirement that the sequence form a cochain complex. This property typically arises from linearized constraints and gauge equivariance, as demonstrated by several examples, including the linearized Einstein equations with sources, where the cohomology encodes geometric and topological data.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis in Conformally Flat Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on a baryogenesis mechanism originating from the theory of causal fermion systems, we analyze its main geometric and analytic features in conformally flat spacetimes. An explicit formula is derived for the rate of baryogenesis in these spacetimes, which depends on the mass $m$ of the particles, the conformal factor $\Omega$ and a future directed timelike vector field $u$ (dubbed the regularizing vector field). Our analysis covers Friedmann-Lema{\^i}tre-Robertson-Walker, Milne and Milne-like spacetimes. It sets the ground for concrete, quantitative predictions for specific cosmological spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Equations of motion for dynamical systems with angular momentum on Finsler geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article aims to derive equations of motion for dynamical systems with angular momentum on Finsler geometries. To this end, we apply Souriau's Principle of General Covariance, which is a geometrical framework to derive diffeomorphism invariant equations of motion. The equations we obtain are the generalization of that of Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) on Finsler geometries, and we give their conserved quantities which turn out to be formally identical to the Riemannian case.
  These equations share the same properties as the MPD equations, and we mention different choices possible for supplementary conditions to close this system of equations. These equations have an additional requirement, which is the choice of what defines the tangent direction of the Finsler manifold, since the velocity and momentum are not parallel in general. After choosing the momentum as the Finsler direction and to define the center of mass, we give the complete equations of motion in 3 spatial dimensions, which we find coincide to previously known equations for Finsler spinoptics, and novel equations in 4 dimensions for massive and massless dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Stability of neckpinch singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.06118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability of neckpinch singularities. We show that if a mean curvature flow $\{M_t\}$ develops only finitely many neckpinch singularities at the first singular time, then the mean curvature flow starting at any sufficiently small perturbation of $M_0$ can also develop only neckpinch type singularities at the first singular time. We also show stability of nondegenerate neckpinch singularities in the above sense, which speaks in favor of stability of Type I singularities.</description>

      <title>Metric Lines in Engel-type Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of sub-Riemannian Manifolds, a relevant question is: what are the \enquote{metric lines} (i.e., the isometric embedding of the real line)? This article presents a conjecture classifying the metric lines in Carnot groups and takes the first steps in answering this question for \enquote{arbitrary rank} Carnot groups. We classify the metric lines of the Engel-type groups $\Eng(n)$ (Theorem 1.2), whose sub-Riemannian structure is defined on a non-integrable distribution of rank $n+1$. Our approach is a new method, called the sequence method, which we began to develop to study metric lines in the jet space.</description>

      <title>$\ast$-$\eta$-Ricci solitons and Einstein metrics on a weak $\beta$-Kenmotsu manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak almost contact manifolds (i.e., the complex structure on the contact distribution is replaced by a nonsingular skew-symmetric tensor), defined by the author and R. Wolak, allow a new look at the classical theory. An important case of these manifolds, which is locally a warped or twisted product, is a weak $\beta$-Kenmotsu manifold defined by the author and D.S. Patra. In the paper, the concept of the $\ast$-Ricci tensor is adapted to weak almost contact manifolds, the interaction of the $\ast$-$\eta$-Ricci soliton with the weak $\beta$-Kenmotsu structure is studied and new characteristics of Einstein metrics are obtained.</description>

      <title>Scale-Dependent Poincar\'{e} inequalities, log-Sobolev inequality and the stability of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle on the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21039v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a general scale-dependent Poincar\'{e}-Hardy type identity involving a vector field on the hyperbolic space. By choosing suitable parameter, potential and vector field in this identity, we can recover, as well as derive new versions of and substantially improve several Poincar\'{e} type, Hardy type and Poincar\'{e}-Hardy type inequalities in the literature. We also investigate weighted Poincar\'{e} inequalities on hyperbolic space, where the weight functions depend on a scaling parameter. This leads to a new family of scale-dependent Poincar\'{e} inequalities with Gaussian type measure on the hyperbolic space which is of independent interest. As a result, we derive both scale-dependent and scale-invariant $L^{2}$-stability results for the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in this setting. Finally, we study the logarithmic Sobolev inequality with Gaussian measure on the hyperbolic spaces, that is still missing in the literature.</description>
