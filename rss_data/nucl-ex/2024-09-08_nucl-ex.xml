      <title>Higher-order symmetry plane correlations in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlations between event-by-event fluctuations of symmetry planes are measured in Pb$-$Pb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV recorded by the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider. This analysis is conducted using the Gaussian Estimator technique, which is insensitive to biases from correlations between different flow amplitudes. The study presents, for the first time, the centrality dependence of correlations involving up to five different symmetry planes. The correlation strength varies depending on the harmonic order of the symmetry plane and the collision centrality. Comparisons with measurements from lower energies indicate no significant differences within uncertainties. Additionally, the results are compared with hydrodynamic model calculations. Although the model predictions provide a qualitative explanation of the experimental results, they overestimate the data for some observables. This is particularly true for correlators that are sensitive to the non-linear response of the medium to initial-state anisotropies in the collision system. As these new correlators provide unique information - independent of flow amplitudes - their usage in future model developments can further constrain the properties of the strongly-interacting matter created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Exploring nuclear structure with multiparticle azimuthal correlations at the LHC</title>

Abstract: Understanding nuclear structure provides essential insights into the properties of atomic nuclei. In this paper, details of the nuclear structure of $^{\rm 129}$Xe, such as the quadrupole deformation and the nuclear diffuseness, are studied by extensive measurements of anisotropic-flow-related observables in Xe$-$Xe collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.44$ TeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The results are compared with those from Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV for a baseline, given that the $^{\rm 208}$Pb nucleus is not deformed. Furthermore, comprehensive comparisons are performed with a state-of-the-art hybrid model using IP-Glasma+MUSIC+UrQMD. It is found that among various IP-Glasma+MUSIC+UrQMD calculations with different values of nuclear parameters, the one using a nuclear diffuseness parameter of $a_0=0.492$ and a nuclear quadrupole deformation parameter of $\beta_2=0.207$ provides a better description of the presented flow measurements. These studies represent an important step towards a thorough exploration of the imaging power of nuclear collisions at ultrarelativistic energy and the search for the imprint of nuclear structure on various flow observables in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. The findings demonstrate the potential of nuclear structure studies at the TeV energy scale and highlight that the LHC experiments can complement existing low-energy experiments on nuclear structure studies.</description>

      <title>J/$\psi$-hadron correlations at midrapidity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the measurement of inclusive, non-prompt, and prompt J/$\psi$-hadron correlations by the ALICE Collaboration at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The correlations are studied at midrapidity ($|y| &lt; 0.9$) in the transverse momentum ranges $p_{\rm T} &lt; 40~\text{GeV}/c$ for the J/$\psi$ and $0.15 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 10$ GeV/$c$ and $|\eta|&lt;0.9$ for the associated hadrons. The measurement is based on minimum bias and high multiplicity data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of $L_{\text{int}} = 34~\text{nb}^{-1}$ and $L_{\text{int}} = 6.9~\text{pb}^{-1}$, respectively. In addition, two more data samples are employed, requiring, on top of the minimum bias condition, a threshold on the tower energy of $E = 4$ and $9~\text{GeV}$ in the ALICE electromagnetic calorimeters, which correspond to integrated luminosities of $L_{\text{int}} = 0.9~\text{pb}^{-1}$ and $L_{\text{int}} = 8.4~\text{pb}^{-1}$, respectively. The results are presented as associated hadron yields per J/$\psi$ trigger as a function of the azimuthal angle difference between the associated hadrons and J/$\psi$ mesons. The integrated near-side and away-side correlated yields are also extracted as a function of the J/$\psi$ transverse momentum. The measurements are discussed in comparison to PYTHIA calculations.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of $\Upsilon$ production at forward rapidity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement of $\Upsilon$(1S), $\Upsilon$(2S), and $\Upsilon$(3S) yields as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity density, $\textrm{d}N_{\textrm{ch}}/\textrm{d}\eta$, using the ALICE experiment at the LHC, is reported in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV. The $\Upsilon$ meson yields are measured at forward rapidity ($2.5 &lt; y &lt; 4$) in the dimuon decay channel, whereas the charged-particle multiplicity is defined at central rapidity ($|\eta| &lt; 1$). Both quantities are divided by their average value in minimum bias events to compute the self-normalized quantities. The increase of the self-normalized $\Upsilon$(1S), $\Upsilon$(2S), and $\Upsilon$(3S) yields is found to be compatible with a linear scaling with the self-normalized $\textrm{d}N_{\textrm{ch}}/\textrm{d}\eta$, within the uncertainties. The self-normalized yield ratios of excited-to-ground $\Upsilon$ states are compatible with unity within uncertainties. Similarly, the measured double ratio of the self-normalized $\Upsilon$(1S) to the self-normalized J/$\psi$ yields, both measured at forward rapidity, is compatible with unity for self-normalized charged-particle multiplicities beyond one. The measurements are compared with theoretical predictions incorporating initial or final state effects.</description>
