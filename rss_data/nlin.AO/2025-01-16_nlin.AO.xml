      <title>The Physics of Life: Exploring Information as a Distinctive Feature of Living Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the idea that information is an essential and distinctive feature of living systems. Unlike non-living systems, living systems actively acquire, process, and use information about their environments to respond to changing conditions, sustain themselves, and achieve other intrinsic goals. We discuss relevant theoretical frameworks such as ``semantic information'' and ``fitness value of information''. We also highlight the broader implications of our perspective for fields such as origins-of-life research and astrobiology. In particular, we touch on the transition to information-driven systems as a key step in abiogenesis, informational constraints as determinants of planetary habitability, and informational biosignatures for detecting life beyond Earth. We briefly discuss experimental platforms which offer opportunities to investigate these theoretical concepts in controlled environments. By integrating theoretical and experimental approaches, this perspective advances our understanding of life's informational dynamics and its universal principles across diverse scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Megastable quantization in generalized pilot-wave hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical particle in a harmonic potential gives rise to a continuous energy spectra, whereas the corresponding quantum particle exhibits countably infinite quantized energy levels. In recent years, classical non-Markovian wave-particle entities that materialize as walking droplets have been shown to exhibit various hydrodynamic quantum analogs, including quantization in a harmonic potential by displaying few coexisting limit cycle orbits. By considering a truncated-memory stroboscopic pilot-wave model of the system in the low dissipation regime, we obtain a classical harmonic oscillator perturbed by oscillatory non-conservative forces that displays countably infinite coexisting limit-cycle states, also known as \emph{megastability}. Using averaging techniques in the low-memory regime, we derive analytical approximations of the orbital radii, orbital frequency and Lyapunov energy function of this megastable spectrum, and further show average energy conservation along these quantized states. Our formalism extends to a general class of self-excited oscillators and can be used to construct megastable spectrum with different energy-frequency relations.</description>
