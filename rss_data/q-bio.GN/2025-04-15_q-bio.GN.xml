      <title>Classifying Copy Number Variations Using State Space Modeling of Targeted Sequencing Data: A Case Study in Thalassemia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thalassemia, a blood disorder and one of the most prevalent hereditary genetic disorders worldwide, is often caused by copy number variations (CNVs) in the hemoglobin genes. This disorder has incredible diversity, with a large number of distinct profiles corresponding to alterations of different regions in the genes. Correctly classifying an individual's profile is critical as it impacts treatment, prognosis, and genetic counseling. However, genetic classification is challenging due to the large number of profiles worldwide, and often requires a large number of sequential tests. Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS), which characterizes segments of an individual's genome, has the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of testing and increase accuracy. In this work, we introduce a probabilistic state space model for profiling thalassemia from targeted NGS data, which naturally characterize the spatial ordering of the genes along the chromosome. We then use decision theory to choose the best profile among the different options. Due to our use of Bayesian methodology, we are also able to detect low-quality samples to be excluded from consideration, an important component of clinical screening. We evaluate our model on a dataset of 57 individuals, including both controls and cases with a variety of thalassemia profiles. Our model has a sensitivity of 0.99 and specificity of 0.93 for thalassemia detection, and accuracy of 91.5\% for characterizing subtypes. Furthermore, the specificity and accuracy rise to $0.96$ and 93.9\% when low-quality samples are excluded using our automated quality control method. This approach outperforms alternative methods, particularly in specificity, and is broadly applicable to other disorders.</description>

      <title>Inferring genotype-phenotype maps using attention models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting phenotype from genotype is a central challenge in genetics. Traditional approaches in quantitative genetics typically analyze this problem using methods based on linear regression. These methods generally assume that the genetic architecture of complex traits can be parameterized in terms of an additive model, where the effects of loci are independent, plus (in some cases) pairwise epistatic interactions between loci. However, these models struggle to analyze more complex patterns of epistasis or subtle gene-environment interactions. Recent advances in machine learning, particularly attention-based models, offer a promising alternative. Initially developed for natural language processing, attention-based models excel at capturing context-dependent interactions and have shown exceptional performance in predicting protein structure and function. Here, we apply attention-based models to quantitative genetics. We analyze the performance of this attention-based approach in predicting phenotype from genotype using simulated data across a range of models with increasing epistatic complexity, and using experimental data from a recent quantitative trait locus mapping study in budding yeast. We find that our model demonstrates superior out-of-sample predictions in epistatic regimes compared to standard methods. We also explore a more general multi-environment attention-based model to jointly analyze genotype-phenotype maps across multiple environments and show that such architectures can be used for "transfer learning" - predicting phenotypes in novel environments with limited training data.</description>

      <title>Multimodal 3D Genome Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning techniques have driven significant progress in various analytical tasks within 3D genomics in computational biology. However, a holistic understanding of 3D genomics knowledge remains underexplored. Here, we propose MIX-HIC, the first multimodal foundation model of 3D genome that integrates both 3D genome structure and epigenomic tracks, which obtains unified and comprehensive semantics. For accurate heterogeneous semantic fusion, we design the cross-modal interaction and mapping blocks for robust unified representation, yielding the accurate aggregation of 3D genome knowledge. Besides, we introduce the first large-scale dataset comprising over 1 million pairwise samples of Hi-C contact maps and epigenomic tracks for high-quality pre-training, enabling the exploration of functional implications in 3D genomics. Extensive experiments show that MIX-HIC can significantly surpass existing state-of-the-art methods in diverse downstream tasks. This work provides a valuable resource for advancing 3D genomics research.</description>
