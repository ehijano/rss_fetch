      <title>A Four-Level Ontological Framework for Quantum Field Theory: From Quantum Vacuum to Phenomenal Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the foundational challenges in both Quantum Field Theory and the philosophy of physics lies in the traditional binary classification of entities as either real or unreal. The classical view posits that material entities are real, while mental constructs or theoretical entities are unreal. However, quantum phenomena such as virtual particles challenge this simplistic dichotomy. These unobservable entities, by influencing measurable phenomena, raise profound questions about the nature and modes of existence. To address this, we propose a four-level ontological hierarchy that spans from the quantum vacuum and the virtual level to the quantum level and phenomenal reality, providing a coherent continuum from potentiality to actualization. This framework not only clarifies the interpretation of quantum theory but also offers a unified perspective linking the unobservable with the observable. In QFT, virtual particles play a crucial role in mediating forces and in correcting the measurable properties of real particles. They arise within the mathematical structure of Feynman diagrams and, despite being unobservable, produce real, measurable effects such as the Lamb shift and the Casimir effect. Philosophically, this raises deep ontological questions: if unobservable entities affect measurable phenomena, can they truly be dismissed as unreal? Conversely, if they are real, what mode of existence do they possess? The traditional dichotomy of real versus unreal is thus insufficient for interpreting the ontological implications of quantum processes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a four-level ontological hierarchy.</description>

      <title>From Heisenberg and Schr\"odinger to the P vs. NP Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This essay offers an epistemological reinterpretation of the foundational divide between matrix mechanics and wave mechanics. Though formally equivalent, the two theories embody distinct modes of knowing: procedural construction and recognitional verification. These epistemic architectures anticipate, in philosophical form, the logical asymmetry expressed by the P versus NP problem in computational complexity. Here, the contrast between efficient generation and efficient recognition is treated not as a mathematical taxonomy but as a framework for understanding how knowledge is produced and validated across physics, computation, and cognition. The essay reconstructs the mathematical history of quantum mechanics through the original derivations of Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Pascual Jordan, Paul Dirac, Erwin Schr\"odinger, Paul Ehrenfest, and Wolfgang Pauli, culminating in John von Neumann's unification of both approaches within the formalism of Hilbert space. By juxtaposing Heisenberg's algorithmic formalism with Schr\"odinger's representational one, it argues that their divergence reveals a structural feature of scientific reasoning itself-the enduring tension between what can be procedurally constructed and what can only be recognized.</description>

      <title>Quantum Logic and Meaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08450v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper gives a formulation of quantum logic in the abstract algebraic setting laid out by Dunn and Hardegree (2001). On this basis, it provides a comparative analysis of viable quantum logical bivalent semantics and their classical counterparts, thereby showing that the truth-functional status of classical and quantum connectives is not as different as usually thought. Then it points out that bivalent semantics for quantum logic -- compatible with realism about quantum mechanics -- can be maintained, albeit at the price of truth-functionality. Finally, the paper critically addresses Geoffrey Hellman's argument (1980) that this lack of truth-functionality entails a change of meaning between classical and quantum connectives.</description>

      <title>Nearly forgotten results in development of physical cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It would be reasonable to recall some critical issues in physical cosmology development. GR was created by A. Einstein in 1915. In 1917 Einstein proposed the first (static) cosmological model. Soon after the A. Eddington proved that the model is unstable therefore it can not be realizable in nature. In 1922 and 1924 A. A. Friedmann found non-stationary solutions for cosmological equations written in the framework of GR. In 1927 G. Lemaitre obtained very similar results and, in addition, he derived the Hubble law (E. Hubble obtained this law from observations). Unfortunately, G. Lemaitre published his paper in not very popular Belgium journal. In 1931 Lemaitre proposed the first version of hot Universe model (he called it hypothesis of the primeval atom). In his book Lemaitre predicted even a background radiation as a signature of his model.
  One of the important property of the Lemaitre -- Gamow model was a prediction of CMB radiation with a temperature around a few K. It was recalled that the discovery of CMB radiation was done by T. Shmaonov in 1956 and his paper was published in 1957 (several years before Penzias and Wilson).
  In 1965, 1970 E. B. Gliner proposed vacuum like equation of matter which could correspond to exponential explosion of the Universe which was later called inflation. For decades in USSR, Friedmann's cosmological non-stationary models were treated as purely mathematical results without cosmologocal applications. On September 16, 1925 passed away untimely and it would be reasonable to remind today his great contribution in physical cosmology since the authors of book on Friedmann wrote that "similarly to Copernicus who forced the Earth to move Friedmann forced the Universe to expand".</description>
