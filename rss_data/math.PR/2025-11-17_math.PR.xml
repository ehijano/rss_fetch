      <title>Convergence of the extended Kalman filter with small and state-dependent noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear filtering problems are encountered in many applications, and one solution approach is the extended Kalman filter, which is not always convergent. Therefore, it is crucial to identify conditions under which the extended Kalman filter provides accurate approximations. This paper generalizes two significant results from Picard (1991) on the efficiency of the continuous-time extended Kalman filter to a more general setting where the observation noise may be state-dependent but does not allow signal reconstruction from the quadratic variation of the observation process as in epidemic models. Firstly, we show that when the observation's drift coefficient is strongly injective and the signal's and observation's drift become nearly linear for the diffusion scaling coefficient $\epsilon \to 0$, the estimation error is of order $\sqrt{\epsilon}$. Subsequently, we establish conditions under which the impact of the initial filtering error decays exponentially fast.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a class of recursive distributional equations including the resistance of the series-parallel graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a class of recursive distributional equations (RDE's) proposed by Gurel-Gurevich [17] and involving a bias parameter $p$, which includes the logarithm of the resistance of the series-parallel graph. A discrete-time evolution equation resembling a nonlinear, fractional Fisher-KPP equation is derived to describe the CDF's of solutions. When the bias parameter $p = \frac{1}{2}$, this equation is shown to have a PDE scaling limit, from which distributional limit theorems for the RDE are derived. Applied to the series-parallel graph, the results imply that $N^{-1/3} \log R^{(N)}$ has a nondegenerate limit when $p = \frac{1}{2}$, as conjectured by Addario-Berry, Cairns, Devroye, Kerriou, and Mitchell [1].</description>

      <title>General multi-scale estimates for Lyapunov data of Perron-Frobenius matrices. The case of diluted autocatalytic chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autocatalytic chemical reaction networks are dynamical systems whose linearization around zero, dX/dt = AX, is represented by a Perron-Frobenius matrix A with positive Lyapunov exponent; this exponent gives the growth rate of the species concentration vector X in the diluted regime, i.e. in a vicinity of zero. We introduce here a new, general recursive procedure providing precise quantitative information about Lyapunov data, namely, the Lyapunov eigenvalue, and left and right eigenvectors. Our estimates are based on a multi-scale algorithm inspired from Wilson's renormalization group method in quantum field theory, and Markov chain arguments introduced in (Nghe &amp; Unterberger). They are compatible with the very scarce knowledge of kinetic rates (coefficients of A) generally available in chemistry, and take on the form of simple rational functions of the latter.</description>

      <title>Explosion and implosion of birth-and-death continuous-time random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for explosion and implosion of birth-and-death (non-Markov) continuous-time random walks. In other words, we obtain conditions for $\infty$ to be accessible and for it to be an entrance point. We derive the analytical regularity criteria in terms of the appropriate scale function and the speed measure, which involve transition probabilities and the Laplace transform of the waiting times. We show that these criteria closely resemble classical ones for diffusions and Markov birth-and-death processes. We then calculate explicit conditions of regularity for semi-Markov processes with waiting times that have (a) finite first moments; (b) regularly varying tails (in particular, $\alpha$-stable distribution).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we characterize continuous stationary fields via generalized Langevin dynamics. This gives natural connections between stationary fields, stationary increment fields, self-similar fields, and generalized Langevin dynamics. Our contribution extends some recently proved similar results for stochastic processes to the case of continuous random fields. As a by-product, we introduce some new results on multiple Riemann-Stieltjes integrals.</description>

      <title>Tripod in uniform spanning tree and three-sided radial SLE$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a bounded $3$-polygon $(\Omega; x_1, x_2, x_3)$ with three marked boundary points $x_1, x_2, x_3\in\partial\Omega$ and suppose $(\Omega^{\delta}; x_1^{\delta}, x_2^{\delta}, x_3^{\delta})$ is an approximation of $(\Omega; x_1, x_2, x_3)$ on $\delta$-scaled hexagonal lattice. We consider uniform spanning tree (UST) in $\Omega^{\delta}$ with wired boundary conditions. Conditional on the event that both branches from $x_1^{\delta}$ and $x_2^{\delta}$ hit the boundary through $x_3^{\delta}$, the two branches meet at a point $\mathfrak{t}^{\delta}$ which we call trifurcation, and the union of the three branches from $x_j^{\delta}$ to $\mathfrak{t}^{\delta}$ form a tripod in the UST. We compute the scaling limit of the tripod: the distribution of trifurcation is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure with explicit density; given the trifurcation, the conditional law of the tripod is three-sided radial SLE$_2$. Interestingly, the scaling limit of the observable for trifurcation coincides with the partition function for three-sided radial SLE$_2$. The proof for the distribution of the trifurcation relies on Fomin's formula [Fom01] and tools from [CS11, CW21]. The proof of the convergence to three-sided radial SLE$_2$ relies on tools developped recently from [HPW25]. We believe the conclusion is true for a large family of discrete lattice approximations, however, our proof uses the geometry of the hexagonal lattice in an essential way.</description>

      <title>Sharp asymptotics for the maximal distance from the boundary to the nucleus of a typical Poisson-Voronoi cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the typical Poisson-Voronoi cell in the Euclidean space R d and in particular the maximal distance D from a vertex of that cell to its nucleus. We provide a sharp asymptotics for the tail distribution of D. As a byproduct, we prove that the extremal index related to the sequence of such distances for all Voronoi cells included in a large box is equal to (2d) -1 . This confirms a conjecture formulated by Chenavier and Robert. The explicit constant appearing in the estimate of the tail probability of D is proved to be the mean volume of a random simplex formed by uniformly distributed points on the unit sphere conditioned on satisfying some spatial condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Actions in the Airy line ensemble represent distances from an infinitely far object. We characterize the Airy sheet by S(x,.)=T^x(.,1), where T^x is the unique action in the Airy line ensemble satisfying a growth condition depending on x.
  This provides a new simple framework for establishing convergence to the Airy sheet. We present simple conceptual proofs of such results in the case of Brownian last passage, the O'Connell-Yor semidiscrete polymer, the log-gamma polymer and the KPZ equation.</description>

      <title>Stability conditions of the $N$-model with a waiting time dependent threshold on the diagonal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $N$-model queueing system with a waiting time dependent threshold on the diagonal: the service discipline is First--Come--First--Served, but type-1 jobs can only be served by server 2 if their waiting time exceeds a deterministic threshold. We prove the necessary and sufficient stability conditions for this model -- an intuitive result that has not been established in literature up to this point. Our proof relies on coupling the queue length process to a carefully constructed upper (and lower) bound system, and establishing stochastic dominance for the queue length process.</description>

      <title>Animal social networks as intersections graphs of random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study here the social network generated by the asynchronous visits, to a fixed set of sites, of mobile agents modelled as independent random walks on the plane lattice. The social network is constructed by assuming that a group of agents are associated if they have visited the same set of sites within a finite time interval. This construction is an instance of a random intersection graph, and has been used in the literature to study association networks in a number of animal species. We characterize the mathematical structure of these networks, which we view as one-mode projections of suitable bipartite graphs or, equivalently, as 2-sections of the corresponding hypergraphs. We determine analytically the probability distribution of the random bipartite graphs and hypergraphs associated to this construction, and suggest that association networks generated by the use of common resources are better described by hypergraphs rather than simple projected graphs, that miss important information regarding the actual associations among the agents.</description>

      <title>Boundary Compactified Imaginary Liouville Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the construction of Compactified Imaginary Liouville Theory (CILT), a non-unitary logarithmic Conformal Field Theory (CFT) defined on closed surfaces, to surfaces with boundary. Starting from a compactified Gaussian Free Field (GFF) with Neumann boundary condition, we perturb it by adding in curvature terms and exponential potentials on both the bulk and the boundary. In physics, this theory is conjectured to describe the scaling limit of loop models such as the Potts and $O(n)$ models. To define it mathematically, the curvature terms require a detailed analysis of the topology, and the potential terms are defined using the imaginary Guassian Multiplicative Chaos (GMC). We prove that the resulting probabilistic path integral satisfies the axioms of CFT, including Segal's gluing axioms. This work provides the foundation for future studies of boundary CILT and will also help with the understanding of CILT.</description>

      <title>Phase transition for conditional covariance matrices estimated by importance sampling, and implications for cross-entropy schemes in high dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the estimation of covariance matrices by importance sampling arising in the cross-entropy (CE) algorithm, we study a random matrix model $\hat \Sigma = {\bf X} L {\bf X}^\top$ with two distinct features: $\bf X$ and $L$ are dependent, and $L$ is heavy-tailed. In the high-dimensional regime $d \to \infty$, we prove under suitable assumptions that a phase transition occurs in the polynomial regime $n = d^\kappa$, with $n$ the sample size. Namely, we prove that $\lVert \hat \Sigma - E \hat \Sigma \rVert \Rightarrow 0$ if and only if $\kappa &gt; \kappa_*$ for some threshold $\kappa_*$ determined by the behavior of the maximum likelihood ratios. Moreover, we identify general situations where $\kappa_* = 1/\lambda_1$, with $\lambda_1$ the smallest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of the auxiliary distribution used to estimate $\hat \Sigma$ by importance sampling. This suggests that importance sampling will work better with covariance matrices having a large smallest eigenvalue. We carry this insight into recent CE schemes proposed to estimate the probability of high-dimensional rare events. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that better CE schemes are also the ones with larger smallest eigenvalue, even though these algorithms were not designed to smooth the spectrum. This new spectral interpretation raises stimulating questions and opens research directions for the design of efficient high-dimensional algorithms.</description>

      <title>Incentive Attacks in BTC: Short-Term Revenue Changes and Long-Term Efficiencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bitcoin's (BTC) Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA) has been a source of vulnerability for incentive attacks such as selfish mining, block withholding and coin hopping strategies. In this paper, first, we rigorously study the short-term revenue change per hashpower of the adversarial and honest miners for these incentive attacks. To study the long-term effects, we introduce a new efficiency metric defined as the revenue/cost per hashpower per time for the attacker and the honest miners.
  Our results indicate that the short-term benefits of intermittent mining strategies are negligible compared to the original selfish mining attack, and in the long-term, selfish mining provides better efficiency. We further demonstrate that a coin hopping strategy between BTC and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) relying on BTC DAA benefits the loyal honest miners of BTC in the same way and to the same extent per unit of computational power as it does the hopper in the short-term. For the long-term, we establish a new boundary between the selfish mining and coin hopping attack, identifying the optimal efficient strategy for each parameter.
  For block withholding strategies, it turns out, the honest miners outside the pool profit from the attack, usually even more than the attacker both in the short-term and the long-term. Moreover, a power adjusting withholding attacker does not necessarily observe a profit lag in the short-term. It has been long thought that the profit lag of selfish mining is among the main reasons why such an attack has not been observed in practice. We show that such a barrier does not apply to power adjusting attacks and relatively small pools are at an immediate threat.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the convergence of the densities of a sequence of nonlinear functionals of an underlying Gaussian process to the density of a Gamma distribution. The key idea of our work is a new density formula for random variables in the setting of Markov diffusion generators, which yields a special representation for the density of a Gamma distribution. Via this representation, we are able to provide precise estimates on the distance between densities while developing the techniques of Malliavin calculus and Stein's method suitable to Gamma approximation at the density level. We first focus our study on the case of random variables living in a fixed Wiener chaos of an even order for which the bound for the difference of the densities can be dominated by a linear combination of moments up to order four. We then study the case of general Gaussian functionals with possibly infinite chaos expansion. Finally, we provide an application to random variables living in the second Wiener chaos.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms on Poisson and Cox Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hierarchical clustering algorithm, the Clustroid Hierarchical Nearest Neighbor ($\mathrm{CHN}^2$), designed for datasets with a countably infinite number of points. The method builds clusters across successive levels by linking nearest-neighbor points or clusters using the clustroid distance. The properties of this algorithm make it suitable for very large datasets.
  To evaluate its properties, we first apply the algorithm to the homogeneous Poisson point process, which serves as a natural null-hypothesis model with no intrinsic aggregation. In this setting, the algorithm generates a random forest that is a factor of the Poisson point process and hence unimodular. We prove that at every level, the level-$k$ graph has only finite connected components (a.s.) and derive bounds on their mean size. We also establish the existence of a limiting graph as the number of levels tends to infinity. In this limit, clusters are infinite and one-ended, which induces a natural order within each component and supports a tree-like phylogenetic interpretation.
  Beyond the Poisson case, we extend the analysis to a class of Cox and more general stationary point processes without second-order descending chains (introduced here), for which analogous results hold. Simulations show that comparing these cases with the Poisson baseline allows an efficient detection of aggregation, thereby linking the stochastic-geometric analysis to practical clustering tasks.</description>

      <title>Non-local random deposition models for earthquakes and energy propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a new class of non-local random deposition models, initially introduced by physicists to study the field of mechanical constraints (stress) applied along a line or on a given area located in a seismic zone. The non-local features are twofold. First, the falling objects have random and heavy-tailed dimensions. Second, the locations where the objects are falling are at least for some of the models that we consider, depending on the shape of the surface before deposition. We consider $(h_N)_{N\in \N}$ a sequence of random $(d+1)$-dimensional surfaces defined on $[0,D]^d$ for $d\in \{1,2\}$. Thus, the process $h_{N}$ is obtained by adding to $h_{N-1}$ an object $$\s\in [0,D]^d \mapsto Z_{N}^{\alpha-1} \psi\Big(\frac{v_{Y_N}(\s)}{Z_N}\Big),$$ where $Z=(Z_i)_{i\in \N}$ is an i.i.d. sequence of Pareto random variables, where $\psi:[0,\infty)\mapsto \mathbb{R}^+$ determines the global shape of the object, where $v_{\y}(\x)$ is the distance between $\x$ and $\y$ on the torus and where $Y=(Y_i)_{i\in \N}$ are random variables in $[0,D]^d$ that provide the location of each falling object.
  In the present paper we focus on three variations of this model. First, the rand-model for which $Y$ is an i.i.d. sequence of uniform random variables. Then, the min-model, that introduces an important property of the physics of earthquakes but is also harder to tract since a strong correlation appears between the $N$-th falling object and the shape of the profile $h_{N-1}$. Finally we consider a variant of the rand-model: the stellar model, which allows us to study the intensity of the microwaves emitted by stellar clouds and measured at the Earth surface.
  For those three models, our results identify the limit in law of $(h_N)_{N\in \N}$ viewed as a sequence of continuous random functions rescaled properly. We also determine the limit in law of the fluctuations of $(h_N)_{N\in \N}$.</description>

      <title>Tube formula for spherically contoured random fields with subexponential marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is widely known that the tube method, or equivalently the Euler characteristic heuristic, provides a very accurate approximation for the tail probability that the supremum of a smooth Gaussian random field exceeds a threshold value $c$. The relative approximation error $\Delta(c)$ is exponentially small as a function of $c$ when $c$ tends to infinity. On the other hand, little is known about non-Gaussian random fields.
  In this paper, we obtain the approximation error of the tube method applied to the canonical isotropic random fields on a unit sphere defined by $u\mapsto\langle u,\xi\rangle$, $u\in M\subset\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, where $\xi$ is a spherically contoured random vector. These random fields have statistical applications in multiple testing and simultaneous regression inference when the unknown variance is estimated. The decay rate of the relative error $\Delta(c)$ depends on the tail of the distribution of $\|\xi\|^2$ and the critical radius of the index set $M$. If this distribution is subexponential but not regularly varying, $\Delta(c)\to 0$ as $c\to\infty$. However, in the regularly varying case, $\Delta(c)$ does not vanish and hence is not negligible. To address this limitation, we provide simple upper and lower bounds for $\Delta(c)$ and for the tube formula itself. Numerical studies are conducted to assess the accuracy of the asymptotic approximation.</description>

      <title>Space-time fractional SPDEs with locally Lipschitz coefficients: well-posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the space-time SPDE
  $$ \partial_t^\beta u=-(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2} u+I_t^{1-\beta}[b(u)+\sigma(u)\dot{W}],$$
  where $u=u(t,x)$ is defined for $(t,x)\in\mathbb{R}_+\times \mathbb{R},$ $\beta\in(0,1), \alpha\in(0,2)$ and $\dot{W}$ denotes a space-time white noise.
  It has long been conjectured that this equation has a unique solution with finite moments under the minimal assumptions of locally Lipschitz coefficients $b$ and $\sigma$ with linear growth.
  We prove that this SPDE is well-posed under the assumptions that the initial condition $u_0$ is bounded and measurable, and the functions $b$ and $\sigma$ are locally Lipschitz and have at-most linear growth and some conditions on the Lipschitz constants on the truncated versions of $b$ and $\sigma$. Our results generalize the work of Foondun et al.(2025) to a space-time fractional setting.</description>

      <title>Components, large and small, are as they should be I: supercritical percolation on regular graphs of growing degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions for a regular graph $G$ of growing degree $d$, guaranteeing a phase transition in its random subgraph $G_p$ similar to that of $G(n,p)$ when $p\cdot d\approx 1$. These conditions capture several well-studied graphs, such as (percolation on) the complete graph $K_n$, the binary hypercube $Q^d$, $d$-regular expanders, and random $d$-regular graphs. In particular, this serves as a unified proof for these (and other) cases.
  Suppose that $G$ is a $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, with $d=\omega(1)$. Let $\epsilon&gt;0$ be a small constant, and let $p=\frac{1+\epsilon}{d}$. Let $y(\epsilon)$ be the survival probability of a Galton-Watson tree with offspring distribution Po$(1+\epsilon)$. We show that if $G$ satisfies a (very) mild edge expansion requirement, and if one has fairly good control on the expansion of small sets in $G$, then typically the percolated random subgraph $G_p$ contains a unique giant component of asymptotic order $y(\epsilon)n$, and all the other components in $G_p$ are of order $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$.
  We also show that this result is tight, in the sense that if one asks for a slightly weaker control on the expansion of small sets in $G$, then there are $d$-regular graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices, where typically the second largest component is of order $\Omega(d\log (n/d))=\omega(\log n)$.
  This is the first of a two-part sequence of papers. In the subsequent work, we consider supercritical percolation on regular graphs of constant degree, and establish similar sufficient (and essentially tight) conditions in that setting.</description>

      <title>Negative Dependence as a toolbox for machine learning : review and new developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07285v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Negative dependence is becoming a key driver in advancing learning capabilities beyond the limits of traditional independence. Recent developments have evidenced support towards negatively dependent systems as a learning paradigm in a broad range of fundamental machine learning challenges including optimization, sampling, dimensionality reduction and sparse signal recovery, often surpassing the performance of current methods based on statistical independence. The most popular negatively dependent model has been that of determinantal point processes (DPPs), which have their origins in quantum theory. However, other models, such as perturbed lattice models, strongly Rayleigh measures, zeros of random functions have gained salience in various learning applications. In this article, we review this burgeoning field of research, as it has developed over the past two decades or so. We also present new results on applications of DPPs to the parsimonious representation of neural networks. In the limited scope of the article, we mostly focus on aspects of this area to which the authors contributed over the recent years, including applications to Monte Carlo methods, coresets and stochastic gradient descent, stochastic networks, signal processing and connections to quantum computation. However, starting from basics of negative dependence for the uninitiated reader, extensive references are provided to a broad swath of related developments which could not be covered within our limited scope. While existing works and reviews generally focus on specific negatively dependent models (e.g. DPPs), a notable feature of this article is that it addresses negative dependence as a machine learning methodology as a whole. In this vein, it covers within its span an array of negatively dependent models and their applications well beyond DPPs, thereby putting forward a very general and rather unique perspective.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Laplacians: Tunable principal component analysis under directional prior information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of algorithms for detecting and estimating a rank-one signal from a noisy observation under prior information about that signal's direction, focusing on examples where the signal is known to have entries biased to be positive. Given a matrix observation $\mathbf{Y}$, our algorithms construct a nonlinear Laplacian, another matrix of the form $\mathbf{Y}+\mathrm{diag}(\sigma(\mathbf{Y1}))$ for a nonlinear $\sigma:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, and examine the top eigenvalue and eigenvector of this matrix. When $\mathbf{Y}$ is the (suitably normalized) adjacency matrix of a graph, our approach gives a class of algorithms that search for unusually dense subgraphs by computing a spectrum of the graph "deformed" by the degree profile $\mathbf{Y1}$. We study the performance of such algorithms compared to direct spectral algorithms (the case $\sigma=0$) on models of sparse principal component analysis with biased signals, including the Gaussian planted submatrix problem. For such models, we rigorously characterize the strength of rank-one signal, as a function of $\sigma$, required for an outlier eigenvalue to appear in the spectrum of a nonlinear Laplacian matrix. While identifying the $\sigma$ that minimizes the required signal strength in closed form seems intractable, we explore three approaches to design $\sigma$ numerically: exhaustively searching over simple classes of $\sigma$, learning $\sigma$ from datasets of problem instances, and tuning $\sigma$ using black-box optimization of the critical signal strength. We find both theoretically and empirically that, if $\sigma$ is chosen appropriately, then nonlinear Laplacian spectral algorithms substantially outperform direct spectral algorithms, while retaining the conceptual simplicity of spectral methods compared to broader classes of computations like approximate message passing or general first order methods.</description>

      <title>The maximum-average subtensor problem: equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the Maximum-Average Subtensor ($p$-MAS) problem, in which one wants to find a subtensor of size $k$ of a given random tensor of size $N$, both of order $p$, with maximum sum of entries. We are motivated by recent work on the matrix case of the problem in which several equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties have been characterized analytically in the asymptotic regime $1 \ll k \ll N$, and a puzzling phenomenon was observed involving the coexistence of a clustered equilibrium phase and an efficient algorithm which produces submatrices in this phase. Here we extend previous results on equilibrium and algorithmic properties for the matrix case to the tensor case. We show that the tensor case has a similar equilibrium phase diagram as the matrix case, and an overall similar phenomenology for the considered algorithms. Additionally, we consider out-of-equilibrium landscape properties using Overlap Gap Properties and Franz-Parisi analysis, and discuss the implications or lack-thereof for average-case algorithmic hardness.</description>

      <title>Joint Probability Distribution of mRNA and Protein Molecules in a Stochastic Gene Expression Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic modeling of gene expression is a classic problem in theoretical biophysics. However, models formulated via chemical master equation have long been considered analytically intractable unless burst approximation is applied. This article shows that general stochastic gene expression models with an arbitrary number of gene states admit direct analysis. Based on chemical master equation and high-dimensional binomial moment method, we derive recurrence relations for binomial moments in steady state, yielding analytical expressions to arbitrary order in a hierarchical manner. Subsequently, the joint probability mass function of mRNA and protein copy number can be reconstructed. An algorithm is developed for numerical computation. Particularly, explicit expressions for low-order cumulants are presented. Compared with models under burst approximation, the mean remains exact, whereas the variance typically differs. We estimate the difference between two second-order binomial moments using functional analysis, therefore evaluating the validity of burst approximation.</description>

      <title>Maximal Cells in Shifted Staircase Tableaux and a Quarter-Circle Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we explicitly compute the probability that a given cell in a random standard Young tableau of the shifted staircase shape $(2n-1, 2n-3, \ldots, 3,1)$ contains the maximal label. We also show that the asymptotic distribution of the cell containing the maximal label is governed by the quarter-circle law. The bijection between the tableaux and thereduced decompositions of the longest element of the group $B_n$ of the signed permutations yields the probability distribution of the first (and any) letter of the random reduced decompositions. We also show the results of some computational experiments on the random sorting networks of $B_n$.</description>
