      <title>Wavelet Scattering Transform for Gravitational Waves Analysis. An Application to Glitch Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves, first predicted by Albert Einstein within the framework of general relativity, were confirmed in 2015 by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration, marking a pivotal breakthrough in astrophysics. Despite this achievement, a key challenge remains in distinguishing true gravitational wave signals from noise artifacts, or "glitches," which can distort data and affect the quality of observations. Current state-of-the-art methods, such as the Q-transform, are widely used for signal processing, but face limitations when addressing certain types of signals. In this study, we investigate the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST), a recent signal analysis method, as a complementary approach. Theoretical motivation for WST arises from its stability under signal deformations and its equivariance properties, which make it particularly suited for the complex nature of gravitational wave data. Our experiments on the LIGO O1a dataset show that WST simplifies classification tasks and enables the use of more efficient architectures compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we explore the potential benefits of integrating WST with the Q-transform, demonstrating that ensemble methods exploiting both techniques can capture complementary features of the signal and improve overall performance. This work contributes to advancing machine learning applications in gravitational wave analysis, introducing refined preprocessing techniques that improve signal detection and classification.</description>

      <title>Real-time Anomaly Detection at the L1 Trigger of CMS Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the preparation, deployment, and testing of an autoencoder trained for unbiased detection of new physics signatures in the CMS experiment Global Trigger (GT) test crate FPGAs during LHC Run 3. The GT makes the final decision whether to readout or discard the data from each LHC collision, which occur at a rate of 40 MHz, within a 50 ns latency. The Neural Network makes a prediction for each event within these constraints, which can be used to select anomalous events for further analysis. The GT test crate is a copy of the main GT system, receiving the same input data, but whose output is not used to trigger the readout of CMS, providing a platform for thorough testing of new trigger algorithms on live data, but without interrupting data taking. We describe the methodology to achieve ultra low latency anomaly detection, and present the integration of the DNN into the GT test crate, as well as the monitoring, testing, and validation of the algorithm during proton collisions.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Approach to Load Profile Forecasting in Power Grids using Galerkin-Approximated Koopman Pseudospectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an interpretable machine learning approach that characterizes load dynamics within an operator-theoretic framework for electricity load forecasting in power grids. We represent the dynamics of load data using the Koopman operator, which provides a linear, infinite-dimensional representation of the nonlinear dynamics, and approximate a finite version that remains robust against spectral pollutions due to truncation. By computing $\epsilon$-approximate Koopman eigenfunctions using dynamics-adapted kernels in delay coordinates, we decompose the load dynamics into coherent spatiotemporal patterns that evolve quasi-independently. Our approach captures temporal coherent patterns due to seasonal changes and finer time scales, such as time of day and day of the week. This method allows for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interactions within power grids and their response to various exogenous factors. We assess our method using a large-scale dataset from a renewable power system in the continental European electricity system. The results indicate that our Koopman-based method surpasses a separately optimized deep learning (LSTM) architecture in both accuracy and computational efficiency, while providing deeper insights into the underlying dynamics of the power grid\footnote{The code is available at \href{https://github.com/Shakeri-Lab/Power-Grids}{github.com/Shakeri-Lab/Power-Grids}.</description>

      <title>Integrating audiological datasets via federated merging of Auditory Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audiological datasets contain valuable knowledge about hearing loss in patients, which can be uncovered using data-driven, federated learning techniques. Our previous approach summarized patient information from one audiological dataset into distinct Auditory Profiles (APs). To obtain a better estimate of the audiological patient population, however, patient patterns must be analyzed across multiple, separated datasets, and finally, be integrated into a combined set of APs.
  This study aimed at extending the existing profile generation pipeline with an AP merging step, enabling the combination of APs from different datasets based on their similarity across audiological measures. The 13 previously generated APs (NA=595) were merged with 31 newly generated APs from a second dataset (NB=1272) using a similarity score derived from the overlapping densities of common features across the two datasets. To ensure clinical applicability, random forest models were created for various scenarios, encompassing different combinations of audiological measures.
  A new set with 13 combined APs is proposed, providing separable profiles, which still capture detailed patient information from various test outcome combinations. The classification performance across these profiles is satisfactory. The best performance was achieved using a combination of loudness scaling, audiogram and speech test information, while single measures performed worst.
  The enhanced profile generation pipeline demonstrates the feasibility of combining APs across datasets, which should generalize to all datasets and could lead to an interpretable global profile set in the future. The classification models maintain clinical applicability.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature of cathodoluminescence from photon statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cathodoluminescence (CL), the emission of light induced by accelerated free electrons, has been extensively utilized in various applications, such as displays, streak cameras, and high-spatial-resolution analysis of optical material, surpassing the diffraction limit of light. Despite its long history, the photon statistics of CL have only recently been examined, revealing unexpectedly large bunching of photons. Here we find that this peculiar photon bunching contains information of intervening excitation processes before the photon emission, which can be extracted from the photon statistics within each excitation event by a single free electron. Using this approach, we experimentally unveiled the statistical differences of coherent CL involving a single electromagnetic interaction process and incoherent CL involving multiple excitation processes. The developed formulation is universally applicable for particle generation processes in general to investigate the nature of cascade reactions.</description>

      <title>Parsimonious Dynamic Mode Decomposition: A Robust and Automated Approach for Optimally Sparse Mode Selection in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Parsimonious Dynamic Mode Decomposition (parsDMD), a novel algorithm designed to automatically select an optimally sparse subset of dynamic modes for both spatiotemporal and purely temporal data. By incorporating time-delay embedding and leveraging Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), parsDMD ensures robustness against noise and effectively handles complex, nonlinear dynamics. The algorithm is validated on a diverse range of datasets, including standing wave signals, identifying hidden dynamics, fluid dynamics simulations (flow past a cylinder and transonic buffet), and atmospheric sea-surface temperature (SST) data. ParsDMD addresses a significant limitation of the traditional sparsity-promoting DMD (spDMD), which requires manual tuning of sparsity parameters through a rigorous trial-and-error process to balance between single-mode and all-mode solutions. In contrast, parsDMD autonomously determines the optimally sparse subset of modes without user intervention, while maintaining minimal computational complexity. Comparative analyses demonstrate that parsDMD consistently outperforms spDMD by providing more accurate mode identification and effective reconstruction in noisy environments. These advantages render parsDMD an effective tool for real-time diagnostics, forecasting, and reduced-order model construction across various disciplines.</description>

      <title>An accurate solar axions ray-tracing response of BabyIAXO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BabyIAXO is the intermediate stage of the International Axion Observatory (IAXO) to be hosted at DESY. Its primary goal is the detection of solar axions following the axion helioscope technique. Axions are converted into photons in a large magnet that is pointing to the sun. The resulting X-rays are focused by appropriate X-ray optics and detected by sensitive low-background detectors placed at the focal spot. The aim of this article is to provide an accurate quantitative description of the different components (such as the magnet, optics, and X-ray detectors) involved in the detection of axions. Our efforts have focused on developing robust and integrated software tools to model these helioscope components, enabling future assessments of modifications or upgrades to any part of the IAXO axion helioscope and evaluating the potential impact on the experiment's sensitivity. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the application of these tools by presenting a precise signal calculation and response analysis of BabyIAXO's sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling. Though focusing on the Primakoff solar flux component, our virtual helioscope model can be used to test different production mechanisms, allowing for direct comparisons within a unified framework.</description>
