      <title>Linear Flows on Translation Prisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of billiards in polyhedra, we study linear flows in a family of singular flat $3$-manifolds which we call translation prisms. Using ideas of Furstenberg and Veech, we connect results about weak mixing properties of flows on translation surfaces to ergodic properties of linear flows on translation prisms, and use this to obtain several results about unique ergodicity of these prism flows and related billiard flows. Furthermore, we construct explicit eigenfunctions for translation flows in pseudo-Anosov directions with Pisot expansion factors, and use this construction to build explicit examples of non-ergodic prism flows, and non-ergodic billiard flows in a right prism over a regular $n$-gons for $n=7, 9, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 30$.</description>

      <title>Role of Intra-specific Competition and Additional Food on Prey-Predator Systems exhibiting Holling Type-IV Functional Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the study on the impact of competition on additional food provided prey-predator systems have gained significant attention from researchers in the field of mathematical biology. In this study, we consider an additional food provided prey-predator model exhibiting Holling type-IV functional response and the intra-specific competition among predators. We prove the existence and uniqueness of global positive solutions for the proposed model. We study the existence and stability of equilibrium points and further explore the codimension-$1$ and $2$ bifurcations with respect to the additional food and competition. We further study the global dynamics of the system and discuss the consequences of providing additional food. Later, we do the time-optimal control studies with respect to the quality and quantity of additional food as control variables by transforming the independent variable in the control system. Making use of the Pontraygin maximum principle, we characterize the optimal quality of additional food and optimal quantity of additional food. We show that the findings of these dynamics and control studies have the potential to be applied to a variety of problems in pest management.</description>

      <title>The symmetries of affine $K$-systems and a program for centralizer rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let Aff(X) be the group of affine diffeomorphisms of a closed homogeneous manifold X=G/B admitting a G-invariant Lebesgue-Haar probability measure $\mu$. For $f_0\in$ Aff(X), let $Z^\infty(f_0)$ be the group of $C^\infty$ diffeomorphisms of X commuting with $f_0$. This paper addresses the question: for which $f_0\in$ Aff(X) is $Z^\infty(f_0)$ a Lie subgroup of $Diff^\infty(X)$? Among our main results are the following.
  (1) If $f_0\in$ Aff(X) is weakly mixing with respect to $\mu$, then $Z^\infty(f_0)&lt;$ Aff(X), and hence is a Lie group.
  (2) If $f_0\in$ Aff(X) is ergodic with respect to $\mu$, then $Z^\infty(f_0)$ is a (necessarily $C^0$ closed) Lie subgroup of $Diff^\infty(X)$ (although not necessarily a subgroup of Aff(X)).
  (3) If $f_0\in$ Aff(X) fails to be a K-system with respect to $\mu$, then there exists $f\in$ Aff(X) arbitrarily close to $f_0$ such that $Z^\infty(f)$ is not a Lie group, containing as a continuously embedded subgroup either the abelian group $C^\infty_c((0,1))$ (under addition) or the simple group $Diff^\infty_c((0,1))$ (under composition).
  (4) Considering perturbations of $f_0$ by left translations, we conclude that $f_0$ is stably ergodic if and only if the condition $Z^\infty&lt;$ Aff(X) holds in a neighborhood of $f_0$ in Aff(X). (Note that by BS97, Dani77, $f_0\in$ Aff(X) is stably ergodic in Aff(X) if and only if $f_0$ is a K-system.)
  The affine K-systems are precisely those that are partially hyperbolic and essentially accessible, belonging to a class of diffeomorphisms whose dynamics have been extensively studied. In addition, the properties of partial hyperbolicity and accessibility are stable under $C^1$-small perturbation, and in some contexts, essential accessibility has been shown to be stable under smooth perturbation. Considering the smooth perturbations of affine K-systems, we outline a full program for (local) centralizer rigidity.</description>

      <title>On bifurcation of a stage-structured single-species model with harvest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of the Nicholson's blowffies equation with stage structure and harvest. By employing the property of Lambert W function, the existence of positive equilibria is obtained. With aid of the distribution of the eigenvalues in the characteristic equation, the local stability of the equilibria and the existence of Hopf bifurcation of the singlespecies
  model are obtained. Furthermore, by applying the results due to Balazs I., Rost G. (Internat. J. Bifur. Chaos 31(2021):2150071), when the harvest rate is sufffciently small, the direction of the Hopf bifurcations at the ffrst and last bifurcation values are forward and backward, respectively, and the bifurcating periodic solutions are all asymptotically stable. Finally, Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical conclusions. These results can be seen as the complement of the works of Shu et al. (J. Differential Equations 255 (2013) 2565).</description>

      <title>Arnold Diffusion in the Full Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09273v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence of Arnold diffusion in the planar full three-body problem, which is expressed as a perturbation of a Kepler problem and a planar circular restricted three-body problem, with the perturbation parameter being the mass of the smallest body. In this context, we obtain Arnold diffusion in terms of a transfer of energy, in an amount independent of the perturbation parameter, between the Kepler problem and the restricted three-body problem. Our argument is based on a topological method based on correctly aligned windows which is implemented into a computer assisted proof. This approach can be applied to physically relevant masses of the bodies, such as those in a Neptune-Triton-asteroid system. In this case, we obtain explicit estimates for the range of the perturbation parameter and for the diffusion time.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov spectrum via boundary theory I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the Lyapunov spectrum for measurable cocycles
  over an ergodic pmp system taking values in semi-simple real Lie groups.
  We prove simplicity of the Lyapunov spectrum and its continuity
  under certain perturbations for a class systems that includes many
  familiar examples.
  Our framework uses some soft qualitative assumptions, and does not
  rely on symbolic dynamics.
  We use ideas from boundary theory
  that appear in the study of super-rigidity to deduce our results.
  This gives a new perspective even on the most studied case of random
  matrix products.
  The current paper introduces the general framework and contains the proofs
  of the main results and some basic examples.
  In a follow up paper we discuss further examples.</description>

      <title>A Hofer-like Metric on the Space of Anosov Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a family of Hofer-like metrics ($\dAnV{V}$) on the space of Anosov vector fields $\An(M)$, providing dynamically relevant distances based on the cost of deformation paths using $\Ck{k}$ or Sobolev $\SobolevHk{k}$ norms. We establish fundamental properties, including completeness for $V= C^r (r \ge 1)$ or $H^k (k &gt; \dim(M)/2+1)$, and naturality under diffeomorphisms. We show the utility of these metrics by proving quantitative stability results: proximity in $\dAnV{V}$ implies controlled variation of essential dynamical invariants, including topological entropy, Lyapunov exponents, SRB measures, thermodynamic pressure, spectral gaps (mixing rates), and zeta functions. Sufficient regularity ensures local Lipschitz continuity and Fr\'echet differentiability, connecting the metric structure to linear response formulas, particularly for pressure, exponents, and the spectral gap. While Sobolev metrics yield locally flat geometry with straight line geodesics, the framework is broadly applicable. We explore implications for the moduli space of Anosov flows, including stability of invariants and the framework for local slice theorems. Furthermore, we introduce \emph{Topological Anosov Flows}, defined via simultaneous uniform flow convergence and $\dAn$ metric convergence of the generating fields. This new class aims to capture essential hyperbolic features in non-smooth settings. Overall, the proposed metrics offer several geometric perspectives for analyzing the stability, classification, and possible extensions of Anosov dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unital shift equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a unital version of shift equivalence for finite square matrices over the nonnegative integers. In contrast to the classical case, we show that unital shift equivalence does not coincide with one-sided eventual conjugacy. We also prove that unital shift equivalent matrices define one-sided shifts of finite type that are continuously orbit equivalent. Consequently, unitally shift equivalent matrices have isomorphic topological full groups and isomorphic Leavitt path algebras, the latter being related to Hazrat's graded classification conjecture in algebra.</description>

      <title>Global stability of the Lengyel-Epstein systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the global (asymptotic) stability of the Lengyel-Epstein differential systems, sometimes called Belousov-Zhabotinsky differential systems. Such systems are topologically equivalent to a two-parameter family of cubic systems in the plane. We show that for each pair of admissible parameters the unique equilibrium point of the corresponding system is not globally (asymptotically) stable. On the other hand, we provide explicit conditions for this unique equilibrium point to be asymptotically stable and we study its basin of attraction. We also study the generic and degenerate Hopf bifurcations and highlight a subset of the set of admissible parameters for which the phase portraits of the systems have two limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Periodic approximation of topological Lyapunov exponents and the joint spectral radius for cocycles of mapping classes of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cocycles taking values in the mapping class group of closed surfaces and investigate their leading topological Lyapunov exponent. Under a natural closing property, we show that the top topological Lyapunov exponent can be approximated by periodic orbits. We also extend the notion of the joint spectral radius to this setting, interpreting it via the exponential growth of curves under iterated mapping classes. Our approach connects ideas from ergodic theory, Teichm\"uller geometry, and spectral theory, and suggests a broader framework for similar results.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional non-uniform hyperbolicity, robust exponential mixing and the basin problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the ergodic, topological and geometric basins coincide for hyperbolic dominated ergodic $cu$-Gibbs states, solving the ``basin problem'' for a wide class of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems.
  We obtain robust examples of exponential mixing physical measures for systems with multidimensional nonuniform hyperbolic dominated splitting, without uniformly expanding or contracting subbundles.
  Both results are a consequence of extending the construction of Gibbs-Markov-Young structures from partial hyperbolic systems to systems with only a dominated splitting, using the existence of an ``improved hyperbolic block'', with respect to Pesin's Nonuniform Hyperbolic Theory, for hyperbolic dominated measures of smooth maps, obtained through hyperbolic times and associated ``coherent schedules'' introduced by one of the coauthors.</description>

Abstract: We study a fast-slow version of the Bazykin-Berezovskaya predator-prey model with Allee effect evolving on two timescales, through the lenses of Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT). The system we consider is in non-standard form. We completely characterize its dynamics, providing explicit threshold quantities to distinguish between a rich variety of possible asymptotic behaviors. Moreover, we propose numerical results to illustrate our findings. Lastly, we comment on the real-world interpretation of these results, in an economic framework and in the context of predator-prey models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a classical correspondence between magnetic flows and sub-Riemannian geometry, first established by Montgomery, we undertake a systematic study of magnetic flows on sub-Riemannian manifolds.
  We focus on three-dimensional contact manifolds, and we show that magnetic fields are naturally defined through Rumin differential forms. We provide a geometric interpretation of the sub-Riemannian magnetic geodesic flow, demonstrating that it can be understood as a geodesic flow on a suitably defined lifted sub-Riemannian structure, which is of Engel type when the magnetic field is non-vanishing.
  In the general case, when the magnetic field might be vanishing, we investigate the geometry of this lifted structure, characterizing properties such as its step and the abnormal trajectories in terms of the analytical features of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Local Phase Tracking and Metastability of Planar Waves in Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planar travelling waves on $\mathbb R^d,$ with $ d\geq 2,$ are shown to persist in systems of reaction-diffusion equations with multiplicative noise on significantly long timescales with high probability, provided that the wave is orbitally stable in dimension one ($d=1$). While a global phase tracking mechanism is required to determine the location of the stochastically perturbed wave in one dimension, or on a cylindrical domain, we show that the travelling wave on the full unbounded space can be controlled by keeping track of local deviations only. In particular, the energy infinitesimally added to or withdrawn from the system by noise dissipates almost fully into the transverse direction, leaving behind small localised phase shifts. The noise process considered is white in time and coloured in space, possibly weighted, and either translation invariant or trace class.</description>

      <title>Quotients of Poisson boundaries, entropy, and spectral gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poisson boundary is a measurable $\Gamma$-space canonically associated with a group $\Gamma$ and a probability measure $\mu$ on it. The collection of all measurable $\Gamma$-equivariant quotients, known as $\mu$-boundaries, of the Poisson boundary forms a partially ordered set, equipped with a strictly monotonic non-negative function, known as Furstenberg or differential entropy.
  In this paper we demonstrate the richness and the complexity of this lattice of quotients for the case of free groups and surface groups and rather general measures. In particular, we show that there are continuum many unrelated $\mu$-boundaries at each, sufficiently low, entropy level, and there are continuum many distinct order-theoretic cubes of $\mu$-boundaries.
  These $\mu$-boundaries are constructed from dense linear representations $\rho:\Gamma\to G$ to semi-simple Lie groups, like $\PSL_2(\bbC)^d$ with absolutely continuous stationary measures on $\hat\bbC^d$.</description>

      <title>Exact Parameter Identification in PET Pharmacokinetic Modeling: Extension to the Reversible Two Tissue Compartment Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of recovering tracer kinetic parameters from multi-region measurement data in quantitative PET imaging using the reversible two tissue compartment model. Its main result is an extension of our previous work on the irreversible two tissue compartment model. In analogy to our previous work, we show that also in the (practically highly relevant) reversible case, most tracer kinetic parameters can be uniquely identified from standard PET measurements (without additional full blood sample analysis that is usually performed in practice) and under reasonable assumptions. In addition, unique identifiability of all parameters is shown provided that additional measurements from the (uncorrected) total arterial blood tracer concentration (which can be obtained from standard PET measurements or from a simple blood sample analysis) are available.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation Theory for a Class of Periodic Superlinear Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze, mainly using bifurcation methods, an elliptic superlinear problem in one-dimension with periodic boundary conditions. One of the main novelties is that we follow for the first time a bifurcation approach, relying on a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction and some recent global bifurcation results, that allows us to study the local and global structure of non-trivial solutions at bifurcation points where the linearized operator has a two-dimensional kernel. Indeed, at such points the classical tools in bifurcation theory, like the Crandall-Rabinowitz theorem or some generalizations of it, cannot be applied because the multiplicity of the eigenvalues is not odd, and a new approach is required. We apply this analysis to specific examples, obtaining new existence and multiplicity results for the considered periodic problems, going beyond the information variational and fixed point methods like Poincar\'e-Birkhoff theorem can provide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a gradient modeling framework for memristive systems. Our focus is on memristive systems as they appear in neurophysiology and neuromorphic systems. Revisiting the original definition of Chua, we regard memristive elements as gradient operators of quadratic functionals with respect to a metric determined by the memristance. We explore the consequences of gradient properties for the analysis and design of neuromorphic circuits.</description>

      <title>DUE: A Deep Learning Framework and Library for Modeling Unknown Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equations, particularly differential equations, are fundamental for understanding natural phenomena and predicting complex dynamics across various scientific and engineering disciplines. However, the governing equations for many complex systems remain unknown due to intricate underlying mechanisms. Recent advancements in machine learning and data science offer a new paradigm for modeling unknown equations from measurement or simulation data. This paradigm shift, known as data-driven discovery or modeling, stands at the forefront of AI for science, with significant progress made in recent years. In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework for data-driven modeling of unknown equations using deep learning. This versatile framework is capable of learning unknown ODEs, PDEs, DAEs, IDEs, SDEs, reduced or partially observed systems, and non-autonomous differential equations. Based on this framework, we have developed Deep Unknown Equations (DUE), an open-source software package designed to facilitate the data-driven modeling of unknown equations using modern deep learning techniques. DUE serves as an educational tool for classroom instruction, enabling students and newcomers to gain hands-on experience with differential equations, data-driven modeling, and contemporary deep learning approaches such as FNN, ResNet, generalized ResNet, operator semigroup networks (OSG-Net), and Transformers. Additionally, DUE is a versatile and accessible toolkit for researchers across various scientific and engineering fields. It is applicable not only for learning unknown equations from data but also for surrogate modeling of known, yet complex, equations that are costly to solve using traditional numerical methods. We provide detailed descriptions of DUE and demonstrate its capabilities through diverse examples, which serve as templates that can be easily adapted for other applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1112.6107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let Q be a component of a stratum of abelian or quadratic differentials on an oriented surface of genus $g\geq 0$ with $m\geq 0$ punctures and $3g-3+m\geq 2$. We construct a subshift of finite type $(\Omega,\sigma)$ and a Borel suspension of $(\Omega,\sigma)$ which admits a finite-to-one semi-conjugacy into the Teichmueller flow $\Phi^t$ on Q. This is used to show that the $\Phi^t$-invariant Lebesgue measure on Q is the unique measure of maximal entropy.</description>

      <title>A Central Limit Theorem for the Kontsevich-Zorich Cocycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11760v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a central limit theorem holds for exterior powers of the Kontsevich-Zorich (KZ) cocycle. In particular, we show that, under the hypothesis that the top Lyapunov exponent on the exterior power is simple, a central limit theorem holds for the lift of the (leafwise) hyperbolic Brownian motion to any strongly irreducible, symplectic, $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$-invariant subbundle, that is moreover symplectic-orthogonal to the so-called tautological subbundle. We then show that this implies that a central limit theorem holds for the lift of the Teichm\"uller geodesic flow to the same bundle.
  For the random cocycle over the hyperbolic Brownian motion, we prove under the same hypotheses that the variance of the top exponent is strictly positive. For the deterministic cocycle over the Teichm\"uller geodesic flow we prove that the variance is strictly positive only for the top exponent of the first exterior power (the KZ cocycle itself) under the hypothesis that its Lyapunov spectrum is simple.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every infinite, locally finite, and connected graph admitsa translation-like action by $\mathbb{Z}$, and that this action can be takento be transitive exactly when the graph has either one or two ends.The actions constructed satisfy $d(v,v\ast 1)\leq3$ for every vertex$v$. This strengthens a theorem by Brandon Seward. We also study the effective computability of translation-like actionson groups and graphs. We prove that every finitely generated infinitegroup with decidable word problem admits a translation-like actionby $\mathbb{Z}$ which is computable, and satisfies an extra condition whichwe call decidable orbit membership problem. As a nontrivial application of our results, we prove that for everyfinitely generated infinite group with decidable word problem, effectivesubshifts attain all $\Pi_{1}^{0}$ Medvedev degrees. This extends a classification proved by Joseph Miller for $\mathbb{Z}^{d},$ $d\geq1$.</description>

Abstract: We obtain expansions of ergodic integrals for $\Z^d$-covers of compact self-similar translation flows, and as a consequence we obtain a form of weak rational ergodicity with optimal rates. As examples, we consider the so-called self-similar $(s,1)$-staircase flows ($\Z$-extensions of self-similar translations flows of genus-$2$ surfaces), and particular cases of the Ehrenfest wind-tree model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate dimension-theoretic properties of concentric topological spheres, which are fractal sets emerging both in pure and applied mathematics. We calculate the box dimension and Assouad spectrum of such collections, and use them to prove that fractal spheres cannot be shrunk into a point at a polynomial rate. We also apply these dimension estimates to quasiconformally classify certain spiral shells, a generalization of planar spirals in higher dimensions. This classification also provides a bi-H\"older map between shells, and constitutes an addition to a general programme of research proposed by J. Fraser.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on a class of additive perturbations in dynamical systems. An equivalence statement for this construction is discovered, and consequently, a method of checking a notion of positive invariance with perturbation. The resulting conclusion is an equivalence between a more strict definition of positive invariance, based on a perturbation extension of the system and the Dubovitskij-Miljutin tangent cone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any strong orbit equivalence class of minimal Cantor systems and any cardinal number that is finite, countable, or the continuum, we show that there exists a minimal subshift within the given class whose number of asymptotic components is exactly the given cardinal. For finite or countable ones, we explicitly construct such examples using $\mathcal{S}$-adic subshifts. We derived the uncountable case by showing that any topological dynamical system with countably many asymptotic components has zero topological entropy. We also construct systems with arbitrarily high subexponential word complexity with only one asymptotic class. We deduce that within any strong orbit equivalence class, there exists a subshift whose automorphism group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}$ diffeomorphisms on a compact manifold $M$ with ${\rm dim} M\leq 3$, if an invariant measure $\mu$ is a continuity point of the sum of positive Lyapunov exponents, then $\mu$ is an upper semi-continuity point of the entropy map. This gives several consequences, such as the upper-semi continuity of dimensions of measures for surface diffeomorphisms. Furthermore, we know the continuity of dimensions for measures of maximal entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a dominant rational self-map $f:X \dashrightarrow X$ of a normal projective variety defined over a number field. We study the arithmetic degree $\alpha_k(f)$ for $f$ and $\alpha_k(f,V)$ of a subvariety $V$, which generalize the classical arithmetic degree $\alpha_1(f,P)$ of a point $P$. We generalize Yuan's arithmetic version of Siu's inequality to higher codimensions and utilize it to demonstrate the existence of the arithmetic degree $\alpha_k(f)$. Furthermore, we establish the relative degree formula $\alpha_k(f)=\max\{\lambda_k(f),\lambda_{k-1}(f)\}$. In addition, we prove several basic properties of the arithmetic degree $\alpha_k(f, V)$ and establish the upper bound $\overline{\alpha}_{k+1}(f, V)\leq \max\{\lambda_{k+1}(f),\lambda_{k}(f)\}$, which generalizes the classical result $\overline{\alpha}_f(P)\leq \lambda_1(f)$. Finally, we discuss a generalized version of the Kawaguchi-Silverman conjecture that was proposed by Dang et al, and we provide a counterexample to this conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conway's Game of Life is a two-dimensional cellular automaton. As a dynamical system, it is well-known to be computationally universal, i.e.\ capable of simulating an arbitrary Turing machine. We show that in a sense taking a single backwards step of the Game of Life is a computationally universal process, by constructing patterns whose preimage computation encodes an arbitrary circuit-satisfaction problem, or, equivalently, any tiling problem. As a corollary, we obtain for example that the set of orphans is coNP-complete, exhibit a $6210 \times 37800$-periodic configuration whose preimage is nonempty but contains no periodic configurations, and prove that the existence of a preimage for a periodic point is undecidable. Our constructions were obtained by a combination of computer searches and manual design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish an existence result of a solution to a class of probability measure-valued equations, whose solutions can be associated with stationary distributions of many McKean-Vlasov diffusions with gradient-type drifts. Coefficients of the probability measure-valued equation may be discontinuous in the weak topology and the total variation norm. Owing to that the bifurcation point of the probability measure-valued equation is relevant to the phase transition point of the associated McKean-Vlasov diffusion, we establish a local Krasnosel'skii bifurcation theorem. Regularized determinant for the Hilbert-Schmidt operator is used to derive our criteria for the bifurcation point. Concrete examples, including the granular media equation and the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation with quadratic interaction, are given to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Gaps in the complex Farey sequence of an imaginary quadratic number field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an imaginary quadratic number field $K$ with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$, we are interested in the asymptotic \emph{distance to nearest neighbour} (or \emph{gap}) statistic of complex Farey fractions $\frac{p}{q}$, with $p,q \in \mathcal{O}_K$ and $0&lt;|q|\leq T$, as $T \to \infty$. Reformulating this problem in a homogeneous dynamical setting, we follow the approach of J. Marklof for real Farey fractions with several variables (2013) and adapt a joint equidistribution result in the real $3$-dimensional hyperbolic space of J. Parkkonen and F. Paulin (2023) to derive the existence of a probability measure describing this asymptotic gap statistic. We obtain an integral formula for the associated cumulative distribution function, and use geometric arguments to find an explicit estimate for its tail distribution in the cases of Gaussian and Eisenstein fractions.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory and Excitable Dynamics in an Opinion Model with Group Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In traditional models of opinion dynamics, each agent in a network has an opinion and changes in opinions arise from pairwise (i.e., dyadic) interactions between agents. However, in many situations, groups of individuals possess a collective opinion that can differ from the opinions of its constituent individuals. In this paper, we study the effects of group opinions on opinion dynamics. We formulate a hypergraph model in which both individual agents and groups of 3 agents have opinions, and we examine how opinions evolve through both dyadic interactions and group memberships. In some parameter regimes, we find that the presence of group opinions can lead to oscillatory and excitable opinion dynamics. In the oscillatory regime, the mean opinion of the agents in a network has self-sustained oscillations. In the excitable regime, finite-size effects create large but short-lived opinion swings (as in social fads). We develop a mean-field approximation of our model and obtain good agreement with direct numerical simulations. We also show -- both numerically and via our mean-field description -- that oscillatory dynamics occur only when the number of dyadic and polyadic interactions per agent are not completely correlated. Our results illustrate how polyadic structures, such as groups of agents, can have important effects on collective opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Measure and dimension theory of permeable sets and its applications to fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study {\it permeable} sets. These are sets \(\Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) which have the property that each two points \(x,y\in \mathbb{R}^d\) can be connected by a short path \(\gamma\) which has small (or even empty, apart from the end points of \(\gamma\)) intersection with \(\Theta\). We investigate relations between permeability and Lebesgue measure and establish theorems on the relation of permeability with several notions of dimension. It turns out that for most notions of dimension each subset of \(\mathbb{R}^d\) of dimension less than \(d-1\) is permeable. We use our permeability result on the Nagata dimension to characterize permeability properties of self-similar sets with certain finiteness properties.</description>

      <title>An efficient scheme for approximating long-time dynamics of a class of non-linear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel, highly efficient, mean-reverting-SAV-BDF2-based, long-time unconditionally stable numerical scheme for a class of finite-dimensional nonlinear models important in geophysical fluid dynamics. The scheme is highly efficient in that only a fixed symmetric positive definite linear problem (with varying right-hand sides) is solved at each time step. The solutions remain uniformly bounded for all time. We show that the scheme accurately captures the long-time dynamics of the underlying geophysical model, with the global attractors and invariant measures of the scheme converging to those of the original model as the step size approaches zero.
  In our numerical experiments, we adopt an indirect approach, using statistics from long-time simulations to approximate the invariant measures. Our results suggest that the convergence rate of the long-term statistics, as a function of terminal time, is approximately first-order under the Jensen-Shannon metric and half-order under the total variation metric. This implies that extremely long simulations are required to achieve high-precision approximations of the invariant measure (or climate). Nevertheless, the second-order scheme significantly outperforms its first-order counterpart, requiring far less time to reach a small neighborhood of statistical equilibrium for a given step size.</description>

      <title>Quasimorphisms on the group of density preserving diffeomorphisms of the M\"{o}bius band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of quasimorphisms on groups of homeomorphisms of manifolds has been extensively studied under various regularity conditions, such as smooth, volume-preserving, and symplectic. However, in this context, nothing is known about groups of `area'-preserving diffeomorphisms on non-orientable manifolds.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of groups of density-preserving diffeomorphisms on non-orientable manifolds.
  Here, the density is a natural concept that generalizes volume without concerning orientability. We show that the group of density-preserving diffeomorphisms on the M\"obius band admits countably many unbounded quasimorphisms which are linearly independent. Along the proof, we show that groups of density preserving diffeomorphisms on compact, connected, non-orientable surfaces with non-empty boundary are weakly contractible.</description>

      <title>H\"older spiral arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a quantitative necessary and sufficient condition for a spiral arc to be a H\"older arc. The class of spiral arcs contains the polynomial spirals studied by Fraser, and the elliptical spirals studied by Burrell-Falconer-Fraser. As an application, we recover the sharp result on the H\"older winding problem for polynomial spirals. Moreover, we provide a sharp exponent estimate for the H\"older classification of polynomial spirals, which coincides with the corresponding quasiconformal classification estimate, and improve certain exponent bounds of Burrell-Falconer-Fraser on the H\"older classification of elliptical spirals.</description>
