      <title>A pretest-posttest pilot study for augmented reality-based physical-cognitive training in community-dwelling older adults at risk of mild cognitive impairment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As cognitive interventions for older adults evolve, modern technologies are increasingly integrated into their development. This study investigates the efficacy of augmented reality (AR)-based physical-cognitive training using an interactive game with Kinect motion sensor technology on older individuals at risk of mild cognitive impairment. Utilizing a pretest-posttest experimental design, twenty participants (mean age 66.8 SD. = 4.6 years, age range 60-78 years) underwent eighteen individual training sessions, lasting 45 to 60 minutes each, conducted three times a week over a span of 1.5 months. The training modules from five activities, encompassing episodic and working memory, attention and inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and speed processing, were integrated with physical movement and culturally relevant Thai-context activities. Results revealed significant improvements in inhibition, cognitive flexibility, accuracy, and reaction time, with working memory demonstrating enhancements in accuracy albeit not in reaction time. These findings underscore the potential of AR interventions to bolster basic executive enhancement among community-dwelling older adults at risk of cognitive decline.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Functional Connectivity and Graph Convolutional Network for Working Memory Load Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain responses related to working memory originate from distinct brain areas and oscillate at different frequencies. EEG signals with high temporal correlation can effectively capture these responses. Therefore, estimating the functional connectivity of EEG for working memory protocols in different frequency bands plays a significant role in analyzing the brain dynamics with increasing memory and cognitive loads, which remains largely unexplored. The present study introduces a Bayesian structure learning algorithm to learn the functional connectivity of EEG in sensor space. Next, the functional connectivity graphs are taken as input to the graph convolutional network to classify the working memory loads. The intrasubject (subject-specific) classification performed on 154 subjects for six different verbal working memory loads produced the highest classification accuracy of 96% and average classification accuracy of 89%, outperforming state-of-the-art classification models proposed in the literature. Furthermore, the proposed Bayesian structure learning algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art functional connectivity estimation methods through intersubject and intrasubject statistical analysis of variance. The results also show that the alpha and theta bands have better classification accuracy than the beta band.</description>

      <title>A rank decomposition for the topological classification of neural representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks can be thought of as applying a transformation to an input dataset. The way in which they change the topology of such a dataset often holds practical significance for many tasks, particularly those demanding non-homeomorphic mappings for optimal solutions, such as classification problems. In this work, we leverage the fact that neural networks are equivalent to continuous piecewise-affine maps, whose rank can be used to pinpoint regions in the input space that undergo non-homeomorphic transformations, leading to alterations in the topological structure of the input dataset. Our approach enables us to make use of the relative homology sequence, with which one can study the homology groups of the quotient of a manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and a subset $A$, assuming some minimal properties on these spaces.
  As a proof of principle, we empirically investigate the presence of low-rank (topology-changing) affine maps as a function of network width and mean weight. We show that in randomly initialized narrow networks, there will be regions in which the (co)homology groups of a data manifold can change. As the width increases, the homology groups of the input manifold become more likely to be preserved. We end this part of our work by constructing highly non-random wide networks that do not have this property and relating this non-random regime to Dale's principle, which is a defining characteristic of biological neural networks.
  Finally, we study simple feedforward networks trained on MNIST, as well as on toy classification and regression tasks, and show that networks manipulate the topology of data differently depending on the continuity of the task they are trained on.</description>

      <title>Can a Machine be Conscious? Towards Universal Criteria for Machine Consciousness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As artificially intelligent systems become more anthropomorphic and pervasive, and their potential impact on humanity more urgent, discussions about the possibility of machine consciousness have significantly intensified, and it is sometimes seen as 'the holy grail'. Many concerns have been voiced about the ramifications of creating an artificial conscious entity. This is compounded by a marked lack of consensus around what constitutes consciousness and by an absence of a universal set of criteria for determining consciousness. By going into depth on the foundations and characteristics of consciousness, we propose five criteria for determining whether a machine is conscious, which can also be applied more generally to any entity. This paper aims to serve as a primer and stepping stone for researchers of consciousness, be they in philosophy, computer science, medicine, or any other field, to further pursue this holy grail of philosophy, neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model of the visual MacKay effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the intricate connection between visual perception and the mathematical modelling of neural activity in the primary visual cortex (V1). The focus is on modelling the visual MacKay effect [Mackay, Nature 1957]. While bifurcation theory has been a prominent mathematical approach for addressing issues in neuroscience, especially in describing spontaneous pattern formations in V1 due to parameter changes, it faces challenges in scenarios with localized sensory inputs. This is evident, for instance, in Mackay's psychophysical experiments, where the redundancy of visual stimuli information results in irregular shapes, making bifurcation theory and multi-scale analysis less effective. To address this, we follow a mathematical viewpoint based on the input-output controllability of an Amari-type neural fields model. In this framework, we consider sensory input as a control function, a cortical representation via the retino-cortical map of the visual stimulus that captures its distinct features. This includes highly localized information in the center of MacKay's funnel pattern "MacKay rays". From a control theory point of view, the Amari-type equation's exact controllability property is discussed for linear and nonlinear response functions. For the visual MacKay effect modelling, we adjust the parameter representing intra-neuron connectivity to ensure that cortical activity exponentially stabilizes to the stationary state in the absence of sensory input. Then, we perform quantitative and qualitative studies to demonstrate that they capture all the essential features of the induced after-image reported by MacKay.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Graph Heat Modelling for Diffusion-based Connectivity Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heat diffusion describes the process by which heat flows from areas with higher temperatures to ones with lower temperatures. This concept was previously adapted to graph structures, whereby heat flows between nodes of a graph depending on the graph topology. Here, we combine the graph heat equation with the stochastic heat equation, which ultimately yields a model for multivariate time signals on a graph. We show theoretically how the model can be used to directly compute the diffusion-based connectivity structure from multivariate signals. Unlike other connectivity measures, our heat model-based approach is inherently multivariate and yields an absolute scaling factor, namely the graph thermal diffusivity, which captures the extent of heat-like graph propagation in the data. On two datasets, we show how the graph thermal diffusivity can be used to characterise Alzheimer's disease (AD). We find that the graph thermal diffusivity is lower for AD patients than healthy controls and correlates with mini mental state examination (MMSE) scores, suggesting structural impairment in patients in line with previous findings.</description>

      <title>Balancing Spectral, Temporal and Spatial Information for EEG-based Alzheimer's Disease Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prospect of future treatment warrants the development of cost-effective screening for Alzheimer's disease (AD). A promising candidate in this regard is electroencephalography (EEG), as it is one of the most economic imaging modalities. Recent efforts in EEG analysis have shifted towards leveraging spatial information, employing novel frameworks such as graph signal processing or graph neural networks. Here, we investigate the importance of spatial information relative to spectral or temporal information by varying the proportion of each dimension for AD classification. To do so, we systematically test various dimension resolution configurations on two routine EEG datasets. Our findings show that spatial information is more important than temporal information and equally valuable as spectral information. On the larger second dataset, substituting spectral with spatial information even led to an increase of 1.1% in accuracy, which emphasises the importance of spatial information for EEG-based AD classification. We argue that our resolution-based feature extraction has the potential to improve AD classification specifically, and multivariate signal classification generally.</description>
