      <title>Revealing Symmetry-broken Superconducting Configurations by Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coherent theory for both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. Here we show that the electron charge densities of Al, YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO), and LaH10 along with Pb and Nb3Sn share the same feature of electron charge gains in their respective superconducting configurations (SCCs) predicted by first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT). It is discovered that the formation of SCCs is due to the local symmetry breaking from their normal conducting configurations (NCCs), and the electron charge gains in SCCs form electron tunnels in crystals that resemble pontoons, thus termed as electron pontoon tunnel (EPT) here. The nuclei promoting the formation of EPTs in conventional superconductors have strong bonding with other nuclei, resulting in their EPTs easily destroyed and thus low superconducting critical temperature (Tc), while in unconventional superconductor, this bonding is very weak as shown by negative stretching force constants in YBCO, thus resulting in much higher Tc. The fundamental understanding of SCCs and the capability to predict them by DFT enable theoretical search of room temperature superconductors without empirical models.</description>

      <title>Inversion and Tunability of Van Hove Singularities in $A$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, and Cs) kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand the alkali-metal-dependent material properties of recently discovered $A$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, and Cs), we conducted a detailed electronic structure analysis based on first-principles density functional theory calculations. Contrary to the case of $A$ = K and Rb, the energetic positions of the low-lying Van Hove singularities are reversed in CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, and the characteristic higher-order Van Hove point gets closer to the Fermi level. We found that this notable difference can be attributed to the chemical effect, apart from structural differences. Due to their different orbital compositions, Van Hove points show qualitatively different responses to the structure changes. A previously unnoticed highest lying point can be lowered, locating close to or even below the other ones in response to a reasonable range of bi- and uni-axial strain. Our results can be useful in better understanding the material-dependent features reported in this family and in realizing experimental control of exotic quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Variational approach for the two-body problem in a multiband extended-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering a spin-up and a spin-down fermion in a generic tight-binding lattice with a multi-site basis, here we study the two-body problem using a multiband extended-Hubbard model with arbitrary but finite-ranged hopping and interaction parameters. We derive a linear eigenvalue problem for the entire two-body spectrum, alongside a nonlinear eigenvalue problem for the bound states in the form of a self-consistency equation. Our results are based on an exact variational approach and their versatility offers practical applications in a broad range of lattice geometries. As an illustration, we apply them to the linear-chain model and demonstrate that the resultant spin singlet and triplet bound states are in perfect agreement with the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Engineered Graviton Condensates in a Room-Temperature Superconductor for a Unified Quantum Fibonacci Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quest to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity, the concept of gravitons as quantum carriers of gravitational force stands as a pivotal yet unproven hypothesis. This work pioneers a bold approach to graviton condensation via an innovative ambient superconductor, synthesized through a groundbreaking yet theoretically plausible physics process. Building on recent superconductivity breakthroughs, we introduce a novel ambient superconductor fabricated through the bombardment of a dilute Bose-Einstein condensate with high-energy gamma photons, under precisely controlled magnetic fields oscillating in Fibonacci sequence patterns. This process, designed to exploit quantum coherence at macroscopic scales, fosters conditions ripe for graviton condensation. Here we demonstrate the successful induction of a graviton condensate within our engineered superconductor, marking a significant stride towards integrating gravitational and electromagnetic forces at a quantum level. This discovery not only defies traditional views separating the four fundamental interactions but also lays down a tangible groundwork for quantum gravity. Our results challenge existing paradigms by indicating that graviton condensation, mediated through tailored superconducting states, can unlock new aspects of fundamental physics. This graviton condensate represents a critical step towards a unified field theory, bridging the gap between quantum mechanics and general relativity. This investigation not only extends the boundaries of theoretical physics but also hints at potential future technologies harnessing the quantum interplay of gravitational and electromagnetic forces. Through imaginative yet rigorous scientific inquiry, this study underscores the limitless potential of physics to explore and unify the natural world's most fundamental forces.</description>

      <title>Structural transition, electric transport, and electronic structures in the compressed trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16763v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic structure and electronic band structure are fundamental properties for understanding the mechanism of superconductivity. Motivated by the discovery of pressure-induced high-temperature superconductivity at 80 K in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La3Ni2O7, the atomic structure and electronic band structure of the trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 under pressure up to 44.3 GPa are investigated. A structural transition from the monoclinic P21/a space group to the tetragonal I4/mmm around 12.6-13.4 GPa is identified, accompanying with a drop of resistance below 7 K. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the bonding state of Ni 3dz2 orbital rises and crosses the Fermi level at high pressures, which may give rise to possible superconductivity observed in resistance under pressure in La4Ni3O10. The trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 shows some similarities with the bilayer La3Ni2O7 and has unique properties, providing a new platform to investigate the underlying mechanism of superconductivity in nickelates.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Cooper-pair fluctuations in a 2D Electron System with Strong Spin-Orbit Scatterings: Phase Separation and Large Magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A microscopic theory of Cooper-pair fluctuations (CPFs) in a 2D electron system with strong spin-orbit scatterings is presented to account for the observation, at low temperatures, of large magnetoresistance (MR) above a crossover field to superconductivity in electron-doped SrTiO$_{3}$/LaAlO$% _{3} $ interfaces. It is found that, while the conventional (diagrammatic) microscopic theory of superconducting fluctuations fails to account for the pronounced MR, an extension of the theory, which introduces a proper definition of the CPFs density, reveals an operative mechanism of this intriguing effect. Phase separation due to Coulomb repulsion, from the rarefying unpaired normal-state electron gas, following field-induced condensation of CPFs in real-space mesoscopic puddles, are in the core of this mechanism. These findings enable us to amend the state-of-the-art microscopic theory, in a consistent manner with the time dependent GL functional approach used previously in an extensive account of the experimentally reported effect.</description>

      <title>On the lineshapes of temperature-dependent transport measurements of superconductors under pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent reports of superconductivity in the vicinity of room temperature have been the subject of discussion by the community. Specifically, features in the resistance-temperature (R-T) relations have raised questions. We show that many of these features can arise from previously unaccounted-for dynamic effects associated with the AC transport techniques often used in high-pressure experiments. These dynamic AC effects can can cause the apparent resistance (Rapparent) to diverge from the DC resistance (RDC), sharpen measured superconducting transitions, and produce other features in the measured R-T response. We also show that utilizing the full output of phase-sensitive transport measurements provides a valuable probe of superconducting samples in difficult to measure systems</description>
