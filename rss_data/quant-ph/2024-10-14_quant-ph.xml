      <title>Comment on "Unified framework for open quantum dynamics with memory"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent article by Ivander, Lindoy and Lee [Nature Communications 15, 8087 (2024)] claims to discover the relationship between the generalized quantum master equation (GQME) and the path integral for a system coupled to a harmonic bath. However, this relationship was already established in 2020 by Makri in the context of the small matrix decomposition of the path integral (SMatPI) [J. Chem. Theory and Comput. 16, 4038 (2020)]. The procedure that this article uses in its Supplementary Information (SI) to obtain the various matrices follows the SMatPI decomposition steps for the alternative Trotter ordering. The absence of endpoint effects in the kernel matrices of the discretized GQME expression for the reduced density matrix (RDM) is the consequence of a crude GQME discretization and is not consistent with the SMatPI decomposition of an auxiliary matrix presented in the SI. This form is identical to the transfer tensor method (TTM) of Cerrillo and Cao [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 110401 (2014)]. Further, the Dyck path section of this article follows precisely the diagrammatic analysis developed by Wang and Cai in a recent paper [Communications in Computational Physics 36, 389 (2024)]. We elaborate on these three critiques in this Comment.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of single-server Markovian queues: A dynamic amplification approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is revolutionizing various fields, including operations research and queueing theory. This study presents a quantum method for simulating single-server Markovian (M/M/1) queues, making quantum computing more accessible to researchers in operations research. We introduce a dynamic amplification approach that adapts to queue traffic, potentially improving simulation efficiency, and design custom-parameterized quantum gates for arrival and service processes. This flexible framework enables modeling of various queueing scenarios while bridging quantum computing and classical queueing theory. Notably, our quantum method shows potential advantages over classical simulations, particularly in high-traffic scenarios. This quantum simulation approach opens new possibilities for analyzing complex queueing systems, potentially outperforming classical methods in challenging scenarios and paving the way for quantum-enhanced operations research. The method was implemented and tested across low-, moderate-, and high-traffic scenarios, comparing quantum simulations with both theoretical formulas and classical simulations. Results demonstrate high agreement between quantum computations and theoretical predictions, with relative errors below 0.002 for effective arrival rates in high-traffic scenarios. As the number of qubits increases, we observe rapid convergence to theoretical values, with relative errors decreasing by up to two orders of magnitude in some cases. Sensitivity analysis reveals optimal parameter regions yielding errors lower than 0.001.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Free Localization for Benchmarking Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder-free localization (DFL) is a phenomenon as striking as it appears to be simple: a translationally invariant state evolving under a disorder-free Hamiltonian failing to thermalize. It is predicted to occur in a number of quantum systems exhibiting emergent or native \emph{local} symmetries. These include models of lattice gauge theories and, perhaps most simply, some two-component spin chains. Though well-established analytically for special soluble examples, numerical studies of generic systems have proven difficult. Moreover, the required local symmetries are a challenge for any experimental realization. Here, we show how a canonical model of DFL can be efficiently implemented on gate-based quantum computers, which relies on our efficient encoding of three-qubit gates. We show that the simultaneous observation of the absence of correlation spreading and tunable entanglement growth to a volume law provides an ideal testbed for benchmarking the capabilities of quantum computers. In particular, the availability of a soluble limit allows for a rigorous prediction of emergent localization length scales and tunable time scales for the volume law entanglement growth, which are ideal for testing capabilities of scalable quantum computers.</description>

      <title>An Accessible Planar Ion Trap for Experiential Learning in Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an inexpensive and accessible instructional setup which explores ion trapping with a planar linear ion trap. The planar trap is constructed using standard printed circuit board manufacturing and is designed to trap macroscopic charged particles in air. Trapping, shuttling, and splitting is demonstrated to students using these particles, visible to the naked eye. Students have control over trap voltages and can compare properties of particle motion to an analytic model of the trap using a computer vision program for particle tracking. Learning outcomes include understanding the design considerations for planar RF traps, mechanisms underpinning ion ejection, the physics of micromotion, and methods of data analysis using standard computer vision libraries.</description>

      <title>Four-qubit critical states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verstraete, Dehaene, and De Moor (2003) showed that SLOCC invariants provide entanglement monotones. We observe that many highly entangled or useful four-qubit states that appear in prior literature are stationary points of such entanglement measures. This motivates the search for more stationary points. We use the notion of critical points (in the sense of the Kempf-Ness theorem) together with Vinberg theory to reduce the complexity of the problem significantly. We solve the corresponding systems utilizing modern numerical nonlinear algebra methods and reduce the solutions by natural symmetries. This method produces an extended list of four-qubit stationary points, which includes all the critical states in the survey by Enriquez et al (2016).</description>

      <title>Extendibility of fermionic states and rigorous ground state approximations of interacting fermionic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving interacting fermionic quantum many-body problems as they are ubiquitous in quantum chemistry and materials science is a central task of theoretical and numerical physics, a task that can commonly only be addressed in the sense of providing approximations of ground states. For this reason, it is important to have tools at hand to assess how well simple ansatzes would fare. In this work, we provide rigorous guarantees on how well fermionic Gaussian product states can approximate the true ground state, given a weighted interaction graph capturing the interaction pattern of the systems. Our result can be on the one hand seen as a extendibility result of fermionic quantum states: It says in what ways fermionic correlations can be distributed. On the other hand, this is a non-symmetric de-Finetti theorem for fermions, as the direct fermionic analog of a theorem due to Brandao and Harrow. We compare the findings with the distinctly different situation of distinguishable finite-dimensional quantum systems, comment on the approximation of ground states with Gaussian states and elaborate on the connection to the no low-energy trivial state conjecture.</description>

      <title>Revealing spoofing of quantum illumination using entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several quantum radar concepts have been proposed that exploit the entanglement found in two-mode squeezed vacuum states of the electromagnetic field, the most prominent being radar based on quantum illumination. Classical radars are sometimes required to distinguish between true echos of their transmitted signals and signals generated by interferors or spoofers. How vulnerable to spoofing is quantum illumination? We analyze the scenario of a radar operator trying to detect the presence of a classical spoofer employing a measure-and-prepare strategy against a quantum radar. We consider two spoofing strategies - (1) direct detection and number state preparation, and (2) heterodyne detection and coherent state preparation. In each case, the radar operator performs a hypothesis test to decide if received pulses are true returns or spoofs. Since the spoofer can not reproduce the entanglement with modes retained by the radar operator, both approaches to spoofing are to some extent detectable. We quantify the effectiveness of the spoof in terms of the fidelity between the real return and the spoof return, and the probability of error in spoof detection. We find that in the absence of noise and loss, direct detection tends to produce spoofs with greater fidelity, which are therefore harder to detect. Moreover, this advantage survives the introduction of noise and loss into the model. Our results suggest that entanglement is a novel resource available to quantum radar for detecting spoofing.</description>

      <title>1-Shot Oblivious Transfer and 2-Party Computation from Noisy Quantum Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few primitives are as intertwined with the foundations of cryptography as Oblivious Transfer (OT). Not surprisingly, with the advent of the use of quantum resources in information processing, OT played a central role in establishing new possibilities (and defining impossibilities) pertaining to the use of these novel assets. A major research path is minimizing the required assumptions to achieve OT, and studying their consequences. Regarding its computation, it is impossible to construct unconditionally-secure OT without extra assumptions; and, regarding communication complexity, achieving 1-shot (and even non-interactive) OT has proved to be an elusive task, widely known to be impossible classically. Moreover, this has strong consequencesfor realizing round-optimal secure computation, in particular 1-shot 2-Party Computation (2PC). In this work, three main contributions are evidenced by leveraging quantum resources:
  1. Unconditionally-secure 2-message non-interactive OT protocol constructed in the Noisy-Quantum-Storage Model.
  2. 1-shot OT in the Noisy-Quantum-Storage Model -- proving that this construction is possible assuming the existence of one-way functions and sequential functions.
  3. 1-shot 2PC protocol compiled from a semi-honest 1-shot OT to semi-honest 1-shot Yao's Garbled Circuits protocol.</description>

      <title>Galois Symmetries in the Classification and Quantification of Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, remains challenging to classify, particularly in multipartite systems. Here, we present a new interpretation of entanglement classification by revealing a profound connection to Galois groups, the algebraic structures governing polynomial symmetries. This approach not only uncovers hidden geometric relationships between entangled quantum states and polynomial roots but also introduces a method for quantifying entanglement in multi-qubit symmetric states. By reframing the classification of GHZ, W, and separable states within the structure of Galois symmetries, we establish a previously unrecognized hierarchy in their entanglement properties. This work bridges the mathematical elegance of Galois theory with the complexities of quantum mechanics, opening pathways for advances in quantum computing and information theory.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of the master equation for interacting quantized fields at finite temperature decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the Markovian dynamics of a quantum system involving the interaction of two quantized fields at finite temperature decay. Utilizing superoperator techniques and applying two non-unitary transformations, we reformulate the Lindblad master equation into a von Neumann-like equation with an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Furthermore, an additional non-unitary transformation is employed to diagonalize this Hamiltonian, enabling us to derive an exact solution to the Lindblad master equation. This method provides a framework to calculate the evolution of any initial state in a fully quantum regime. As a specific example, we present the photon coincidence rates for two indistinguishable photons initially interacting within a cavity.</description>

      <title>Lattice fermions with solvable wide range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exactly solvable (spinless) lattice fermions with wide range interactions are constructed explicitly based on {\em exactly solvable stationary and reversible Markov chains} $\mathcal{K}^R$ reported a few years earlier by Odake and myself. The reversibility of $\mathcal{K}^R$ with the stationary distribution $\pi$ leads to a positive classical Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}^R$. The exact solvability of $\mathcal{H}^R$ warrants that of a spinless lattice fermion $c_x$, $c_x^\dagger$, $\mathcal{H}^R_f=\sum_{x,y\in\mathcal{X}}c_x^\dagger\mathcal{H}^R(x,y) c_y$ based on the principle advocated recently by myself. The reversible Markov chains $\mathcal{K}^R$ are constructed by convolutions of the orthogonality measures of the discrete orthogonal polynomials of Askey scheme. Several explicit examples of the fermion systems with wide range interactions are presented.</description>

      <title>Weak local measurements reproduce the measurement time of strong measurements on entangled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established that starting only with strong, projective quantum measurements, experiments can be designed to allow weak measurements, which lead to random walk between the possible final measurement outcomes. However, one can ask the reverse question: starting with only weak measurements, can all the results of standard strong measurements be recovered? Prior work has shown that some results can be, such as the Born rule for the probability of measurement outcomes as a function of wave intensity. In this paper we show that another crucial result can be reproduced by purely weak measurements, namely the collapse of a many-body, nonlocally entangled wave function on a time scale comparable to the characteristic time of a single, local measurement; for an entangled state of a single excitation among $N$ qubits, we find the collapse time scales as a double logarithm of $N$. This result affirms the self-consistency of the hypothesis that spontaneous weak measurements lie at the base of all physical measurements, independent of human observers.</description>

Abstract: With the growing reliance on cloud-based quantum computing, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of quantum computations is paramount. Quantum Trusted Execution Environments (QTEEs) have been proposed to protect users' quantum circuits when they are submitted to remote cloud-based quantum computers. However, deployment of QTEEs necessitates a Quantum Operating Systems (QOS) that can support QTEEs hardware and operation. This work introduces the first architecture for a QOS to support and enable essential steps required for secure quantum task execution on cloud platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speed Limit in Terms of Coherence Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherence is the most fundamental quantum resource in quantum information processing. How fast a physical system gets coherence or decoherence is a critical ingredient. We present an attainable quantum speed limit based on the variation of quantum coherence subject to a dynamical process. It indicates that for a 2-dimensional quantum state, one can always find corresponding dynamics driving it to evolve along the geodesic to another state with certain coherence variation. As applications, we study the coherence quantum speed limits of the dephasing and dissipative dynamics. It is shown that the dephasing dynamics can saturate our coherence quantum speed limit, and the decoherence of the state with identical populations will be faster than others. However, the dissipative dynamics have the opposite behavior. In addition, we illustrate a stronger tightness of our bound for the mentioned dynamics by comparison.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Group Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptographic group actions are a leading contender for post-quantum cryptography, and have also been used in the development of quantum cryptographic protocols. In this work, we explore quantum state group actions, which consist of a group acting on a set of quantum states. We show the following results:
  1. In certain settings, statistical (even query bounded) security is impossible, analogously to post-quantum classical group actions.
  2. We construct quantum state group actions and prove that many computational problems that have been proposed by cryptographers hold it. Depending on the construction, our proofs are either unconditional, rely on LWE, or rely on the quantum random oracle model. While our analysis does not directly apply to classical group actions, we argue it gives at least a sanity check that there are no obvious flaws in the post-quantum assumptions made by cryptographers.
  3. Our quantum state group action allows for unifying two existing quantum money schemes: those based on group actions, and those based on non-collapsing hashes. We also explain how they can unify classical and quantum key distribution.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear regression is a data analysis technique, which is categorized as supervised learning. By utilizing known data, we can predict unknown data. Recently, researchers have explored the use of quantum annealing (QA) to perform linear regression where parameters are approximated to discrete values using binary numbers. However, this approach has a limitation: we need to increase the number of qubits to improve the accuracy. Here, we propose a novel linear regression method using QA that leverages continuous variables. In particular, the boson system facilitates the optimization of linear regression without resorting to discrete approximations, as it directly manages continuous variables while engaging in QA. The major benefit of our new approach is that it can ensure accuracy without increasing the number of qubits as long as the adiabatic condition is satisfied.</description>

      <title>Analog simulation of noisy quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that simulating quantum circuits with low but non-zero hardware noise is more difficult than without noise. It requires either to perform density matrix simulations (coming with a space overhead) or to sample over "quantum trajectories" where Kraus operators are inserted randomly (coming with a runtime overhead). We propose a simulation technique based on a representation of hardware noise in terms of trajectories generated by operators that remain close to identity at low noise. This representation significantly reduces the variance over the quantum trajectories, speeding up noisy simulations by factors around $10$ to $100$. As a by-product, we provide a formula to factorize multiple-Pauli channels into a concatenation of single Pauli channels.</description>

      <title>Emergence of second-order coherence in the superradiant emission from a free-space atomic ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of the second-order temporal coherence during the emission of a superradiant burst by an elongated cloud of cold Rb atoms in free space. To do so, we measure the two-times intensity correlation function $g_N^{(2)}(t_1, t_2)$ following the pulsed excitation of the cloud. By monitoring $g_N^{(2)}(t, t)$ during the burst, we observe the establishment of second-order coherence, and contrast it with the situation where the cloud is initially prepared in a steady state. We compare our findings to the predictions of the Dicke model, using an effective atom number to account for finite size effects, finding that the model reproduces the observed trend at early time. For longer times, we observe a subradiant decay, a feature that goes beyond Dicke's model. Finally, we measure the $g_N^{(2)}(t_1, t_2)$ at different times and observe the appearance of anti-correlations during the burst, that are not present when starting from a steady state.</description>

      <title>Transmission through Cantor structured Dirac comb potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce the Cantor-structured Dirac comb potential, referred to as the Cantor Dirac comb (CDC-$\rho_{N}$) potential system, and investigate non-relativistic quantum tunneling through this novel potential configuration. This system is engineered by positioning delta potentials at the boundaries of each rectangular potential segment of Cantor potential. This study is the first to investigate quantum tunneling through a fractal geometric Dirac comb potential. This potential system exemplifies a particular instance of the super periodic potential (SPP), a broader class of potentials that generalize locally periodic potentials. Utilizing the theoretical framework of SPP, we derived a closed-form expression for the transmission probability for this potential architecture. We report various transmission characteristics, including the appearance of band-like features and the scaling behavior of the reflection coefficient with wave vector $k$, which is governed by a scaling function expressed as a finite product of the Laue function. A particularly striking feature of the system is the occurrence of sharp transmission resonances, which may prove useful in applications such as highly sharp transmission filters.</description>

      <title>On the impact of key design aspects in simulated Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks for Earth Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has introduced novel perspectives for tackling and improving machine learning tasks. Moreover, the integration of quantum technologies together with well-known deep learning (DL) architectures has emerged as a potential research trend gaining attraction across various domains, such as Earth Observation (EO) and many other research fields. However, prior related works in EO literature have mainly focused on convolutional architectural advancements, leaving several essential topics unexplored. Consequently, this research investigates through three cases of study fundamental aspects of hybrid quantum machine models for EO tasks aiming to provide a solid groundwork for future research studies towards more adequate simulations and looking at the post-NISQ era. More in detail, we firstly (1) investigate how different quantum libraries behave when training hybrid quantum models, assessing their computational efficiency and effectiveness. Secondly, (2) we analyze the stability/sensitivity to initialization values (i.e., seed values) in both traditional model and quantum-enhanced counterparts. Finally, (3) we explore the benefits of hybrid quantum attention-based models in EO applications, examining how integrating quantum circuits into ViTs can improve model performance.</description>

      <title>Graph-based identification of qubit network (GidNET) for qubit reuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing introduces the challenge of optimizing quantum resources crucial for executing algorithms within the limited qubit availability of current quantum architectures. Existing qubit reuse algorithms face a trade-off between optimality and scalability, with some achieving optimal reuse but limited scalability due to computational complexities, while others exhibit reduced runtime at the expense of optimality. This paper introduces GidNET (Graph-based Identification of qubit NETwork), an algorithm for optimizing qubit reuse in quantum circuits. By analyzing the circuit's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representation and its corresponding candidate matrix, GidNET identifies higher-quality pathways for qubit reuse more efficiently. Through a comparative study with established algorithms, notably QNET [1], GidNET not only achieves a consistent reduction in compiled circuit widths by a geometric mean of 4.4%, reaching up to 21% in larger circuits, but also demonstrates enhanced computational speed and scaling, with average execution time reduction of 97.4% (i.e., 38.5X geometric mean speedup) and up to 99.3% (142.9X speedup) across various circuit sizes. Furthermore, GidNET consistently outperforms Qiskit in circuit width reduction, achieving an average improvement of 59.3%, with maximum reductions of up to 72% in the largest tested circuits. These results demonstrate GidNET's ability to improve circuit width and runtime, offering a solution for quantum computers with limited numbers of qubits.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining and compounding as monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two very basic constructions involving experimental procedures are the formation of coarse-grained versions of experiments, and the formation of branching sequential experiments. The latter allow for the conditioning of states on the results of previous measurements. When one conditions on the results of different coarse-grainings of the same previous experiment, the possibility of interference effects arises. Here, I show how to formulate both constructions in terms of monads on a suitable category of (general) probabilistic models. Moreover, I show that these are connected by distributive law, allowing for a composite monad describing the closure of a probabilistic model under both coarse-graining and sequential measurement. Algebras for all three monads are characterized; lessons are drawn regarding the possibility of interference and also regarding the formation of sequential products of effects; and connections are made with some themes from the older quantum-logical literature.</description>

      <title>Superluminal signalling witness for quantum state reduction with correlated noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models for quantum state reduction address the quantum measurement problem by suggesting weak modifications to Schr\"odinger's equation that have no observable effect at microscopic scales, but dominate the dynamics of macroscopic objects. Enforcing linearity of the master equation for such models ensures that modifications to Schr\"odinger's equation do not introduce a possibility for superluminal signalling. In large classes of quantum state reduction models, however, and in particular in all models employing correlated noise, formulating a master equation for the quantum state is prohibitively difficult or impossible. Here, we formulate a witness for superluminal signalling that is applicable to generic quantum state reduction models, including those involving correlated noise. We apply the witness to several relevant cases, and find that correlated-noise models in general allow for superluminal signalling. We suggest how specific models may be able to avoid it, and that the witness introduced here provides a stringent guide to constructing such models.</description>

      <title>Superradiance of strongly interacting dipolar excitons in moir\'e quantum materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e lattices created in two-dimensional heterostructures exhibit rich many-body physics of interacting electrons and excitons and, at the same time, suggest promising optoelectronic applications. Here, we study the cooperative radiance of moir\'e excitons that is demonstrated to emerge from the deep subwavelength nature of the moir\'e lattice and the strong excitonic onsite interaction. In particular, we show that the static dipole-dipole interaction between interlayer excitons can strongly affect their cooperative optical properties, suppressing superradiance of disordered states while enhancing superradiance of ordered phases of moir\'e excitons. Moreover, we show that doping permits direct control of optical cooperativity, e.g., by generating supperradiant dynamics of otherwise subradiant states of excitons. Our results show that interlayer moir\'e excitons offer a unique platform for exploring cooperative optical phenomena in strongly interacting many-body systems, thus, holding promise for applications in quantum nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Feedforward of a Photonic Quantum State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulation conditioned on measurements on entangled photonic quantum states is a cornerstone technology of optical quantum information processing. Performing this task with low latency requires combining single-photon-level detectors with both electronic logic processing and optical modulation in close proximity. In the technologically relevant telecom wavelength band, detection of photonic quantum states is best performed with high-efficiency, low-noise, and high-speed detectors based on the photon-induced breakdown of superconductivity. Therefore, using these devices for feedforward requires mutual compatibility of all components under cryogenic conditions. Here, we demonstrate low-latency feedforward using a quasi-photon-number-resolved measurement on a quantum light source. Specifically, we use a multipixel superconducting nanowire single-photon detector, amplifier, logic, and an integrated electro-optic modulator in situ below 4K. We modulate the signal mode of a spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, conditional on a photon-number measurement of the idler mode, with a total latency of (23+/-3)ns. The photon-number discrimination actively manipulates the signal mode photon statistics, which is itself a central component in photonic quantum computing reliant on heralded single-photon sources. This represents an important benchmark for the fastest quantum photonic feedforward experiments comprising measurement, amplification, logic and modulation. This has direct applications in quantum computing, communication, and simulation protocols.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Hypothesis Testing under Zero-rate Communication Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trade-offs between error probabilities in quantum hypothesis testing are by now well-understood in the centralized setting, but much less is known for distributed settings. Here, we study a distributed binary hypothesis testing problem to infer a bipartite quantum state shared between two remote parties, where one of these parties communicates classical information to the tester at zero-rate (while the other party communicates classical or quantum information to the tester at zero-rate or higher). As our main contribution, we derive an efficiently computable single-letter formula for the Stein's exponent of this problem, when the state under the alternative is product. For the general case, we show that the Stein's exponent is given by a multi-letter expression involving max-min optimization of regularized measured relative entropy. While this becomes single-letter for the fully classical case, we further prove that this already does not happen in the same way for classical-quantum states in general. As a key tool for proving the converse direction of our results, we develop a quantum version of the blowing-up lemma which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing an operational architecture for the Quantum Internet is a challenging task in light of both fundamental limitations imposed by the laws of physics and technological constraints. Here, we propose a method to abstract away most of the quantum-specific elements and formulate a best-effort quantum network architecture based on packet-switching, akin to that of the classical Internet. Such reframing provides an opportunity to exploit the many tools and protocols available and well-understood within the Internet. As an illustration, we tailor and adapt classical congestion control and active queue management protocols to quantum networks, comprising an architecture wherein quantum end- and intermediate nodes effectively regulate demand and resource utilization, respectively. Results show that these classical networking tools can be effectively used to combat quantum memory decoherence and keep end-to-end fidelity around a target value.</description>

      <title>Hardness-Dependent Optimized Quantum Adiabatic Schedules for Maximum Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a numerical approach to design highly efficient schedules for adiabatic quantum computing, focusing on the maximum independent set problem and on neutral atom platforms. Based on a representative dataset of small graphs, we present numerical evidences that the optimum schedules depend principally on the hardness of the problem and not on its size. These schedules perform better than the benchmark protocols and admit a straightforward implementation in the hardware. This allows us to extrapolate the results to larger graphs and to successfully solve moderately hard instances with more than 100 atoms using QuEra's quantum computer ``Aquila''. We believe that extending our approach to hybrid algorithms could be the key to solve the hardest problems with the current technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore to which extent it is possible to construct efficient classical simulation of quantum many body systems using a combination of tensor network methods and the stabilizer formalism. For this we study both quantum circuit and Hamiltonian dynamics. We find that expectations of Pauli operators can be simulated efficiently even for deep Clifford circuits doped with T-gates or more general phase gates, provided the number of non-Clifford gates is smaller or approximately equal to the system size. This is despite the fact that the resulting states exhibit both extensive entanglement and extensive nonstabilizerness. For the Hamiltonian dynamics we find that the classical simulation generically quickly becomes inefficient, but suggest the use of matchgate circuits alongside tensor networks for the efficient simulation of many-body quantum systems near free-fermion integrability.</description>

      <title>Single V2 defect in 4H Silicon Carbide Schottky diode at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoelectrical and photonic integration of quantum optical components is crucial for scalable solid-state quantum technologies. Silicon carbide stands out as a material with mature quantum defects and a wide variety of applications in semiconductor industry. Here, we study the behaviour of single silicon vacancy (V2) colour centres in a metal-semiconductor (Au/Ti/4H-SiC) epitaxial wafer device, operating in a Schottky diode configuration. We explore the depletion of free carriers in the vicinity of the defect, as well as electrical tuning of the defect optical transition lines. By detecting single charge traps, we investigate their impact on V2 optical line width. Additionally, we investigate the charge-photon-dynamics of the V2 centre and find its dominating photon-ionisation processes characteristic rate and wavelength dependence. Finally, we probe the spin coherence properties of the V2 system in the junction and demonstrate several key protocols for quantum network applications. Our work shows the first demonstration of low temperature integration of a Schottky device with optical microstructures for quantum applications and paves the way towards fundamentally scalable and reproducible optical spin defect centres in solids.</description>

      <title>Anomalously extended Floquet prethermal lifetimes and applications to long-time quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet prethermalization is observed in periodically driven quantum many-body systems where the system avoids heating and maintains a stable, non-equilibrium state, for extended periods. Here we introduce a novel quantum control method using off-resonance and short-angle excitation to significantly extend Floquet prethermal lifetimes. This is demonstrated on randomly positioned, dipolar-coupled, 13C nuclear spins in diamond, but the methodology is broadly applicable. We achieve a lifetime $T_2'~800 s at 100 K while tracking the transition to the prethermal state quasi-continuously. This corresponds to a &gt;533,000-fold extension over the bare spin lifetime without prethermalization, and constitutes a new record both in terms of absolute lifetime as well as the total number of Floquet pulses applied (here exceeding 7 million). Using Laplace inversion, we develop a new form of noise spectroscopy that provides insights into the origin of the lifetime extension. Finally, we demonstrate applications of these extended lifetimes in long-time, reinitialization-free quantum sensing of time-varying magnetic fields continuously for ~10 minutes at room temperature. Our work facilitates new opportunities for stabilizing driven quantum systems through Floquet control, and opens novel applications for continuously interrogated, long-time responsive quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Learning dynamic quantum circuits for efficient state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic quantum circuits (DQCs) incorporate mid-circuit measurements and gates conditioned on these measurement outcomes. DQCs can prepare certain long-range entangled states in constant depth, making them a promising route to preparing complex quantum states on devices with a limited coherence time. Almost all constructions of DQCs for state preparation have been formulated analytically, relying on special structure in the target states. In this work, we approach the problem of state preparation variationally, developing scalable tensor network algorithms which find high-fidelity DQC preparations for generic states. We apply our algorithms to critical states, random matrix product states, and subset states. We consider both DQCs with a fixed number of ancillae and those with an extensive number of ancillae. Even in the few ancillae regime, the DQCs discovered by our algorithms consistently prepare states with lower infidelity than a static quantum circuit of the same depth. Notably, we observe constant fidelity gains across system sizes and circuit depths. For DQCs with an extensive number of ancillae, we introduce scalable methods for decoding measurement outcomes, including a neural network decoder and a real-time decoding protocol. Our work demonstrates the power of an algorithmic approach to generating DQC circuits, broadening their scope of applications to new areas of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Systematic construction of stabilizer codes via gauging abelian boundary symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a systematic framework to construct a (d+1)-dimensional stabilizer model from an initial generic d-dimensional abelian symmetry. Our approach builds upon the iterative gauging procedure, developed by one of the authors in [J. Garre-Rubio, Nature Commun. 15, 7986 (2024)], in which an initial symmetric state is repeatedly gauged to obtain an emergent model in one dimension higher that supports the initial symmetry at its boundary. This method not only enables the construction of emergent states and corresponding commuting stabilizer Hamiltonians of which they are ground states, but it also provides a way to construct gapped boundary conditions for these models that amount to spontaneously breaking part of the boundary symmetry.
  In a detailed introductory example, we showcase our paradigm by constructing three-dimensional Clifford-deformed surface codes from iteratively gauging a global 0-form symmetry that lives in two dimensions. We then provide a proof of our main result, hereby drawing upon a slight extension of the gauging procedure of Williamson. We additionally provide two more examples in d=2 in which different type-I fracton orders emerge from gauging initial linear subsystem and Sierpinski fractal symmetries. En passant, we provide explicit tensor network representations of all of the involved gauging maps and the emergent states.</description>

      <title>Exact spectral form factors of non-interacting fermions with Dyson statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral form factor (SFF) is a powerful diagnostic of random matrix behavior in quantum many-body systems. We introduce a family of random circuit ensembles whose SFFs can be computed $\textit{exactly}$. These ensembles describe the evolution of non-interacting fermions in the presence of correlated on-site potentials drawn from the eigenvalue distribution of a circular ensemble. For disorder parameters drawn from the circular unitary ensemble (CUE), we derive an exact closed form for the SFF, valid for any choice of system size $L$ or time $t$. When the disorder is drawn from the circular orthogonal or symplectic ensembles (COE and CSE, respectively), we carry out the disorder averages analytically and reduce the computation of the SFF to a combinatorial problem amenable to transfer matrix methods. In each of these cases the SFF grows exponentially in time, which we argue is a signature of random matrix universality at the single-particle level. Finally, we develop matchgate circuit representations of our circuit ensembles, enabling their experimental realization in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Multi wavefunction overlap and multi entropy for topological ground states in (2+1) dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-wavefunction overlaps -- generalizations of the quantum mechanical inner product for more than two quantum many-body states -- are valuable tools for studying many-body physics. In this paper, we investigate the multi-wavefunction overlap of (2+1)-dimensional gapped ground states, focusing particularly on symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states. We demonstrate how these overlaps can be calculated using the bulk-boundary correspondence and (1+1)-dimensional edge theories, specifically conformal field theory. When applied to SPT phases, we show that the topological invariants, which can be thought of as discrete higher Berry phases, can be extracted from the multi-wavefunction overlap of four ground states with appropriate symmetry actions. Additionally, we find that the multi-wavefunction overlap can be expressed in terms of the realignment of reduced density matrices. Furthermore, we illustrate that the same technique can be used to evaluate the multi-entropy -- a quantum information theoretical quantity associated with multi-partition of many-body quantum states -- for (2+1)-dimensional gapped ground states. Combined with numerics, we show that the difference between multi-entropy for tripartition and second R\'enyi entropies is bounded from below by $(c_{{\it tot}}/4)\ln 2$ where $c_{{\it tot}}$ is the central charge of ungappable degrees of freedom. To calculate multi-entropy numerically for free fermion systems (such as Chern insulators), we develop the correlator method for multi-entropy.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure prediction of medium and high entropy alloys across composition space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose machine learning (ML) models to predict the electron density -- the fundamental unknown of a material's ground state -- across the composition space of concentrated alloys. From this, other physical properties can be inferred, enabling accelerated exploration. A significant challenge is that the number of sampled compositions and descriptors required to accurately predict fields like the electron density increases rapidly with species. To address this, we employ Bayesian Active Learning (AL), which minimizes training data requirements by leveraging uncertainty quantification capabilities of Bayesian Neural Networks. Compared to strategic tessellation of the composition space, Bayesian-AL reduces the number of training data points by a factor of 2.5 for ternary (SiGeSn) and 1.7 for quaternary (CrFeCoNi) systems. We also introduce easy-to-optimize, body-attached-frame descriptors, which respect physical symmetries and maintain approximately the same descriptor-vector size as alloy elements increase. Our ML models demonstrate high accuracy and generalizability in predicting both electron density and energy across composition space.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a mixed-state generalization of the multi-entropy through the canonical purification, which we called reflected multi-entropy. We propose the holographic dual of this measure. For the tripartite case, a field-theoretical calculation is performed using a six-point function of twist operators at large $c$ limit. At both zero and finite temperature, the field-theoretical results match the holographic results exactly, supporting our holographic conjecture of this new measure.</description>

      <title>The spin lifetime of an individual atomic nucleus investigated via local-probe single-shot readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear spins owe their long-lived magnetic states to their excellent isolation from their environment. At the same time, a limited degree of interaction with their surroundings is necessary for reading and writing the spin state. Detailed knowledge of and control over the atomic environment of a nuclear spin is therefore key to optimizing conditions for quantum information applications. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), combined with electron spin resonance (ESR), provides atomic-scale information of individual nuclear spins via the hyperfine interaction. While this approach proved successful in mapping the nuclear spin energy levels, insight in its intrinsic behaviour in the time domain remain limited. Here, we demonstrate single-shot readout of an individual $^{\text{49}}$Ti nuclear spin with an STM. Employing a pulsed measurement scheme, we find its intrinsic lifetime to be 5.3 $\pm$ 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, we shed light on reveal the pumping and relaxation mechanism of the nuclear spin by investigating its response to both ESR driving and DC tunneling current, which is supported by model calculations involving flip-flop interactions with the electron spin in the same atom. These findings give an atomic-scale insight into the nature of nuclear spin relaxation and are relevant for the development of atomically-assembled qubit platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum cellular automata and categorical duality of spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dualities play a central role in the study of quantum spin chains, providing insight into the structure of quantum phase diagrams and phase transitions. In this work we study categorical dualities, which are defined as bounded-spread isomorphisms between algebras of symmetry-respecting local operators on a spin chain. We consider generalized global symmetries that correspond to unitary fusion categories, which are represented by matrix-product operator algebras. A fundamental question about dualities is whether they can be extended to quantum cellular automata on the larger algebra generated by all local operators that respect the unit matrix-product operator. For conventional global symmetries, which are on-site representations of finite groups, this larger algebra is simply the tensor product of algebras associated to individual spins in the chain. We present a solution to the extension problem using the machinery of Doplicher-Haag-Roberts bimodules. Our solution provides a crisp categorical criterion for when an extension of a duality exists. We show that the set of possible extensions form a torsor over the invertible objects in the relevant symmetry category. Our approach recovers existing results from the literature when applied to quantum cellular automata that respect a conventional global symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative optical effects are enabled and controlled by interactions between molecular dipoles, meaning that their mutual orientation is of paramount importance to, for example, superabsorbing light-harvesting antennas. Here we show how to move beyond the possibilities of simple geometric tailoring, demonstrating how a metallic sphere placed within a ring of parallel dipoles engineers an effective Hamiltonian that generates "guide-sliding" states within the ring system. This allows steady-state superabsorption in noisy room temperature environments, outperforming previous designs while being significantly simpler to implement.
  As exemplified by this showcase, our approach represents a powerful design paradigm for tailoring cooperative light-matter effects in molecular structures that extends beyond superabsorbing systems, to a huge array of quantum energy transport systems.</description>

      <title>Transferable Belief Model on Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transferable belief model, as a semantic interpretation of Dempster-Shafer theory, enables agents to perform reasoning and decision making in imprecise and incomplete environments. The model offers distinct semantics for handling unreliable testimonies, allowing for a more reasonable and general process of belief transfer compared to the Bayesian approach. However, because both the belief masses and the structure of focal sets must be considered when updating belief functions-leading to extra computational complexity during reasoning-the transferable belief model has gradually lost favor among researchers in recent developments. In this paper, we implement the transferable belief model on quantum circuits and demonstrate that belief functions offer a more concise and effective alternative to Bayesian approaches within the quantum computing framework. Furthermore, leveraging the unique characteristics of quantum computing, we propose several novel belief transfer approaches. More broadly, this paper introduces a new perspective on basic information representation for quantum AI models, suggesting that belief functions are more suitable than Bayesian approach for handling uncertainty on quantum circuits.</description>

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks miss a principled model of their operation. A novel framework for supervised learning based on Topological Quantum Field Theory that looks particularly well suited for implementation on quantum processors has been recently explored. We propose using this framework to understand the problem of generalisation in Deep Neural Networks. More specifically, in this approach, Deep Neural Networks are viewed as the semi-classical limit of Topological Quantum Neural Networks. A framework of this kind explains the overfitting behavior of Deep Neural Networks during the training step and the corresponding generalisation capabilities. We explore the paradigmatic case of the perceptron, which we implement as the semiclassical limit of Topological Quantum Neural Networks. We apply a novel algorithm we developed, showing that it obtains similar results to standard neural networks, but without the need for training (optimisation).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09074v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the frictional force arising from quantum fluctuations when two dissipative metallic plates are set in a shear motion. While early studies showed that the electromagnetic fields in the quantum friction setup reach nonequilibrium steady states, yielding a time-independent force, other works have demonstrated the failure to attain steady states, leading to instability and time-varying friction under sufficiently low-loss conditions. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical theory without perturbative approximations and unveil the transition from stable to unstable regimes of the quantum friction setup. Due to the relative motion of the plates, their electromagnetic response may be active in some conditions, resulting in optical gain. We prove that the standard fluctuation-dissipation leads to inconsistent results when applied to our system, and, in particular, it predicts a vanishing frictional force. Using a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation tailored for gain media, we calculate the frictional force in terms of the system Green's function, thereby recovering early works on quantum friction. Remarkably, we also find that the frictional force diverges to infinity as the relative velocity of the plates approaches a threshold. This threshold is determined by the damping strength and the distance between the metal surfaces. Beyond this critical velocity, the system exhibits instability, akin to the behaviour of a laser cavity, where no steady state exists. In such a scenario, the frictional force escalates exponentially. Our findings pave the way for experimental exploration of the frictional force in proximity to this critical regime.</description>

      <title>Universal Performance Gap of Neural Quantum States Applied to the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) have demonstrated significant potential in approximating ground states of many-body quantum systems, though their performance can be inconsistent across different models. This study investigates the performance of NQS in approximating the ground state of the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard (HBH) model, an interacting boson system on a two-dimensional square lattice with a perpendicular magnetic field. Our results indicate that increasing magnetic flux leads to a substantial increase in energy error, up to three orders of magnitude. Importantly, this decline in NQS performance is consistent across different optimization methods, neural network architectures, and physical model parameters, suggesting a significant challenge intrinsic to the model. Despite investigating potential causes such as wave function phase structure, quantum entanglement, fractional quantum Hall effect, and the variational loss landscape, the precise reasons for this degradation remain elusive. The HBH model thus proves to be an effective testing ground for exploring the capabilities and limitations of NQS. Our study highlights the need for advanced theoretical frameworks to better understand the expressive power of NQS which would allow a systematic development of methods that could potentially overcome these challenges.</description>

      <title>High Fidelity Artificial Quantum Thermal State Generation using Encoded Coherent States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum steganography is a powerful method for information security where communications between a sender and receiver are disguised as naturally occurring noise in a channel. We encoded the phase and amplitude of weak coherent laser states such that a third party monitoring the communications channel, measuring the flow of optical states through the channel, would see an amalgamation of states indistinguishable from thermal noise light. Using quantum state tomography, we experimentally reconstructed the density matrices for artificially engineered thermal states and spontaneous emission from an optical amplifier and verified a state fidelity F&gt;0.98 when compared with theoretical thermal states.</description>

      <title>Emulating quantum computing with optical matrix multiplication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14178v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical computing harnesses the speed of light to perform vector-matrix operations efficiently. It leverages interference, a cornerstone of quantum computing algorithms, to enable parallel computations. In this work, we interweave quantum computing with classical structured light by formulating the process of photonic matrix multiplication using quantum mechanical principles such as state superposition and subsequently demonstrate a well known algorithm, namely the Deutsch-Jozsa's algorithm. This is accomplished by elucidating the inherent tensor product structure within the Cartesian transverse degrees of freedom of light, which is the main resource for optical vector-matrix multiplication. To this end, we establish a discrete basis using localized Gaussian modes arranged in a lattice formation and demonstrate the operation of a Hadamard Gate. Leveraging the reprogrammable and digital capabilities of spatial light modulators, coupled with Fourier transforms by lenses, our approach proves adaptable to various algorithms. Therefore our work advances the use of structured light for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Improved QLDPC Surgery: Logical Measurements and Bridging Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the gauge-fixed QLDPC surgery scheme, an improved logical measurement scheme based on the construction of Cohen et al.~(Sci.~Adv.~8, eabn1717). Our scheme leverages expansion properties of the Tanner graph to substantially reduce the space overhead of QLDPC surgery. In certain cases, we only require $\Theta(w)$ ancilla qubits to fault-tolerantly measure a weight $w$ logical operator. We provide rigorous analysis for the code distance and fault distance of our schemes, and present a modular decoding algorithm that achieves maximal fault-distance. We further introduce a bridge system to facilitate fault-tolerant joint measurements of logical operators. Augmented by this bridge construction, our scheme can be used to connect different families of QLDPC codes into one universal architecture.
  Applying our toolbox, we show how to perform all logical Clifford gates on the [[144,12,12]] bivariate bicycle code. Our scheme adds 103 ancilla qubits into the connectivity graph, and one of the twelve logical qubits is used as an ancilla for gate synthesis. Logical measurements are combined with the automorphism gates studied by Bravyi et al.~(Nature 627, 778-782) to implement 288 Pauli product measurements. We demonstrate the practicality of our scheme through circuit-level noise simulations, leveraging our proposed modular decoder that combines BPOSD with matching.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Protocol for High-Quality QAOA Parameters with Few Shots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum heuristic for combinatorial optimization that has been demonstrated to scale better than state-of-the-art classical solvers for some problems. For a given problem instance, QAOA performance depends crucially on the choice of the parameters. While average-case optimal parameters are available in many cases, meaningful performance gains can be obtained by fine-tuning these parameters for a given instance. This task is especially challenging, however, when the number of circuit executions (shots) is limited. In this work, we develop an end-to-end protocol that combines multiple parameter settings and fine-tuning techniques. We use large-scale numerical experiments to optimize the protocol for the shot-limited setting and observe that optimizers with the simplest internal model (linear) perform best. We implement the optimized pipeline on a trapped-ion processor using up to 32 qubits and 5 QAOA layers, and we demonstrate that the pipeline is robust to small amounts of hardware noise. To the best of our knowledge, these are the largest demonstrations of QAOA parameter fine-tuning on a trapped-ion processor in terms of 2-qubit gate count.</description>

      <title>Generalized Quantum Stein's Lemma and Second Law of Quantum Resource Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics is the cornerstone of physics, characterizing the convertibility between thermodynamic states through a single function, entropy. Given the universal applicability of thermodynamics, a fundamental question in quantum information theory is whether an analogous second law can be formulated to characterize the convertibility of resources for quantum information processing by a single function. In 2008, a promising formulation was proposed, linking resource convertibility to the optimal performance of a variant of the quantum version of hypothesis testing. Central to this formulation was the generalized quantum Stein's lemma, which aimed to characterize this optimal performance by a measure of quantum resources, the regularized relative entropy of resource. If proven valid, the generalized quantum Stein's lemma would lead to the second law for quantum resources, with the regularized relative entropy of resource taking the role of entropy in thermodynamics. However, in 2023, a logical gap was found in the original proof of this lemma, casting doubt on the possibility of such a formulation of the second law. In this work, we address this problem by developing alternative techniques to successfully prove the generalized quantum Stein's lemma under a smaller set of assumptions than the original analysis. Based on our proof, we reestablish and extend the second law of quantum resource theories, applicable to both static resources of quantum states and a fundamental class of dynamical resources represented by classical-quantum (CQ) channels. These results resolve the fundamental problem of bridging the analogy between thermodynamics and quantum information theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating physical systems with variational quantum algorithms is a well-studied approach, but it is challenging to implement in current devices due to demands in qubit number and circuit depth. We show how limited knowledge of the system, namely the entropy of its subsystems, its entanglement structure or certain symmetries, can be used to reduce the cost of these algorithms with entanglement forging. To do so, we simulate a Fermi-Hubbard one-dimensional chain with a parametrized hopping term, as well as atomic nuclei ${}^{28}$Ne and ${}^{60}$Ti with the nuclear shell model. Using an adaptive variational quantum eigensolver we find significant reductions in both the maximum number of qubits (up to one fourth) and the amount of two-qubit gates (over an order of magnitude) required in the quantum circuits. Our findings indicate that our method, entropy-driven entanglement forging, can be used to adjust quantum simulations to the limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: Among different quantum computing technologies, neutral atom quantum computers have several advantageous features, such as multi-qubit gates, application-specific topologies, movable qubits, homogenous qubits, and long-range interactions. However, existing compilation techniques for neutral atoms fall short of leveraging these advantages in a practical and scalable manner. This paper introduces Parallax, a zero-SWAP, scalable, and parallelizable compilation and atom movement scheduling method tailored for neutral atom systems, which reduces high-error operations by 25% and increases the success rate by 28% on average compared to the state-of-the-art technique.</description>

Abstract: Bell's states are among the most useful in quantum computing. These state are an orthonormal base of entagled states with two qubits. We propose alternative bases of entangled states. Some of these states depend on a continuous parameter. We present the quantum circuit and code of these alternative bases. In addition, we study quantum teleportation with these entangled states and present their quantum circuits and codes associated.</description>

      <title>Compare the Pair: Rotated vs. Unrotated Surface Codes at Equal Logical Error Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practical quantum computers will require resource-efficient error-correcting codes. The rotated surface code uses approximately half the number of qubits as the unrotated surface code to create a logical qubit with the same error-correcting distance. However, instead of distance, a more useful qubit-saving metric would be based on logical error rates. In this work we find the well-below-threshold scaling of logical to physical error rates under circuit-level noise for both codes at high odd and even distances, then compare the number of qubits used by each code to achieve equal logical error rates. We perform Monte Carlo sampling of memory experiment circuits with all valid CNOT orders, using the stabiliser simulator Stim and the uncorrelated minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder PyMatching 2. We find that the rotated code uses $74 - 75\%$ the number of qubits used by the unrotated code, depending on the noise model, to achieve a logical error rate of $p_L = 10^{-12}$ at the operational physical error rate of $p=10^{-3}$. The ratio remains $\approx75\%$ for physical error rates within a factor of two of $p=10^{-3}$ for all useful logical error rates. Our work finds the low-$p_L$ scaling of the surface code and clarifies the qubit savings provided by the rotated surface code, providing numerical justification for its use in future implementations of the surface code.</description>

      <title>Certifying the quantumness of a nuclear spin qudit through its uniform precession</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin precession is a textbook example of dynamics of a quantum system that exactly mimics its classical counterpart. Here we challenge this view by certifying the quantumness of exotic states of a nuclear spin through its uniform precession. The key to this result is measuring the positivity, instead of the expectation value, of the $x$-projection of the precessing spin, and using a spin &gt; 1/2 qudit, that is not restricted to semi-classical spin coherent states. The experiment is performed on a single spin-7/2 $^{123}$Sb nucleus, implanted in a silicon nanoelectronic device, amenable to high-fidelity preparation, control, and projective single-shot readout. Using Schr\"odinger cat states and other bespoke states of the nucleus, we violate the classical bound by 19 standard deviations, proving that no classical probability distribution can explain the statistic of this spin precession, and highlighting our ability to prepare quantum resource states with high fidelity in a single atomic-scale qudit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the development of an advanced ultracold dysprosium apparatus, which incorporates a cold atom microscope (CAM) with a design resolution of a quarter micrometer. The CAM and the cooling and trapping regions are within the same vacuum glass vessel ensuring simple atom transport between them. We demonstrate the essential experimental steps of laser and evaporative cooling, lattice loading, transporting and precise positioning of a cloud of the bosonic isotope $^{164}$Dy at the CAM focal plane. Basic characterization of the CAM and future plans in enabling its full capacity are outlined. We also present a feasible platform for simulating complex spin models of quantum magnetism, such as the $XYZ$ model, by exploiting a set of closely spaced opposite parity levels in Dy with a large magnetic and electric dipole moment. We isolate a degenerate isospin-1/2 system, which possesses both magnetic and electric dipole-dipole coupling, containing Ising, exchange and spin-orbit terms. The last gives rise to a spin model with asymmetric tunable rates that depend on the lattice geometry.</description>

Abstract: Many body localization (MBL) represents a unique physical phenomenon, providing a testing ground for exploring thermalization, or more precisely its failure. Here we characterize the MBL phase geometrically by the many-body quantum metric (MBQM), defined in the parameter space of twist boundary. We find that we can characterise the transition by comparing the thermodynamic limits of the MBQM and localization length as defined in the modern theory of polarization and insulators. As such we find that we can extract a natural localization length in the MBL phase that relies only on the real space spread of the wave function and can be measured through lattice shaking or AC response measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a theoretical study of the coupled dynamics of two species of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a double well potential where both the tunneling and the interatomic interactions are driven periodically in time. The population difference between the wells of each species gives rise to a two dimensional lattice in Fock space with dimensions given by the number of atoms in each BEC. We use a Floquet analysis to derive an effective Hamiltonian that acts in this Fock space and find that it contains an artificial gauge field. This system simulates noninteracting particles in a tight binding lattice subject to an additional harmonic potential and vector potential. When the intra-species interactions are attractive there is a critical value at which the ground state of the Floquet operator undergoes a transition from a Gaussian state to a quantized vortex state in Fock space. The transition can be quantified in terms of the angular momentum as well as the entanglement entropy of the ground state with both showing sudden jumps as the intra-species interactions become stronger. The stability of the vortex state vanishes in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Gauged Gaussian PEPS -- A High Dimensional Tensor Network Formulation for Lattice Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories form the basis of our understanding of modern physics - ranging from the description of quarks and gluons to effective models in condensed matter physics. In the non-perturbative regime, gauge theories are conventionally treated discretely as lattice gauge theories. The resulting systems are evaluated with path-integral based Monte Carlo methods. These methods, however, can suffer from the sign problem and do not allow for a direct evaluation of real-time dynamics. In this work, we present a unified and comprehensive framework for gauged Gaussian Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), a variational ansatz based on tensor networks. We review the construction of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories, explain their similarities with PEPS, and detail the construction of the state. The estimation of ground states is based on a variational Monte Carlo procedure with the PEPS as an ansatz state. This sign-problem-free ansatz can be efficiently evaluated in any dimension with arbitrary gauge groups, and can include dynamical fermionic matter, suggesting new options for the simulation of non-perturbative regimes of gauge theories, including QCD.</description>

      <title>Testing and Debugging Quantum Programs: The Road to 2030</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has existed in the theoretical realm for several decades. Recently, quantum computing has re-emerged as a promising technology to solve problems that a classical computer could take hundreds of years to solve. However, there are challenges and opportunities for academics and practitioners regarding software engineering practices for testing and debugging quantum programs. This paper presents a roadmap for addressing these challenges, pointing out the existing gaps in the literature and suggesting research directions. We discuss the limitations caused by noise, the no-cloning theorem, the lack of a standard architecture for quantum computers, among others. Regarding testing, we highlight gaps and opportunities related to transpilation, mutation analysis, input states with hybrid interfaces, program analysis, and coverage. For debugging, we present the current strategies, including classical techniques applied to quantum programs, quantum-specific assertions, and quantum-related bug patterns. We introduce a conceptual model to illustrate concepts regarding the testing and debugging of quantum programs and the relationship between them. Those concepts are used to identify and discuss research challenges to cope with quantum programs through 2030, focusing on the interfaces between classical and quantum computing and on creating testing and debugging techniques that take advantage of the unique quantum computing characteristics.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography with $\tau$ leptons at the FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Future Circular Collider (FCC) -- in its first incarnation as a lepton collider -- will produce, according to the proposed design, more than 100 billion pairs of $\tau$ leptons after working for four years at the energy of the $Z$-boson resonance. The $\tau$ lepton is special because its relatively long lifetime makes it possible to reconstruct the momenta of neutrinos emitted in the single pion decay mode. The resulting large number of events is an ideal source for a full quantum tomography of the process that will test quantum entanglement and the violation of Bell inequality with unprecedented precision. In addition, the study of polarizations and spin correlations can provide a competitive determination of the Weinberg angle $ \theta_W$ and constrain possible anomalous couplings in the neutral electroweak current. We utilize analytic results and Monte Carlo simulations to explore to what extent these goals might be accomplished.</description>

      <title>Operator-Valued Kernels, Machine Learning, and Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of kernel optimization, we prove a result that yields new factorizations and realizations. Our initial context is that of general positive operator-valued kernels. We further present implications for Hilbert space-valued Gaussian processes, as they arise in applications to dynamics and to machine learning. Further applications are given in non-commutative probability theory, including a new non-commutative Radon--Nikodym theorem.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04684v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how out-of-equilibrium states thermalize under quantum unitary dynamics is an important problem in many-body physics. In this work, we propose a statistical ansatz for the matrix elements of non-equilibrium initial states in the energy eigenbasis, in order to describe such evolution. The approach is inspired by the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis (ETH) but the proposed ansatz exhibits different scaling. Importantly, we point out the exponentially small cross-correlations between the observable and the initial state matrix elements that determine relaxation dynamics toward equilibrium. We numerically verify scaling and cross-correlation, point out the emergent universality of the high-frequency behavior, and outline possible generalizations.</description>
