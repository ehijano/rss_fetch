      <title>Physical formula enhanced multi-task learning for pharmacokinetics prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has demonstrated remarkable potential in drug dis-covery, where pharmacokinetics plays a crucial role in determining the dosage, safety, and efficacy of new drugs. A major challenge for AI-driven drug discovery (AIDD) is the scarcity of high-quality data, which often requires extensive wet-lab work. A typical example of this is pharmacokinetic experiments. In this work, we develop a physical formula enhanced mul-ti-task learning (PEMAL) method that predicts four key parameters of pharmacokinetics simultaneously. By incorporating physical formulas into the multi-task framework, PEMAL facilitates effective knowledge sharing and target alignment among the pharmacokinetic parameters, thereby enhancing the accuracy of prediction. Our experiments reveal that PEMAL significantly lowers the data demand, compared to typical Graph Neural Networks. Moreover, we demonstrate that PEMAL enhances the robustness to noise, an advantage that conventional Neural Networks do not possess. Another advantage of PEMAL is its high flexibility, which can be potentially applied to other multi-task machine learning scenarios. Overall, our work illustrates the benefits and potential of using PEMAL in AIDD and other scenarios with data scarcity and noise.</description>

      <title>Towards DNA-Encoded Library Generation with GFlowNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNA-encoded libraries (DELs) are a powerful approach for rapidly screening large numbers of diverse compounds. One of the key challenges in using DELs is library design, which involves choosing the building blocks that will be combinatorially combined to produce the final library. In this paper we consider the task of protein-protein interaction (PPI) biased DEL design. To this end, we evaluate several machine learning algorithms on the PPI modulation task and use them as a reward for the proposed GFlowNet-based generative approach. We additionally investigate the possibility of using structural information about building blocks to design a hierarchical action space for the GFlowNet. The observed results indicate that GFlowNets are a promising approach for generating diverse combinatorial library candidates.</description>

      <title>HiGraphDTI: Hierarchical Graph Representation Learning for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of drug-target interactions (DTIs) plays a crucial role in pharmaceutical development. The deep learning model achieves more accurate results in DTI prediction due to its ability to extract robust and expressive features from drug and target chemical structures. However, existing deep learning methods typically generate drug features via aggregating molecular atom representations, ignoring the chemical properties carried by motifs, i.e., substructures of the molecular graph. The atom-drug double-level molecular representation learning can not fully exploit structure information and fails to interpret the DTI mechanism from the motif perspective. In addition, sequential model-based target feature extraction either fuses limited contextual information or requires expensive computational resources. To tackle the above issues, we propose a hierarchical graph representation learning-based DTI prediction method (HiGraphDTI). Specifically, HiGraphDTI learns hierarchical drug representations from triple-level molecular graphs to thoroughly exploit chemical information embedded in atoms, motifs, and molecules. Then, an attentional feature fusion module incorporates information from different receptive fields to extract expressive target features.Last, the hierarchical attention mechanism identifies crucial molecular segments, which offers complementary views for interpreting interaction mechanisms. The experiment results not only demonstrate the superiority of HiGraphDTI to the state-of-the-art methods, but also confirm the practical ability of our model in interaction interpretation and new DTI discovery.</description>
