      <title>Inversion of an analytic operator function through Fredholm quotients and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the inverse of an analytic Fredholm operator-valued function A(z) near an isolated singularity within a general Banach space framework. Our approach relies on the sequential factorization of A(z) via Fredholm quotient operators. By analyzing the properties of these quotient operators near an isolated singularity, we fully characterize the Laurent series expansion of the inverse of A(z) in terms of its Taylor coefficients around the singularity. These theoretical results are subsequently applied to characterize the solution of a general autoregressive law of motion in a Banach space.</description>

      <title>A note on the Maxwell's eigenvalues on thin sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the Maxwell's spectrum on thin tubular neighborhoods of embedded surfaces of $\mathbb R^3$. We show that the Maxwell eigenvalues converge to the Laplacian eigenvalues of the surface as the thin parameter tends to zero. To achieve this, we reformulate the problem in terms of the spectrum of the Hodge Laplacian with relative conditions acting on co-closed differential $1$-forms. The result leads to new examples of domains where the Faber-Krahn inequality for Maxwell's eigenvalues fails, examples of domains with any number of arbitrarily small eigenvalues, and underlines the failure of spectral stability under singular perturbations changing the topology of the domain. Additionally, we explicitly produce the Maxwell's eigenfunctions on product domains with the product metric, extending previous constructions valid in the Euclidean case.</description>

      <title>Stability of the inverse Sturm-Liouville problem on a quantum tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the Sturm-Liouville operators with distribution potentials of the space $W_2^{-1}$ on a metric tree. We study an inverse spectral problem that consists in the recovery of the potentials from the characteristic functions related to various boundary conditions. We prove the uniform stability of this inverse problem for potentials in a ball of any fixed radius, as well as the local stability under small perturbations of the spectral data. Our approach is based on a stable algorithm for the unique reconstruction of the potentials relying on the ideas of the method of spectral mappings.</description>

      <title>On Lieb-Thirring inequalities for multidimensional Schr\"odinger operators with complex potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the open problem by Demuth, Hansmann, and Katriel announced in [Integr. Equ. Oper. Theory 75 (2013), 1-5] by a counter-example construction. The problem concerns a possible generalisation of the Lieb-Thirring inequality for Schr\"odinger operators in to the case of complex-valued potentials. A counter-example has already been found for the one-dimensional case by the first and third authors in [J. Spectr. Theory 11 (2021), 1391-1413]. Here we generalise the counter-example to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Lieb-Thirring type inequalities for Schr\"odinger and Jacobi operators with complex potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove optimal Lieb-Thirring type inequalities for Schr\"odinger and Jacobi operators with complex potentials. Our results bound eigenvalue power sums (Riesz means) by the $L^p$ norm of the potential, where in contrast to the self-adjoint case, each term needs to be weighted by a function of the ratio of the distance of the eigenvalue to the essential spectrum and the distance to the endpoint(s) thereof. Our Lieb-Thirring type bounds only hold for integrable weight functions. To prove optimality, we establish divergence estimates for non-integrable weight functions. The divergence rates exhibit a logarithmic or even polynomial gain compared to semiclassical methods (Weyl asymptotics) for real potentials.</description>

      <title>On The Spectrum Of Infinite Quantum Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.04024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interplay between spectrum, geometry and boundary conditions for two distinguished self-adjoint realisations of the Laplacian on infinite metric graphs, the so-called riedrichs and Neumann extensions. We introduce a new criterion for compactness of the resolvent and apply this to identify a transition from purely discrete to non-empty essential spectrum among a class of infinite metric graphs, a phenomenon that seems to have no known counterpart for Laplacians on Euclidean domains of infinite volume. In the case of discrete spectrum we then prove upper and lower bounds on eigenvalues, thus extending a number of bounds previously only known in the compact setting to infinite graphs. Some of our bounds, for instance in terms of the inradius, are new even on compact graphs.</description>

      <title>Effective eigenvalue approximation from moments for self-adjoint trace-class operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral properties of bounded linear operators play a crucial role in several areas of mathematics and physics. For each self-adjoint, trace-class operator $O$ we define a set $\Lambda_n\subset \mathbb{R}$, and we show that it converges to the spectrum of $O$ in the Hausdorff metric under mild conditions. Our set $\Lambda_n$ only depends on the first $n$ moments of $O$. We show that it can be effectively calculated for physically relevant operators, and it approximates the spectrum well without diagonalization.
  We prove that using the above method we can converge to the minimal and maximal eigenvalues with super-exponential speed.
  We also construct monotone increasing lower bounds $q_n$ for the minimal eigenvalue (or decreasing upper bounds for the maximal eigenvalue). This sequence only depends on the moments of $O$ and a concrete upper estimate of its $1$-norm; we also demonstrate that $q_n$ can be effectively calculated for a large class of physically relevant operators. This rigorous lower bound $q_n$ tends to the minimal eigenvalue with super-exponential speed provided that $O$ is not positive semidefinite. As a by-product, we obtain computable upper bounds for the $1$-norm of $O$, too.
  Numerical examples demonstrate the relevance of our approximation in estimating entropy and negativity, which is useful, among others, in quantum optical and in open quantum system models. The results can be directly applicable to problems in quantum information, statistical mechanics, and quantum thermodynamics, where using traditional techniques based on diagonalization is impractical.</description>
