      <title>Prethermalization in aperiodically driven classical spin systems</title>

Abstract: Periodically driven classical many-body systems can host a rich zoo of prethermal dynamical phases. In this work, we extend the paradigm of classical prethermalization to aperiodically driven systems. We establish the existence of a long-lived prethermal regime in spin systems subjected to random multipolar drives (RMDs). We demonstrate that the thermalization time scales as $(1/T)^{2n+2}$, where $n$ is the multipolar order and $T$ is the intrinsic time-scale associated with the drive. In the $n \rightarrow \infty$ limit, the drive becomes quasi-periodic and the thermalization time becomes exponentially long ($\sim \exp(\beta/T)$). We further establish the robustness of prethermalization by demonstrating that these thermalization time scaling laws hold for a wide range of initial state energy densities. Intriguingly, the thermalization process in these classical systems is parametrically slower than their quantum counterparts, thereby highlighting important differences between classical and quantum prethermalization. Finally, we propose a protocol to harness this classical prethermalization to realize time rondeau crystals.</description>

      <title>Efficient point-based simulation of four-way coupled particles in turbulence at high number density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many natural and industrial applications, turbulent flows encompass some form of dispersed particles. Although this type of multiphase turbulent flow is omnipresent, its numerical modeling has proven to be a remarkably challenging problem. Models that fully resolve the particle phase are computationally very expensive, strongly limiting the number of particles that can be considered in practice. This warrants the need for efficient reduced order modeling of the complex system of particles in turbulence that can handle high number densities of particles. Here, we present an efficient method for point-based simulation of particles in turbulence that are four-way coupled. In contrast with traditional one-way coupled simulations, where only the effect of the fluid phase on the particle phase is modeled, this method additionally captures the back-reaction of the particle phase on the fluid phase, as well as the interactions between particles themselves. We focus on the most challenging case of very light particles or bubbles, which show strong clustering in the high-vorticity regions of the fluid. This strong clustering poses numerical difficulties which are systematically treated in our work. Our method is valid in the limit of small particles with respect to the Kolmogorov scales of the flow and is able to handle very large number densities of particles. This methods paves the way for comprehensive studies of the collective effect of small particles in fluid turbulence for a multitude of applications.</description>
