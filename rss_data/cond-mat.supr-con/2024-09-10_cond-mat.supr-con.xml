      <title>Anomalous Superconductivity in Twisted MoTe2 Nanojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introducing superconductivity in topological materials can lead to innovative electronic phases and device functionalities. Here, we present a new strategy for quantum engineering of superconducting junctions in moire materials through direct, on-chip, and fully encapsulated 2D crystal growth. We achieve robust and designable superconductivity in Pd-metalized twisted bilayer molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) and observe anomalous superconducting effects in high-quality junctions across ~ 20 moire cells. Surprisingly, the junction develops enhanced, instead of weakened, superconducting behaviors, exhibiting fluctuations to a higher critical magnetic field compared to its adjacent Pd7MoTe2 superconductor. Additionally, the critical current further exhibits a striking V-shaped minimum at zero magnetic field. These features are unexpected in conventional Josephson junctions and indeed absent in junctions of natural bilayer MoTe2 created using the same approach. We discuss implications of these observations, including the possible formation of mixed even- and odd-parity superconductivity at the moire junctions. Our results also demonstrate a pathway to engineer and investigate superconductivity in fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Planar Hall supercurrent and {\delta}{\phi}-shift in the topological Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate Josephson junctions comprising superconductors and ferromagnets on the surface of three-dimensional topological insulators. We use Bogoliubov-deGennes formalism and show the in-plane magnetization creates a difference between the upward and downward population of Andreev modes and produces a planar Hall supercurrent. Due to the strong spin-orbit interaction of Dirac fermions, bending on the supercurrent imposes a spin transfer torque on the junction. We develop a theory and demonstrate the relation between planar Hall supercurrent and spin transfer torque. The parallel component of in-plane magnetization creates an anomalous supercurrent that can flow even in zero superconducting phase difference and make $\delta\phi$-junction. We show in some range,$\pi/2d \leq m_y \leq \pi/d$, there is a $\pi$ shift in the Josephson supercurrent. This research advances our understanding of quantum transport in 3DTIs and highlights their potential in emerging quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Nodal Nematic Superconductivity in Multiple-Flat-Band Land</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a mechanism of inducing stable nodal superconductivity for multiple-flat-band systems. This mechanism is based on the degenerate flat band nature, so that not only intra-eigen-band pairing, but also inter-eigen-band pairing has a significant influence on the superconductivity properties. Based on the Bogoliubov de Gennes formalism of the heavy fermion model for the twisted bilayer graphene as an example, we show that although the nodal nematic d-wave pairing has higher energy around the nodal points compared to the chiral d-wave pairing in the momentum space, the inter-eigen-band pairing can lower the energy in other momenta away from the nodes, so that the nematic d-wave pairing is energetically favored for its overall condensation energy. This type of mechanism is particular to multiple-flat-band systems with no Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <title>Signatures of enhanced spin-triplet superconductivity induced by interfacial properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While spin-triplet pairing remains elusive in nature, there is a growing effort to realize proximity-induced equal-spin triplet superconductivity in junctions with magnetic regions or an applied magnetic field and common $s$-wave superconductors. To enhance such spin-triplet contribution, it is expected that junctions with a weak interfacial barrier and strong spin-orbit coupling are desirable. Intuitively, a weak interfacial barrier enables a robust proximity-induced superconductivity and strong spin-orbit coupling promotes spin mixing, converting spin-singlet into spin-triplet superconductivity. In contrast, we reveal a nonmonotonic spin-triplet contribution with the strength of the interfacial barrier and spin-orbit coupling. This picture is established by considering different signatures in conductance and superconducting correlations, as well as by performing self-consistent calculations. As a result, we identify a strongly enhanced spin-triplet superconductivity, realized for an intermediate strength of interfacial barrier and spin-orbit coupling. In junctions with magnetic regions, an enhanced spin-triplet superconductivity leads to a large magnetoanisotropy of conductance and superconducting correlations. This picture of an enhanced spin-triplet superconductivity is consistent with experiments demonstrating a huge increase in the conductance magnetoanisotropy, which we predict can be further enhanced at a finite bias.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the theoretical model underpinning the recently reported room-temperature, ambient-pressure superconductivity along line defects on the surface of highly-oriented pyrolytic graphite. The main ingredients for this 1D room-temperature superconductivity are pairing by effective strain gauge fields, the formation of an effective Josephson junction array in its Bose metal state on the surface and the suppression of phase slips by dimensional embedding in an extremely well-conducting 3D bulk structure.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quasiparticle Relaxation in a Superconductor via the Proximity Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiparticle relaxation in pure superconductors is thought to be determined by the intrinsic inelastic scattering rate in the material. In certain applications, i.e. superconducting qubits and circuits, excess quasiparticles exist at densities far beyond the thermal equilibrium level, potentially leading to dephasing and energy loss. In order to engineer superconductors with shorter overall quasiparticle lifetimes, we consider the impact of a proximity layer on the transport of quasiparticles in a superconductor. We find that a normal metal layer can be used to significantly increase the relaxation rate of quasiparticles in a superconductor, as seen by a large reduction in the quasiparticle charge imbalance in a fully proximitized Cu/Al bilayer wire. The mechanism for this effect may be useful for preventing quasiparticle poisoning of qubits using carefully chosen proximity bilayers consisting of clean superconductors and disordered normal metals.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous magnetic field and disorder effects in BaPtAs_1-x_Sb_x_ with honeycomb network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral superconductivity exhibits the formation of novel electron pairs that breaks the time-reversal symmetry and has been actively studied in various quantum materials in recent years. However, despite its potential to provide definitive information, effects of disorder in the crystal structure on the chiral superconductivity has not yet been clarified, and therefore the investigation using a solid-solution system is desirable. We report muon-spin-relaxation (muSR) results of layered pnictide BaPtAs_1-x_Sb_x_ with a honeycomb network composed of Pt and (As, Sb). We observed an increase of the zero-field muon-spin relaxation rate in the superconducting (SC) state at the Sb end of x=1.0, suggesting the occurrence of spontaneous magnetic field due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the SC state. On the other hand, spontaneous magnetic field was almost and completely suppressed for the As-Sb mixed samples of x=0.9 and 0.2, respectively, suggesting that the time-reversal symmetry breaking SC state in x=1.0 is sensitive to disorder. The magnetic penetration depth estimated from transverse-field muSR measurements at x=1.0 and 0.2 behaved like weak-coupling s-wave superconductivity. These seemingly incompatible zero-field and transverse-field muSR results of BaPtAs_1-x_Sb_x_ with x=1.0 could be understood in terms of chiral d-wave superconductivity with point nodes on the three-dimensional Fermi surface.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in ternary pyrite-type compound IrBi$_{1-x}$Te$_{1+x}$ ($x \approx 0.2$) at ambient and high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report superconductivity in the ternary compound IrBi$_{0.8}$Te$_{1.2}$ with critical temperature 1.7 K. The replacement of Bi by Te leads to the metallic conductivity in contrast to the semiconducting parent compound IrBiTe. The superconductivity can be further enhanced by application of external pressure. $T_c$ demonstrates dome-shaped dependence on pressure with a maximum value of 2.6 K at 26.5 GPa. Pressure effects on electronic properties and lattice dynamic of IrBi$_{0.8}$Te$_{1.2}$ were studied by pressure dependent electrical resistivity, Hall effect and Raman spectroscopy measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantized current steps due to the synchronization of microwaves with Bloch oscillations in small Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization of Bloch oscillations in small Josephson junctions (JJs) under microwave radiation, which leads to current quantization, has been proposed as an effect that is dual to the appearance of Shapiro steps. This current quantization was recently demonstrated in superconducting nanowires in a compact high-impedance environment. Direct observation of current quantization in JJs would cofirm the synchronization of Bloch oscillations with microwaves and help with the realisation of the metrological current standard. Here, we place JJs in a high-impedance environment and demonstrate dual Shapiro steps for frequencies up to 24 GHz (I=7.7 nA). Current quantization exists, however, only in a narrow range of JJ parameters. We carry out a systematic study to explain this by invoking the model of a JJ in the presence of thermal noise. The findings are important for fundamental physics and application in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>FePd2Te2: An Anisotropic Two-Dimensional Ferromagnet with One-Dimensional Fe Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnets have attracted significant attentions in recent years due to their importance in the research on both fundamental physics and spintronic applications. Here, we report the discovery of a new ternary compound FePd2Te2. It features a layered quasi-2D crystal structure with one-dimensional Fe zigzag chains extending along the b-axis in the cleavage plane. Single crystals of FePd2Te2 with centimeter-size could be grown. Density functional theory calculations, mechanical exfoliation and atomic force microscopy on these crystals reveal that they are 2D materialsthat can be thinned down to 5 nm. Magnetic characterization shows that FePd2Te2 is an easy-plane ferromagnet with Tc 183 K and strong in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Magnetoresistance and anomalous Hall effect demonstrate that ferromagnetism could maintain in FePd2Te2 flakes with large coercivity. A crystal twinning effect is observed by scanning tunneling microscopy which makes the Fe chains right-angle bent in the cleavage plane and creates an intriguing spin texture. Our results show that FePd2Te2 is a correlated anisotropic 2D magnets that may attract multidisciplinary research interests.</description>

      <title>Emergent chirality and superfluidity of parity-doubled baryons in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose novel superfluids induced by the parity-doubled baryons. The parity-doubled baryons, i.e., a nucleon $N(940)$ with spin-parity $J^{P}=1/2^{+}$ and an excited nucleon $N^{\ast}(1535)$ with $J^{P}=1/2^{-}$ in vacuum, become degenerate at sufficiently high density where the chiral symmetry is restored. In this study, we extend the conventional $\mathrm{U}(1)$ chiral symmetry to the higher dimensional symmetries, dubbed emergent chiral symmetries, including the naive and mirror assignments as their subgroups. Starting with the Lagrangian up to four-point interactions among the neutron $n$ and its chiral partner $n^{\ast}$, neutral components in $N$ and $N^{\ast}$, in pure neutron matter, we investigate the properties of the ground state with a pairing gap generated by the $n$ and $n^{\ast}$ in the mean-field approximation. We find vector-type condensates that induce the dynamical breaking of a new class of internal symmetries, emergent chiral symmetries, as well as the baryon number and the rotational symmetries of the real space, indicating the appearance of massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons consisting of six quarks: emergent pions, superfluid phonons, and magnons, respectively. We also study the fermionic excitation modes at low-energy scales, and show that they exhibit a spatial anisotropy of the propagation at the Dirac cone in momentum space. Some phenomenological implications are advocated, shedding new light on the properties of neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate superconducting gallium in its $\alpha$ phase using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at temperatures down to about 100 mK. High-resolution tunneling spectroscopies using both superconducting and normal tips show that superconducting $\alpha$-Ga is accurately described by Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, with a gap $\Delta_{\rm Ga}$ = 163 $\mu$eV on the $\alpha-$Ga(112) facet, with highly homogeneous spectra over the surface, including atomic defects and step edges. Using a superconducting Pb tip, we furthermore study the low-bias conductance features of the Josephson junction formed between tip and sample. The features are accurately described by dynamical Coulomb blockade theory, highlighting $\alpha-$Ga as a possible platform for surface science studies of mesoscopic superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Finite-size topological phases from semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological semimetals are some of the topological phases of matter most intensely-studied experimentally. The Weyl semimetal phase, in particular, has garned tremendous, sustained interest given fascinating signatures such as the Fermi arc surface states and the chiral anomaly, as well as the minimal requirements to protect this three-dimensional topological phase. Here, we show that thin films of Weyl semimetals (which we call quasi-(3-1)-dimensional, or q(3-1)d) generically realize finite-size topological phases distinct from 3d and 2d topological phases of established classification schemes: response signatures of the 3d bulk topology co-exist with topologically-protected, quasi-(3-2)d Fermi arc states or chiral boundary modes due to a second, previously-unidentified bulk-boundary correspondence. We show these finite-size topological semimetal phases are realized by Hamiltonians capturing the Fermiology of few-layer Van der Waals material MoTe2 in experiment. Given the broad experimental interest in few-layer Van der Waals materials and topological semimetals, our work paves the way for extensive future theoretical and experimental characterization of finite-size topological phases.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Versus Static Oxidation of Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb Trilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High quality Nb-based superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) junctions with Al oxide (AlO$_x$) tunnel barriers grown from Al overlayers are widely reported in the literature. However, the thin barriers required for high critical current density (J$_c$) junctions exhibit defects that result in significant subgap leakage current that is detrimental for many applications. High quality, high-J$_c$ junctions can be realized with AlN$_x$ barriers, but control of J$_c$ is more difficult than with AlO$_x$. It is therefore of interest to study the growth of thin AlO$_x$ barriers with the ultimate goal of achieving high quality, high-J$_c$ AlO$_x$ junctions. In this work, 100\%\ O$_2$ and 2\%\ O$_2$ in Ar gas mixtures are used both statically and dynamically to grow AlO$_x$ tunnel barriers over a large range of oxygen exposures. In situ ellipsometry is used for the first time to extensively measure AlO$_x$ tunnel barrier growth in real time, revealing a number of unexpected patterns. Finally, a set of test junction wafers was fabricated that exhibited the well-known dependence of J$_c$ on oxygen exposure (E) in order to further validate the experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian phase-biased Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study non-Hermitian Josephson junctions formed by superconductors with a finite phase difference under non-Hermiticity, which naturally appears due to coupling to normal reservoirs. Depending on the structure of non-Hermiticity, captured in terms of retarded self-energies, the low-energy spectrum hosts topologically stable exceptional points either at zero or finite real energies as a function of the superconducting phase difference. Interestingly, the corresponding phase-biased supercurrents may acquire divergent profiles at such exceptional points. This instance is a natural and unique non-Hermitian effect that signals a possible way to enhance the sensitivity of Josephson junctions. Our work opens a way for realizing unique non-Hermitian phenomena due to the interplay between non-Hermitian topology and the Josephson effect.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect in one-dimensional quantum wires connected to superconductors with mixed singlet-triplet pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect (JDE), characterized by asymmetric critical currents in a Josephson junction, has drawn considerable attention in the field of condensed matter physics. We investigate the conditions under which JDE can manifest in a one-dimensional Josephson junction composed of a spin-orbit-coupled quantum wire with an applied Zeeman field, connected between two superconductors. Our study reveals that while spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and a Zeeman field in the quantum wire are not sufficient to induce JDE when the superconductors are purely singlet, the introduction of triplet pairing in the superconductors leads to the emergence of JDE. This finding highlights the potential of JDE as a probe for triplet superconductivity. We further demonstrate that even in absence of SOC in the quantum wire, JDE can arise when the directions of the triplet pairing and the Zeeman field are non-collinear, provided the superconductors exhibit mixed singlet-triplet pairing. Additionally, we identify specific conditions under which JDE is absent, namely, when the pairing is purely triplet and the directions of the SOC and the triplet pairing are perpendicular. Our findings indicate that JDE is always accompanied by the anomalous Josephson effect. The diode effect coefficient is found to oscillate with variations in the chemical potential of the quantum wire, driven by Fabry-P\'erot interference effects. Our results suggest that quantum wires in Josephson junctions could serve as effective platforms for probing triplet superconductivity through the observation of JDE.</description>

      <title>Non-trivial fusion of Majorana zero modes in interacting quantum-dot arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental reports of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in quantum-dot systems at the ``sweet spot'', where the electronic hopping $t_h$ is equal to the superconducting coupling $\Delta$, we study the time-dependent spectroscopy corresponding to the non-trivial fusion of MZMs. The expression non-trivial refers to the fusion of Majoranas from different original pairs of MZMs, each with well-defined parities. For the first time, we employ an experimentally accessible time-dependent real-space local density-of-states (LDOS) method to investigate the non-trivial MZMs fusion outcomes in canonical chains and in a Y-shape array of interacting electrons. In the case of quantum-dot chains where two pairs of MZMs are initially disconnected, after fusion we find equal-height peaks in the electron and hole components of the LDOS, signaling non-trivial fusion into both the vacuum $I$ and fermion $\Psi$ channels with equal weight. For $\pi$-junction quantum-dot chains, where the superconducting phase has opposite signs on the left and right portions of the chain, after the non-trivial fusion, we observed the formation of an exotic two-site MZM near the center of the chain, coexisting with another single-site MZM. Furthermore, we also studied the fusion of three MZMs in the Y-shape geometry. In this case, after the fusion we observed the novel formation of another exotic multi-site MZM, with properties depending on the connection and geometry of the central region of the Y-shape quantum-dot array.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics of a Superconducting Szilard Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement a Szilard engine using a 2-bit logical unit consisting of inductively coupled quantum flux parametrons (QFPs) -- Josephson-junction superconducting circuits with applications in both the classical and quantum information processing regimes. Detailed simulations show that it is highly thermodynamically efficient while functioning as a Maxwell demon -- converting heat to work. The physically-calibrated design is targeted to direct experimental exploration. However, variations in Josephson junction fabrication introduce asymmetries that result in energy inefficiency and low operational fidelity. We provide a design solution that mitigates these practical challenges. The resulting platform is ideally suited to probe the thermodynamic foundations of information processing devices far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Shock waves in nonlinear transmission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01463v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first half of the paper we consider interaction between the small amplitude travelling waves ("sound") and the shock waves in the transmission line containing both nonlinear capacitors and nonlinear inductors. We calculate the "sound" wave coefficient of reflection from (coefficient of transmission through) the shock wave. These coefficients are expressed in terms of the speeds of the "sound" waves relative to the shock and the wave impedances. In the second half of the paper we explicitly include into consideration the dissipation in the system, introducing ohmic resistors shunting the inductors and also in series with the capacitors. This allows us to justify the conditions on the shocks, postulated in the first half of the paper. This also allows us to describe the shocks as physical objects of finite width and study their profiles, same as the profiles of the waves closely connected with the shocks - the kinks. The profiles of the latter, and in some particular cases the profiles of the former, were obtained in terms of elementary functions.</description>

      <title>Connection between f-electron correlations and magnetic excitations in UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detailed anisotropy of the low-temperature, low-energy magnetic excitations of the candidate spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ is revealed using inelastic neutron scattering. The magnetic excitations emerge from the Brillouin zone boundary at the high symmetry $Y$ and $T$ points and disperse along the crystallographic $\hat{b}$-axis. In applied magnetic fields to at least $\mu_0 H=11$~T along the $\hat{c}-$axis, the magnetism is found to be field-independent in the $(hk0)$ plane. The scattering intensity is consistent with that expected from U$^{3+}$/U$^{4+}$ $f$-electron spins with preferential orientation along the crystallographic $\hat{a}$-axis, and a fluctuating magnetic moment of 2.3(7) $\mu_B$. These characteristics indicate that the excitations are due to intraband spin excitons arising from $f$-electron hybridization.</description>
