      <title>Hartogs type extension theorem for the complement of effective and numerically effective divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these notes we generalize the Ohsawa's results on the Hartogs extension phenomenon in the complement of effective divisors in K\"ahler manifolds with semipositive non-flat normal bundle. Namely, we prove that the Hartogs extension phenomenon occurs in the complement of effective and nef divisors with connected supports in K\"ahler manifolds. We use homological algebra methods instead of a construction of the $(n-1)$-convex exhaustion function. Also, the Demailly-Peternell vanishing theorem is a crucial argument for us. Moreover, we obtain geometric characterizations of the Hartogs phenomenon for the complement of basepoint-free divisors.</description>

      <title>Infinitely divisible modified Bessel distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on continuous univariate probability distributions, like McKay distributions, $K$-distribution, generalized inverse Gaussian distribution and generalised McKay distributions, with support $[0,\infty),$ which are related to modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds and in most cases we show that they belong to the class infinitely divisible distributions, self-decomposable distributions, generalized gamma convolutions and hyperbolically completely monotone densities. Some of the results are known, however the proofs are new and we use special functions technique. Integral representations of quotients of Tricomi hypergeometric functions as well as of quotients of Gaussian hypergeometric functions, or modified Bessel functions of the second kind play an important role in our study. In addition, by using a different approach we rediscover a Stieltjes transform representation due to Hermann Hankel for the product of modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds and we also deduce a series of new Stieltjes transform representations for products, quotients and their reciprocals concerning modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds. By using these results we obtain new infinitely divisible modified Bessel distributions with Laplace transforms related to modified Bessel functions of the first and second kind. Moreover, we show that the new Stieltjes transform representations have some interesting applications and we list some open problems which may be of interest for further research. In addition, we present a new proof via the Pick function characterization theorem for the infinite divisibility of the ratio of two gamma random variables and we present some new Stieltjes transform representations of quotients of Tricomi hypergeometric functions.</description>

      <title>Smooth plurisubharmonic exhaustion functions on pseudo-convex domains in infinite dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, by modifying significantly the Friedrichs-Gross mollifier technique and/or using the Lasry-Lions regularization technique together with some carefully chosen cut-off functions, for the first time we construct explicitly smooth exhaustion functions on any open subset and smooth plurisubharmonic exhaustion functions on any pseudo-convex domain in a typical Hilbert space, which enjoy delicate properties needed for the $L^{2}$ method in infinite-dimensional complex analysis.</description>

      <title>Some Characterizations of Weakly Uniformly Perfect Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the concept of weakly uniform perfectness is considered. As an analogue of the theory of uniform perfectness, we obtain the relationships between weakly uniform perfectness and Bergman kernel, Poincar\'e metric and Hausdorff content. In particular, for a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}$, we show that the uniform perfectness of $\partial \Omega$ is equivalent to $K_{\Omega}(z) \gtrsim \delta(z)^{-2}$, where $K_{\Omega}(z)$ is the Bergman kernel of $\Omega$ and $\delta(z)$ denotes the boundary distance.</description>

      <title>Deformation Families of Quasi-Projective Varieties and Symmetric Projective K3 Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to construct a deformation family of symmetric projective K3 surfaces through a deformation family of quasi-projective varieties together with construction of symmetric Kahler metrics on symmetric projective K3 surfaces. Firstly, if the normal bundle satisfies the Diophantine condition, the tubular neighborhood of an elliptic curve embedded in $\text{CP}^2 \text{$\#$9} \overline{\text{CP}}^2$ can be identified through the toroidal group. Secondly, with ample line bundles fixed on $\text{CP}^2 \text{$\#$9} \overline{\text{CP}}^2$, complete Kahler metrics are constructed on the quasi-projective variety from $\text{CP}^2 \text{$\#$9} \overline{\text{CP}}^2$. Finally, a deformation family of symmetric projective K3 surfaces over a 10-dimensional complex manifold is constructed through a smooth compactifiable deformation of complete quasi-projective varieties from $\text{CP}^2 \text{$\#$9} \overline{\text{CP}}^2$ over a 9-dimensional complex manifold and an analogue deformation family.</description>
