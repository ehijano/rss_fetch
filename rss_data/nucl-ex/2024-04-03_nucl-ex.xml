      <title>Avenues for a number density interpretation of dihadron fragmentation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this comment, we reassess the underlying physics of the number sum rule for dihadron fragmentation functions. We will argue that, currently, there are no settled constraints on what constitutes a valid number density interpretation for multihadron fragmentation functions. Imposing overly restrictive criteria might lead to misinterpretating the data. Most importantly, and on the basis of phenomenological analyses, the slightly varying definitions used in previous work are not excluded from possessing legitimate number density interpretations (up to the usual issues with ultraviolet divergences and renormalization), so long as they are paired with appropriate factorization theorems. We advocate for further theoretical analyses to be challenged with experimental data, available at JLab or at the future EIC.</description>

      <title>An implementation of nuclear many-body wave functions by the superposition of localized Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for the low-energy nuclear structure calculations, which describes the single-particle wave function as a superposition of localized Gaussians. It is a hybrid of the Hartree-Fock and antisymmetrized molecular dynamics models. In the numerical calculations of oxygen, calcium isotopes and 100Sn, the framework shows its potential by significantly improving upon AMD and yielding the results consistent with or even better than Hartree-Fock(-Bogoliubov) calculations based on harmonic oscillator expansions. In addition to the basic equations, general form of the matrix elements is also given.</description>

      <title>Estimating the detection of antineutrinos in the future Brazilian neutron source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In line with the tradition of employing nuclear reactors for neutrino physics research, we present potential experiments that could be undertaken using the new Brazilian neutron source, the Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor (RMB). This upcoming facility has clearly defined objectives, including the production of radiopharmaceuticals for the healthcare system, material irradiation testing, and research using neutron beams to investigate the micro and mesostructures of various materials. However, we anticipate that the RMB will generate up to $3,500$ antineutrinos daily, potentially expanding the facility's scope to include neutrino physics experiments involving beta and inverse beta reactions. The modern operational conditions of the RMB and its location in the Iper\'o-Brazil region may also enable neutrino oscillation experiments and the determination of the $\theta_{13}$ parameter, as well as support safeguards activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), allowing for the monitoring of nuclear fuel burning cycles and isotope fractions. We discuss the potential utilization of the RMB as an antineutrino source, proposing experiments and addressing associated technical limitations.</description>
