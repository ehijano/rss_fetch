      <title>A theoretical framework for reservoir computing on networks of organic electrochemical transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate prediction of physical systems is important even when the rules of those systems cannot be easily learned. Reservoir computing, a type of recurrent neural network with fixed nonlinear units, is one such prediction method and is valued for its ease of training. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are physical devices with nonlinear transient properties that can be used as the nonlinear units of a reservoir computer. We present a theoretical framework for simulating reservoir computers using OECTs as the non-linear units as a test bed for designing physical reservoir computers. We present a proof of concept demonstrating that such an implementation can accurately predict the Lorenz attractor with comparable performance to standard reservoir computer implementations. We explore the effect of operating parameters and find that the prediction performance strongly depends on the pinch-off voltage of the OECTs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Population-based Search with Active Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Active Inference framework models perception and action as a unified process, where agents use probabilistic models to predict and actively minimize sensory discrepancies. In complement and contrast, traditional population-based metaheuristics rely on reactive environmental interactions without anticipatory adaptation. This paper proposes the integration of Active Inference into these metaheuristics to enhance performance through anticipatory environmental adaptation. We demonstrate this approach specifically with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) on the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). Experimental results indicate that Active Inference can yield some improved solutions with only a marginal increase in computational cost, with interesting patterns of performance that relate to number and topology of nodes in the graph. Further work will characterize where and when different types of Active Inference augmentation of population metaheuristics may be efficacious.</description>

      <title>Mutation Strength Adaptation of the $(\mu/\mu_I, \lambda)$-ES for Large Population Sizes on the Sphere Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mutation strength adaptation properties of a multi-recombinative $(\mu/\mu_I, \lambda)$-ES are studied for isotropic mutations. To this end, standard implementations of cumulative step-size adaptation (CSA) and mutative self-adaptation ($\sigma$SA) are investigated experimentally and theoretically by assuming large population sizes ($\mu$) in relation to the search space dimensionality ($N$). The adaptation is characterized in terms of the scale-invariant mutation strength on the sphere in relation to its maximum achievable value for positive progress. %The results show how the different $\sigma$-adaptation variants behave as $\mu$ and $N$ are varied. Standard CSA-variants show notably different adaptation properties and progress rates on the sphere, becoming slower or faster as $\mu$ or $N$ are varied. This is shown by investigating common choices for the cumulation and damping parameters. Standard $\sigma$SA-variants (with default learning parameter settings) can achieve faster adaptation and larger progress rates compared to the CSA. However, it is shown how self-adaptation affects the progress rate levels negatively. Furthermore, differences regarding the adaptation and stability of $\sigma$SA with log-normal and normal mutation sampling are elaborated.</description>

      <title>On the Improvement of Generalization and Stability of Forward-Only Learning via Neural Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forward-only learning algorithms have recently gained attention as alternatives to gradient backpropagation, replacing the backward step of this latter solver with an additional contrastive forward pass. Among these approaches, the so-called Forward-Forward Algorithm (FFA) has been shown to achieve competitive levels of performance in terms of generalization and complexity. Networks trained using FFA learn to contrastively maximize a layer-wise defined goodness score when presented with real data (denoted as positive samples) and to minimize it when processing synthetic data (corr. negative samples). However, this algorithm still faces weaknesses that negatively affect the model accuracy and training stability, primarily due to a gradient imbalance between positive and negative samples. To overcome this issue, in this work we propose a novel implementation of the FFA algorithm, denoted as Polar-FFA, which extends the original formulation by introducing a neural division (\emph{polarization}) between positive and negative instances. Neurons in each of these groups aim to maximize their goodness when presented with their respective data type, thereby creating a symmetric gradient behavior. To empirically gauge the improved learning capabilities of our proposed Polar-FFA, we perform several systematic experiments using different activation and goodness functions over image classification datasets. Our results demonstrate that Polar-FFA outperforms FFA in terms of accuracy and convergence speed. Furthermore, its lower reliance on hyperparameters reduces the need for hyperparameter tuning to guarantee optimal generalization capabilities, thereby allowing for a broader range of neural network configurations.</description>

Abstract: Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) have emerged as a revolutionary technology with a high temporal resolution that far surpasses RGB cameras. DVS technology draws biological inspiration from photoreceptors and the initial retinal synapse. Our research showcases the potential of additional retinal functionalities to extract visual features. We provide a domain-agnostic and efficient algorithm for ego-motion compensation based on Object Motion Sensitivity (OMS), one of the multiple robust features computed within the mammalian retina. We develop a framework based on experimental neuroscience that translates OMS' biological circuitry to a low-overhead algorithm. OMS processes DVS data from dynamic scenes to perform pixel-wise object motion segmentation. Using a real and a synthetic dataset, we highlight OMS' ability to differentiate object motion from ego-motion, bypassing the need for deep networks. This paper introduces a bio-inspired computer vision method that dramatically reduces the number of parameters by a factor of 1000 compared to prior works. Our work paves the way for robust, high-speed, and low-bandwidth decision-making for in-sensor computations.</description>

      <title>Event Stream based Human Action Recognition: A High-Definition Benchmark Dataset and Algorithms</title>

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) stands as a pivotal research domain in both computer vision and artificial intelligence, with RGB cameras dominating as the preferred tool for investigation and innovation in this field. However, in real-world applications, RGB cameras encounter numerous challenges, including light conditions, fast motion, and privacy concerns. Consequently, bio-inspired event cameras have garnered increasing attention due to their advantages of low energy consumption, high dynamic range, etc. Nevertheless, most existing event-based HAR datasets are low resolution ($346 \times 260$). In this paper, we propose a large-scale, high-definition ($1280 \times 800$) human action recognition dataset based on the CeleX-V event camera, termed CeleX-HAR. It encompasses 150 commonly occurring action categories, comprising a total of 124,625 video sequences. Various factors such as multi-view, illumination, action speed, and occlusion are considered when recording these data. To build a more comprehensive benchmark dataset, we report over 20 mainstream HAR models for future works to compare. In addition, we also propose a novel Mamba vision backbone network for event stream based HAR, termed EVMamba, which equips the spatial plane multi-directional scanning and novel voxel temporal scanning mechanism. By encoding and mining the spatio-temporal information of event streams, our EVMamba has achieved favorable results across multiple datasets. Both the dataset and source code will be released on \url{https://github.com/Event-AHU/CeleX-HAR}</description>

      <title>Liquid Fourier Latent Dynamics Networks for fast GPU-based numerical simulations in computational cardiology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (ML) is gaining momentum as a cost-effective alternative to physics-based numerical solvers in many engineering applications. In fact, scientific ML is currently being used to build accurate and efficient surrogate models starting from high-fidelity numerical simulations, effectively encoding the parameterized temporal dynamics underlying Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), or even the spatio-temporal behavior underlying Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), in appropriately designed neural networks. We propose an extension of Latent Dynamics Networks (LDNets), namely Liquid Fourier LDNets (LFLDNets), to create parameterized space-time surrogate models for multiscale and multiphysics sets of highly nonlinear differential equations on complex geometries. LFLDNets employ a neurologically-inspired, sparse, liquid neural network for temporal dynamics, relaxing the requirement of a numerical solver for time advancement and leading to superior performance in terms of tunable parameters, accuracy, efficiency and learned trajectories with respect to neural ODEs based on feedforward fully-connected neural networks. Furthermore, in our implementation of LFLDNets, we use a Fourier embedding with a tunable kernel in the reconstruction network to learn high-frequency functions better and faster than using space coordinates directly as input. We challenge LFLDNets in the framework of computational cardiology and evaluate their capabilities on two 3-dimensional test cases arising from multiscale cardiac electrophysiology and cardiovascular hemodynamics. This paper illustrates the capability to run Artificial Intelligence-based numerical simulations on single or multiple GPUs in a matter of minutes and represents a significant step forward in the development of physics-informed digital twins.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Stability-Plasticity Dilemma in Adaptive Train Scheduling with Curriculum-Driven Continual DQN Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A continual learning agent builds on previous experiences to develop increasingly complex behaviors by adapting to non-stationary and dynamic environments while preserving previously acquired knowledge. However, scaling these systems presents significant challenges, particularly in balancing the preservation of previous policies with the adaptation of new ones to current environments. This balance, known as the stability-plasticity dilemma, is especially pronounced in complex multi-agent domains such as the train scheduling problem, where environmental and agent behaviors are constantly changing, and the search space is vast. In this work, we propose addressing these challenges in the train scheduling problem using curriculum learning. We design a curriculum with adjacent skills that build on each other to improve generalization performance. Introducing a curriculum with distinct tasks introduces non-stationarity, which we address by proposing a new algorithm: Continual Deep Q-Network (DQN) Expansion (CDE). Our approach dynamically generates and adjusts Q-function subspaces to handle environmental changes and task requirements. CDE mitigates catastrophic forgetting through EWC while ensuring high plasticity using adaptive rational activation functions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in learning efficiency and adaptability compared to RL baselines and other adapted methods for continual learning, highlighting the potential of our method in managing the stability-plasticity dilemma in the adaptive train scheduling setting.</description>

      <title>TBA: Faster Large Language Model Training Using SSD-Based Activation Offloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth rate of the GPU memory capacity has not been able to keep up with that of the size of large language models (LLMs), hindering the model training process. In particular, activations -- the intermediate tensors produced during forward propagation and reused in backward propagation -- dominate the GPU memory use. To address this challenge, we propose TBA to efficiently offload activations to high-capacity NVMe SSDs. This approach reduces GPU memory usage without impacting performance by adaptively overlapping data transfers with computation. TBA is compatible with popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, Megatron, and DeepSpeed, and it employs techniques such as tensor deduplication, forwarding, and adaptive offloading to further enhance efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on GPT, BERT, and T5. Results demonstrate that TBA effectively reduces 47% of the activation peak memory usage. At the same time, TBA perfectly overlaps the I/O with the computation and incurs negligible performance overhead. We introduce the recompute-offload-keep (ROK) curve to compare the TBA offloading with other two tensor placement strategies, keeping activations in memory and layerwise full recomputation. We find that TBA achieves better memory savings than layerwise full recomputation while retaining the performance of keeping the activations in memory.</description>

      <title>Applications of Nature-Inspired Metaheuristic Algorithms for Tackling Optimization Problems Across Disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms are important components of artificial intelligence, and are increasingly used across disciplines to tackle various types of challenging optimization problems. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of such algorithms for solving a variety of challenging optimization problems in statistics using a nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm called competitive swarm optimizer with mutated agents (CSO-MA). This algorithm was proposed by one of the authors and its superior performance relative to many of its competitors had been demonstrated in earlier work and again in this paper. The main goal of this paper is to show a typical nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithmi, like CSO-MA, is efficient for tackling many different types of optimization problems in statistics. Our applications are new and include finding maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in a single cell generalized trend model to study pseudotime in bioinformatics, estimating parameters in the commonly used Rasch model in education research, finding M-estimates for a Cox regression in a Markov renewal model, performing matrix completion tasks to impute missing data for a two compartment model, and selecting variables optimally in an ecology problem in China. To further demonstrate the flexibility of metaheuristics, we also find an optimal design for a car refueling experiment in the auto industry using a logistic model with multiple interacting factors. In addition, we show that metaheuristics can sometimes outperform optimization algorithms commonly used in statistics.</description>

      <title>A Crowding Distance That Provably Solves the Difficulties of the NSGA-II in Many-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent theoretical works have shown that the NSGA-II can have enormous difficulties to solve problems with more than two objectives. In contrast, algorithms like the NSGA-III or SMS-EMOA, differing from the NSGA-II only in the secondary selection criterion, provably perform well in these situations.
  To remedy this shortcoming of the NSGA-II, but at the same time keep the advantages of the widely accepted crowding distance, we use the insights of these previous work to define a variant of the crowding distance, called truthful crowding distance. Different from the classic crowding distance, it has for any number of objectives the desirable property that a small crowding distance value indicates that some other solution has a similar objective vector.
  Building on this property, we conduct mathematical runtime analyses for the NSGA-II with truthful crowding distance. We show that this algorithm can solve the many-objective versions of the OneMinMax, COCZ, LOTZ, and OJZJ$_k$ problems in the same (polynomial) asymptotic runtimes as the NSGA-III and the SMS-EMOA. This contrasts the exponential lower bounds previously shown for the classic NSGA-II. For the bi-objective versions of these problems, our NSGA-II has a similar performance as the classic NSGA-II, gaining however from smaller admissible population sizes. For the bi-objective OneMinMax problem, we also observe a (minimally) better performance in approximating the Pareto front.
  These results suggest that our truthful version of the NSGA-II has the same good performance as the classic NSGA-II in two objectives, but can resolve the drastic problems in more than two objectives.</description>

      <title>Patch of Invisibility: Naturalistic Physical Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on Object Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04238v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks on deep-learning models have been receiving increased attention in recent years. Work in this area has mostly focused on gradient-based techniques, so-called "white-box" attacks, wherein the attacker has access to the targeted model's internal parameters; such an assumption is usually unrealistic in the real world. Some attacks additionally use the entire pixel space to fool a given model, which is neither practical nor physical (i.e., real-world). On the contrary, we propose herein a direct, black-box, gradient-free method that uses the learned image manifold of a pretrained generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate naturalistic physical adversarial patches for object detectors. To our knowledge this is the first and only method that performs black-box physical attacks directly on object-detection models, which results with a model-agnostic attack. We show that our proposed method works both digitally and physically. We compared our approach against four different black-box attacks with different configurations. Our approach outperformed all other approaches that were tested in our experiments by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Auto-weighted Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks and robust estimations for multitask inverse problems in pore-scale imaging of dissolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a novel data assimilation strategy in pore-scale imaging and demonstrate that this makes it possible to robustly address reactive inverse problems incorporating Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). Pore-scale modeling of reactive flow offers a valuable opportunity to investigate the evolution of macro-scale properties subject to dynamic processes. Yet, they suffer from imaging limitations arising from the associated X-ray microtomography (X-ray microCT) process, which induces discrepancies in the properties estimates. Assessment of the kinetic parameters also raises challenges, as reactive coefficients are critical parameters that can cover a wide range of values. We account for these two issues and ensure reliable calibration of pore-scale modeling, based on dynamical microCT images, by integrating uncertainty quantification in the workflow.
  The present method is based on a multitasking formulation of reactive inverse problems combining data-driven and physics-informed techniques in calcite dissolution. This allows quantifying morphological uncertainties on the porosity field and estimating reactive parameter ranges through prescribed PDE models with a latent concentration field and dynamical microCT. The data assimilation strategy relies on sequential reinforcement incorporating successively additional PDE constraints. We guarantee robust and unbiased uncertainty quantification by straightforward adaptive weighting of Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINNs), ensuring reliable micro-porosity changes during geochemical transformations. We demonstrate successful Bayesian Inference in 1D+Time and 2D+Time calcite dissolution based on synthetic microCT images with meaningful posterior distribution on the reactive parameters and dimensionless numbers.</description>

      <title>Order of Compression: A Systematic and Optimal Sequence to Combinationally Compress CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model compression has gained significant popularity as a means to alleviate the computational and memory demands of machine learning models. Each compression technique leverages unique features to reduce the size of neural networks. Although intuitively combining different techniques may enhance compression effectiveness, we find that the order in which they are combined significantly influences performance. To identify the optimal sequence for compressing neural networks, we propose the Order of Compression, a systematic and optimal sequence to apply multiple compression techniques in the most effective order. We start by building the foundations of the orders between any two compression approaches and then demonstrate inserting additional compression between any two compressions will not break the order of the two compression approaches. Based on the foundations, an optimal order is obtained with topological sorting. Validated on image-based regression and classification networks across different datasets, our proposed Order of Compression significantly reduces computational costs by up to 859 times on ResNet34, with negligible accuracy loss (-0.09% for CIFAR10) compared to the baseline model. We believe our simple yet effective exploration of the order of compression will shed light on the practice of model compression.</description>

Abstract: Multiresolution Matrix Factorization (MMF) is unusual amongst fast matrix factorization algorithms in that it does not make a low rank assumption. This makes MMF especially well suited to modeling certain types of graphs with complex multiscale or hierarchical strucutre. While MMF promises to yields a useful wavelet basis, finding the factorization itself is hard, and existing greedy methods tend to be brittle. In this paper, we propose a ``learnable'' version of MMF that carfully optimizes the factorization using metaheuristics, specifically evolutionary algorithms and directed evolution, along with Stiefel manifold optimization through backpropagating errors. We show that the resulting wavelet basis far outperforms prior MMF algorithms and gives comparable performance on standard learning tasks on graphs. Furthermore, we construct the wavelet neural networks (WNNs) learning graphs on the spectral domain with the wavelet basis produced by our MMF learning algorithm. Our wavelet networks are competitive against other state-of-the-art methods in molecular graphs classification and node classification on citation graphs. We release our implementation at https://github.com/HySonLab/LearnMMF</description>

      <title>Online Learning of Temporal Dependencies for Sustainable Foraging Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01501</link>

Abstract: The sustainable foraging problem is a dynamic environment testbed for exploring the forms of agent cognition in dealing with social dilemmas in a multi-agent setting. The agents need to resist the temptation of individual rewards through foraging and choose the collective long-term goal of sustainability. We investigate methods of online learning in Neuro-Evolution and Deep Recurrent Q-Networks to enable agents to attempt the problem one-shot as is often required by wicked social problems. We further explore if learning temporal dependencies with Long Short-Term Memory may be able to aid the agents in developing sustainable foraging strategies in the long term. It was found that the integration of Long Short-Term Memory assisted agents in developing sustainable strategies for a single agent, however failed to assist agents in managing the social dilemma that arises in the multi-agent scenario.</description>
