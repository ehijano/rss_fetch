      <title>Involutive scroll structures on solutions of 4D dispersionless integrable hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rational normal scroll structure on an $(n+1)$-dimensional manifold $M$ is defined as a field of rational normal scrolls of degree $n-1$ in the projectivised cotangent bundle $\mathbb{P}T^*M$. We show that geometry of this kind naturally arises on solutions of various 4D dispersionless integrable hierarchies of heavenly type equations. In this context, rational normal scrolls coincide with the characteristic varieties (principal symbols) of the hierarchy. Furthermore, such structures automatically satisfy an additional property of involutivity. Our main result states that involutive scroll structures are themselves governed by a dispersionless integrable hierarchy, namely, the hierarchy of conformal self-duality equations.</description>

      <title>The Virasoro symmetries of the bigraded modified Toda hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modified Toda hierarchy is a two-component generalization of the 1st modified KP hierarchy, which has been widely applied to analyze constraints of the Toda hierarchy, including the B--Toda and C--Toda hierarchies. In this paper, we construct additional symmetries for the modified Toda hierarchy and derive the corresponding Adler-Shiota-van Moerbeke formula. In addition, we also show that $(N,M)$--bigraded modified Toda hierarchy(BMTH), which is a special reduction for modified Toda, possess additional symmetries that form a subalgebra of the Virasoro algebra.</description>

      <title>Effective Soliton Velocities in the Toda Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Toda lattice $(\boldsymbol{p}(t); \boldsymbol{q}(t))$ at thermal equilibrium, meaning that its variables $(p_i)$ and $(e^{q_i-q_{i+1}})$ are independent Gaussian and Gamma random variables, respectively. This model can be thought of a dense collection of many solitons. We establish a law of large numbers for the trajectory of these solitons, showing that they travel with approximately constant velocities, which are explicit. Our proof is based on a direct analysis of the asymptotic scattering relation, an equation (proven in previous work of the author) that approximately governs the dynamics of soliton locations. This makes use of a regularization argument that essentially linearizes this relation, together with concentration estimates for the Toda lattice's (random) Lax matrix.</description>

      <title>Majorana fermions solve the tetrahedron equations as well as higher simplex equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Yang-Baxter equations define quantum integrable models. The tetrahedron and higher simplex equations are multi-dimensional generalizations. Finding the solutions of these equations is a formidable task. In this work we develop a systematic method - constructing higher simplex operators [solutions of corresponding simplex equations] from lower simplex ones. We call it lifting. By starting from solutions of Yang-Baxter equations we can construct solutions of the tetrahedron equation and simplex equation in any dimension. We then generalize this by starting from a solution of any lower simplex equation and lifting it [construct solution] to another simplex equation in higher dimension. This process introduces several constraints among the different lower simplex operators that are lifted to form the higher simplex operators. We show that braided Yang-Baxter operators [solutions of Yang-Baxter equations independent of spectral parameters] constructed using Majorana fermions satisfy these constraints, thus solving the higher simplex equations. As a consequence these solutions help us understand the action of an higher simplex operator on Majorana fermions. Apart from these we show that solutions constructed using Dirac (complex) fermions and Clifford algebras also satisfy these constraints. Furthermore it is observed that the Clifford solutions give rise to positive Boltzmann weights resulting in the possibility of physical statistical mechanics models in higher dimensions. Finally we also show that anti-Yang-Baxter operators [solutions of Yang-Baxter-like equations with a negative sign on the right hand side] can also be lifted to higher simplex solutions.</description>
