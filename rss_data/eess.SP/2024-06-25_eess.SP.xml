      <title>Enhanced Robustness in Wireless Communications through Unified Sequency-Frequency Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the evolving wireless communications landscape, addressing the challenges of multipath fading and high mobility remains paramount. This paper introduces the Unified Sequency-Frequency Multiplexing (USFM) framework, a pioneering modulation scheme designed to significantly improve signal robustness and system performance by harnessing the integrated strengths of both sequency and frequency domains. At the heart of USFM lies the Joint Sequency-Frequency Transform (JSFT), a novel mathematical operation that seamlessly merges the characteristics of the Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT) and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Through rigorous mathematical modeling, we delineate the theoretical foundation of USFM, supported by theorems and lemmas that underscore its potential to mitigate common channel impairments more effectively than existing modulation schemes. Furthermore, we propose an optimization process, guided by machine learning algorithms, to dynamically adapt the signal based on real-time Channel State Information (CSI), ensuring optimal performance under diverse conditions. Empirical simulations demonstrate the superior performance of USFM in scenarios characterized by Rayleigh fading and Doppler effects, highlighting its advantages in terms of error probability reduction and spectral efficiency. The USFM framework represents a significant leap forward in communication theory and offers practical implications for designing future wireless systems that require high reliability and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Full-Space Wireless Sensing Enabled by Multi-Sector Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15945v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-sector intelligent surface (IS), benefiting from a smarter wave manipulation capability, has been shown to enhance channel gain and offer full-space coverage in communications. However, the benefits of multi-sector IS in wireless sensing remain unexplored. This paper introduces the application of multi-sector IS for wireless sensing/localization. Specifically, we propose a new self-sensing system, where an active source controller uses the multi-sector IS geometry to reflect/scatter the emitted signals towards the entire space, thereby achieving full-space coverage for wireless sensing. Additionally, dedicated sensors are installed aligned with the IS elements at each sector, which collect echo signals from the target and cooperate to sense the target angle. In this context, we develop a maximum likelihood estimator of the target angle for the proposed multi-sector IS self-sensing system, along with the corresponding theoretical limits defined by the Cram\'er-Rao Bound. The analysis reveals that the advantages of the multi-sector IS self-sensing system stem from two aspects: enhancing the probing power on targets (thereby improving power efficiency) and increasing the rate of target angle (thereby enhancing the transceiver's sensitivity to target angles). Finally, our analysis and simulations confirm that the multi-sector IS self-sensing system, particularly the 4-sector architecture, achieves full-space sensing capability beyond the single-sector IS configuration. Furthermore, similarly to communications, employing directive antenna patterns on each sector's IS elements and sensors significantly enhances sensing capabilities. This enhancement originates from both aspects of improved power efficiency and target angle sensitivity, with the former also being observed in communications while the latter being unique in sensing.</description>

      <title>Gridless Parameter Estimation in Partly Calibrated Rectangular Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial frequency estimation from a mixture of noisy sinusoids finds applications in various fields. While subspace-based methods offer cost-effective super-resolution parameter estimation, they demand precise array calibration, posing challenges for large antennas. In contrast, sparsity-based approaches outperform subspace methods, especially in scenarios with limited snapshots or correlated sources. This study focuses on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using a partly calibrated rectangular array with fully calibrated subarrays. A gridless sparse formulation leveraging shift invariances in the array is developed, yielding two competitive algorithms under the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and successive convex approximation frameworks, respectively. Numerical simulations show the superior error performance of our proposed method, particularly in highly correlated scenarios, compared to the conventional subspace-based methods. It is demonstrated that the proposed formulation can also be adopted in the fully calibrated case to improve the robustness of the subspace-based methods to the source correlation. Furthermore, we provide a generalization of the proposed method to a more challenging case where a part of the sensors is unobservable due to failures.</description>

      <title>Federated Transfer Learning Aided Interference Classification in GNSS Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the classification of interference signals to global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) stemming from mobile jammers such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) across diverse wireless communication zones, employing federated learning (FL) and transfer learning (TL). Specifically, we employ a neural network classifier, enhanced with FL to decentralize data processing and TL to hasten the training process, aiming to improve interference classification accuracy while preserving data privacy. Our evaluations span multiple data scenarios, incorporating both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-identically distributed (non-IID), to gauge the performance of our approach under different interference conditions. Our results indicate an improvement of approximately $8\%$ in classification accuracy compared to basic convolutional neural network (CNN) model, accompanied by expedited convergence in networks utilizing pre-trained models. Additionally, the implementation of FL not only developed privacy but also matched the robustness of centralized learning methods, particularly under IID scenarios. Moreover, the federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm effectively manages regional interference variability, thereby enhancing the regional communication performance indicator, $C/N_0$, by roughly $5\text{dB}\cdot \text{Hz}$ compared to isolated setups.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Precoding With Low-Resolution PSs for Wideband Terahertz Communication Systems in The Face of Beam Squint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication is considered one of the most critical technologies for 6G because of its abundant bandwidth. To compensate the high propagation of THz, analog/digital hybrid precoding for THz massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) is proposed to focus signals and extend communication range. Notably, considering hardware cost and power consumption, infinite and high-resolution phase shifters (PSs) are difficult to implement in THz massive MIMO and low-resolution PSs are typically adopted in practice. However, low-resolution PSs cause severe performance degradation. Moreover, the beam squint in wideband THz massive MIMO increases the performance degradation because of the frequency independence of the analog PSs. Motivated by the above factors, in this paper, we firstly propose a heuristic algorithm under fully connected (FC) structure, which optimize the digital precoder and the analog precoder alternately. Then we migrate the proposed heuristic algorithm to the partially-connected (PC) architecture. To further improve the performance, we extend our design to dynamic subarrays in which each RF chain is connected to any antenna that does not duplicate. The numerical results demonstrate that our proposed wideband hybrid precoding with low-resolution PSs achieves better performance to the comparisons for both FC structure and PC structure.</description>

      <title>Robust Broadband Beamforming using Bilinear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for robust beamforming, where the goal is to estimate a signal from array samples when there is uncertainty in the angle of arrival. Our method offers state-of-the-art performance on narrowband signals and is naturally applied to broadband signals. Our beamformer operates by treating the forward model for the array samples as unknown. We show that the "true" forward model lies in the linear span of a small number of fixed linear systems. As a result, we can estimate the forward operator and the signal simultaneously by solving a bilinear inverse problem using least squares. Our numerical experiments show that if the angle of arrival is known to only be within an interval of reasonable size, there is very little loss in estimation performance compared to the case where the angle is known exactly.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity CSI Feedback for FDD Massive MIMO Systems via Learning to Optimize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In frequency-division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the growing number of base station antennas leads to prohibitive feedback overhead for downlink channel state information (CSI). To address this challenge, state-of-the-art (SOTA) fully data-driven deep learning (DL)-based CSI feedback schemes have been proposed. However, the high computational complexity and memory requirements of these methods hinder their practical deployment on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones. To solve the problem, we propose a model-driven DL-based CSI feedback approach by integrating the wisdom of compressive sensing and learning to optimize (L2O). Specifically, only a linear learnable projection is adopted at the encoder side to compress the CSI matrix, thereby significantly cutting down the user-side complexity and memory expenditure. On the other hand, the decoder incorporates two specially designed components, i.e., a learnable sparse transformation and an element-wise L2O reconstruction module. The former is developed to learn a sparse basis for CSI within the angular domain, which explores channel sparsity effectively. The latter shares the same long short term memory (LSTM) network across all elements of the optimization variable, eliminating the retraining cost when problem scale changes. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves a comparable performance with the SOTA CSI feedback scheme but with much-reduced complexity, and enables multiple-rate feedback.</description>

      <title>Polar-Coded Tensor-Based Unsourced Random Access with Soft Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unsourced random access (URA) has emerged as a viable scheme for supporting the massive machine-type communications (mMTC) in the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks. Notably, the tensor-based URA (TURA), with its inherent tensor structure, stands out by simultaneously enhancing performance and reducing computational complexity for the multi-user separation, especially in mMTC networks with a large numer of active devices. However, current TURA scheme lacks the soft decoder, thus precluding the incorporation of existing advanced coding techniques. In order to fully explore the potential of the TURA, this paper investigates the Polarcoded TURA (PTURA) scheme and develops the corresponding iterative Bayesian receiver with feedback (IBR-FB). Specifically, in the IBR-FB, we propose the Grassmannian modulation-aided Bayesian tensor decomposition (GM-BTD) algorithm under the variational Bayesian learning (VBL) framework, which leverages the property of the Grassmannian modulation to facilitate the convergence of the VBL process, and has the ability to generate the required soft information without the knowledge of the number of active devices. Furthermore, based on the soft information produced by the GM-BTD, we design the soft Grassmannian demodulator in the IBR-FB. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PTURA in conjunction with the IBR-FB surpasses the existing state-of-the-art unsourced random access scheme in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Robust NLoS Localization in 5G mmWave Networks: Data-based Methods and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring smooth mobility management while employing directional beamformed transmissions in 5G millimeter-wave networks calls for robust and accurate user equipment (UE) localization and tracking. In this article, we develop neural network-based positioning models with time- and frequency-domain channel state information (CSI) data in harsh non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions. We propose a novel frequency-domain feature extraction, which combines relative phase differences and received powers across resource blocks, and offers robust performance and reliability. Additionally, we exploit the multipath components and propose an aggregate time-domain feature combining time-of-flight, angle-of-arrival and received path-wise powers. Importantly, the temporal correlations are also harnessed in the form of sequence processing neural networks, which prove to be of particular benefit for vehicular UEs. Realistic numerical evaluations in large-scale line-of-sight (LoS)-obstructed urban environment with moving vehicles are provided, building on full ray-tracing based propagation modeling. The results show the robustness of the proposed CSI features in terms of positioning accuracy, and that the proposed models reliably localize UEs even in the absence of a LoS path, clearly outperforming the state-of-the-art with similar or even reduced processing complexity. The proposed sequence-based neural network model is capable of tracking the UE position, speed and heading simultaneously despite the strong uncertainties in the CSI measurements. Finally, it is shown that differences between the training and online inference environments can be efficiently addressed and alleviated through transfer learning.</description>

      <title>The Derivation of The Probability of Error for BPSK, 16-QAM and 64-QAM in Rayleigh Fading Channel: A Unified Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the probability of error is paramount in the design and analysis of digital communication systems, particularly in Rayleigh fading channels where signal impairments are prevalent. This article presents a unified approach for deriving the probability of error formulations applicable to Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), 16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (16-QAM), and 64-QAM in Rayleigh fading channels. This article presents a general approach to derive the probability of error formulations applicable to Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), 16-Quadruple Amplitude Modulation (16-QAM) and 64-QAM in Rayleigh fading channels. The derivation process encompasses the unique characteristics of each modulation scheme and the statistical properties of Rayleigh fading providing a comprehensive framework to analyze error performance. By establishing a unified formulation, this approach simplifies the analysis and facilitates a deeper understanding of error probability behavior across different modulation schemes. The derived formulations offer insights into the impact of fading-induced impairments on system performance, allowing for accurate prediction and optimization of communication systems in real-world fading environments. The insights and techniques presented herein serve as a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and practitioners engaged in the design and optimization of communication systems operating in challenging fading environments.</description>

      <title>Decentralized RL-Based Data Transmission Scheme for Energy Efficient Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolving landscape of the Internet of Things (IoT) has given rise to a pressing need for an efficient communication scheme. As the IoT user ecosystem continues to expand, traditional communication protocols grapple with substantial challenges in meeting its burgeoning demands, including energy consumption, scalability, data management, and interference. In response to this, the integration of wireless power transfer and data transmission has emerged as a promising solution. This paper considers an energy harvesting (EH)-oriented data transmission scheme, where a set of users are charged by their own multi-antenna power beacon (PB) and subsequently transmits data to a base station (BS) using an irregular slotted aloha (IRSA) channel access protocol. We propose a closed-form expression to model energy consumption for the present scheme, employing average channel state information (A-CSI) beamforming in the wireless power channel. Subsequently, we employ the reinforcement learning (RL) methodology, wherein every user functions as an agent tasked with the goal of uncovering their most effective strategy for replicating transmissions. This strategy is devised while factoring in their energy constraints and the maximum number of packets they need to transmit. Our results underscore the viability of this solution, particularly when the PB can be strategically positioned to ensure a strong line-of-sight connection with the user, highlighting the potential benefits of optimal deployment.</description>

      <title>Stationary and Sparse Denoising Approach for Corticomuscular Causality Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Cortico-muscular communication patterns are instrumental in understanding movement control. Estimating significant causal relationships between motor cortex electroencephalogram (EEG) and surface electromyogram (sEMG) from concurrently active muscles presents a formidable challenge since the relevant processes underlying muscle control are typically weak in comparison to measurement noise and background activities. Methodology: In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to simultaneously estimate the order of the autoregressive model of cortico-muscular interactions along with the parameters while enforcing stationarity condition in a convex program to ensure global optimality. The proposed method is further extended to a non-convex program to account for the presence of measurement noise in the recorded signals by introducing a wavelet sparsity assumption on the excitation noise in the model. Results: The proposed methodology is validated using both simulated data and neurophysiological signals. In case of simulated data, the performance of the proposed methods has been compared with the benchmark approaches in terms of order identification, computational efficiency, and goodness of fit in relation to various noise levels. In case of physiological signals our proposed methods are compared against the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of the ability to detect Granger causality. Significance: The proposed methods are shown to be effective in handling stationarity and measurement noise assumptions, revealing significant causal interactions from brain to muscles and vice versa.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Sample Size in Reconstructing Noisy Graph Signals: A Theoretical Characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing a signal on a graph from noisy observations of a subset of the vertices is a fundamental problem in the field of graph signal processing. This paper investigates how sample size affects reconstruction error in the presence of noise via an in-depth theoretical analysis of the two most common reconstruction methods in the literature, least-squares reconstruction (LS) and graph-Laplacian regularised reconstruction (GLR). Our theorems show that at sufficiently low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), under these reconstruction methods we may simultaneously decrease sample size and decrease average reconstruction error. We further show that at sufficiently low SNRs, for LS reconstruction we have a $\Lambda$-shaped error curve and for GLR reconstruction, a sample size of $ \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the total number of vertices, results in lower reconstruction error than near full observation. We present thresholds on the SNRs, $\tau$ and $\tau_{GLR}$, below which the error is non-monotonic, and illustrate these theoretical results with experiments across multiple random graph models, sampling schemes and SNRs. These results demonstrate that any decision in sample-size choice has to be made in light of the noise levels in the data.</description>

Abstract: Optical imaging of blood flow yields critical functional insights into the circulatory system, but its clinical implementation has typically been limited to shallow depths (~1 millimeter) due to light scattering in biological tissue. Here, we present photoacoustic noninvasive Doppler angiography (PANDA) for deep blood flow imaging. PANDA synergizes the photoacoustic and Doppler effects to generate color Doppler velocity and power Doppler blood flow maps of the vascular lumen. Our results demonstrate PANDA's ability to measure blood flow in vivo up to one centimeter in depth, marking approximately an order of magnitude improvement over existing high-resolution pure optical modalities. PANDA enhances photoacoustic flow imaging by increasing depth and enabling cross-sectional blood vessel imaging. We also showcase PANDA's clinical feasibility through three-dimensional imaging of blood flow in healthy subjects and a patient with varicose veins. By integrating the imaging system onto a mobile platform, we have designed PANDA to be a portable modality that is primed for expedient clinical translation. PANDA offers noninvasive, single modality imaging of hemoglobin and blood flow with three-dimensional capability, facilitating comprehensive assessment of deep vascular dynamics in humans.</description>

      <title>Coded Beam Training for RIS Assisted Wireless Communications</title>

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is considered as one of the key technologies for future 6G communications. To fully unleash the performance of RIS, accurate channel state information (CSI) is crucial. Beam training is widely utilized to acquire the CSI. However, before aligning the beam correctly to establish stable connections, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at UE is inevitably low, which reduces the beam training accuracy. To deal with this problem, we exploit the coded beam training framework for RIS systems, which leverages the error correction capability of channel coding to improve the beam training accuracy under low SNR. Specifically, we first extend the coded beam training framework to RIS systems by decoupling the base station-RIS channel and the RIS-user channel. For this framework, codewords that accurately steer to multiple angles is essential for fully unleashing the error correction capability. In order to realize effective codeword design in RIS systems, we then propose a new codeword design criterion, based on which we propose a relaxed Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) based codeword design scheme by considering the constant modulus constraints of RIS elements. In addition, considering the two dimensional structure of RIS, we further propose a dimension reduced encoder design scheme, which can not only guarentee a better beam shape, but also enable a stronger error correction capability. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme can realize effective and accurate beam training in low SNR scenarios.</description>

      <title>Automatic AI Model Selection for Wireless Systems: Online Learning via Digital Twinning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern wireless network architectures, such as O-RAN, artificial intelligence (AI)-based applications are deployed at intelligent controllers to carry out functionalities like scheduling or power control. The AI "apps" are selected on the basis of contextual information such as network conditions, topology, traffic statistics, and design goals. The mapping between context and AI model parameters is ideally done in a zero-shot fashion via an automatic model selection (AMS) mapping that leverages only contextual information without requiring any current data. This paper introduces a general methodology for the online optimization of AMS mappings. Optimizing an AMS mapping is challenging, as it requires exposure to data collected from many different contexts. Therefore, if carried out online, this initial optimization phase would be extremely time consuming. A possible solution is to leverage a digital twin of the physical system to generate synthetic data from multiple simulated contexts. However, given that the simulator at the digital twin is imperfect, a direct use of simulated data for the optimization of the AMS mapping would yield poor performance when tested in the real system. This paper proposes a novel method for the online optimization of AMS mapping that corrects for the bias of the simulator by means of limited real data collected from the physical system. Experimental results for a graph neural network-based power control app demonstrate the significant advantages of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Shaping Radio Access to Match Variable Wireless Fronthaul Quality in Next-Generation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Centralized-RAN (C-RAN) has revolutionized mobile network infrastructure, offering streamlined cell-site engineering and enhanced network management capabilities. As C-RAN gains momentum, the focus shifts to optimizing fronthaul links. While fiber fronthaul guarantees performance, wireless alternatives provide cost efficiency and scalability, making them preferable in densely urbanized areas. However, wireless fronthaul often requires expensive over-dimensioning to overcome the challenging atmospheric attenuation typical of high frequencies. We propose a framework designed to continuously align radio access capacity with fronthaul link quality to overcome this rigidity. By gradually adapting radio access capacity to available fronthaul capacity, the framework ensures smooth degradation rather than complete service loss. Various strategies are proposed, considering factors like functional split and beamforming technology and exploring the tradeoff between adaptation strategy complexity and end-to-end system performance. Numerical evaluations using experimental rain attenuation data illustrate the framework's effectiveness in optimizing radio access capacity under realistically variable fronthaul link quality, ultimately proving the importance of adaptive capacity management in maximizing C-RAN efficiency.</description>

      <title>Pivotal Auto-Encoder via Self-Normalizing ReLU</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse auto-encoders are useful for extracting low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional data. However, their performance degrades sharply when the input noise at test time differs from the noise employed during training. This limitation hinders the applicability of auto-encoders in real-world scenarios where the level of noise in the input is unpredictable. In this paper, we formalize single hidden layer sparse auto-encoders as a transform learning problem. Leveraging the transform modeling interpretation, we propose an optimization problem that leads to a predictive model invariant to the noise level at test time. In other words, the same pre-trained model is able to generalize to different noise levels. The proposed optimization algorithm, derived from the square root lasso, is translated into a new, computationally efficient auto-encoding architecture. After proving that our new method is invariant to the noise level, we evaluate our approach by training networks using the proposed architecture for denoising tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the trained models yield a significant improvement in stability against varying types of noise compared to commonly used architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks for classification tasks. We look at the smallest magnitude of possible additive perturbations that can change the output of a classification algorithm. We provide a matrix-theoretic explanation of the adversarial fragility of deep neural network for classification. In particular, our theoretical results show that neural network's adversarial robustness can degrade as the input dimension $d$ increases. Analytically we show that neural networks' adversarial robustness can be only $1/\sqrt{d}$ of the best possible adversarial robustness. Our matrix-theoretic explanation is consistent with an earlier information-theoretic feature-compression-based explanation for the adversarial fragility of neural networks.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Modeling in Metrology -- A Short Introduction, Current Developments and Future Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical models are vital to the field of metrology, playing a key role in the derivation of measurement results and the calculation of uncertainties from measurement data, informed by an understanding of the measurement process. These models generally represent the correlation between the quantity being measured and all other pertinent quantities. Such relationships are used to construct measurement systems that can interpret measurement data to generate conclusions and predictions about the measurement system itself. Classic models are typically analytical, built on fundamental physical principles. However, the rise of digital technology, expansive sensor networks, and high-performance computing hardware have led to a growing shift towards data-driven methodologies. This trend is especially prominent when dealing with large, intricate networked sensor systems in situations where there is limited expert understanding of the frequently changing real-world contexts. Here, we demonstrate the variety of opportunities that data-driven modeling presents, and how they have been already implemented in various real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Decentralized and Centralized IDD Schemes for Cell-Free Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose iterative interference cancellation schemes with access points selection (APs-Sel) for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems. Closed-form expressions for centralized and decentralized linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) receive filters with APs-Sel are derived assuming imperfect channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, we develop a list-based detector based on LMMSE receive filters that exploits interference cancellation and the constellation points. A message-passing-based iterative detection and decoding (IDD) scheme that employs low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is then developed. Moreover, log-likelihood ratio (LLR) refinement strategies based on censoring and a linear combination of local LLRs are proposed to improve the network performance. We compare the cases with centralized and decentralized processing in terms of bit error rate (BER) performance, complexity, and signaling under perfect CSI (PCSI) and imperfect CSI (ICSI) and verify the superiority of the distributed architecture with LLR refinements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The wireless domain is witnessing a flourishing of integrated systems, e.g. (a) integrated sensing and communications, and (b) simultaneous wireless information and power transfer, due to their potential to use resources (spectrum, power) judiciously. Inspired by this trend, we investigate integrated sensing, communications and powering (ISCAP), through the design of a wideband OFDM signal to power a sensor while simultaneously performing target-sensing and communication. To characterize the ISCAP performance region, we assume symbols with non-zero mean asymmetric Gaussian distribution (i.e., the input distribution), and optimize its mean and variance at each subcarrier to maximize the harvested power, subject to constraints on the achievable rate (communications) and the average side-to-peak-lobe difference (sensing). The resulting input distribution, through simulations, achieves a larger performance region than that of (i) a symmetric complex Gaussian input distribution with identical mean and variance for the real and imaginary parts, (ii) a zero-mean symmetric complex Gaussian input distribution, and (iii) the superposed power-splitting communication and sensing signal (the coexisting solution). In particular, the optimized input distribution balances the three functions by exhibiting the following features: (a) symbols in subcarriers with strong communication channels have high variance to satisfy the rate constraint, while the other symbols are dominated by the mean, forming a relatively uniform sum of mean and variance across subcarriers for sensing; (b) with looser communication and sensing constraints, large absolute means appear on subcarriers with stronger powering channels for higher harvested power. As a final note, the results highlight the great potential of the co-designed ISCAP system for further efficiency enhancement.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers a batch solution to the multi-object tracking problem based on sets of trajectories. Specifically, we present two offline implementations of the trajectory Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (TPMBM) filter for batch data based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of the data association hypotheses. In contrast to online TPMBM implementations, the proposed offline implementations solve a large-scale, multi-scan data association problem across the entire time interval of interest, and therefore they can fully exploit all the measurement information available. Furthermore, by leveraging the efficient hypothesis structure of TPMBM filters, the proposed implementations compare favorably with other MCMC-based multi-object tracking algorithms. Simulation results show that the TPMBM implementation using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm presents state-of-the-art multiple trajectory estimation performance.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal RIS for Multi-Band Multi-Cell MIMO Networks: A Practical Frequency-Dependent Model and Performance Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper delves into the unexplored frequency-dependent characteristics of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RISs). A generalized practical frequency-dependent reflection model is proposed as a fundamental framework for configuring fully-connected and group-connected RISs in a multi-band multi-base station (BS) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network. Leveraging this practical model, multi-objective optimization strategies are formulated to maximize the received power at multiple users connected to different BSs, each operating under a distinct carrier frequency. By relying on matrix theory and exploiting the symmetric structure of the reflection matrices inherent to BD-RISs, relaxed tractable versions of the challenging problems are achieved for scenarios with obstructed and unobstructed direct channel links. The relaxed solutions are then combined with codebook-based approaches to configure the practical capacitance values for the BD-RISs. Simulation results reveal the frequency-dependent behaviors of different RIS architectures and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. Notably, BD-RISs exhibit high reflection performance across the intended frequency range, remarkably outperforming conventional single-connected RISs. Moreover, the proposed optimization approaches prove effective in enabling the targeted operation of BD-RISs across one or more carrier frequencies. The results also shed light on the potential for harmful interference in the absence of synchronization between RISs and adjacent BSs.</description>

      <title>Subspace-Informed Matrix Completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the matrix completion problem, where the objective is to reconstruct a low-rank matrix from a few observed entries. A commonly employed approach involves nuclear norm minimization. For this method to succeed, the number of observed entries needs to scale at least proportional to both the rank of the ground-truth matrix and the coherence parameter. While the only prior information is oftentimes the low-rank nature of the ground-truth matrix, in various real-world scenarios, additional knowledge about the ground-truth low-rank matrix is available. For instance, in collaborative filtering, Netflix problem, and dynamic channel estimation in wireless communications, we have partial or full knowledge about the signal subspace in advance. Specifically, we are aware of some subspaces that form multiple angles with the column and row spaces of the ground-truth matrix. Leveraging this valuable information has the potential to significantly reduce the required number of observations. To this end, we introduce a multi-weight nuclear norm optimization problem that concurrently promotes the low-rank property as well the information about the available subspaces. The proposed weights are tailored to penalize each angle corresponding to each basis of the prior subspace independently. We further propose an optimal weight selection strategy by minimizing the coherence parameter of the ground-truth matrix, which is equivalent to minimizing the required number of observations. Simulation results validate the advantages of incorporating multiple weights in the completion procedure. Specifically, our proposed multi-weight optimization problem demonstrates a substantial reduction in the required number of observations compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transmitter Design and Pilot Spacing in MIMO Non-Stationary Aging Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers an uplink wireless communication system where multiple users with multiple antennas transmit data frames over dynamic channels. Previous studies have shown that multiple transmit and receive antennas can substantially enhance the sum-capacity of all users when the channel is known at the transmitter and in the case of uncorrelated transmit and receive antennas. However, spatial correlations stemming from close proximity of transmit antennas and channel variation between pilot and data time slots, known as channel aging, can substantially degrade the transmission rate if they are not properly into account. In this work, we provide an analytical framework to concurrently exploit both of these features. Specifically, we first propose a beamforming framework to capture spatial correlations. Then, based on random matrix theory tools, we introduce a deterministic expression that approximates the average sum-capacity of all users. Subsequently, we obtain the optimal values of pilot spacing and beamforming vectors upon maximizing this expression. Simulation results show the impacts of path loss, velocity of mobile users and Rician factor on the resulting sum-capacity and underscore the efficacy of our methodology compared to prior works.</description>

      <title>Improved Downlink Channel Estimation in Time-Varying FDD Massive MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of accurately obtaining channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) for frequency division duplexing (FDD) multiple input multiple output systems. Although CSIT is vital for maximizing spatial multiplexing gains, traditional CSIT estimation methods often suffer from impracticality due to the substantial training and feedback overhead they require. To address this challenge, we leverage two sources of prior information simultaneously: the presence of limited local scatterers at the base station (BS) and the time-varying characteristics of the channel. The former results in a redundant angular sparsity of users' channels exceeding the spatial dimension (i.e., the number of BS antennas), while the latter provides a prior non-uniform distribution in the angular domain. We propose a weighted optimization framework that simultaneously reflects both of these features. The optimal weights are then obtained by minimizing the expected recovery error of the optimization problem. This establishes an analytical closed-form relationship between the optimal weights and the angular domain characteristics. Numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach in reducing the recovery error and consequently resulting in decreased training and feedback overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an innovative method for determining the fill level of containers, such as trash cans, addressing a critical aspect of waste management. The method combines spatial impulse response analysis with machine learning (ML) techniques, offering a unique and effective approach for sound-based classification that can be extended to various domains beyond waste management. By employing a buzzer-generated sine sweep signal, we create a distinctive signature specific to the fill level of the waste container. This signature, once accurately decoded, is then interpreted by a specially developed ensemble learning algorithm. Our approach achieves a classification accuracy of over 90% when implemented locally on a development board, optimizing operational efficiencies and eliminating the need to delegate complex classification tasks to external entities. Using low-cost and energy-efficient hardware components, our method offers a cost-effective approach that contributes to sustainable and efficient waste management practices, providing a reliable and locally deployable solution.</description>

      <title>Feature Characterization for Profile Surface Texture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional field parameters for surface measurement use all data points, while feature characterization focuses on subsets extracted by watershed segmentation. This approach enables the extraction of specific features that are potentially responsible for the function of the surface or are a direct reflection of the manufacturing process, allowing for a more accurate assessment of both aspects. Feature characterization with the underlying watershed segmentation for areal surface topographies has been standardized for over a decade and is well established in industry and research. In contrast, feature characterization for surface profiles has been standardized recently, and the corresponding standard for watershed segmentation is planned to be published in the near future. Since the standards do not provide guidelines for implementation, this paper presents an unambiguous algorithm of the watershed segmentation and the feature characterization for surface profiles. This framework provides the basis for future work, mainly investigating the relationship between feature parameters based on feature characterization and the function of the surface or manufacturing process. For this purpose, recommendations for the configuration and extensions of the toolbox can also be developed, which could find their way into the ISO standards.</description>

      <title>Real-time Deformation Correction in Additively Printed Flexible Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07797</link>

Abstract: Conformal phased arrays provide multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, which is typically limited by antenna aperture in rigid arrays. Silicon-based RF signal processing offers reliable, reconfigurable, multi-functional, and compact control for conformal phased arrays that can be used for on-the-move communication. While the lightweight, compactness, and shape-changing properties of the conformal phased arrays are attractive, these features result in dynamic deformation of the array during motion leading to significant dynamic beam pointing errors. We propose a silicon-based, compact, reconfigurable solution to self-correct these dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. Furthermore, additive printing is leveraged to enhance the flexibility of the conformal phased arrays, as the printed conductive ink is more flexible than bulk copper and can be easily deposited on flexible sheets using different printing tools, providing an environmentally-friendly solution for large-scale production. The inks such as conventional silver inks are expensive and copper-based printable inks suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. This work uses a low-cost molecular copper decomposition ink with reliable RF properties at different temperature and strain to print the proposed intelligent conformal phased array operating at 2.1 GHz. Proof-of-concept prototype $2\times2$ array self-corrects the deformation induces beampointing error with an error $&lt;1.25^\circ$. The silicon based array processing part occupying only 2.58 mm$^2$ area and 83 mW power per tile.</description>

      <title>Morlet wavelet transform using attenuated sliding Fourier transform and kernel integral for graphic processing unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.11866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Morlet or Gabor wavelet transforms as well as Gaussian smoothing, are widely used in signal processing and image processing. However, the computational complexity of their direct calculations is proportional not only to the number of data points in a signal but also to the smoothing size, which is the standard deviation in the Gaussian function in their transform functions. Thus, when the standard deviation is large, its considerable computation time diminishes the advantages of aforementioned transforms. Therefore, it is important to formulate an algorithm to reduce the calculation time of the transformations. In this paper, we first review calculation methods of Gaussian smoothing by using the sliding Fourier transform (SFT) and our proposed attenuated SFT (ASFT) \cite{YamashitaICPR2020}. Based on these methods, we propose two types of calculation methods for Morlet wavelet transforms. We also propose an algorithm to calculate SFT using the kernel integral on graphic processing unit (GPU). When the number of calculation cores in GPU is not less than the number of data points, the order of its calculation time is the logarithm of the smoothing size and does not depend on the number of data points. Using experiments, we compare the two methods for calculating the Morlet wavelet transform and evaluate the calculation time of the proposed algorithm using a kernel integral on GPU. For example, when the number of data points and the standard deviation are 102400 and 8192.0, respectively, the calculation time of the Morlet wavelet transform by the proposed method is 0.545 ms, which 413.6 times faster than a conventional method. (In this version, mistakes in fitures are corrected.)</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for IRS-and-UAV-Aided Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks in Maritime IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00412v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-and-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted two-way amplify-and-forward (AF) relay network in maritime Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed, where ship1 ($\text{S}_1$) and ship2 ($\text{S}_2$) can be viewed as data collecting centers. To enhance the message exchange rate between $\text{S}_1$ and $\text{S}_2$, a problem of maximizing minimum rate is cast, where the variables, namely AF relay beamforming matrix and IRS phase shifts of two time slots, need to be optimized. To achieve a maximum rate, a low-complexity alternately iterative (AI) scheme based on zero forcing and successive convex approximation (LC-ZF-SCA) algorithm is presented. To obtain a significant rate enhancement, a high-performance AI method based on one step, semidefinite programming and penalty SCA (ONS-SDP-PSCA) is proposed. Simulation results show that by the proposed LC-ZF-SCA and ONS-SDP-PSCA methods, the rate of the IRS-and-UAV-assisted AF relay network surpass those of with random phase and only AF relay networks. Moreover, ONS-SDP-PSCA perform better than LC-ZF-SCA in aspect of rate.</description>

      <title>Motion-robust free-running volumetric cardiovascular MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PURPOSE: To present and assess an outlier mitigation method that makes free-running volumetric cardiovascular MRI (CMR) more robust to motion.
  METHODS: The proposed method, called compressive recovery with outlier rejection (CORe), models outliers in the measured data as an additive auxiliary variable. We enforce MR physics-guided group sparsity on the auxiliary variable, and jointly estimate it along with the image using an iterative algorithm. For evaluation, CORe is first compared to traditional compressed sensing (CS), robust regression (RR), and an existing outlier rejection method using two simulation studies. Then, CORe is compared to CS using seven three-dimensional (3D) cine, 12 rest four-dimensional (4D) flow, and eight stress 4D flow imaging datasets.
  RESULTS: Our simulation studies show that CORe outperforms CS, RR, and the existing outlier rejection method in terms of normalized mean square error and structural similarity index across 55 different realizations. The expert reader evaluation of 3D cine images demonstrates that CORe is more effective in suppressing artifacts while maintaining or improving image sharpness. Finally, 4D flow images show that CORe yields more reliable and consistent flow measurements, especially in the presence of involuntary subject motion or exercise stress.
  CONCLUSION: An outlier rejection method is presented and tested using simulated and measured data. This method can help suppress motion artifacts in a wide range of free-running CMR applications.
