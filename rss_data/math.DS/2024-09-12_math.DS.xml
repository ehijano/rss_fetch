      <title>Localized synchronous patterns in weakly coupled bistable oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by numerical continuation studies of coupled mechanical oscillators, we investigate branches of localized time-periodic solutions of one-dimensional chains of coupled oscillators. We focus on Ginzburg-Landau equations with nonlinearities of lambda-omega type and establish the existence of on-site and off-site solutions in the case of weak coupling and weak-amplitude dependence of the oscillator periods. Utilizing a core-far-field decomposition, we demonstrate that in-phase solutions lie on branches that exhibit snaking behavior.</description>

      <title>Sturmian external angles of primitive components in the Mandelbrot set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the broken line construction, which is a geometric and combinatorial algorithm that computes periodic Sturmian angles of a given period, yielding the locations of their landing parameters in the Mandelbrot set. An easy to implement method to compute the conjugated angle of a periodic Sturmian angle is also provided. Furthermore, if $\theta$ is a periodic Sturmian angle computed by the broken line construction, then we show the existence of a one-to-one correspondence between its binary expansion and its associated kneading sequence.</description>

Abstract: We study multiple recurrence without commutativity in this paper. We show that for any two homeomorphisms $T,S: X\rightarrow X$ with $(X,T)$ and $(X,S)$ being minimal, there is a residual subset $X_0$ of $X$ such that for any $x\in X_0$ and any nonlinear integral polynomials $p_1,\ldots, p_d$ vanishing at $0$, there is some subsequence $\{n_i\}$ of $\mathbb Z$ with $n_i\to \infty$ satisfying $$ S^{n_i}x\to x,\ T^{p_1(n_i)}x\to x, \ldots,\ T^{p_d(n_i)}x\to x,\ i\to\infty.$$</description>

      <title>Dimensions of harmonic measures on non-autonomous Cantor sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Non Autonomous Conformal Iterative Function Systems (NACIFS) and their limit set. Our main concern is harmonic measure and its dimensions : Hausdorff and Packing. We prove that this two dimensions are continuous under perturbations and that they verify Bowen's and Manning's type formulas. In order to do so we prove general results about measures, and more generally about positive functionals, defined on a symbolic space, developing tools from thermodynamical formalism in a non-autonomous setting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the analogue of Khintchine's theorem for all self-similar probability measures on the real line. When specified to the case of the Hausdorff measure on the middle-thirds Cantor set, the result is already new and provides an answer to an old question of Mahler. The proof consists in showing effective equidistribution in law of expanding upper-triangular random walks on $\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{R})/\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$, a result of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Decomposing force fields as flows on graphs reconstructed from stochastic trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disentangling irreversible and reversible forces from random fluctuations is a challenging problem in the analysis of stochastic trajectories measured from real-world dynamical systems. We present an approach to approximate the dynamics of a stationary Langevin process as a discrete-state Markov process evolving over a graph-representation of phase-space, reconstructed from stochastic trajectories. Next, we utilise the analogy of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of an edge-flow on a contractible simplicial complex with the associated decomposition of a stochastic process into its irreversible and reversible parts. This allows us to decompose our reconstructed flow and to differentiate between the irreversible currents and reversible gradient flows underlying the stochastic trajectories. We validate our approach on a range of solvable and nonlinear systems and apply it to derive insight into the dynamics of flickering red-blood cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. In particular, we capture the difference in irreversible circulating currents between healthy and passive cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. Our method breaks new ground at the interface of data-driven approaches to stochastic dynamics and graph signal processing, with the potential for further applications in the analysis of biological experiments and physiological recordings. Finally, it prompts future analysis of the convergence of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition in discrete and continuous spaces.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for predicting rate-induced tipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems exposed to changing forcing can exhibit catastrophic transitions between alternative and often markedly different states. The phenomenon of critical slowing down (CSD) can be used to anticipate such transitions if caused by a bifurcation and if the change in forcing is slow compared to the internal time scale of the system. However, in many real-world situations, these assumptions are not met and transitions can be triggered because the forcing exceeds a critical rate. For example, given the pace of anthropogenic climate change in comparison to the internal time scales of key Earth system components, such as the polar ice sheets or the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, such rate-induced tipping poses a severe risk. Moreover, depending on the realisation of random perturbations, some trajectories may transition across an unstable boundary, while others do not, even under the same forcing. CSD-based indicators generally cannot distinguish these cases of noise-induced tipping versus no tipping. This severely limits our ability to assess the risks of tipping, and to predict individual trajectories. To address this, we make a first attempt to develop a deep learning framework to predict transition probabilities of dynamical systems ahead of rate-induced transitions. Our method issues early warnings, as demonstrated on three prototypical systems for rate-induced tipping, subjected to time-varying equilibrium drift and noise perturbations. Exploiting explainable artificial intelligence methods, our framework captures the fingerprints necessary for early detection of rate-induced tipping, even in cases of long lead times. Our findings demonstrate the predictability of rate-induced and noise-induced tipping, advancing our ability to determine safe operating spaces for a broader class of dynamical systems than possible so far.</description>

      <title>Disturbance-Robust Backup Control Barrier Functions: Safety Under Uncertain Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining a controlled invariant set is crucial for safety-critical control with control barrier functions (CBFs) but is non-trivial for complex nonlinear systems and constraints. Backup control barrier functions allow such sets to be constructed online in a computationally tractable manner by examining the evolution (or flow) of the system under a known backup control law. However, for systems with unmodeled disturbances, this flow cannot be directly computed, making the current methods inadequate for assuring safety in these scenarios. To address this gap, we leverage bounds on the nominal and disturbed flow to compute a forward invariant set online by ensuring safety of an expanding norm ball tube centered around the nominal system evolution. We prove that this set results in robust control constraints which guarantee safety of the disturbed system via our Disturbance-Robust Backup Control Barrier Function (DR-BCBF) solution. Additionally, the efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated in simulation, applied to a double integrator problem and a rigid body spacecraft rotation problem with rate constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the following result: If $X_0$ is an affine surface over a field $K$ and $f, g$ are two loxodromic automorphisms with an orbit meeting infinitely many times, then $f$ and $g$ must share a common iterate. The proof uses the preliminary work of the author in [Abb23] on the dynamics of endomorphisms of affine surfaces and arguments from arithmetic dynamics. We then show a dynamical Mordell-Lang type result for surfaces in $X_0 \times X_0$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a class of examples which provide an affine generalization of the nonholonomic problem of a convex body rolling without slipping on the plane. We investigate dynamical aspects of the system such as existence of first integrals, smooth invariant measure and integrability, giving special attention to the cases in which the convex body is a dynamically balanced sphere or a body of revolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.13882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find sufficient conditions for the singularity of a substitution $\mathbb{Z}$-action's spectrum, which generalize the conditions given in arXiv:2003.11287, Theorem 2.4, and we also obtain a similar statement for a collection of substitution $\mathbb{R}$-actions, including the self-similar one. To achieve this, we first study the distribution of related toral endomorphism orbits. In particular, given a toral endomorphism and a vector $\mathbf{v}\in\mathbb{Q}^d$, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the orbit of $\omega\mathbf{v}$ to be uniformly distributed modulo $1$ for almost every $\omega\in\mathbb{R}$. We use our results to find new examples of singular substitution $\mathbb{Z}$- and $\mathbb{R}$-actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of hypocoercivity for linear evolution equations with dissipation is discussed and equivalent characterizations that were developed for the finite-dimensional case are extended to separable Hilbert spaces. Using the concept of a hypocoercivity index, quantitative estimates on the short-time and long-time decay behavior of a hypocoercive system are derived. As a useful tool for analyzing the structural properties, an infinite-dimensional staircase form is also derived and connections to linear systems and control theory are presented. Several examples illustrate the new concepts and the results are applied to the Lorentz kinetic equation.</description>

Abstract: An extension of Szemer\'edi's Theorem is proved for sets of positive density in approximate lattices in general locally compact and second countable abelian groups. As a consequence, we establish a recent conjecture of Klick, Strungaru and Tcaciuc. Via a novel version of Furstenberg's Correspondence principle, which should be of independent interest, we show that our Szemer\'edi Theorems can be deduced from a general \emph{transverse} multiple recurrence theorem, which we establish using recent works of Austin.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic properties of families of plane polynomial automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an algebraic family $f\colon\Lambda\times \mathbb{A}^2 \to \Lambda\times \mathbb{A}^2$ of plane polynomial automorphisms of H\'enon type parameterized by a quasi-projective curve, defined over a number field $\mathbb{K},$ we investigate certain arithmetic properties of periodic points contained in a family of subvarieties $X \subset \Lambda \times \mathbb{A}^2 \twoheadrightarrow \Lambda$.
  First, consider $X$ as a curve. We prove that the set of parameters $t\in\Lambda(\overline{\mathbb{Q}})$, such that $X_t$ is periodic, has bounded height. This generalizes a result of Patrick Ingram. Moreover, if $X$ is non-periodic, then under some mild conditions -- such as when the family is dissipative -- we show that there are, in fact, only finitely many periodic parameters. This extends a result of Charles Favre and Romain Dujardin.
  Second, let $X$ be a family of curves. Assuming $X$ is non-degenerate, we establish a uniform bound on the number of periodic points in each curve $X_t$, $t\in \Lambda(\overline{\mathbb{Q}})$ and show that the set of these periodic points have bounded height in $\Lambda\times \mathbb{A}^2$ as well. We then examine in more detail the non-degeneracy property in the case of dissipative families of quadratic H\'enon maps.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary mechanisms that promote cooperation may not promote social welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of prosocial behaviours among self-interested individuals is an important problem in many scientific disciplines. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the evolution of such behaviours, primarily seeking the conditions under which a given mechanism can induce highest levels of cooperation. As these mechanisms usually involve costs that alter individual payoffs, it is however possible that aiming for highest levels of cooperation might be detrimental for social welfare -- the later broadly defined as the total population payoff, taking into account all costs involved for inducing increased prosocial behaviours. Herein, by comparatively analysing the social welfare and cooperation levels obtained from stochastic evolutionary models of two well-established mechanisms of prosocial behaviour, namely, peer and institutional incentives, we demonstrate exactly that. We show that the objectives of maximising cooperation levels and the objectives of maximising social welfare are often misaligned. We argue for the need of adopting social welfare as the main optimisation objective when designing and implementing evolutionary mechanisms for social and collective goods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish Lasota-Yorke inequality for the Frobenius-Perron Operator of a piecewise expanding $C^{1+\varepsilon}$ map of an interval. By adapting this inequality to satisfy the assumptions of the Ionescu-Tulcea and Marinescu ergodic theorem \cite{ionescu1950}, we demonstrate the existence of an absolutely continuous invariant measure (ACIM) for the map. Furthermore, we prove the quasi-compactness of the Frobenius-Perron operator induced by the map. Additionally, we explore significant properties of the system, including weak mixing and exponential decay of correlations.</description>

      <title>The definable content of homological invariants I: $\mathrm{Ext}$ &amp; $\mathrm{lim}^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.08782v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first installment in a series of papers in which we illustrate how classical invariants of homological algebra and algebraic topology can be enriched with additional descriptive set-theoretic information. To effect this enrichment, we show that many of these invariants can be naturally regarded as functors to the category, introduced herein, of groups with a Polish cover. The resulting definable invariants provide far stronger means of classification.
  In the present work we focus on the first derived functors of $\mathrm{Hom}(-,-)$ and $\mathrm{lim}(-)$. The resulting definable $\mathrm{Ext}(B,F)$ for pairs of countable abelian groups $B,F$ and definable $\mathrm{lim}^{1}(\boldsymbol{A})$ for towers $\boldsymbol{A}$ of Polish abelian groups substantially refine their classical counterparts. We show, for example, that the definable $\textrm{Ext}(-,\mathbb{Z})$ is a fully faithful contravariant functor from the category of finite rank torsion-free abelian groups $\Lambda$ with no free summands; this contrasts with the fact that there are uncountably many non-isomorphic such groups $\Lambda$ with isomorphic classical invariants $\textrm{Ext}(\Lambda,\mathbb{Z}) $. To facilitate our analysis, we introduce a general Ulam stability framework for groups with a Polish cover and we prove several rigidity results for non-Archimedean abelian groups with a Polish cover. A special case of our main result answers a question of Kanovei and Reeken regarding quotients of the $p$-adic groups. Finally, using cocycle superrigidity methods for profinite actions of property (T) groups, we obtain a hierarchy of complexity degrees for the problem $\mathcal{R}(\mathrm{Aut}(\Lambda)\curvearrowright\mathrm{Ext}(\Lambda,\mathbb{Z}))$ of classifying all group extensions of $\Lambda$ by $\mathbb{Z}$ up to base-free isomorphism, when $\Lambda =\mathbb{Z}[1/p]^{d}$ for prime numbers $p$ and $ d\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Dumont-Thomas complement numeration systems for $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14481v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the well-known Dumont--Thomas numeration systems to $\mathbb{Z}$ using an approach inspired by the two's complement numeration system. Integers in $\mathbb{Z}$ are canonically represented by a finite word (starting with $\mathtt{0}$ when nonnegative and with $\mathtt{1}$ when negative). The systems are based on two-sided periodic points of substitutions as opposed to the right-sided fixed points. For every periodic point of a substitution, we construct an automaton which returns the letter at position $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ of the periodic point when fed with the representation of $n$ in the corresponding numeration system. The numeration system naturally extends to $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We give an equivalent characterization of the numeration system in terms of a total order on a regular language. Lastly, using particular periodic points, we recover the well-known two's complement numeration system and the Fibonacci analogue of the two's complement numeration system.</description>

      <title>The structure of quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor with applications to the domino problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01823v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An infinite graph is quasi-transitive if its vertex set has finitely many orbits under the action of its automorphism group. In this paper we obtain a structure theorem for locally finite quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor, which is reminiscent of the Robertson-Seymour Graph Minor Structure Theorem. We prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph $G$ avoiding a minor has a tree-decomposition whose torsos are finite or planar; moreover the tree-decomposition is canonical, i.e. invariant under the action of the automorphism group of $G$. As applications of this result, we prove the following.
  * Every locally finite quasi-transitive graph attains its Hadwiger number, that is, if such a graph contains arbitrarily large clique minors, then it contains an infinite clique minor. This extends a result of Thomassen (1992) who proved it in the 4-connected case and suggested that this assumption could be omitted.
  * Locally finite quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor are accessible (in the sense of Thomassen and Woess), which extends known results on planar graphs to any proper minor-closed family.
  * Minor-excluded finitely generated groups are accessible (in the group-theoretic sense) and finitely presented, which extends classical results on planar groups.
  * The domino problem is decidable in a minor-excluded finitely generated group if and only if the group is virtually free, which proves the minor-excluded case of a conjecture of Ballier and Stein (2018).</description>

      <title>Finiteness of totally geodesic hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a closed negatively curved analytic Riemannian manifold that contains infinitely many totally geodesic hypersurfaces is isometric to an arithmetic hyperbolic manifold. Equivalently, any closed analytic Riemannian manifold with negative sectional curvature has only finitely many totally geodesic hypersurfaces, unless it has constant curvature.</description>
