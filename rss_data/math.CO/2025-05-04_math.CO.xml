      <title>The design spectrum of the Shrikhande graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design spectrum of a simple graph $G$ is the set of positive integers $n$ such that there exists an edgewise decomposition of the complete graph $K_n$ into $n(n - 1)/(2 |E(G)|)$ copies of $G$. The purpose of this short paper is to prove that the Shrikhande graph and the line graph of $K_{4,4}$ have the design spectrum $\{96t + 1: t = 1, 2, \dots\}$.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of polytopes with edge length and coplanarity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a novel setting for polytope rigidity, where a flex must preserve edge lengths and the planarity of faces, but is allowed to change the shapes of faces. For instance, the regular cube is flexible in this notion. We present techniques for constructing flexible polytopes and find that flexibility seems to be an exceptional property. Based on this observation, we introduce a notion of generic realizations for polytopes and conjecture that convex polytopes are generically rigid in dimension $d\geq 3$. We prove this conjecture in dimension $d=3$. Motivated by our findings we also pose several questions that are intended to inspire future research into this notion of polytope rigidity.</description>

      <title>Ramsey with purple edges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a question of Angell, we introduce a variant of Ramsey numbers where some edges are coloured simultaneously red and blue, which we call purple. Specifically, we are interested in the largest number $g=g(n;s,t)$, for some $s$ and $t$ and $n&lt;R(s,t)$, such that there exists a red/blue/purple colouring of $K_n$ with $g$ purple edges, with no red/purple copy of $K_s$ nor blue/purple copy of $K_t$. We determine $g$ asymptotically for a large family of parameters, exhibiting strong dependencies with Ramsey-Tur\'{a}n numbers.</description>

      <title>New optima for the deletion shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a family $\mathcal{F}$ of words of length $n$ drawn from an alphabet $A=[r]=\{1,\dots,r\}$, Danh and Daykin defined the deletion shadow $\Delta \mathcal{F}$ as the family containing all words that can be made by deleting one letter of a word of $\mathcal{F}$. They asked, given the size of such a family, how small its deletion shadow can be, and answered this with a Kruskal-Katona type result when the alphabet has size $2$. However, Leck showed that no ordering can give such a result for larger alphabets. The minimal shadow has been known for families of size $s^n$, where the optimal family has form $[s]^n$. We give the minimal shadow for many intermediate sizes between these levels, showing that families of the form 'all words in $[s]^n$ in which the symbol $s$ appears at most $k$ times' are optimal. Our proof uses some fractional techniques that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Towards a format for describing networks / 1. Networks and knowledge graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between the concepts of network and knowledge graph is explored. A knowledge graph can be considered a special type of network. When using a knowledge graph, various networks can be obtained from it, and network analysis procedures can be applied to them. RDF is a formalization of the knowledge graph concept for the Semantic Web, but some of its solutions are also extensible to a format for describing general networks.</description>

      <title>Cluster deletion and clique partitioning in graphs with bounded clique number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cluster Deletion problem takes a graph $G$ as input and asks for a minimum size set of edges $X$ such that $G-X$ is the disjoint union of complete graphs. An equivalent formulation is the Clique Partition problem, which asks to find a partition of $V(G)$ into cliques such that the total number of edges is maximized.
  We begin by giving a much simpler proof of a theorem of Gao, Hare, and Nastos that Cluster Deletion is efficiently solvable on the class of cographs. We then investigate Cluster Deletion and Clique Partition on permutation graphs, which are a superclass of cographs. Our findings suggest that Cluster Deletion may be NP-hard on permutation graphs.
  Finally, we prove that for graphs with clique number at most $c$, there is a $\frac{2\binom{c}{2}}{\binom{c}{2}+1}$-approximation algorithm for Clique Partition. This is the first polynomial time algorithm which achieves an approximation ratio better than 2 for graphs with bounded clique number. More generally, our algorithm runs in polynomial time on any graph class for which Maximum Clique can be computed in polynomial time. We also provide a class of examples which shows that our approximation ratio is best possible.</description>

      <title>The tape reconfiguration problem and its consequences for dominating set reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dominating set of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a set of vertices $D \subseteq V$ whose closed neighborhood is $V$, i.e., $N[D]=V$. We view a dominating set as a collection of tokens placed on the vertices of $D$. In the token sliding variant of the Dominating Set Reconfiguration problem (TS-DSR), we seek to transform a source dominating set into a target dominating set in $G$ by sliding tokens along edges, and while maintaining a dominating set all along the transformation.
  TS-DSR is known to be PSPACE-complete even restricted to graphs of pathwidth $w$, for some non-explicit constant $w$ and to be XL-complete parameterized by the size $k$ of the solution. The first contribution of this article consists in using a novel approach to provide the first explicit constant for which the TS-DSR problem is PSPACE-complete, a question that was left open in the literature.
  From a parameterized complexity perspective, the token jumping variant of DSR, i.e., where tokens can jump to arbitrary vertices, is known to be FPT when parameterized by the size of the dominating sets on nowhere dense classes of graphs. But, in contrast, no non-trivial result was known about TS-DSR. We prove that DSR is actually much harder in the sliding model since it is XL-complete when restricted to bounded pathwidth graphs and even when parameterized by $k$ plus the feedback vertex set number of the graph. This gives, for the first time, a difference of behavior between the complexity under token sliding and token jumping for some problem on graphs of bounded treewidth. All our results are obtained using a brand new method, based on the hardness of the so-called Tape Reconfiguration problem, a problem we believe to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Characteristic polynomial of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}$ and log-concavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Stanley's generalization of the chromatic polynomial of a graph to the chromatic symmetric function, we introduce the characteristic polynomial of a representation of the symmetric group, or more generally, of a symmetric function. When the representation arises from geometry, the coefficients of its characteristic polynomial tend to form a log-concave sequence. To illustrate, we investigate explicit examples, including the $n$-fold products of the projective spaces, the GIT moduli spaces of points on $\mathbb{P}^1$ and Hessenberg varieties. Our main focus lies on the cohomology of the moduli space of pointed rational curves, for which we prove asymptotic formulas of its characteristic polynomial and establish asymptotic log-concavity.</description>

      <title>Going deep and going wide: Counting logic and homomorphism indistinguishability over graphs of bounded treedepth and treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the expressive power of first-order logic with counting quantifiers, especially the k-variable and quantifier-rank-q fragment C^k_q, using homomorphism indistinguishability. Recently, Dawar, Jakl, and Reggio~(2021) proved that two graphs satisfy the same C^k_q-sentences if and only if they are homomorphism indistinguishable over the class T^k_q of graphs admitting a k-pebble forest cover of depth q. After reproving this result using elementary means, we provide a graph-theoretic analysis of the graph class T^k_q. This allows us to separate T^k_q from the intersection TW_{k-1} \cap TD_q, provided that q is sufficiently larger than k. Here TW_{k-1} is the class of all graphs of treewidth at most k-1 and TD_q is the class of all graphs of treedepth at most q.
  We are able to lift this separation to a (semantic) separation of the respective homomorphism indistinguishability relations \equiv_{T^k_q} and \equiv_{TW_{k-1} \cap TD_q}. We do this by showing that the classes TD_q and T^k_q are homomorphism distinguishing closed, as conjectured by Roberson~(2022).
  In order to prove Roberson's conjecture for T^k_q we characterise T^k_q in terms of a monotone Cops-and-Robber game. The crux is to prove that if Cop has a winning strategy then Cop also has a winning strategy that is monotone. To that end, we show how to transform Cops' winning strategy into a pree-tree-decomposition, which is inspired by decompositions of matroids, and then applying an intricate breadth-first `cleaning up' procedure along the pree-tree-decomposition (which may temporarily lose the property of representing a strategy), in order to achieve monotonicity while controlling the number of rounds simultaneously across all branches of the decomposition via a vertex exchange argument.</description>

      <title>Ind-cluster algebras and infinite Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A prototypical examples of a cluster algebra is the coordinate ring of a finite Grassmannian: using the Pl\"ucker embedding the cluster algebra structure allows one to move between `maximal sets' of algebraically independent Pl\"ucker coordinates via mutations. Fioresi and Hacon studied a specific colimit of the coordinate rings of finite Grassmannians and its link with the infinite Grassmannian introduced by Sato and independently by Segal and Wilson in connection with the Kadomtsev-Petiashvili (KP) hierarchy, an infinite set of nonlinear partial differential equations which possess soliton solutions. In this article we prove that this ring is a cluster algebra of infinite rank with the structure induced by the colimit construction. More generally, we prove that cluster algebras of infinite rank are precisely the ind-objects of a natural category of cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral realisations of finite arc complexes using strip deformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study infinitesimal deformations of complete hyperbolic surfaces with boundary and with ideal vertices, possibly decorated with horoballs. ``Admissible'' deformations are the ones that pull all horoballs apart; they form a convex cone of deformations. We describe this cone in terms of the arc complex of the surface: specifically, this paper focuses on the surfaces for which that complex is finite. Those surfaces form four families: (ideal) polygons, once-punctured polygons, one-holed polygons (or ``crowns''), and M\"obius strips with spikes. In each case, we describe a natural simplicial decomposition of the projectivised admissible cone and of each of its faces, realizing them as appropriate arc complexes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove multiplicative congruences mod $2^{12}$ for George Andrews's partition function, $\overline{\mathcal{EO}}(n)$, the number of partitions of $n$ in which every even part is less than each odd part and only the largest even part occurs an odd number of times. We find analogous congruences for more general infinite products. These congruences are obtained using Fricke involutions and Newman's approach to half integer weight Hecke operators on eta quotients, and were inspired by Atkin's multiplicative congruences for the partition function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider binary classification restricted to a class of continuous piecewise linear functions whose decision boundaries are (possibly nonconvex) starshaped polyhedral sets, supported on a fixed polyhedral simplicial fan. We investigate the expressivity of these function classes and describe the combinatorial and geometric structure of the loss landscape, most prominently the sublevel sets, for two loss-functions: the 0/1-loss (discrete loss) and an exponential loss function. In particular, we give explicit bounds on the VC dimension of this model, and concretely describe the sublevel sets of the discrete loss as chambers in a hyperplane arrangement. For the exponential loss, we give sufficient conditions for the optimum to be unique, and describe the geometry of the optimum when varying the rate parameter of the underlying exponential probability distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Grasstope is the image of the totally nonnegative Grassmannian $\text{Gr}_{\geq 0}(k,n)$ under a linear map $\text{Gr}(k,n)\dashrightarrow \text{Gr}(k,k+m)$. This is a generalization of the amplituhedron, a geometric object of great importance to calculating scattering amplitudes in physics. The amplituhedron is a Grasstope arising from a totally positive linear map. While amplituhedra are relatively well-studied, much less is known about general Grasstopes. We study Grasstopes in the $m=1$ case and show that they can be characterized as unions of cells of a hyperplane arrangement satisfying a certain sign variation condition, extending work of Karp and Williams. Inspired by this characterization, we also suggest a notion of a Grasstope arising from an arbitrary oriented matroid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14523v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma_k(V)$ be the Grassmann graph whose vertex set ${\mathcal G}_{k}(V)$ is formed by all $k$-dimensional subspaces of an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$ over the finite field $F_q$ consisting of $q$ elements. We discuss its subgraph $\Gamma(n,k)_q$ with the vertex set ${\mathcal C}(n,k)_q$ consisting of all non-degenerate linear $[n, k]_q$ codes. %We assume that $1&lt;k&lt;n-1$. We study maximal cliques $\langle U]^{c}_{k}$ of $\Gamma(n,k)_q$, which are intersections of tops of $\Gamma_k(V)$ with ${\mathcal C}(n,k)_q$. We show when they are contained in a line of ${\mathcal G}_{k}(V)$ and then we prove that $\langle U]^{c}_{k}$ is a maximal clique of $\Gamma(n,k)_q$ when it is not contained in a line of ${\mathcal G}_{k}(V)$. Furthermore, we show that the automorphism group of the set of such maximal cliques is isomorphic with the automorphism group of $\Gamma(n,k+1)_{q}$.</description>

Abstract: The spread of a graph $G$ is the difference $\lambda_1 - \lambda_n$ between the largest and smallest eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix. Breen, Riasanovsky, Tait and Urschel recently determined the graph on $n$ vertices with maximum spread for sufficiently large $n$. In this paper, we study a related question of maximizing the difference $\lambda_{i+1} - \lambda_{n-j}$ for a given pair $(i, j)$ over all graphs on $n$ vertices. We give upper bounds for all pairs $(i, j)$, exhibit an infinite family of pairs where the bound is tight, and show that for the pair $(1, 0)$ the extremal example is unique. These results contribute to a line of inquiry pioneered by Nikiforov aiming to maximize different linear combinations of eigenvalues over all graphs on $n$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Utilizing the Reflective Symmetry of the Mother Graph in Finding New Permutiple Classes from Old</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A permutiple is a natural number whose representation in some base is an integer multiple of a number whose representation has the same collection of digits. Previous efforts have made progress on finding such numbers using graph-theoretical and finite-state-machine constructions. These are the mother graph and the Hoey-Sloane machine (and its state graph). In this paper, we use the reflective symmetry of the mother graph as a starting point for understanding relationships between permutiple classes and how new classes can be determined from old. Such results are not only useful for finding new permutiples from old, they help us to see previous work through a new lens.</description>

      <title>Linear Recurrence Sequence Automata and the Addition of Abstract Numeration Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abstract numeration systems encode natural numbers using radix ordered words of an infinite regular language and linear recurrence sequences play a key role in their valuation. Sequence automata, which are deterministic finite automata with an additional linear recurrence sequence on each transition, are introduced to compute various $\mathbb{Z}$-rational non commutative formal series in abstract numeration systems. Under certain Pisot conditions on the recurrence sequences, the support of these series is regular. This property can be leveraged to derive various synchronized relations including a deterministic finite automaton that computes the addition relation of various Dumont-Thomas numeration systems and deterministic finite automata converting between various numeration systems. A practical implementation for Walnut is provided.</description>

      <title>Parameterised Holant Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the complexity of parameterised holant problems p-$\mathrm{Holant}(\mathcal{S})$ for families of signatures $\mathcal{S}$. The parameterised holant framework was introduced by Curticapean in 2015 as a counter-part to the classical theory of holographic reductions and algorithms and it constitutes an extensive family of coloured and weighted counting constraint satisfaction problems on graph-like structures, encoding as special cases various well-studied counting problems in parameterised and fine-grained complexity theory such as counting edge-colourful $k$-matchings, graph-factors, Eulerian orientations or, subgraphs with weighted degree constraints. We establish an exhaustive complexity trichotomy along the set of signatures $\mathcal{S}$: Depending on $\mathcal{S}$, p-$\mathrm{Holant}(\mathcal{S})$ is: (1) solvable in FPT-near-linear time (i.e. $f(k)\cdot \tilde{\mathcal{O}}(|x|)$); (2) solvable in "FPT-matrix-multiplication time" (i.e. $f(k)\cdot {\mathcal{O}}(n^{\omega})$) but not solvable in FPT-near-linear time unless the Triangle Conjecture fails; or (3) #W[1]-complete and no significant improvement over brute force is possible unless ETH fails. This classification reveals a significant and surprising gap in the complexity landscape of parameterised Holants: Not only is every instance either fixed-parameter tractable or #W[1]-complete, but additionally, every FPT instance is solvable in time $f(k)\cdot {\mathcal{O}}(n^{\omega})$.
  We also establish a complete classification for a natural uncoloured version of parameterised holant problem p-$\mathrm{UnColHolant}(\mathcal{S})$, which encodes as special cases the non-coloured analogues of the aforementioned examples. We show that the complexity of p-$\mathrm{UnColHolant}(\mathcal{S})$ is different: Depending on $\mathcal{S}$ all instances are either solvable in FPT-near-linear time, or #W[1]-complete.</description>

      <title>Odd Verma's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By applying the exchange property of odd reflections, we describe compositions of homomorphisms between Verma modules associated with different Borel subalgebras that share the same character. As an application, we realize the module category of certain finite-dimensional algebras containing Verma modules, such as the preprojective algebra of type \( A_2 \), as extension-closed abelian subcategories of category \( \mathcal{O} \). This allows us to establish lower bounds on the length of socle of Verma modules in terms of combinatorial invariants of graphs, such as finite Young lattices.
  In addition, we investigate variants of Verma modules obtained by changing Borel subalgebras. These variants enable us to realize the principal block of \( \mathfrak{gl}(1|1) \) as an extension-closed abelian subcategory of category \( \mathcal{O} \).
  We further apply the exchange property of odd reflections to refine existing results on the associated varieties and projective dimensions of Verma modules.
  As explained in our companion manuscript, many of our results extend to the setting of regular symmetrizable Kac Moody Lie superalgebras and Nichols algebras of diagonal type, in view of the Weyl groupoids framework in the sence of Heckenberger and Yamane.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corner VOA and the Super Macdonald Polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a relation between the quantum corner VOA $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, which can be regarded as a generalization of quantum $W_N$ algebra, and Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials. We demonstrate precisely that, under a specific map, the correlation functions of the currents of $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, coincide with the Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials.</description>

Abstract: Paul Erdos posed the following question: Is there a prime number $p&gt;5$ such that the residues of $2!$, $3!$,\ldots, $(p-1)!$ modulo $p$ all are distinct? In this short note, we prove that there are no such prime numbers.</description>
