      <title>Cognition Engines: A Row-Scale HVDC Architecture for Computational Continuity of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI training creates synchronized, step-dominant surges with millisecond edges that destabilize constant-power loads (Choukse et al., 2025; arXiv:2508.14318). We propose a physics-anchored row-scale $\pm 400$ Vdc architecture that makes Computational Continuity a structural property. DRUs supply fast energy via controlled droop; SSTs regulate average power with bounded ramps and no reverse power flow and no high-frequency export at the PCC; import is subjected to a bounded dP/dt envelope; film capacitance and clamps absorb the first edge. The contract is explicit: $\pm 1\%$ steady-band, $\leq 2\%$ transient deviation, $\leq 3$ ms recovery, $\geq 45^{\circ}$ margin, reserve floors intact, yields spine and lowest branches. Recharge is valley-following (admitted only below Avg with MW headroom; $\leq 5$ kW/s per row ramps). Protection is time-graded (branch $\mu$s, row ms, MW seconds). Scaling preserves invariants from row to pod/hall/campus without retuning. Conformance is by waveform evidence (microsecond branch clears, $2\%/50$ ms holds, FLISR with no reverse power flow and no high-frequency export at the PCC). The result is not tuning but a contract for continuity.</description>

      <title>Conductance-dependent Photoresponse in a Dynamic SrTiO3 Memristor for Biorealistic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern computers perform pre-defined operations using static memory components, whereas biological systems learn through inherently dynamic, time-dependent processes in synapses and neurons. The biological learning process also relies on global signals - neuromodulators - who influence many synapses at once depending on their dynamic, internal state. In this study, using optical radiation as a global neuromodulatory signal, we investigate nanoscale SrTiO3 (STO) memristors that can act as solid-state synapses. Via diverse sets of measurements, we demonstrate that the memristor's photoresponse depends on the electrical conductance state, following a well-defined square root relation. Additionally, we show that the conductance decays after photoexcitation with time constants in the range of 1 - 10 s and that this effect can be reliably controlled using an electrical bias. These properties in combination with our device's low power operation (&lt; 1pJ per optical pulse) and small measurement variability may pave the way for space- and energy-efficient implementations of complex biological learning processes in electro-optical hardware.</description>

      <title>Length-Matching Routing for Programmable Photonic Circuits Using Best-First Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of programmable photonic integrated circuits (PICs), precise wire length control is crucial for the performance of on-chip programmable components such as optical ring resonators, Mach-Zehnder interferometers, and optical true time-delay lines. Unlike conventional routing algorithms that prioritize shortest-path solutions, these photonic components require exact-length routing to maintain the desired optical properties.
  To address these challenges, this paper presents different length-matching routing strategies to find exact-length paths while balancing search space and runtime efficiently. We propose a novel admissible heuristic estimator and a pruning method, designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the search process. The algorithms are derived from the Best-First search with modified evaluation functions. For two-pin length-matching routing, we formally prove that the proposed algorithms are complete under monotonic heuristics. For multi-pin length-matching challenges, we introduce a pin-ordering mechanism based on detour margins to reduce the likelihood of prematurely blocking feasible routes. Through evaluations on various length-matching benchmarks, we analyze runtime and heuristic performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approaches across different layout scenarios.</description>

      <title>Embedded Deep Learning for Bio-hybrid Plant Sensors to Detect Increased Heat and Ozone Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a bio-hybrid environmental sensor system that integrates natural plants and embedded deep learning for real-time, on-device detection of temperature and ozone level changes. Our system, based on the low-power PhytoNode platform, records electric differential potential signals from Hedera helix and processes them onboard using an embedded deep learning model. We demonstrate that our sensing device detects changes in temperature and ozone with good sensitivity of up to 0.98. Daily and inter-plant variability, as well as limited precision, could be mitigated by incorporating additional training data, which is readily integrable in our data-driven framework. Our approach also has potential to scale to new environmental factors and plant species. By integrating embedded deep learning onboard our biological sensing device, we offer a new, low-power solution for continuous environmental monitoring and potentially other fields of application.</description>

      <title>Information Transmission in Quorum Sensing for Gut Microbiome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microorganisms employ sophisticated mechanisms for intercellular communication and environmental sensing, with quorum sensing serving as a fundamental regulatory process. Dysregulation of quorum sensing has been implicated in various diseases. While most theoretical studies focus on mathematical modeling of quorum sensing dynamics, the communication-theoretic aspects remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the information processing capabilities of quorum sensing systems using a stochastic differential equation framework that links intracellular gene regulation to extracellular autoinducer dynamics. We quantify mutual information as a measure of signaling efficiency and information fidelity in two major bacterial phyla of the gut microbiota: Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes.</description>

      <title>Photonics-Aware Planning-Guided Automated Electrical Routing for Large-Scale Active Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rising demand for AI training and inference, as well as scientific computing, combined with stringent latency and energy budgets, is driving the adoption of integrated photonics for computing, sensing, and communications. As active photonic integrated circuits (PICs) scale in device count and functional heterogeneity, physical implementation by manual scripting and ad-hoc edits is no longer tenable. This creates an immediate need for an electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) stack in which physical design automation is a core capability. However, there is currently no end-to-end fully automated routing flow that coordinates photonic waveguides and on-chip metal interconnect. Critically, available digital VLSI and analog/custom routers are not directly applicable to PIC metal routing due to a lack of customization to handle constraints induced by photonic devices and waveguides. We present, to our knowledge, the first end-to-end routing framework for large-scale active PICs that jointly addresses waveguides and metal wires within a unified flow. We introduce a physically-aware global planner that generates congestion- and crossing-aware routing guides while explicitly accounting for the placement of photonic components and waveguides. We further propose a sequence-consistent track assignment and a soft guidance-assisted detailed routing to speed up the routing process with significantly optimized routability and via usage. Evaluated on various large PIC designs, our router delivers fast, high-quality active PIC routing solutions with fewer vias, lower congestion, and competitive runtime relative to manual and existing VLSI router baselines; on average it reduce via count by ~99%, user-specified design rule violation by ~98%, and runtime by 17x, establishing a practical foundation for EPDA at system scale.</description>

      <title>A Computational Perspective on NeuroAI and Synthetic Biological Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NeuroAI is an emerging field at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, where insights from brain function guide the design of intelligent systems. A central area within this field is synthetic biological intelligence (SBI), which combines the adaptive learning properties of biological neural networks with engineered hardware and software. SBI systems provide a platform for modeling neural computation, developing biohybrid architectures, and enabling new forms of embodied intelligence. In this review, we organize the NeuroAI landscape into three interacting domains: hardware, software, and wetware. We outline computational frameworks that integrate biological and non-biological systems and highlight recent advances in organoid intelligence, neuromorphic computing, and neuro-symbolic learning. These developments collectively point toward a new class of systems that compute through interactions between living neural tissue and digital algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm: Performance on Simulators and Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Running quantum circuits on quantum computers does not always generate "clean" results, unlike on a simulator, as noise plays a significant role in any quantum device. To explore this, we experimented with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on quantum simulators and real quantum hardware. QAOA is a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm and requires hundreds or thousands of independent executions of the quantum circuit for optimization, which typically goes beyond the publicly available resources for quantum computing. We were granted access to the IBM Quantum System One at the Cleveland Clinic, the first on-premises IBM system in the U.S. This paper explores different optimization methods, techniques, error mitigation methods, and QAOA variants to observe how they react to quantum noise differently, which is helpful for other researchers to understand the complexities of running QAOA on real quantum hardware and the challenges faced in dealing with noise.</description>

      <title>Orchestrating multi-level magic state distillation: a dynamic pipeline architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Practical quantum computation requires high-fidelity instruction executions on qubits. Among them, Clifford instructions are relatively easy to perform, while non-Clifford instructions require the use of magic states. This makes magic state distillation a central procedure in fault-tolerant quantum computing. A magic state distillation factory consumes many low-fidelity input magic states and produces fewer, higher-fidelity states. To reach high fidelities, multiple distillation factories are typically chained together into a multi-level pipeline, consuming significant quantum computational resources. Our work optimizes the resource usage of distillation pipelines by introducing a novel dynamic pipeline architecture. Observing that distillation pipelines consume magic states in a burst-then-steady pattern, we develop dynamic factory scheduling and resource allocation techniques that go beyond existing static pipeline organizations. Dynamic pipelines reduce the qubit cost by 16%-70% for large-scale quantum applications and achieve average reductions of 26%-37% in qubit-time volume on generated distillation benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art static architectures. By significantly reducing the resource overhead of this building block, our work accelerates progress towards the practical realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Text-to-SQL: Benchmarking the Limits of Language Models with Collaborative Language Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables natural access to databases, yet most benchmarks are English-only, limiting multilingual progress. We introduce MultiSpider 2.0, extending Spider 2.0 to eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese). It preserves Spider 2.0's structural difficulty while adding linguistic and dialectal variability, demanding deeper reasoning for complex SQL. On this benchmark, state-of-the-art LLMs (such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1) reach only 4\% execution accuracy when relying on intrinsic reasoning, versus 60\% on MultiSpider 1.0. Therefore, we provide a collaboration-driven language agents baseline that iteratively refines queries, improving accuracy to 15\%. These results reveal a substantial multilingual gap and motivate methods that are robust across languages and ready for real-world enterprise deployment. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/phkhanhtrinh23/Multilingual_Text_to_SQL.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Digital Twin-Driven Predictive Maintenance in Industrial Engineering: Taxonomy, Architectural Elements, and Future Research Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing complexity of industrial systems, there is a pressing need for predictive maintenance to avoid costly downtime and disastrous outcomes that could be life-threatening in certain domains. With the growing popularity of the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and real-time big data analytics, there is a unique opportunity for efficient predictive maintenance to forecast equipment failures for real-time intervention and optimize maintenance actions, as traditional reactive and preventive maintenance practices are often inadequate to meet the requirements for the industry to provide quality-of-services of operations. Central to this evolution is digital twin technology, an adaptive virtual replica that continuously monitors and integrates sensor data to simulate and improve asset performance. Despite remarkable progress in digital twin implementations, such as considering DT in predictive maintenance for industrial engineering. This paper aims to address this void. We perform a retrospective analysis of the temporal evolution of the digital twin in predictive maintenance for industrial engineering to capture the applications, middleware, and technological requirements that led to the development of the digital twin from its inception to the AI-enabled digital twin and its self-learning models. We provide a layered architecture of the digital twin technology, as well as a taxonomy of the technology-enabled industrial engineering applications systems, middleware, and the used Artificial Intelligence algorithms. We provide insights into these systems for the realization of a trustworthy and efficient smart digital-twin industrial engineering ecosystem. We discuss future research directions in digital twin for predictive maintenance in industrial engineering.</description>

      <title>UniTraj: Learning a Universal Trajectory Foundation Model from Billion-Scale Worldwide Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building a universal trajectory foundation model is a promising solution to address the limitations of existing trajectory modeling approaches, such as task specificity, regional dependency, and data sensitivity. Despite its potential, data preparation, pre-training strategy development, and architectural design present significant challenges in constructing this model. Therefore, we introduce UniTraj, a Universal Trajectory foundation model that aims to address these limitations through three key innovations. First, we construct WorldTrace, an unprecedented dataset of 2.45 million trajectories with billions of GPS points spanning 70 countries, providing the diverse geographic coverage essential for region-independent modeling. Second, we develop novel pre-training strategies--Adaptive Trajectory Resampling and Self-supervised Trajectory Masking--that enable robust learning from heterogeneous trajectory data with varying sampling rates and quality. Finally, we tailor a flexible model architecture to accommodate a variety of trajectory tasks, effectively capturing complex movement patterns to support broad applicability. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior scalability, adaptability, and generalization, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal yet non-exclusive training resource.</description>

      <title>Can Human Drivers and Connected Autonomous Vehicles Co-exist in Lane-Free Traffic? A Microscopic Simulation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology have sparked growing research interest in lane-free traffic (LFT). LFT envisions a scenario where all vehicles are CAVs, coordinating their movements without lanes to achieve smoother traffic flow and higher road capacity. This potentially reduces congestion without building new infrastructure. However, the transition phase will likely involve non-connected actors such as human-driven vehicles (HDVs) or independent AVs sharing the roads. This raises the question of how LFT performance is impacted when not all vehicles are CAVs, as these non-connected vehicles may prioritize their own benefits over system-wide improvements. This paper addresses this question through microscopic simulation on a ring road, where CAVs follow the potential lines (PL) controller for LFT, while HDVs adhere to a strip-based car-following model. The PL controller is also modified for safe velocities to prevent collisions. The results reveal that even a small percentage of HDVs can significantly disrupt LFT flow: 5% HDVs can reduce LFT's maximum road capacity by 20% and a 40% HDVs nearly halves it, up until 100% HDVs where it drops by nearly 60%. The study also develops an adaptive potential line (APL) controller that forms APL corridors in the surroundings of HDVs. APL shows a peak traffic flow improvement of nearly 10% over the PL controller. The study indicates that a penetration rate of approximately 60% CAVs is required to start observing the major LFT benefits. These findings open a new research direction on minimizing the adverse effects of non-connected vehicles on LFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging field that harnesses advances in Quantum Computing (QC) to improve the scalability and efficiency of decentralized Federated Learning (FL) models. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive survey of the emerging problems and solutions when FL meets QC, from research protocol to a novel taxonomy, particularly focusing on both quantum and federated limitations, such as their architectures, Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and privacy preservation, so on. This work explores key developments and integration strategies, along with the impact of quantum computing on FL, keeping a sharp focus on hybrid quantum-classical approaches. The paper offers an in-depth understanding of how the strengths of QC, such as gradient hiding, state entanglement, quantum key distribution, quantum security, and quantum-enhanced differential privacy, have been integrated into FL to ensure the privacy of participants in an enhanced, fast, and secure framework. Finally, this study proposes potential future directions to address the identified research gaps and challenges, aiming to inspire faster and more secure QFL models for practical use.</description>

      <title>VQEzy: An Open-Source Dataset for Parameter Initialization in Variational Quantum Eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) are a leading class of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms, whose performance is highly sensitive to parameter initialization. Although recent machine learning-based initialization methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance, their progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are typically restricted to a single domain, contain only a few hundred instances, and lack complete coverage of Hamiltonians, ansatz circuits, and optimization trajectories. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VQEzy, the first large-scale dataset for VQE parameter initialization. VQEzy spans three major domains and seven representative tasks, comprising 12,110 instances with full VQE specifications and complete optimization trajectories. The dataset is available online, and will be continuously refined and expanded to support future research in VQE optimization.</description>

      <title>Experience Deploying Containerized GenAI Services at an HPC Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) applications are built from specialized components -- inference servers, object storage, vector and graph databases, and user interfaces -- interconnected via web-based APIs. While these components are often containerized and deployed in cloud environments, such capabilities are still emerging at High-Performance Computing (HPC) centers. In this paper, we share our experience deploying GenAI workloads within an established HPC center, discussing the integration of HPC and cloud computing environments. We describe our converged computing architecture that integrates HPC and Kubernetes platforms running containerized GenAI workloads, helping with reproducibility. A case study illustrates the deployment of the Llama Large Language Model (LLM) using a containerized inference server (vLLM) across both Kubernetes and HPC platforms using multiple container runtimes. Our experience highlights practical considerations and opportunities for the HPC container community, guiding future research and tool development.</description>

      <title>A Review on Quantum Circuit Optimization using ZX-Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises significant speed-ups for certain algorithms but the practical use of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era computers remains limited by resources constraints (e.g., noise, qubits, gates, and circuit depth). Quantum circuit optimization is a key mitigation strategy. In this context, ZX-calculus has emerged as an alternative framework that allows for semantics-preserving quantum circuit optimization.
  We review ZX-based optimization of quantum circuits, categorizing them by optimization techniques, target metrics and intended quantum computing architecture. In addition, we outline critical challenges and future research directions, such as multi-objective optimization, scalable algorithms, and enhanced circuit extraction methods. This survey is valuable for researchers in both combinatorial optimization and quantum computing. For researchers in combinatorial optimization, we provide the background to understand a new challenging combinatorial problem: ZX-based quantum circuit optimization. For researchers in quantum computing, we classify and explain existing circuit optimization techniques.</description>

      <title>Bridging Technical Capability and User Accessibility: Off-grid Civilian Emergency Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During large-scale crises disrupting cellular and Internet infrastructure, civilians lack reliable methods for communication, aid coordination, and access to trustworthy information. This paper presents a unified emergency communication system integrating a low-power, long-range network with a crisis-oriented smartphone application, enabling decentralized and off-grid civilian communication. Unlike previous solutions separating physical layer resilience from user layer usability, our design merges these aspects into a cohesive crisis-tailored framework.
  The system is evaluated in two dimensions: communication performance and application functionality. Field experiments in urban Z\"urich demonstrate that the 868 MHz band, using the LongFast configuration, achieves a communication range of up to 1.2 km with 92% Packet Delivery Ratio, validating network robustness under real-world infrastructure degraded conditions. In parallel, a purpose-built mobile application featuring peer-to-peer messaging, identity verification, and community moderation was evaluated through a requirements-based analysis.</description>
