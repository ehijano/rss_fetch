      <title>Node Similarities under Random Projections: Limits and Pathological Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random Projections have been widely used to generate embeddings for various graph tasks due to their computational efficiency. The majority of applications have been justified through the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma. In this paper, we take a step further and investigate how well dot product and cosine similarity are preserved by Random Projections. Our analysis provides new theoretical results, identifies pathological cases, and tests them with numerical experiments. We find that, for nodes of lower or higher degrees, the method produces especially unreliable embeddings for the dot product, regardless of whether the adjacency or the (normalized version) transition is used. With respect to the statistical noise introduced by Random Projections, we show that cosine similarity produces remarkably more precise approximations.</description>

      <title>Stampede Alert Clustering Algorithmic System Based on Tiny-Scale Strengthened DETR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel crowd stampede detection and prediction algorithm based on Deformable DETR is proposed to address the challenges of detecting a large number of small targets and target occlusion in crowded airport and train station environments. In terms of model design, the algorithm incorporates a multi-scale feature fusion module to enlarge the receptive field and enhance the detection capability of small targets. Furthermore, the deformable attention mechanism is improved to reduce missed detections and false alarms for critical targets. Additionally, a new algorithm is innovatively introduced for stampede event prediction and visualization. Experimental evaluations on the PKX-LHR dataset demonstrate that the enhanced algorithm achieves a 34% performance in small target detection accuracy while maintaining the original detection speed.</description>

      <title>Community detection and anomaly prediction in dynamic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is an essential task in the analysis of dynamic networks, as it can provide early warning of potential threats or abnormal behavior. We present a principled approach to detect anomalies in dynamic networks that integrates community structure as a foundational model for regular behavior. Our model identifies anomalies as irregular edges while capturing structural changes. Leveraging a Markovian approach for temporal transitions and incorporating structural information via latent variables for communities and anomaly detection, our model infers these hidden parameters to pinpoint abnormal interactions within the network. Our approach is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Real-world network analysis shows strong anomaly detection across diverse scenarios. In a more specific study of transfers of professional male football players, we observe various types of unexpected patterns and investigate how the country and wealth of clubs influence interactions. Additionally, we identify anomalies between clubs with incompatible community memberships, but also instances of anomalous transactions between clubs with similar memberships. The latter is due in particular to the dynamic nature of the transactions, as we find that the frequency of transfers results in anomalous behaviors that are otherwise expected to interact as they belong to similar communities.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Stance Labeling: User-Hashtag Heuristics with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high volume and rapid evolution of content on social media present major challenges for studying the stance of social media users. In this work, we develop a two stage stance labeling method that utilizes the user-hashtag bipartite graph and the user-user interaction graph. In the first stage, a simple and efficient heuristic for stance labeling uses the user-hashtag bipartite graph to iteratively update the stance association of user and hashtag nodes via a label propagation mechanism. This set of soft labels is then integrated with the user-user interaction graph to train a graph neural network (GNN) model using semi-supervised learning. We evaluate this method on two large-scale datasets containing tweets related to climate change from June 2021 to June 2022 and gun control from January 2022 to January 2023. Experiments demonstrate that our user-hashtag heuristic and the semi-supervised GNN method outperform zero-shot stance labeling using LLMs such as GPT4. Further analysis illustrates how the stance labeling information and interaction graph can be used for evaluating the polarization of social media interactions on divisive issues such as climate change and gun control.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Latent Arguments in Social Media Messaging by Employing LLMs-in-the-Loop Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of social media has led to a surge in popularity for automated methods of analyzing public opinion. Supervised methods are adept at text categorization, yet the dynamic nature of social media discussions poses a continual challenge for these techniques due to the constant shifting of the focus. On the other hand, traditional unsupervised methods for extracting themes from public discourse, such as topic modeling, often reveal overarching patterns that might not capture specific nuances. Consequently, a significant portion of research into social media discourse still depends on labor-intensive manual coding techniques and a human-in-the-loop approach, which are both time-consuming and costly. In this work, we study the problem of discovering arguments associated with a specific theme. We propose a generic LLMs-in-the-Loop strategy that leverages the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract latent arguments from social media messaging. To demonstrate our approach, we apply our framework to contentious topics. We use two publicly available datasets: (1) the climate campaigns dataset of 14k Facebook ads with 25 themes and (2) the COVID-19 vaccine campaigns dataset of 9k Facebook ads with 14 themes. Furthermore, we analyze demographic targeting and the adaptation of messaging based on real-world events.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the Graph Polynomial Filter via Positive and Negative Coupling Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the optimization of polynomial filters within Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has emerged as a prominent research focus. Existing spectral GNNs mainly emphasize polynomial properties in filter design, introducing computational overhead and neglecting the integration of crucial graph structure information. We argue that incorporating graph information into basis construction can enhance understanding of polynomial basis, and further facilitate simplified polynomial filter design. Motivated by this, we first propose a Positive and Negative Coupling Analysis (PNCA) framework, where the concepts of positive and negative activation are defined and their respective and mixed effects are analysed. Then, we explore PNCA from the message propagation perspective, revealing the subtle information hidden in the activation process. Subsequently, PNCA is used to analyze the mainstream polynomial filters, and a novel simple basis that decouples the positive and negative activation and fully utilizes graph structure information is designed. Finally, a simple GNN (called GSCNet) is proposed based on the new basis. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets for node classification verify that our GSCNet obtains better or comparable results compared with existing state-of-the-art GNNs while demanding relatively less computational time.</description>

      <title>Cross-Language Evolution of Divergent Collective Memory Around the Arab Spring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Arab Spring was a historic set of protests beginning in 2011 that toppled governments and led to major conflicts. Collective memories of events like these can vary significantly across social contexts in response to political, cultural, and linguistic factors. While Wikipedia plays an important role in documenting both historic and current events, little attention has been given to how Wikipedia articles, created in the aftermath of major events, continue to evolve over years or decades. Using the archived content of Arab Spring-related topics across the Arabic and English Wikipedias between 2011 and 2024, we define and evaluate multilingual measures of event salience, deliberation, contextualization, and consolidation of collective memory surrounding the Arab Spring. Our findings about the temporal evolution of the Wikipedia articles' content similarity across languages has implications for theorizing about online collective memory processes and evaluating linguistic models trained on these data.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Graph Datasets for Node Classification: Homophily-Heterophily Dichotomy and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06177v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homophily is a graph property describing the tendency of edges to connect similar nodes; the opposite is called heterophily. It is often believed that heterophilous graphs are challenging for standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs), and much effort has been put into developing efficient methods for this setting. However, there is no universally agreed-upon measure of homophily in the literature. In this work, we show that commonly used homophily measures have critical drawbacks preventing the comparison of homophily levels across different datasets. For this, we formalize desirable properties for a proper homophily measure and verify which measures satisfy which properties. In particular, we show that a measure that we call adjusted homophily satisfies more desirable properties than other popular homophily measures while being rarely used in graph machine learning literature. Then, we go beyond the homophily-heterophily dichotomy and propose a new characteristic that allows one to further distinguish different sorts of heterophily. The proposed label informativeness (LI) characterizes how much information a neighbor's label provides about a node's label. We prove that this measure satisfies important desirable properties. We also observe empirically that LI better agrees with GNN performance compared to homophily measures, which confirms that it is a useful characteristic of the graph structure.</description>

      <title>Strategic formation of collaborative networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.14204v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine behavior in an experimental collaboration game that incorporates endogenous network formation. The environment is modeled as a generalization of the voluntary contributions mechanism. By varying the information structure in a controlled laboratory experiment, we examine the underlying mechanisms of reciprocity that generate emergent patterns in linking and contribution decisions. Providing players more detailed information about the sharing behavior of others drastically increases efficiency, and positively affects a number of other key outcomes. To understand the driving causes of these changes in behavior we develop and estimate a structural model for actions and small network panels and identify how social preferences affect behavior. We find that the treatment reduces altruism but stimulates reciprocity, helping players coordinate to reach mutually beneficial outcomes. In a set of counterfactual simulations, we show that increasing trust in the community would encourage higher average contributions at the cost of mildly increased free-riding. Increasing overall reciprocity greatly increases collaborative behavior when there is limited information but can backfire in the treatment, suggesting that negative reciprocity and punishment can reduce efficiency. The largest returns would come from an intervention that drives players away from negative and toward positive reciprocity.</description>
