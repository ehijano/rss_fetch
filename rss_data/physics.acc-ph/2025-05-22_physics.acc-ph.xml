      <title>Flux Jumps up to 17 T in ReBCO Tape Stack Cables and their Suppression with Increased Intertape Spacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetization of ReBCO tape stacks and tape stack cables in high magnetic fields (up to 30 T) are not commonly reported. Here we report magnetization measurements of tape stack cables in magnetic fields up to 30 T at 4.2 K. We observed that flux jumps, commonly relegated to low field regimes for single tapes, persisted up to 17 T in tape stacks, an effect which could have substantial technological relevance for high field applications including fusion devices or accelerator magnets. On the other hand, with the use of small spacers, we could suppress flux jump behavior, in some cases eliminating jumps entirely. Our findings provide critical insights for the optimization of designs for ReBCO cables for high-field applications, including fusion magnets and particle accelerators.</description>

      <title>High-$\beta$* Optics Calculus at IP2 for Forward Physics in LHC Runs 3 and 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of high-$\beta$* optics configurations at Interaction Point 2 (IP2) of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), developed to enable forward and diffractive physics measurements with the ALICE experiment during Runs 3 and 4. Using MAD-X, we designed a $\beta$* = 30 m optics scheme that satisfies beam stability and aperture requirements, while offering improved sensitivity to small-angle scattering. The configuration follows the Achromatic Telescopic Squeeze (ATS) optics scheme, originally developed for IP1 and IP5, which provides enhanced control over phase advance and chromaticity. The resulting optics layout enables a forward physics program with continuous data-taking. We also outline possible extensions toward even higher $\beta$* values and discuss the implementation roadmap.</description>

      <title>The Feasibility Study of the GeV-Energy Muon Source Based on HIAF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating a mono-energetic, high-energy muon beam using accelerator facilities can be very attractive for many purposes, for example, improving muon tomography currently limited by the low flux and wide energy spread of cosmic ray muons, and searching for muon related new physics beyond the Standard Model. One potential accelerator facility is the High Intensity Heavy-Ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF), which is currently under construction in Huizhou City, China. Considering the projectile energy and beamline length, a high-intensity and GeV-energy muon flux could be produced and delivered by the High Energy Fragment Separator beamline of the HIAF facility. In this paper, the flux intensity and purity of muon beam based on HIAF are discussed in detail. For the $\mu^+$ beam, the highest muon yield reaches $8.2 \times 10^6 ~ \mu$/s with the purity of approximately $2\%$ at a momentum of 3.5 GeV/c; meanwhile, for the $\mu^-$ beam, the maximum muon yield is 4.2 $\times 10^6 ~ \mu$/s with the purity of around $20\%$ at a momentum of 1.5 GeV/c. The results also indicate that, for muon beams with an energy of several GeV, by applying a suitable purification strategy, we can get a muon beam with a purity of 100\% and an intensity of the order of $10^5 ~ \mu$/s.</description>

      <title>Development and Characterization of a High-Resolution and High-Sensitivity Collinear Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the recent implementation of a radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) cooler-buncher and a multi-step laser resonance ionization technique, our previously developed collinear laser spectroscopy setup has been successfully upgraded into a fully functional collinear resonance ionization spectroscopy system. The new system was fully characterized using a bunched ion beam at 30~keV, during which hyperfine structure spectra of $^{85,87}$Rb isotopes were measured. An overall efficiency exceeding 1:200 (one resonant ion detected for every 200 ions after the RFQ cooler-buncher) was achieved while maintaining a spectral resolution of 100 MHz. Under these conditions, the extracted hyperfine structure parameters and isotope shift for $^{85,87}$Rb show excellent agreement with the literature values. These results demonstrate the system's capability to perform high-resolution and high-sensitivity laser spectroscopy of neutron-rich Rb isotopes, which are expected to be produced at the Beijing Radioactive Ion-beam Facility at a rate of approximately 100 particles per second.</description>
