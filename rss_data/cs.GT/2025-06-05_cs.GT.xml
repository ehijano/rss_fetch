      <title>User Altruism in Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Users of social media platforms based on recommendation systems (RecSys) (e.g. TikTok, X, YouTube) strategically interact with platform content to influence future recommendations. On some such platforms, users have been documented to form large-scale grassroots movements encouraging others to purposefully interact with algorithmically suppressed content in order to "boost" its recommendation; we term this behavior user altruism. To capture this behavior, we study a game between users and a RecSys, where users provide the RecSys (potentially manipulated) preferences over the contents available to them, and the RecSys -- limited by data and computation constraints -- creates a low-rank approximation preference matrix, and ultimately provides each user her (approximately) most-preferred item. We compare the users' social welfare under truthful preference reporting and under a class of strategies capturing user altruism. In our theoretical analysis, we provide sufficient conditions to ensure strict increases in user social welfare under user altruism, and provide an algorithm to find an effective altruistic strategy. Interestingly, we show that for commonly assumed recommender utility functions, effectively altruistic strategies also improve the utility of the RecSys! We show that our results are robust to several model misspecifications, thus strengthening our conclusions. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by empirical results of effective altruistic strategies on the GoodReads dataset, and an online survey on how real-world users behave altruistically in RecSys. Overall, our findings serve as a proof-of-concept of the reasons why traditional RecSys may incentivize users to form collectives and/or follow altruistic strategies when interacting with them.</description>

      <title>MVP-Shapley: Feature-based Modeling for Evaluating the Most Valuable Player in Basketball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The burgeoning growth of the esports and multiplayer online gaming community has highlighted the critical importance of evaluating the Most Valuable Player (MVP). The establishment of an explainable and practical MVP evaluation method is very challenging. In our study, we specifically focus on play-by-play data, which records related events during the game, such as assists and points. We aim to address the challenges by introducing a new MVP evaluation framework, denoted as \oursys, which leverages Shapley values. This approach encompasses feature processing, win-loss model training, Shapley value allocation, and MVP ranking determination based on players' contributions. Additionally, we optimize our algorithm to align with expert voting results from the perspective of causality. Finally, we substantiated the efficacy of our method through validation using the NBA dataset and the Dunk City Dynasty dataset and implemented online deployment in the industry.</description>

      <title>An O(log log n)-approximate budget feasible mechanism for subadditive valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In budget-feasible mechanism design, there is a set of items $U$, each owned by a distinct seller. The seller of item $e$ incurs a private cost $\overline{c}_e$ for supplying her item. A buyer wishes to procure a set of items from the sellers of maximum value, where the value of a set $S\subseteq U$ of items is given by a valuation function $v:2^U\to \mathbb{R}_+$. The buyer has a budget of $B \in \mathbb{R}_+$ for the total payments made to the sellers. We wish to design a mechanism that is truthful, that is, sellers are incentivized to report their true costs, budget-feasible, that is, the sum of the payments made to the sellers is at most the budget $B$, and that outputs a set whose value is large compared to $\text{OPT}:=\max\{v(S):\overline{c}(S)\le B,S\subseteq U\}$.
  Budget-feasible mechanism design has been extensively studied, with the literature focussing on (classes of) subadditive valuation functions, and various polytime, budget-feasible mechanisms, achieving constant-factor approximation, have been devised for the special cases of additive, submodular, and XOS valuations. However, for general subadditive valuations, the best-known approximation factor achievable by a polytime budget-feasible mechanism (given access to demand oracles) was only $O(\log n / \log \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of items.
  We improve this state-of-the-art significantly by designing a budget-feasible mechanism for subadditive valuations that \emph{achieves a substantially-improved approximation factor of $O(\log\log n)$ and runs in polynomial time, given access to demand oracles.}</description>

      <title>Cooperation and the Design of Public Goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the cooperative elements that arise in the design of public goods, such as transportation policies and infrastructure. These involve a variety of stakeholders: governments, businesses, advocates, and users. Their eventual deployment depends on the decision maker's ability to garner sufficient support from each of these groups; we formalize these strategic requirements from the perspective of cooperative game theory. Specifically, we introduce non-transferable utility, linear production (NTU LP) games, which combine the game-theoretic tensions inherent in public decision-making with the modeling flexibility of linear programming. We derive structural properties regarding the non-emptiness, representability and complexity of the core, a solution concept that models the viability of cooperation. In particular, we provide fairly general sufficient conditions under which the core of an NTU LP game is guaranteed to be non-empty, prove that determining membership in the core is co-NP-complete, and develop a cutting plane algorithm to optimize various social welfare objectives subject to core membership. Lastly, we apply these results in a data-driven case study on service plan optimization for the Chicago bus system. As our study illustrates, cooperation is necessary for the successful deployment of transportation service plans and similar public goods, but it may also have adverse or counterintuitive distributive implications.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Computation in First-Price Auctions with Correlated Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the computational complexity of computing Bayes-Nash equilibria in first-price auctions, where the bidders' values for the item are drawn from a general (possibly correlated) joint distribution. We show that when the values and the bidding space are discrete, determining the existence of a pure Bayes-Nash equilibrium is NP-hard. This is the first hardness result in the literature of the problem that does not rely on assumptions of subjectivity of the priors, or convoluted tie-breaking rules. We then present two main approaches for achieving positive results, via bid sparsification and via bid densification. The former is more combinatorial and is based on enumeration techniques, whereas the latter makes use of the continuous theory of the problem developed in the economics literature. Using these approaches, we develop polynomial-time approximation algorithms for computing equilibria in symmetric settings or settings with a fixed number of bidders, for different (discrete or continuous) variants of the auction.</description>

      <title>CORA: Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition for Multi-Agent Policy Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory, ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima. These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment for improving MARL performance.</description>

      <title>Matching Markets Meet LLMs: Algorithmic Reasoning with Ranked Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.</description>

      <title>Cautious Optimism: A Meta-Algorithm for Near-Constant Regret in General Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play (mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.</description>

      <title>Conservative classifiers do consistently well with improving agents: characterizing statistical and online learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al. for both proper and improper learning.</description>

      <title>Network analysis using Forman curvature and Shapley values on hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.06506v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, network models have become more complex with the development of big data. Therefore, more advanced network analysis is required. In this paper, we introduce a new quantitative measure named combinatorial evaluation, which combines the discrete geometry concept of Forman Ricci curvature and the game theory concept of the Shapley value. We elucidated the characteristics of combinatorial evaluation by proving several properties of this indicator. Furthermore, we demonstrated the usefulness of the concept by calculating and comparing the conventional centrality and combinatorial evaluation for a concrete graph. The code is available at https://github.com/Taiki-Yamada-Math/CombinatorialEvaluation.</description>

      <title>Popular and Dominant Matchings with Uncertain, Multilayer and Aggregated Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14288v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Popular Matching problem in multiple models, where the preferences of the agents in the instance may change or may be unknown/uncertain. In particular, we study an Uncertainty model, where each agent has a possible set of preferences, a Multilayer model, where there are layers of preference profiles, a Robust model, where any agent may move some other agents up or down some places in his preference list and an Aggregated Preference model, where votes are summed over multiple instances with different preferences.
  We study both one-sided and two-sided preferences in bipartite graphs. In the one-sided model, we show that all our problems can be solved in polynomial time by utilizing the structure of popular matchings. We also obtain nice structural results. With two-sided preferences, we show that all four above models lead to NP-hard questions for popular matchings. By utilizing the connection between dominant matchings and stable matchings, we show that in the robust and uncertainty model, a certainly dominant matching in all possible prefernce profiles can be found in polynomial-time, whereas in the multilayer and aggregated models, the problem remains NP-hard for dominant matchings too.
  We also answer an open question about $d$-robust stable matchings.</description>

      <title>Strategy Complexity of B\"uchi Objectives in Concurrent Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study 2-player zero-sum concurrent (i.e., simultaneous move) stochastic B\"uchi games and Transience games on countable graphs. Two players, Max and Min, seek respectively to maximize and minimize the probability of satisfying the game objective. The B\"uchi objective is to visit a given set of target states infinitely often. This can be seen as a special case of maximizing the expected $\limsup$ of the daily rewards, where all daily rewards are in $\{0,1\}$. The Transience objective is to visit no state infinitely often, i.e., every finite subset of the states is eventually left forever. Transience can only be met in infinite game graphs. We show that in B\"uchi games there always exist $\varepsilon$-optimal Max strategies that use just a step counter (discrete clock) plus 1 bit of public memory. This upper bound holds for all countable graphs, but it is a new result even for the special case of finite graphs. The upper bound is tight in the sense that Max strategies that use just a step counter, or just finite memory, are not sufficient even on finite game graphs. This upper bound is a consequence of a slightly stronger new result: $\varepsilon$-optimal Max strategies for the combined B\"uchi and Transience objective require just 1 bit of public memory (but cannot be memoryless). Our proof techniques also yield a closely related result, that $\varepsilon$-optimal Max strategies for the Transience objective alone can be chosen as memoryless.</description>

      <title>Branch-and-Cut for Mixed-Integer Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized Nash equilibrium problems with mixed-integer variables form an important class of games in which each player solves a mixed-integer optimization problem with respect to her own variables and the strategy space of each player depends on the strategies chosen by the rival players. In this work, we introduce a branch-and-cut algorithm to compute exact pure Nash equilibria for different classes of such mixed-integer games. The main idea is to reformulate the equilibrium problem as a suitable bilevel problem based on the Nikaido--Isoda function of the game. The proposed branch-and-cut method is applicable to generalized Nash equilibrium problems under quite mild assumptions. Depending on the specific setting, we use tailored equilibrium or intersection cuts. The latter are well-known in mixed-integer linear optimization and we adapt them to the game setting. We prove finite termination and correctness of the algorithm and present some first numerical results for two different types of knapsack games and another game based on capacitated flow problems.</description>

Abstract: Kidney Exchange Programmes (KEPs) facilitate the exchange of kidneys, and larger pools of recipient-donor pairs tend to yield proportionally more transplants, leading to the proposal of international KEPs (IKEPs). However, as studied by \citet{mincu2021ip}, practical limitations must be considered in IKEPs to ensure that countries remain willing to participate. Thus, we study IKEPs with country-specific parameters, represented by a tuple $\Gamma$, restricting the selected transplants to be feasible for the countries to conduct, e.g., imposing an upper limit on the number of consecutive exchanges within a country's borders. We provide a complete complexity dichotomy for the problem of finding a feasible (according to the constraints given by $\Gamma$) cycle packing with the maximum number of transplants, for every possible $\Gamma$. We also study the potential for countries to misreport their parameters to increase their allocation. As manipulation can harm the total number of transplants, we propose a novel individually rational and incentive compatible mechanism $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$. We first give a theoretical approximation ratio for $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$ in terms of the number of transplants, and show that the approximation ratio of $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$ is asymptotically optimal. We then use simulations which suggest that, in practice, the performance of $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$ is significantly better than this worst-case ratio.</description>
