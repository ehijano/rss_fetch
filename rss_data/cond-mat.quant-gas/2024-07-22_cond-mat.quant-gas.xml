      <title>Interaction effects on the itinerant ferromagnetism phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Itinerant ferromagnetism is one of the most studied quantum phase transitions, the transition point and the nature of this phase transition being widely discussed. In dilute Fermi liquids, this analysis has been carried out up to second-order in the gas parameter, where the results for any spin degeneracy are universal in terms of only the s-wave scattering length $a_0$. We extend this analysis to third-order where energies depend, not only on $a_0$, but also on the s-wave effective range $r_0$ and the p-wave scattering length $a_1$. The introduction in the theory of these new parameters changes the transition point, with respect to the second-order estimation, and also can modify the nature of the phase transition itself. We analyze these interaction effects on the phase transition for different spin values. The emerging phase diagram shows that the type of ferromagnetic transition changes dramatically as a function of $r_0$ and $a_1$ and, importantly, that this classification is not solely determined by the spin value, as happens at second order.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent condensate formation in ultracold atoms with energy-dependent transport coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) formation in ultracold atoms is investigated in a nonlinear diffusion model. For constant transport coefficients, the model has been solved analytically. Here, we extend it to include energy-dependent transport coeffcients and numerically solve the nonlinear equation. Our results are compared with the earlier analytical model for constant transport coeffcients, and with recent deep-quench data for K-39 at various scattering lengths. Some non-physical predictions from the constant-coefficient model are resolved using energy-dependent drift and diffusion.</description>

      <title>Simulations of evaporation to deep Fermi degeneracy in microwave-shielded molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quest toward realizing novel quantum matter in ultracold molecular gases, we perform a numerical study of evaporative cooling in ultracold gases of microwave-shielded polar fermionic molecules. Our Monte Carlo simulations incorporate accurate two-body elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections, realistic modeling of the optical dipole trap, and the influence of Pauli blocking at low temperatures. The simulations are benchmarked against data from evaporation studies performed with ultracold NaK molecules, showing excellent agreement. We further explore the prospects for optimizing the evaporation efficiency by varying the ramp rate and duration of the evaporation trajectory. Our simulation shows that it is possible to reach $&lt; 10\%$ of the Fermi temperature under optimal conditions even in the presence of two-body molecular losses.</description>

      <title>Multicritical quantum sensors driven by symmetry-breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum criticality has been demonstrated as a useful quantum resource for parameter estimation. This includes second-order, topological and localization transitions. In all these works reported so far, gap-to-gapless transition at criticality has been identified as the ultimate resource for achieving the quantum enhanced sensing, although there are several important concepts associated with criticality, such as long-range correlation, symmetry breaking. In this work, we analytically demonstrate that symmetry-breaking can drive a quantum enhanced sensing in single- or multiparameter estimation. We show this in the well-known Kitaev model, a lattice version of the 1D p-wave superconductor, which consists of a pairing term and an onsite potential term. The model is characterized by two critical lines and a multi-critical point at the intersection of these two lines. We show that Heisenberg scaling can be obtained in precision measurement of the superconducting coupling by preparing the system at or near the multicritical point despite the fact that parameter variation follows the critical lines, i.e., without an explicit requirement of gap-to-gapless transition. Quantum enhancement in such situations solely occurs due to a global U(1) symmetry-breaking by the pairing term. Extending our analysis in the realm of multiparameter estimation we show that it is possible to obtain super-Heisenberg scaling by combining the effects of symmetry-breaking and gapless-to-gapped transition.</description>

      <title>Computing ground states of spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensates by the normalized gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze an efficient and accurate numerical method for computing ground states of spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) by using the normalized gradient flow (NGF). In order to successfully extend the NGF to spin-2 BECs which has five components in the vector wave function but with only two physical constraints on total mass conservation and magnetization conservation, two important techniques are introduced for designing the proposed numerical method. The first one is to systematically investigate the ground state structure and property of spin-2 BECs within a spatially uniform system, which can be used on how to properly choose initial data in the NGF for computing ground states of spin-2 BECs. The second one is to introduce three additional projection conditions based on the relations between the chemical potentials, together with the two existing physical constraints, such that the five projection parameters used in the projection step of the NGF can be uniquely determined. Then a backward-forward Euler finite difference method is adapted to discretize the NGF. We prove rigorously that there exists a unique solution of the nonlinear system for determining the five projection parameters in the full discretization of the NGF under a mild condition on the time step size. Extensive numerical results on ground states of spin-2 BECs with ferromagnetic/nematic/cyclic phase and harmonic/optical lattice/box potential in one/two dimensions are reported to show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed numerical method and to demonstrate several interesting physical phenomena on ground states of spin-2 BECs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Echo in Two-Component Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of ultracold atom technology has enabled the precise investigations on quantum dynamics of quantum gases. Recently, inspired by experimental advancement, the $SU(1,1)$ echo, akin to the well-known $SU(2)$ spin echo, has been proposed for single-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). In this paper, we investigate the possibility of quantum echo in the more intricate two-component BEC by fully exploiting its underlying symmetry, which is the Lie group $Sp(4,R)$. We demonstrate that quantum echo can occur for the two-component BEC by applying a driving protocol consisting of two steps in each period. The first step can be any Bogoliubov Hamiltonian, while the second step is a Hamiltonian with interactions turned off, which plays a similar role as the $\pi$-pulse in spin echo. We confirm our theoretical results with numerical calculations for different examples of two-component BEC. We further consider the effect of interactions between the excited boson modes on the quantum echo process and discuss the possible experiment implementation of this quantum echo.</description>

      <title>Interferometry of non-Abelian band singularities and Euler class topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In systems with a real Bloch Hamiltonian band nodes can be characterised by a non-Abelian frame-rotation charge. The ability of these band nodes to annihilate pairwise is path dependent, since by braiding nodes in adjacent gaps the sign of their charges can be changed. Here, we theoretically construct and numerically confirm two concrete methods to experimentally probe these non-Abelian braiding processes and charges in ultracold atomic systems. We consider a coherent superposition of two bands that can be created by moving atoms through the band singularities at some angle in momentum space. Analyzing the dependency of excitations on the frame charges, we demonstrate an interferometry scheme passing through two band nodes, which reveals the relative frame charges and allows for measuring the multi-gap topological invariant. The second method relies on a single wavepacket probing two nodes sequentially, where the frame charges can be determined from the band populations. Our results present a feasible avenue for measuring non-Abelian charges of band nodes and the direct experimental verification of braiding procedures, which can be applied in a variety of settings including the recently discovered anomalous non-Abelian phases arising under periodic driving.</description>

      <title>Optimal form of time-local non-Lindblad master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-local quantum master equations that describe open quantum systems beyond the limit of ultraweak system-bath coupling are often not of Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) form. Prominent examples are the Redfield equation approximating general open quantum systems and the Hu-Paz-Zhang equation exactly describing a damped harmonic oscillator. Here, we show that not only the former, but also the latter can be brought to pseudo-Lindblad form, with a dissipator that resembles that of a GKSL equation, except for the fact that some of the terms have negative weights. Moreover, we systematically investigate transformations that leave the dissipator of pseudo-Lindblad equations unchanged, while changing the relative weight between its positive and negative terms. These can be used to minimize the weights of the negative terms, which is optimal both for the convergence of a recently developed quantum-trajectory unraveling of pseudo-Lindblad equations as well as for the truncation of the negative terms to obtain a GKSL equation.</description>

      <title>Cosmological particle production in a quantum field simulator as a quantum mechanical scattering problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The production of quantum field excitations or particles in cosmological spacetimes is a hallmark prediction of curved quantum field theory. The generation of cosmological perturbations from quantum fluctuations in the early universe constitutes an important application. The problem can be quantum-simulated in terms of structure formation in an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with time-dependent s-wave scattering length. Here, we explore a mapping between cosmological particle production in general (D+1)-dimensional spacetimes and scattering problems described by the non-relativistic stationary Schr\"odinger equation in one dimension. Through this mapping, intuitive explanations for emergent spatial structures in both the BEC and the cosmological system can be obtained for a large class of analogue cosmological scenarios, ranging from power-law expansions to periodic modulations. The investigated cosmologies and their scattering analogues are tuned to be implemented in a (2+1)-dimensional quantum field simulator.</description>
