      <title>Rearrangement Groups of Fractals: Structure and Conjugacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation is about rearrangement groups: a class of groups of homeomorphisms of fractal topological spaces. Introduced in 2019 by J. Belk and B. Forrest, this class generalizes the famous trio of Thompson groups $F$, $T$ and $V$ and includes some of their relatives and generalizations. After an introduction to this topic, this dissertation branches into different aspects of rearrangement groups.
  We first focus on a class of rearrangement groups of tree-like fractals known as Wa\.zewski dendrites. We find finite generating sets for them and their commutator subgroups, we prove that the commutator subgroups are simple (with one possible exception) and we show that these groups are countable dense subgroups of the groups of all homeomorphisms of dendrites.
  We then provide a sufficient condition to solve the conjugacy problem in rearrangement groups using strand diagram. This condition is not necessary, but understanding how to extend it is related to open problems in computer science. This method solves the conjugacy problem in essentially all known rearrangement groups.
  Next we study a group property known as invariable generation. With a dynamical approach we prove that transitive enough rearrangement groups are not invariably generated, which applies to most rearrangement group that has been considered so far.
  Then we study the gluing relation that defines the fractal topological spaces on which rearrangement groups act. We show that it is rational, i.e., there exists a finite-state automaton which reads a pair of elements if and only if they are related.
  We then show that finite and finitely generated abelian groups are rearrangement groups and that the stabilizers of finite sets of rational points of rearrangement groups are themselves rearrangement groups. Lastly, we prove that every rearrangement group embeds into Thompson's group $V$.</description>

      <title>Finite imprimitive rank $3$ affine groups -- I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is one of a series of papers which aims towards a classification of imprimitive affine groups of rank $3$.
  In this paper, a complete classification is given of such groups of characteristic $p$ such that the point stabilizer is not $p$-local, which shows that such groups are very rare, namely, the two non-isomorphic groups of the form $2^4{:}\mathrm{GL}_3(2)$ with a unique minimal normal subgroup are the only examples.</description>

      <title>On the Realization of quantum gates coming from the Tracy-Singh product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tracy-Singh product of matrices permits to construct a new gate $c \boxtimes c'$ from two $2$-qudit gates $c$ and $c'$. If $c$ and $c'$ are both Yang-Baxter gates, then $c \boxtimes c'$ is also a Yang-Baxter gate, and if at least one of them is entangling, then $c \boxtimes c'$ is also entangling. A natural question arises about the realisation of these gates, $c \boxtimes c'$, in terms of local and universal gates. In this paper, we consider this question and describe this realisation.</description>

      <title>Exploiting $\vartheta -$functions for the identification of topological materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact analytical expression is derived for Bloch states in three dimensions, based on the only assumption that the electronic wavefunction can be expanded in terms of Gaussian type orbitals.
  The resulting expression features multidimensional $\vartheta -$functions (and their derivatives) on which the action of discrete space group symmetries is evaluated analytically and contrasted against the symmetry transformations proper of modular forms.
  We integrate group theoretical arguments with continuity requirements of the Bloch states to produce a viable algorithm for the determination of band inversions in materials with a non-trivial topological electronic band structure; the proposed methodology is then applied to two simplified materials models.</description>

      <title>Optimal Linear Sofic Approximations Of Countable Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.10111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A countable group G is called k-linear sofic (for some 0 &lt;k \le 1) if finite subsets of G admit "approximate representations" by complex invertible matrices in the normalized rank metric, so that non-identity elements are k-away from the identity. This class of groups was systematically studied by Arzhantseva and Paunescu [AP17], where it is shown that such a group is always 1/4-linear sofic. In this paper, we will study the optimality of this result for general countable groups and show that every linear sofic group is 1/2-linear sofic, and 1/2 cannot be improved. However, if G is assumed to be torsion-free, then it is 1-linear sofic. These results answer a question posed by G. Arzhantseva in her talk in the IAS Stability and Testability lecture series. We also study the optimal linear sofic constant of finite groups over C and fields of positive characteristic. For the proof, we establish effective non-concentration estimates for random walks on finitely generated abelian groups, which may be of independent interest. Another ingredient of the proof involves bounding integrals of certain trigonometric sums.</description>

      <title>Rational Gluing in Edge Replacement Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the rationality of the gluing relation of edge replacement systems, which were introduced for studying rearrangement groups of fractals. More precisely, we describe an algorithmic procedure for building a finite state automaton that recognizes pairs of equivalent sequences that are glued in the fractal. This fits in recent interest towards the rationality of gluing relations on totally disconnected compact metrizable spaces.</description>

      <title>Infinite graph product of groups I: Geometry of the extension graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the extension graph of graph product of groups and study its geometry. This enables us to study properties of graph product by exploiting large scale geometry of its defining graph. In particular, we show that the extension graph is isomorphic to the crossing graph of a canonical quasi-median graph and exhibits the same phenomenon about asymptotic dimension as quasi-trees of metric spaces studied by Bestvina-Bromberg-Fujiwara. As an application of the extension graph, we prove relative hyperbolicity of graph-wreath product. This provides a new construction of relatively hyperbolic groups.</description>
