      <title>Anyonic Chern insulator in graphene induced by surface electromagnon vacuum fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-wavelength cavities have emerged as a promising platform to realize strong light-matter coupling in condensed matter systems. Previous studies are limited to dielectric sub-wavelength cavities, which preserve time-reversal symmetry. Here, we lift this constraint by proposing a cavity system based on magneto-electric materials, which host surface electromagnons with non-orthogonal electric field and magnetic field components. The quantum fluctuations of the surface electromagnons drive a nearby graphene monolayer into an anyonic Chern insulator, characterized by anyonic quasi-particles and a topological gap that decays polynomially with the graphene-substrate distance. Our work opens a path to controllably break time-reversal symmetry and induce exotic quantum states through cavity vacuum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Parametric resonance in a spin-1/2 chain: dynamical effects of nontrivial topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant parametric modulation is a major tool of studying magnetic systems. For a spin-1/2 chain in a strong magnetic field, the resulting excitations can be mapped on fermionic excitations in the Kitaev chain. We show that the response to the modulation turn-on allows one to reveal dynamical aspects of the nontrivial topology of the periodic chain. In the topological regime, depending on how fast the turn-on is, the system displays the absence of spatial magnetization correlations or their increase with the increasing detuning of the modulation from resonance. The transition between the topological and trivial regimes is controlled by the modulation frequency.</description>

      <title>Effect of doping on hot-carrier thermal breakdown in perforated graphene metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the robustness of the S-shaped current-voltage characteristics associated with hot-carrier-induced electrical breakdown in perforated graphene metasurfaces (PGMs) as a function of doping. The perforation of the graphene layer forms interdigital arrays of graphene microribbons (GMRs) interconnected by graphene nanoribbon (GNR) bridges. These GNR constrictions act as energy barriers for electrons and holes emitted from the GMRs and govern the inter-GMR thermionic current under an applied bias voltage. The doping and the voltage bias establish distinct electron and hole populations in adjacent GMRs. Peltier heating of these carriers within the GMRs increases their effective temperatures, thereby enhancing the inter-GMR current. The resulting positive feedback between carrier heating and current amplification can trigger an electrothermal breakdown, transforming a superlinear current-voltage dependence into an S-shaped characteristic exhibiting negative differential resistance. The degree of electron-hole asymmetry significantly influences this positive feedback and strongly modifies the overall current-voltage response. These results provide a framework for optimizing PGM-based devices employing GMR/GNR architectures, including voltage-controlled fast switches, incandescent emitters, and terahertz bolometric detectors.</description>

      <title>Nearly semi-elliptic relation between the minimal conductivity and Hall conductivity in unpaired Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric conductivities may reveal the topological and magnetic properties of band structures in solids, especially for two-dimensional unpaired Dirac fermions. In this work, we evaluate the longitudinal and Hall conductivity for unpaired Dirac fermions in the framework of the self-consistent Born approximation and find a nearly semi-elliptic relation between the minimal conductivity and Hall conductivities in the Dirac fermions. Near the charge neutrality point, disorder may drive a metal-insulator transition, and enhance the longitudinal conductivity. For the massless case, the minimal conductivity $\sigma_{xx}^*$ coexists with the half-quantized Hall conductivity $e^2/2h$, forming an indicator for the parity anomalous semimetal. The relation signals a disorder-induced metallic phase that bridges two topologically distinct insulating phases, and agrees with the recent experimental observation in magnetic topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Topological states and flat bands in exactly solvable decorated Cayley trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the full spectrum of decorated Cayley trees that constitute tree analogs of selected two-dimensional Euclidean lattices; namely of the Lieb, the double Lieb, the kagome, and the star lattice. The common feature of these Euclidean lattices is that their nearest-neighbor models give rise to flat energy bands interpretable through compact localized states. We find that the tree analogs exhibit similar flat or nearly flat energy bands at the corresponding energies. Interestingly, such flat bands in the decorated Cayley trees acquire an interpretation that is absent in their Euclidean counterparts: as edge states localized to the inner or the outer boundary of the tree branches. In particular, we establish an exact correspondence between the Lieb-Cayley tree and an ensemble of one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, which maps topological edge states on one side of the chains to flat-band states localized in the bulk of the tree, furnishing the flat energy band with a topological stability. Similar mapping to topological edge states or to states bound to edge defects in one-dimensional chains is shown for flat-band states in all the considered tree decorations. We finally show that the persistence of exact flat bands on infinite decorated trees (i.e., Bethe lattices) arises naturally from a covering interpretation of tree graphs. Our findings reveal a rich landscape of flat-band and topological phenomena in non-Euclidean systems, where geometry alone can generate and stabilize unconventional quantum states.</description>

      <title>Orbital Accumulation Induced by Chiral Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate orbital accumulation driven by chiral phonons via orbital-dependent electron-lattice coupling. We derive a formula for the orbital accumulation induced by classical lattice dynamics or nonequilibrium phonons, using the Berry curvature, linear response theory, and the nonequilibrium Green's function method. We show that chiral phonons primarily couple to orbital quadrupole moments and that static orbital dipole accumulation can be generated in the second-order of lattice displacement. Our study provides a useful method for generating orbital accumulation without using spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <title>Impact of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman interaction on the subharmonic gap structure due to multiple Andreev reflections in nanoscopic Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple Andreev reflections in voltage-biased Josephson junctions give rise to the subharmonic gap structure in the conductance, which is widely used to characterize transport properties and estimate the induced gap in the junctions. Here we theoretically investigate the evolution of the subharmonic gap structure in spinful Josephson junctions. Spin mixing introduced by the spin-orbit coupling opens avoided crossings in the dispersion relation of the leads, which, as we demonstrate, subsequently results in pronounced multiple Andreev reflection features in the conductance traces. We analyze how these features evolve under an external magnetic field and explain that their visibility in conductance is governed by the spin polarization of the bands.</description>

      <title>Fokker-Planck approach for thermal fluctuations in antiferromagnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Fokker-Planck approach to describe the dynamics of staggered magnetization and thermal fluctuations in a two-dimensional antiferromagnetic system with uniaxial anisotropy. Beginning with a classical model for the antiferromagnetic system, we incorporate a Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation augmented by Langevin fields to account for thermal fluctuations, and we derive the Fokker-Planck equation governing the probability distribution function of the spin configuration. Employing the mean-field approximation, we derive the equations of motion for the spin polarization and the two-time spin-spin correlation functions. The methodology is applied to the study of spin-wave dynamics and to the formulation of a phenomenological model for resistance fluctuations in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Wiener-Hopf factorization and non-Hermitian topology for Amoeba formulation in one-dimensional multiband systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by the extensive localization of bulk modes at the boundaries, has attracted significant attention as a hallmark feature of non-Hermitian topology. This localization invalidates the conventional Bloch band theory, necessitating an analysis under open boundary conditions even in the thermodynamic limit. The Amoeba formulation addresses this challenge by computing the spectral potential rather than the spectrum itself. Based on the (strong) Szeg\"o limit theorem and its topological generalization, this approach reduces the evaluation of the potential to an optimization problem involving the Ronkin function. However, while the generalized Szeg\"o limit theorem is formally applicable in arbitrary dimensions, its implementation is limited to single-band systems, and its applicability to multiband systems remains unclear. In this paper, we establish the Wiener-Hopf factorization (WHF) of the non-Bloch Hamiltonian as a powerful framework, providing a unified and rigorous foundation for Amoeba analysis in multiband systems. By combining the WHF with Hermitian doubling, we first elucidate the applicability criteria for the generalized Szeg\"o limit theorem in multiband systems. We then show that the WHF provides the natural mathematical origin for the symmetry-decomposed Ronkin function in symmetry class AII$^\dagger$, leading to a rigorous proof of the generalized Szeg\"o limit theorem for these systems and opening a path toward systematic generalizations to other symmetry classes.</description>

      <title>Interlinking helical spin textures in nanopatterned chiral magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale topologically non-trivial magnetization configurations generate significant interest due to both the fundamental properties of their knotted structures and their potential applications in ultra-efficient computing devices. While such textures have been widely studied in two dimensions, three-dimensional (3D) systems can yield more complex configurations, resulting in richer topologies and dynamic behaviors. However, reliably nucleating these 3D textures has proven challenging, and so far, 3D configurations such as vortex rings and hopfions can often only be observed forming spontaneously in relatively uncontrolled manners. Here, we demonstrate that through the 3D nanopatterning of chiral single crystal helimagnets into nano-tori, the controlled formation of a magnetic double helix can be achieved. This surface-localized topological state is stabilized by the interplay of intrinsic exchange interactions of the single crystal with the extrinsic emergent effects of the patterned geometry. These double helices host magnetic defects akin to supercoiling in circular DNA and climbing vines. We expect this study to serve as a foundation for future research combining single crystal systems with 3D nanopatterning, offering a new degree of control over emergent phenomena in nanoscale magnets and wider quantum material systems.</description>

      <title>Relaxation to an Ideal Chern Band through Coupling to a Markovian Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a microscopic, weak-coupling mechanism by which generic Chern bands relax toward ideal bands. We consider coupling interacting electrons to a Caldeira-Leggett like Ohmic bosonic bath. Using the Born-Markov approximation, Slater determinant states of a Chern band under Hartree-Fock approximation evolve toward Slater determinant states corresponding to an ideal Chern band. We validate our proposal by performing numerical simulation of a massive Dirac model, showing that the Berry curvature and quantum metric indeed co-evolve to saturate the trace condition. Our proposal provides a concrete dissipative route to realize ideal Chern bands, a fundamental building block for the stabilization of fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>ARPES signatures of trions in van der Waals materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has recently emerged as a direct probe of excitonic correlations in two-dimensional semiconductors, resolving their dispersion and dynamics in energy-momentum space, including dark exciton states inaccessible to optical techniques. However, the ARPES fingerprint of charged excitons (trions), which plays a key role in all doped and gated 2D material systems, has remained unknown so far. We present a first theoretical analysis of trion signatures in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, highlighting how the additional charge carrier modifies the spectral position and shape relative to neutral excitons in ARPES spectra. Interestingly, we further predict that mass-imbalanced trions yield a characteristic double-peak structure, clearly separated in energy and line shape from neutral excitons. The predicted temperature dependence of these features offers guidance for experimental investigations aimed at identifying trionic states, thereby establishing a framework for ARPES studies of many-body Coulomb complexes in doped two-dimensional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of orbital torque: Dependence on ferromagnet species and nonmagnetic layer thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manipulation of magnetization in ferromagnetic metals (FMs) through orbital torque (OT) has emerged as a promising route for energy-efficient magnetic devices without relying on heavy metals. While Ti and Cu are among the most extensively studied light nonmagnetic metals (NMs) for OT devices, theoretical calculations of the resulting torque have remained limited. Here, we present a systematic and quantitative theoretical study of current-induced torques in Ti/FM and Cu/FM (FM = Co, Ni) bilayers using semi-realistic tight-binding models derived from ab initio electronic structures. We find that the torque in Ti/FM is larger for Ni than for Co, but this trend does not necessarily hold in Cu/FM, revealing that the FM dependence of OT is not universal but varies with the orbital current source. Moreover, the dependence of OT on NM thickness clearly indicates its NM bulk origin in both Ti- and Cu-based systems. Notwithstanding, the quantitative characteristics of OT cannot be explained by a simplified picture based on the individual bulk properties of the NM or FM layers. These results provide microscopic insight and practical guidance for designing light-metal-based orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>RF-Squad: A radiofrequency simulator for quantum dot arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spins in semiconductor quantum dots offer a scalable approach to quantum computing; however, precise control and efficient readout of large quantum dot arrays remain challenging, mainly due to the hyperdimensional voltage space required for tuning multiple gates per dot. To automate this process, large datasets are required for testing and training autotuning algorithms. To address the demand for such large datasets, we introduce RF-Squad, a physics-based simulator designed to realistically replicate radiofrequency (RF) reflectometry measurements of quantum dot arrays, with the ability to go beyond the Constant Interaction Model (CIM) and simulate physical phenomena such as tunnel coupling, tunnel rates, and quantum confinement. Implemented in JAX, an accelerated linear algebra library, RF-Squad achieves high computational speed, enabling the simulation of a 100x100 pixel charge stability diagram of a double quantum dot (DQD) in 52.1 $\pm$0.2 milliseconds at the CIM level. Using optimization algorithms, combined with it's layered architecture, RF-Squad allows users to balance physical accuracy with computational speed, scaling from simple to highly detailed models.</description>

      <title>STEM EBIC as a Quantitative Probe of Semiconductor Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron beam-induced current (EBIC) imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), STEM-EBIC, provides direct access to carrier transport at the nanoscale. While well established in bulk SEM geometries, its application to thin TEM lamellae remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a systematic STEM-EBIC study of silicon photodiode lamellae prepared by gallium and xenon focused ion beam (FIB) milling. We directly visualize the p-n junctions in thin cross sections and extract effective diffusion lengths for electrons and holes as a function of local thickness. The values are orders of magnitude smaller than those obtained by SEM-EBIC on bulk silicon, reflecting pronounced surface recombination and FIB-induced surface modifications. Current-voltage measurements further reveal severe deviations from the expected diode-like behavior, which we attribute to ohmic metal-semiconductor contacts in the emasurement setup. Our analysis establishes STEM-EBIC as a quantitative probe of carrier transport in nanoscale devices.</description>

      <title>Mastering Rheology: A Strategic and practical guide for empowering all users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rheology, the study of flow, plays a vital role in diverse industries such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and food. In this work, we provide a comprehensive introduction to fundamental rheological experiments and offer a strategic approach to understand the rheological behavior of any soft condensed material. We emphasize the importance of design of a good rheological experiment, input parameter and analysis of the obtained output parameter. Through the standard design of the experiment and systematic conduction of rheological experiments, we can estimate a broad range of rheological parameters such as viscosity, modulus, stability, yield stress, nonlinear behavior of the material. Furthermore, we also discuss methods for detecting and good practices for reducing some of the common experimental errors that may arise. We also present a comprehensive range of advanced rheological characterization techniques that can be pursued to gain deeper insights into the mechanical behavior and structural evolution of soft materials. Through this work, we attempt to make rheology more accessible to researchers from various domains to incorporate rheology into their characterization study and enable them to confidently navigate rheological studies and contribute to material development.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the nondemolition nature of a quantum measurement via an adaptive readout protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) requires non-invasive measurements for fault tolerant quantum computing. Deviations from ideal quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements can disturb the encoded information. To address this challenge, we develop a readout protocol for a $D-$dimensional system that, after a single positive outcome, switches to probing only the $D{-}1$ remaining subspace. This adaptive switching strategy minimizes measurement-induced errors by relying on negative-result measurement results that do not perturb the Hamiltonian. We apply the protocol on an 8-dimensional $^{123}{\rm Sb}$ nuclear qudit in silicon, and achieve an increase in the readout fidelity from $(98.93\pm0.07)\%$ to $(99.61\pm0.04)\%$, while reducing threefold the overall readout time. To highlight the broader relevance of measurement-induced errors, we study a 10-dimensional $^{73}{\rm Ge}$ nuclear spin read out through Pauli spin blockade, revealing nuclear spin flips arising from hyperfine and quadrupole interactions. These results unveil the effect of non-ideal QND readout across diverse platforms, and introduce an efficient readout protocol that can be implemented with minimal FPGA logic on existing hardware.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic structure of relaxor ferroelectrics from first principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We hybridize swap Monte Carlo and geometric relaxation to determine the intrinsic compositional structure (CS) of lead magnesium niobate (PMN) relaxor. We verify the stability of a Nb-rich sublattice in PMN, as prescribed by the prevailing random-site model. But ions in the complementary sublattice are not randomly mixed. The majority of Nb ions collapse into a dominant Nb cluster which percolates the lattice with a mesh-like geometry that prevents large space charges. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations predict a pair distribution function agreeing with neutron scattering experiments. Analysis of dipolar structures in the Nb cluster sheds light on the unique dielectric property of PMN.</description>

      <title>Ligand Engineering for Precise Control of Strongly-Confined CsPbI3 Nanoplatelet Superlattices for Efficient Light-Emitting Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly-confined perovskite nanoplatelets (PeNPLs) offer promising opportunities for photonics and optoelectronics due to their narrowband emission, control over the transition dipole moment, and potential for polarized light emission. However, achieving uniform PeNPLs and effective surface passivation major challenges, especially for red-emitting iodide-based compounds. Here, we address these challenges with an ancillary ligand engineering strategy. Combining experimental and ab-initio modelling techniques, we demonstrate that ligands possessing an optimal backbone with strong surface binding and Pb-coordination not only passivate defects, but also improve thickness uniformity. The PeNPLs self-assemble into superlattices a single emission peak, indicative of uniform monolayer formation and orientation-dependent optical properties. Uniform-monolayer PeNPLs obtained with benzylphosphonic acid (BPAc) self-assemble into well-ordered superlattices with orientation-dependent optical properties. Face-down PeNPL thin films fabricated with solvent engineering exhibit Lambertian-like emission suitable for light-emitting devices, while edge-up oriented films exhibit linearly polarized emission. When integrated into light-emitting diodes, our PeNPL devices achieve a external quantum efficiency of 13.1%, the highest reported for strongly-confined PeNPL-based devices. Taken together, these results establish ancillary ligand-induced synthesis of uniform-monolayer PeNPLs as a decisive route to robust orientation control, positioning it as the central principle for advancing next-generation photonic and display technologies.</description>

      <title>Perovskite Nanocrystals as Emerging Single-Photon Emitters: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) have emerged as leading candidates for next-generation quantum emitters, offering a unique combination of high photoluminescence quantum yield, tunable emission, short radiative lifetimes, and record-high single-photon purity under ambient conditions. These properties, together with low-cost and scalable solution-phase fabrication, position PNCs as attractive alternatives to traditional epitaxial and colloidal quantum dots. In this Review, we outline the physical parameters that define quantum emission in PNCs, compare their performance to other established and emerging quantum emitters, and assess the key figures of merit, including photostability, single-photon purity, and photon indistinguishability, required for practical quantum applications. We discuss underlying mechanisms affecting PNC emission behavior and highlight recent advances in improving their quantum emitting properties through synthetic and photonic engineering approaches. While challenges related to environmental stability and photon indistinguishability remain, emerging strategies, such as surface passivation, metal ion doping, and coupling with electromagnetic nano- and micro-cavities, are steadily closing the gap between PNCs and ideal quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Lattice Resonances in Periodic Arrays of Time-Modulated Scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice resonances are collective optical modes supported by periodic arrays of scatterers, arising from their coherent interaction enabled by the underlying periodicity. Owing to their collective nature, these resonances produce optical responses that are both stronger and spectrally narrower than those of individual scatterers. While such phenomena have been extensively studied in conventional time-invariant systems, recent advances in time-varying photonics present new opportunities to exploit and enhance the extraordinary characteristics of these collective modes. Here, we investigate lattice resonances in periodic arrays of time-modulated scatterers using a simple framework based on the dipolar approximation and time-Floquet theory, where each scatterer is modeled as a harmonic oscillator with periodically varying optical properties. We begin by analyzing the response of an individual scatterer, leveraging our model to identify the complex eigenfrequencies that define its dynamics. We show that, for the appropriate modulation amplitude and frequency, the imaginary part of one of these eigenfrequencies vanishes, leading to amplification. Building on this, we extend our analysis to a periodic array to investigate the effect of the interplay between temporal modulation and lattice resonances. In contrast to isolated scatterers, the collective nature of lattice resonances introduces a markedly more intricate spectral dependence of the amplification regime. Notably, this amplification emerges at substantially lower modulation strengths, facilitated by the enhanced light-matter interaction and increased lifetime provided by these collective resonances. Our work establishes a simple theoretical framework for understanding collective lattice resonances in time-modulated arrays, enabling dynamic control and amplification of these modes.</description>

      <title>Collective Enhancement of Photon Blockade via Two-Photon Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analogous to Coulomb blockade for electrons, photon blockade is a key quantum optical effect in which the presence of one photon prevents the transmission of subsequent ones through a nonlinear medium. Beyond its fundamental interest, photon and multi-photon blockade are actively studied as mechanisms for generating technologically-relevant quantum states of light. Although photon blockade typically requires achieving strong light-matter coupling, increasing the number of atoms fails to enhance antibunching. Here, we analyze the optical transmission properties of a quantum resonator that embeds a two-photon-coupled ensemble of emitters, combining an approximate analytical approach with full quantum numerical simulations. We show that when light and matter are coupled via a two-photon interaction, both single- and multi-photon blockade can benefit from a collective enhancement. We propose different driving schemes in which the second or third-order correlation functions are strongly suppressed with increasing atom number. Differently from established methods, this collective enhancement of non-classical properties occurs with unitary transmission and is ultimately constrained only by decoherence. This demonstrates that collective two-photon couplings are a powerful mechanism for realizing photon blockade even in platforms where individual strong coupling is not achievable.</description>

      <title>Vector magnetometry using cavity-enhanced microwave readout in nitrogen-vacancy diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate $4\pi$-steradian vector magnetic field sensing using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in a single-crystal diamond coupled to a microwave (MW) cavity. The MW cavity enhances the spin-photon coupling which enables efficient, high-contrast spin-state readout via MW interrogation and removes the need for bulky optical collection components. An applied AC bias magnetic field lifts the zero-field degeneracy of the four crystallographic NV orientations, allowing each orientation to be individually addressed and used for vector reconstruction of the magnetic field. The resulting magnetometer has a 40\% contrast (20x higher than typical for optical spin-ensemble readout) and achieves a single-axis sensitivity of 250 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ which is flat from DC to 1 kHz. Noise models of the composite spin-cavity system establish MW amplitude noise as the dominant noise source and predict a thermal noise limit of 2 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$.</description>

Abstract: The displacement of a single electron enables exciting avenues for nanotechnology with vast application potential in quantum metrology, quantum communication and quantum computation. Surface acoustic waves (SAW) have proven itself as a surprisingly useful solution to perform this task over large distance with outstanding precision and reliability. Over the last decade, important milestones have been achieved bringing SAW-driven single-electron transport from first proof-of-principle demonstrations to accurate, highly-controlled implementations, such as coherent spin transport, charge-to-photon conversion, or antibunching of charge states. Beyond the well-established piezoelectric gallium-arsenide platform, first realisations of acousto-electronic transport have also been carried out on the surface of liquid helium that promises unique stability and coherence. In this review article, we aim to keep track of this remarkable progress in SAW-driven transport of electron qubits by explaining these recent achievements from basic principles, with an outlook on follow-up experiments and near-term applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Doping-induced superconductivity in group IV elements may enable quantum functionalities in material systems accessible with well-established semiconductor technologies. Non-equilibrium hyperdoping of group III atoms into C, Si, or Ge can yield superconductivity; however, its origin is obscured by structural disorder and dopant clustering. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of hyperdoped Ga:Ge films and trilayer heterostructures by molecular beam epitaxy with extreme hole concentrations ($n_\textup{h} = 4.15 \times 10^{21}$~cm$^{-3}$, ~17.9\% Ga substitution) that yield superconductivity with a critical temperature of $T_{\textup{c}} = 3.5$~K and an out-of-plane critical field of 1~T at 270~mK. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption and scattering methods reveal that Ga dopants are substitutionally incorporated within the Ge lattice, introducing a tetragonal distortion to the crystal unit cell. Our findings, corroborated by first-principles calculations, suggest that the structural order of Ga dopants creates a narrow band for the emergence of superconductivity in Ge, establishing hyperdoped Ga:Ge as a low-disorder, epitaxial superconductor-semiconductor platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The manipulation of skyrmions by surface acoustic waves (SAW) has garnered significant interest in the field of spintronic devices. Previous studies established that skyrmions can be generated and moved by strain pulses. In this study, we propose that sawtooth-SAWs can be used to drive a ratchet motion of magnetic skyrmions in the presence of pinning centers. This results in a net motion of the skyrmions orthogonal to the continuously applied SAW. The ratchet motion is fundamentally caused by non-vanishing pinning, so that a certain strain gradient magnitude is required to overcome pinning and start skyrmion motion. We demonstrate the feasibility of our concept by micromagnetic simulations and analytical model calculations.</description>

Abstract: Heterostructures of superconductors and quantum-Hall insulators are promising platforms of topological quantum computation. However, these two systems are incompatible in some aspects such as a strong magnetic field, the Meissner effect, and chirality. In this work, we address the condition that the superconducting proximity effect works in the bulk of quantum Hall states, and identify an essential role played by the vortex lattice regardless of pairing symmetry. We extend this finding to a heterostructure of a chiral $p$-wave superconductor in the mixed state and an integer quantum Hall insulator. The proximity effect works selectively in the lowest Landau level depending on relative chiralities. If the chiralities align, a topological phase transition to a topological superconductor occurs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitons dominate the optical response of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors. Strong interactions produce peculiar excitonic complexes, which provide a testing ground for exciton and quantum many-body theories. Here, we report a hitherto unobserved many-body exciton that emerges upon filling both the K and Q valleys of WSe$_2$. We optically probe the exciton landscape using charge-tunable devices with unusually thin dielectrics that facilitate doping up to several $10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. We observe the emergence of the thermodynamically stable complex when 10 valleys are electrostatically filled. We gain insight into its physics using magneto-optical measurements. Our results are well-described by a model where the number of distinguishable Fermi seas interacting with the photoexcited electron-hole pair defines the complex's behavior. In addition to expanding the repertoire of excitons in 2D semiconductors, this complex could probe the limit of exciton models and answer open questions about screened Coulomb interactions in 2D semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Giant Response and Harmonic Generation in N\'eel-Torque Antiferromagnetic Resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the resonant and higher order magnetic responses of a collinear antiferromagnet induced by N\'eel spin-orbit torques (NSOTs). By deriving the dynamical susceptibilities up to the third harmonic, we find remarkable NSOT-induced amplifications of the linear and nonlinear magnetic dynamics by orders of magnitude compared to conventional spin-orbit torques, enabling highly-efficient frequency conversion in the terahertz frequency range. From the effective dynamics, we uncover the strong coupling between the N\'eel vector and the driving field of NSOTs, providing a physical explanation of the gigantic responses at all orders. We then propose a multilayer antiferromagnetic nano-device leveraging the gigantic harmonic generation to achieve unprecedented frequency amplifiers and converters. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked role of the NSOTs in nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional Dirac fermions in a one-dimensional mass superlattice under a perpendicular magnetic field. Using exact solutions for isolated and finite arrays of domain walls, we demonstrate the persistence of Jackiw-Rebbi modes with a field-dependent renormalized velocity. For the periodic case, we adopt a gauge-invariant projection method onto magnetic Bloch states, valid for arbitrary fields and mass profiles, which yields dispersive Landau levels, and confirm its accuracy by comparison with finite arrays spectra. From the miniband spectra we predict modified quantum Hall plateaus and Weiss-like magnetoconductivity oscillations, characterized by a strongly reduced amplitude and a $\pi/2$ phase shift compared to electrostatic superlattices.</description>

      <title>Electric field induced Berry curvature dipole and non-linear anomalous Hall effects in higher wave symmetric unconventional magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the second-order anomalous Hall response in two-dimensional higher-wave symmetric magnets, including the recently discovered class of collinear magnets known as altermagnets, when subjected to a symmetry-breaking external electric field. In these systems, the first- and second-order anomalous Hall responses mediated by the first- and second-order multipoles of the Berry curvature over the occupied states vanish by symmetry. However, a symmetry-breaking dc electric field can induce a nonzero Berry curvature dipole by coupling to a non-vanishing quantum metric, also known as the Berry connection polarizability. An applied ac electric field can then generate a finite nonlinear transverse Hall effect characterized by a second harmonic response. In addition, the dc field itself can generate a finite third-order transverse Hall response. We discuss this remarkable effect in a class of higher-order symmetric unconventional magnets (of $p$, $d$, $f$, $g$, $i$ symmetry), including the subclass of altermagnets. We demonstrate that the electric-field-induced anomalous Hall effect in the higher-wave-symmetric magnets can serve not only as a probe of the underlying quantum metric of the occupied states but also as a means to distinguish the even ($d$-,$g$-wave) and odd ($p$-wave) order parameter symmetries defined on the square lattice.</description>

Abstract: Topological chiral crystals have emerged as a fertile material platform for investigating optical phenomena derived from the distinctive Fermi surface Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment textures around multifold chiral band crossings pinned at the time-reversal invariant momenta. In this work, by means of tight-binding model and first principles based calculations, we investigate metallic electro-optic (EO) responses stemming from the Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment of Bloch electrons across 37 materials belonging to space group 198 (SG198). Previously thought to vanish in SG198, our findings reveal a nonzero Berry curvature dipole attributed to the energetic misalignment between topologically charged point nodes of opposite chirality. Moreover, we find that the recently predicted magnetoelectric EO effects, which arise from the interplay between the Berry curvature and magnetic moment on the Fermi surface, are readily accessible in BeAu under experimentally feasible electric biases.</description>

      <title>Visualizing interaction-driven restructuring of quantum Hall edge states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many topological phases host gapless boundary modes that can be dramatically modified by electronic interactions. Even for the long-studied edge modes of quantum Hall phases, forming at the boundaries of two-dimensional (2D) electron systems, the nature of such interaction-induced changes has been elusive. Despite advances made using local probes, key experimental challenges persist: the lack of direct information about the internal structure of edge states on microscopic scales, and complications from edge disorder. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to image pristine electrostatically defined quantum Hall edge states in graphene with high spatial resolution and demonstrate how correlations dictate the structures of edge channels on both magnetic and atomic length scales. For integer quantum Hall states in the zeroth Landau level, we show that interactions renormalize the edge velocity, dictate the spatial profile for copropagating modes, and induce unexpected edge valley polarization that differ from those of the bulk. While some of our findings can be understood by mean-field theory, others show breakdown of this picture, highlighting the roles of edge fluctuations and inter-channel couplings. We also extend our measurements to spatially resolve the edge state of fractional quantum Hall phases and detect spectroscopic signatures of interactions in this chiral Luttinger liquid. Our study establishes STM as a promising tool for exploring edge physics of the rapidly expanding 2D topological phases, including newly realized fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Observation of Long-Lifetime Magnon Pairs by Fano Resonance of Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01667v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mode fluctuations with a long lifetime are essential for quantum information and logic operations in magnonic devices. We probe the broadband nonlinear magnetization dynamics of a high-quality ferromagnet under a strong microwave drive using microwave spectroscopy. We observe an \textit{unexpected} Fano resonance in the microwave transmission when the driven amplitude of the magnetization is large and the drive frequency $\omega_d$ is close to but not at the ferromagnetic resonance. We interpret this Fano resonance by a scattering theory of photons considering the three-magnon interaction between the Kittel magnon and magnon pairs with opposite wave vectors of frequency $\omega_d/2$. The theoretical model suggests that the microwave spectroscopy measures the dynamics of the fluctuation $\delta \hat{\alpha}$ of the Kittel magnon and $\delta\hat{\beta}_{\pm k}$ of the magnon pairs over the driven steady states, which are coupled coherently by the steady-state amplitudes. With the damping of $\delta\hat{\beta}_{\pm k}$ much smaller than that of $\delta \hat{\alpha}$, the theoretical calculation well reproduces the observed Fano resonance, indicating the magnon pairs hold a recorded long lifetime.</description>

      <title>A Depinning Model for Josephson Junction Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building more powerful quantum computers requires manufacturing processes with tight tolerances. To improve the tolerances on Josephson junctions, techniques to fine tune their properties after fabrication have been developed. Understanding how tuning techniques may physically modify the tunnel barrier of a Josephson junction is important and will enable these techniques to be optimised. We develop a model of junction tuning based on depinning theory to interpret a phase diagram of tuning rate. We extract the dependence on temperature, time-varying voltages and oscillation frequency. Using depinning theory we are able to show both why time-varying annealing potentials result in controlled junction tuning and how such protocols can be optimised. We examine how tuning changes the electrical breakdown of barriers and discrepancies between modeled and measured higher energy levels of transmon qubits.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition of Topological Index driven by Dephasing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study topological insulators under dephasing noise. With examples of both a $2d$ Chern insulator and a $3d$ topological insulator protected by time-reversal symmetry, we demonstrate that there is a phase transition at finite dephasing strength between phases with nontrivial and trivial topological indices. Here the topological index is defined through the correlation matrix. The transition can be diagnosed through the spectrum of the whole correlation matrix or of a local subsystem. Interestingly, even if the topological insulator is very close to the topological-trivial critical point in its Hamiltonian, it still takes finite strength of dephasing to change the topological index, suggesting the robustness of topological insulators under dephasing. We further consider Chern insulators in the presence of real-space disorder, which exhibit a ground-state transition between topological and Anderson insulating phases. We find that even strongly-disordered Chern insulators, close to the critical disorder strength, exhibit robustness with respect to dephasing.</description>

      <title>Nickel Doping Unlocks Ambient-condition Photostability in Individual Cesium Lead Bromide Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>

Abstract: Developing efficient single-photon sources is fundamental to advancing photonic quantum technologies. In particular, achieving scalable, cost-effective, stable, high-rate, and high-purity single-photon emission at ambient conditions is paramount for free-space quantum communication. However, fulfilling all the requirements simultaneously under ambient conditions has remained a significant challenge. Here, the scalable, cost-effective ambient condition synthesis of nickel doped (Ni doped) CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (NPQDs) is presented using a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) method. The resulting individual NPQDs demonstrate remarkable photostability, sustaining their performance for over 10 minutes under ambient conditions with environment humidity of ~55%, and exhibit exceptional single-photon purity (&gt;99%) with a narrow emission linewidth (~70 meV). The remarkable photostability could be attributed to the spatial localization of exciton by Ni atoms on the surface of the nanocrystal, reducing its interaction with the environment. Our results demonstrated that NPQDs with outstanding combinations of quantum emitting properties can be both synthesized and operated at ambient conditions. These findings mark a significant step toward scalable, cost-effective quantum light sources for real-world applications, paving the way for robust quantum communication systems and devices.</description>

      <title>A superinductor in a deep sub-micron integrated circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13202v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superinductors are circuit elements characterised by an intrinsic impedance in excess of the superconducting resistance quantum ($R_\text{Q}\approx6.45~$k$\Omega$), with applications from metrology and sensing to quantum computing. However, they are typically obtained using exotic materials with high density inductance such as Josephson junctions, superconducting nanowires or twisted two-dimensional materials. Here, we present a superinductor realised within a silicon integrated circuit (IC), exploiting the high kinetic inductance ($\sim 1$~nH/$\square$) of TiN thin films native to the manufacturing process (22-nm FDSOI). By interfacing the superinductor to a silicon quantum dot formed within the same IC, we demonstrate a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rfSET), the most widely used sensor in semiconductor-based quantum computers. The integrated nature of the rfSET reduces its parasitics which, together with the high impedance, yields a sensitivity improvement of more than two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art, combined with a 10,000-fold area reduction. Beyond providing the basis for dense arrays of integrated and high-performance qubit sensors, the realization of high-kinetic-inductance superconducting devices integrated within modern silicon ICs opens many opportunities, including kinetic-inductance detector arrays for astronomy and the study of metamaterials and quantum simulators based on 1D and 2D resonator arrays.</description>

      <title>Sliding Ferroelectric Metal with Ferrimagnetism</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) sliding ferroelectric (FE) metals with ferrimagnetism represent a previously unexplored class of spintronic materials, featuring out-of-plane FE polarization, metallic conductivity, and a finite net magnetization, which together enable electrically tunable spintronic functionalities via FE switching. Here, based on antiferromagnetic (AFM) metallic bilayers, we propose a general strategy for constructing 2D sliding FE ferrimagnetic (FiM) metals that can achieve triply-coupled switching, in which the FE polarization, spin splitting, and net magnetization are reversed simultaneously through FE switching. As a prototypical realization, we design a bilayer sliding FE metal with FiM order, derived from monolayer Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ -- a van der Waals metal with intrinsic ferromagnetic order close to room temperature. The system exhibits a FE transition from a nonpolar (NP) AFM phase to a FE FiM phase via interlayer sliding. The in-plane mirror symmetry breaking in FE metallic states lifts the nonrelativistic spin degeneracy that exists in the NP phase, leading to a sizable net magnetic moment. Furthermore, the interplay between metallicity, ferroelectricity, and ferrimagnetism gives rise to pronounced sign-reversible transport responses near the Fermi level, all of which can be electrically controlled by FE switching. Our results establish sliding FE metals with FiM as a promising platform for electrically reconfigurable, high-speed, and low-dissipation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Interferometric Braiding of Anyons in Chern Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent control and braiding of anyons remain central challenges in realizing topologically protected quantum operations. We propose a Ramsey interferometry protocol to directly access the geometric phases associated with anyons in fractional Chern insulators. Our approach employs impurities with individually addressable internal states that bind to the anyons, allowing their adiabatic motion and exchange under full spatial control. By combining Ramsey and spin-echo sequences using one and two impurities, the protocol gives independent access to the Aharonov-Bohm and exchange contributions to the total geometric phase, thereby providing an unambiguous probe of anyonic statistics. Our scheme can potentially be implemented in cold-atom quantum simulators as well as in van der Waals heterostructures. Complementary finite-size simulations in non-interacting Chern insulators quantify the system sizes required to faithfully extract geometric phases, highlighting the role of edge effects. Our results establish impurity-based interferometry as a feasible route toward direct anyon braiding experiments in quantum simulators and lay the groundwork for future explorations of non-Abelian braiding and topological quantum control.</description>
