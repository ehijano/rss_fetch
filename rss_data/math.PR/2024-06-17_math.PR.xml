      <title>Differentiability of limit shapes in continuous first passage percolation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a class of abstract continuous action minimization problems that generalize continuous first and last passage percolation. In this class of models a limit shape exists. Our main result provides a framework under which that limit shape can be shown to be differentiable. We then describe examples of continuous first passage percolation models that fit into this framework. The first example is of a family of Riemannian first passage percolation models and the second is a discrete time model based on Poissonian points.</description>

      <title>The giant component of excursions sets of spherical Gaussian ensembles: existence, uniqueness, and volume concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence and uniqueness of a well-concentrated giant component in the supercritical excursion sets of three important ensembles of spherical Gaussian random fields: Kostlan's ensemble, band-limited ensembles, and the random spherical harmonics. Our main results prescribe quantitative bounds for the volume fluctuations of the giant that are essentially optimal for non-monochromatic ensembles, and suboptimal but still strong for monochromatic ensembles.
  Our results support the emerging picture that giant components in Gaussian random field excursion sets have similar large-scale statistical properties to giant components in supercritical Bernoulli percolation. The proofs employ novel decoupling inequalities for spherical ensembles which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Finding pure Nash equilibria in large random games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Best Response Dynamics (BRD) is a class of strategy updating rules to find Pure Nash Equilibria (PNE) in a game. At each step, a player is randomly picked and they switches to a "best response" strategy based on the strategies chosen by others, so that the new strategy profile maximises their payoff. If no such strategy exists, a different player will be chosen randomly. When no player wants to change their strategy anymore, the process reaches a PNE and will not deviate from it. On the other hand, either PNE could not exist, or BRD could be "trapped" within a subgame that has no PNE. We prove that BRD typically converges to PNE when the game has $N$ players, each having two actions. Our results are more general and are described as follows. We study a class of random walks in a random medium on the $N$-dimensional hypercube. The medium is determined by a random game with $N$ players, each with two actions available, and i.i.d. payoffs. The medium contains obstacles that can be of two types. The first type is composed of the PNE of the game, while the other obstacles are known in the literature as traps or sink equilibria. The class of processes we analyze includes BRD, simple random walks on the hypercube, and many other nearest neighbour processes. We prove that, with high probability, these processes reach a PNE before hitting any trap.</description>

      <title>On the existence of Markovian randomized equilibria in Dynkin games of war-of-attrition-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In optimal stopping problems, a Markov structure guarantees Markovian optimal stopping times (first exit times). Surprisingly, there is no analogous result for Markovian stopping games once randomization is required. This paper addresses this gap by proving the existence of Markov-perfect equilibria in a specific type of stopping game - a general nonzero-sum Dynkin games of the war-of-attrition type with underlying linear diffusions. Our main mathematical contribution lies in the development of appropriate topologies for Markovian randomized stopping times. This allows us to establish the existence of equilibria within a tractable and interpretable class of stopping times, paving the way for further analysis of Markovian stopping games.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for the largest singular value of sparse non-Hermitian matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a large deviation principle for the largest singular value of sparse non-Hermitian random matrices, or directed Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks in the constant average degree regime $p =\frac{d}{n}$ where $d$ is fixed. Entries are assumed to have Weibull distributions with tail decaying at rate $e^{-t^{\alpha}}$ for $\alpha &gt;0$. While the law of large number results agree with the largest eigenvalue of sparse Hermitian matrices given in (Ganguly and Nam, '22) and (Ganguly, Hiesmayr and Nam, '22), large deviation results are surprisingly simpler, exhibiting a single transition at $\alpha =2$. The rate function for undirected networks with $0&lt;\alpha \leq 2$ involved a transition at $\alpha =1$ and a complicated variational formula due to the emergence of cliques with large edge-weights \cite{ghn22}. For directed networks, we introduce a clique reduction technique which reformulates the problem for undirected networks with maximum clique size $2$, and the rate function is greatly simplified. For $\alpha &gt;2$, both the law of large numbers and large deviation results are identical to the sparse Hermitian case. Our results easily generalize to rectangular i.i.d. ensembles.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of some strongly critical decomposable 3-type Galton-Watson processes with immigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of a critical decomposable 3-type Galton-Watson process with immigration when its offspring mean matrix is triangular with diagonal entries 1. It is proved that, under second or fourth order moment assumptions on the offspring and immigration distributions, a sequence of appropriately scaled random step processes formed from such a Galton-Watson process converges weakly. The limit process can be described using independent squared Bessel processes $(\mathcal{X}_{t,1})_{t\geq0}$, $(\mathcal{X}_{t,2})_{t\geq0}$, and $(\mathcal{X}_{t,3})_{t\geq0}$, the linear combinations of the integral processes of $(\mathcal{X}_{t,1})_{t\geq0}$ and $(\mathcal{X}_{t,2})_{t\geq0}$, and possibly the 2-fold iterated integral process of $(\mathcal{X}_{t,1})_{t\geq0}$. The presence of the 2-fold iterated integral process in the limit distribution is a new phenomenon in the description of asymptotic behavior of critical multi-type Galton-Watson processes with immigration. Our results complete and extend some results of Foster and Ney (1978) for some strongly critical decomposable 3-type Galton-Watson processes with immigration.</description>

      <title>Occupation times and areas derived from random sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the occupation area of spherical (fractional) Brownian motion, i.e. the area where the process is positive, and show that it is uniformly distributed. For the proof, we introduce a new simple combinatorial view on occupation times of stochastic processes that turns out to be surprisingly effective. A sampling method is used to relate the moments of occupation times to persistence probabilities of random walks that again relate to combinatorial factors in the moments of beta distributions. Our approach also yields a new and completely elementary proof of L\'evy's second arcsine law for Brownian motion. Further, combined with Spitzer's formula and the use of Bell polynomials, we give a characterisation of the distribution of the occupation times for all L\'evy processes.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian expander obtained with Haar distributed unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a random quantum channel obtained by taking a selection of $d$ independent and Haar distributed $N$ dimensional unitaries. We follow the argument of Hastings to bound the spectral gap in terms of eigenvalues and adapt it to give an exact estimate of the spectral gap in terms of singular values \cite{hastings2007random,harrow2007quantum}. This shows that we have constructed a random quantum expander in terms of both singular values and eigenvalues. The lower bound is an analog of the Alon-Boppana bound for $d$-regular graphs. The upper bound is obtained using Schwinger-Dyson equations.</description>

      <title>On Optimal Server Allocation for Moldable Jobs with Concave Speed-Up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large proportion of jobs submitted to modern computing clusters and data centers are parallelizable and capable of running on a flexible number of computing cores or servers. Although allocating more servers to such a job results in a higher speed-up in the job's execution, it reduces the number of servers available to other jobs, which in the worst case, can result in an incoming job not finding any available server to run immediately upon arrival. Hence, a key question to address is: how to optimally allocate servers to jobs such that (i) the average execution time across jobs is minimized and (ii) almost all jobs find at least one server immediately upon arrival. To address this question, we consider a system with $n$ servers, where jobs are parallelizable up to $d^{(n)}$ servers and the speed-up function of jobs is concave and increasing. Jobs not finding any available servers upon entry are blocked and lost. We propose a simple server allocation scheme that achieves the minimum average execution time of accepted jobs while ensuring that the blocking probability of jobs vanishes as the system becomes large ($n \to \infty$). This result is established for various traffic conditions as well as for heterogeneous workloads. To prove our result, we employ Stein's method which also yields non-asymptotic bounds on the blocking probability and the mean execution time. Furthermore, our simulations show that the performance of the scheme is insensitive to the distribution of job execution times.</description>

      <title>New algorithms for sampling and diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing from the theory of stochastic differential equations, we introduce a novel sampling method for known distributions and a new algorithm for diffusion generative models with unknown distributions. Our approach is inspired by the concept of the reverse diffusion process, widely adopted in diffusion generative models. Additionally, we derive the explicit convergence rate based on the smooth ODE flow. For diffusion generative models and sampling, we establish a {\it dimension-free} particle approximation convergence result. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, unlike the traditional Langevin method, our sampling method does not require any regularity assumptions about the density function of the target distribution. Furthermore, we also apply our method to optimization problems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, our main aim is to investigate the strong convergence for a McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation with super-linear delay driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent $H\in(1/2, 1)$. After giving uniqueness and existence for the exact solution, we analyze the properties including boundedness of moment and propagation of chaos. Besides, we give the Euler-Maruyama (EM) scheme and show that the numerical solution converges strongly to the exact solution. Furthermore, a corresponding numerical example is given to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>On Bourgain's approach to stochastic homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2018, Bourgain pioneered a novel perturbative harmonic-analytic approach to the stochastic homogenization theory of discrete elliptic equations with weakly random i.i.d. coefficients. The approach was subsequently refined to show that homogenized approximations of ensemble averages can be derived to a precision four times better than almost sure homogenized approximations, which was unexpected by the state-of-the-art homogenization theory. In this paper, we grow this budding theory in various directions: First, we prove that the approach is robust by extending it to the continuum setting with exponentially mixing random coefficients. Second, we give a new proof via Malliavin calculus in the case of Gaussian coefficients, which avoids the main technicality of Bourgain's original approach. This new proof also applies to strong Gaussian correlations with power-law decay. Third, we extend Bourgain's approach to the study of fluctuations by constructing weak correctors up to order $2d$, which also clarifies the link between Bourgain's approach and the standard corrector approach to homogenization. Finally, we draw several consequences from those different results, both for quantitative homogenization of ensemble averages and for asymptotic expansions of the annealed Green's function.</description>

      <title>Computation of Robust Option Prices via Structured Multi-Marginal Martingale Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient computational framework for solving a class of multi-marginal martingale optimal transport problems, which includes many robust pricing problems of large financial interest. Such problems are typically computationally challenging due to the martingale constraint, however, by extending the state space we can identify them with problems that exhibit a certain sequential martingale structure. Our method exploits such structures in combination with entropic regularisation, enabling fast computation of optimal solutions and allowing us to solve problems with a large number of marginals. We demonstrate the method by using it for computing robust price bounds for different options, such as lookback options and Asian options.</description>

Abstract: We examine under which conditions the canonical heat flow on glued manifolds is ergodic and irreducible. Glued manifolds are spaces consisting of manifolds of varying dimension connected by a weakly doubling measure. Moreover, we construct a non-local perimeter functional, the heat excess, to raise the question of its ${\Gamma}$-convergence to the standard perimeter functional. In this context, we connect our work to the previous work on the convergence of perimeter functionals, approximations, and existence of heat kernels, as well as short-time expansions of Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic loops in the loop O(n) model via the XOR trick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.11977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The loop $O(n)$ model is a family of probability measures on collections of non-intersecting loops on the hexagonal lattice, parameterized by a loop-weight $n$ and an edge-weight $x$. Nienhuis predicts that, for $0 \leq n \leq 2$, the model exhibits two regimes separated by $x_c(n) = 1/\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2-n}}$: when $x &lt; x_c(n)$, the loop lengths have exponential tails, while, when $x \geq x_c(n)$, the loops are macroscopic.
  In this paper, we prove three results regarding the existence of long loops in the loop $O(n)$ model:
  - In the regime $(n,x) \in [1,1+\delta) \times (1- \delta, 1]$ with $\delta &gt;0$ small, a configuration sampled from a translation-invariant Gibbs measure will either contain an infinite path or have infinitely many loops surrounding every face. In the subregime $n \in [1,1+\delta)$ and $x \in (1-\delta,1/\sqrt{n}]$ our results further imply Russo--Seymour--Welsh theory. This is the first proof of the existence of macroscopic loops in a positive area subset of the phase diagram.
  - Existence of loops whose diameter is comparable to that of a finite domain whenever $n=1, x \in (1,\sqrt{3}]$; this regime is equivalent to part of the antiferromagnetic regime of the Ising model on the triangular lattice.
  - Existence of non-contractible loops on a torus when $n \in [1,2], x=1$.
  The main ingredients of the proof are: (i) the `XOR trick': if $\omega$ is a collection of short loops and $\Gamma$ is a long loop, then the symmetric difference of $\omega$ and $\Gamma$ necessarily includes a long loop as well; (ii) a reduction of the problem of finding long loops to proving that a percolation process on an auxiliary planar graph, built using the Chayes--Machta and Edwards--Sokal geometric expansions, has no infinite connected components; and (iii) a recent result on the percolation threshold of Benjamini--Schramm limits of planar graphs.</description>

Abstract: We prove a convergence result for a large class of random models that encompasses the case of the BPHZ models used in the study of singular stochastic PDEs. We introduce for that purpose a useful variation on the notion of regularity structure called a regularity-integrability structure. It allows to deal in a single elementary setting with models on a usual regularity structure and their first order Malliavin derivative.</description>

      <title>A large deviation principle for the normalized excursion of $\alpha$-stable L\'evy processes without negative jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a large deviation principle for the normalized excursion and bridge of an $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process without negative jumps, with $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$. Based on this, we derive precise asymptotics for the tail distributions of functionals of the normalized excursion and bridge, in particular, the area and maximum functionals. We advocate the use of the Skorokhod M1 topology, rather than the more usual J1 topology, as we believe it is better suited to large deviation principles for L\'evy processes in general.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of Bivariate Lack-of-Memory Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an extension of the standard strong and weak lack-of-memory properties. We say that the survival function $\bar{F}$ of the vector $(X,Y)$ satisfies pseudo lack-of-memory property in strong version if \begin{equation} \label{strong}\bar F_{X,Y}(s_1+t_1,s_2+t_2)=\bar F_{X,Y}(s_1,s_2)\otimes_h\bar F_{X,Y}(t_1,t_2), \ t_1,t_2,s_1,s_2 \geq 0 \end{equation} and in weak version if \begin{equation}\label{weak}\bar F_{X,Y}(s_1+t,s_2+t)=\bar F_{X,Y}(s_1,s_2)\otimes_h\bar F_{X,Y}(t,t), \ s_1,s_2,t \geq 0\end{equation} with $a\otimes_hb=h\left (h^{-1}(a)\cdot h^{-1}(b)\right )$, where $h$ is an increasing bijection of $[0,1]$, called generator. After finding sufficient conditions under which the solutions of the above functional equations are bivariate survival functions, we focus on distributions satisfying the latter: we study specific properties in comparison with standard lack-of-memory property and we give a characterization in terms of the random variables $\min(X,Y)$ and $ X -Y$. Finally, we investigate the induced dependence structure, determining their singularity in full generality and studying the upper and lower dependence coefficients for some specific choices of the marginal survival functions and of the generator $h$.</description>

      <title>Disorder Chaos in Short-Range, Diluted, and L\'evy Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough [arXiv:2301.04112], Chatterjee proved site disorder chaos in the Edwards-Anderson (EA) short-range spin glass model utilizing the Hermite spectral method. In this paper, we demonstrate the further usefulness of this Hermite spectral approach by extending the validity of site disorder chaos in three related spin glass models.
  The first, called the mixed even $p$-spin short-range model, is a generalization of the EA model where the underlying graph is a deterministic bounded degree hypergraph consisting of hyperedges with even number of vertices. The second model is the diluted mixed $p$-spin model, which is allowed to have hyperedges with both odd and even number of vertices. For both models, our results hold under general symmetric disorder distributions. The main novelty of our argument is played by an elementary algebraic equation for the Fourier-Hermite series coefficients for the two-spin correlation functions. It allows us to deduce necessary geometric conditions to determine the contributing coefficients in the overlap function, which in spirit is the same as the crucial Lemma 1 in [arXiv:2301.04112]. Finally, we also establish disorder chaos in the L\'evy model with stable index $\alpha \in (1, 2)$.</description>

      <title>Existence and asymptotic autonomous robustness of random attractors for three-dimensional stochastic globally modified Navier-Stokes equations on unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we discuss the existence and asymptotically autonomous robustness (AAR) (almost surely) of random attractors for 3D stochastic globally modified Navier-Stokes equations (SGMNSE) on Poincar\'e domains (which may be bounded or unbounded). Our aim is to investigate the existence and AAR of random attractors for 3D SGMNSE when the time-dependent forcing converges to a time-independent function under the perturbation of linear multiplicative noise as well as additive noise. The main approach is to provide a way to justify that, on some uniformly tempered universe, the usual pullback asymptotic compactness of the solution operators is uniform across an infinite time-interval $(-\infty,\tau]$. The backward uniform ``tail-smallness'' and ``flattening-property'' of the solutions over $(-\infty,\tau]$ have been demonstrated to achieve this goal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to establish the existence as well as AAR of random attractors for 3D SGMNSE on unbounded domains.</description>

Abstract: In this short note, we will give a new combinatorial proof of Ginibre's inequality for XY models. Our proof is based on multigraph representations introduced by van Engelenburg-Lis (2023) and a new bijection, which can be viewed as a combinatorial interpretation of Ginibre's square trick.</description>

      <title>Testing mean and variance by e-processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12480v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of testing conditional mean and conditional variance for non-stationary data. We build e-values and p-values for four types of non-parametric composite hypotheses with specified mean and variance as well as other conditions on the shape of the data-generating distribution. These shape conditions include symmetry, unimodality, and their combination. Using the obtained e-values and p-values, we construct tests via e-processes, also known as testing by betting, as well as some tests based on combining p-values for comparison. Although we mainly focus on one-sided tests, the two-sided test for the mean is also studied. Simulation and empirical studies are conducted under a few settings, and they illustrate features of the methods based on e-processes.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the covariance matrix of a random vector by observing i.i.d samples and each entry of the sampled vector is missed with probability $p$. Under the standard $L_4-L_2$ moment equivalence assumption, we construct the first estimator that simultaneously achieves optimality with respect to the parameter $p$ and it recovers the optimal convergence rate for the classical covariance estimation problem when $p=1$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the length spectrum of a model of random hyperbolic 3-manifolds introduced by Petri and Raimbault. These are compact manifolds with boundary constructed by randomly gluing truncated tetrahedra along their faces. We prove that, as the volume tends to infinity, their length spectrum converge in distribution to a Poisson point process on $\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$, with computable intensity $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Score-Aware Policy-Gradient Methods and Performance Guarantees using Local Lyapunov Conditions: Applications to Product-Form Stochastic Networks and Queueing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a policy-gradient method for model-based reinforcement learning (RL) that exploits a type of stationary distributions commonly obtained from Markov decision processes (MDPs) in stochastic networks, queueing systems, and statistical mechanics. Specifically, when the stationary distribution of the MDP belongs to an exponential family that is parametrized by policy parameters, we can improve existing policy gradient methods for average-reward RL. Our key identification is a family of gradient estimators, called score-aware gradient estimators (SAGEs), that enable policy gradient estimation without relying on value-function approximation in the aforementioned setting. This contrasts with other common policy-gradient algorithms such as actor-critic methods. We first show that policy-gradient with SAGE locally converges, including in cases when the objective function is nonconvex, presents multiple maximizers, and the state space of the MDP is not finite. Under appropriate assumptions such as starting sufficiently close to a maximizer, the policy under stochastic gradient ascent with SAGE has an overwhelming probability of converging to the associated optimal policy. Other key assumptions are that a local Lyapunov function exists, and a nondegeneracy property of the Hessian of the objective function holds locally around a maximizer. Furthermore, we conduct a numerical comparison between a SAGE-based policy-gradient method and an actor-critic method. We specifically focus on several examples inspired from stochastic networks, queueing systems, and models derived from statistical physics, where parametrizable exponential families are commonplace. Our results demonstrate that a SAGE-based method finds close-to-optimal policies faster than an actor-critic method.</description>

      <title>Metric Entropy-Free Sample Complexity Bounds for Sample Average Approximation in Convex Stochastic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies sample average approximation (SAA) in solving convex or strongly convex stochastic programming problems. Under some common regularity conditions, we show -- perhaps for the first time -- that SAA's sample complexity can be completely free from any quantification of metric entropy (such as the logarithm of the covering number), leading to a significantly more efficient rate with dimensionality $d$ than most existing results. From the newly established complexity bounds, an important revelation is that SAA and the canonical stochastic mirror descent (SMD) method, two mainstream solution approaches to SP, entail almost identical rates of sample efficiency, rectifying a persistent theoretical discrepancy of SAA from SMD by the order of $O(d)$. Furthermore, this paper explores non-Lipschitzian scenarios where SAA maintains provable efficacy but the corresponding results for SMD remain mostly unexplored, indicating the potential of SAA's better applicability in some irregular settings.</description>

      <title>An excursion onto Schr\"odinger's bridges: Stochastic flows with spatio-temporal marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07402v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of the present work is to expand substantially the type of control and estimation problems that can be addressed following the paradigm of Schr\"odinger bridges, by incorporating termination (killing) of stochastic flows. Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing measured spatio-temporal marginals of killed particles. In the context of control, we seek a suitable control action directing the killed process toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of our framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding controller takes the form of state feedback.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time estimates on the size of chaos for interacting Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of classical Brownian particles interacting via a smooth long-range potential in the mean-field regime, and we analyze the propagation of chaos in form of sharp, uniform-in-time estimates on many-particle correlation functions. Our results cover both the kinetic Langevin setting and the corresponding overdamped Brownian dynamics. The approach is mainly based on so-called Lions expansions, which we combine with new diagrammatic tools to capture many-particle cancellations, as well as with fine ergodic estimates on the linearized mean-field equation, and with discrete stochastic calculus with respect to initial data. In the process, we derive some new ergodic estimates for the linearized Vlasov-Fokker-Planck kinetic equation that are of independent interest. Our analysis also leads to uniform-in-time concentration estimates and to a uniform-in-time quantitative central limit theorem for the empirical measure associated with the particle dynamics.</description>
