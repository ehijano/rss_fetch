      <title>Holstein mechanism in single-site model with unitary evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Holstein mechanism in single electron (one-site) system with unitary evolution that is intrinsic to both the fermion and boson operators in the case of nonadiabatic limit. The unitary dynamics as well as boson-frequency-dependence provide the evidence of quantum phase transition from the distinct behaviors at short-time and long-time stages, which exhibit power law and exponential law decay, respectively, as can be seem from the polaronic shift.</description>

      <title>The Solution of the Critical Dynamics of the Mean-Field Kob-Andersen Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically solve the critical dynamics of the Kob-Andersen kinetically constrained model of supercooled liquids on the Bethe lattice, employing a combinatorial argument based on the cavity method. For arbitrary values of graph connectivity z and facilitation parameter m, we demonstrate that the critical behavior of the order parameter is governed by equations of motion equivalent to those found in Mode-Coupling Theory. The resulting predictions for the dynamical exponents are validated through direct comparisons with numerical simulations that include both continuous and discontinuous transition scenarios.</description>

      <title>Very persistent random walkers reveal transitions in landscape topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the typical behavior of random walkers on the microcanonical configuration space of mean-field disordered systems. Passive walks have an ergodicity-breaking transition at precisely the energy density associated with the dynamical glass transition, but persistent walks remain ergodic at lower energies. In models where the energy landscape is thoroughly understood, we show that, in the limit of infinite persistence time, the ergodicity-breaking transition coincides with a transition in the topology of microcanonical configuration space. We conjecture that this correspondence generalizes to other models, and use it to determine the topological transition energy in situations where the landscape properties are ambiguous.</description>

      <title>Magnetic vortex writing and local reversal seeding in artificial spin-vortex ice via all-optical and surface-probe control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial spin-vortex ice ('ASVI') is a reconfigurable nanomagnetic metamaterial consisting of magnetic nanoislands tailored to support both Ising macrospin and vortex textures. ASVI has recently shown functional applications including reconfigurable magnonics and neuromorphic computing, where the introduction of vortex textures broadens functionality beyond conventional artificial spin ice which generally supports macrospin states. However, local control of writing vortex states in ASVI remains an open challenge. Here we demonstrate techniques for field-free magnetic vortex writing in ASVI. We expand ASVI to support metastable macrospin, single-vortex and double-vortex states. All-optical writing via focused laser illumination can locally write double-vortex textures, and surface-probe writing using an MFM tip can locally write single vortex states. We leverage this writing to tailor and explore the reconfigurable energy landscape of ASVI, demonstrating programmable local seeding of avalanche-like reversal events. The global field-free texture selective writing techniques reported here expand the suite of nanomagnetic control techniques, with a host of future applications including fundamental studies of avalanche dynamics, physical memory, and direct writing of nanomagnetic 'weights' in physical neuromorphic neural networks.</description>

      <title>Gaplessness from disorder and quantum geometry in gapped superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that disorder can induce low-energy Andreev bound states in a sign-changing, but fully gapped, superconductor at $\pi-$junctions. Generically, these excitations are localized. Starting from a superconductor with a sign-changing and nodeless order parameter in the clean limit, here we demonstrate a mechanism for increasing the localization length associated with the low-energy Andreev bound states at a fixed disorder strength. We find that the Fubini-Study metric associated with the electronic Bloch wavefunctions controls the localization length and the hybridization between bound states localized at distinct $\pi-$junctions. We present results for the inverse participation ratio, superfluid stiffness, site-resolved and disorder-averaged spectral functions as a function of increasing Fubini-Study metric, which indicate an increased tendency towards delocalization. The low-energy properties resemble those of a dirty nodal superconductor with gapless Bogoliubov excitations. We place these results in the context of recent experiments in moire graphene superconductors.</description>

      <title>Extreme value statistics and eigenstate thermalization in kicked quantum chaotic spin-$1/2$ chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is often expected (and assumed) for a quantum chaotic system that the presence of correlated eigenvalues implies that all the other properties as dictated by random matrix theory are satisfied. We demonstrate using the spin-$1/2$ kicked field Ising model that this is not necessarily true. We study the properties of eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix for this model, which constitutes the entanglement spectrum. It is shown that the largest eigenvalue does not follow the expected Tracy--Widom distribution even for the large system sizes considered. The distribution instead follows the extreme value distribution of Weibull type. Furthermore, we also show that such deviations do not lead to drastic change in the thermalization property of this system by showing that the models satisfy the diagonal and off-diagonal eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Finally, we study the spin-spin autocorrelation function and numerically show that it has the characteristic behavior for chaotic systems: it decreases exponentially and saturates to a value at late time that decreases with system size.</description>

      <title>To reset or not to reset in a finite domain: that is the question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the search of a target with a given spatial distribution in a finite one-dimensional domain. The searcher follows Brownian dynamics and is always reset to its initial position when reaching the boundaries of the domain (boundary resetting). In addition, the searcher may be reset to its initial position from any internal point of the domain (bulk resetting). Specifically, we look for the optimal strategy for bulk resetting, i.e., the spatially dependent bulk resetting rate that minimizes the average search time. The best search strategy exhibits a second-order transition from vanishing to non-vanishing bulk resetting when varying the target distribution. The obtained mathematical criteria are further analyzed for a monoparametric family of distributions, to shed light on the properties that control the optimal strategy for bulk resetting. Our work paves new research lines in the study of search processes, emphasizing the relevance of the target distribution for the optimal search strategy, and identifies a successful framework to address these questions.</description>

      <title>Universal estimates for the density of states for aperiodic block subwavelength resonator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the spectral properties of aperiodic block subwavelength resonator systems in one dimension, with a primary focus on the density of states. We prove that for random block configurations, as the number of blocks $M\to \infty$, the integrated density of states converges to a non-random, continuous function. We show both analytically and numerically that the density of states exhibits a tripartite decomposition: it vanishes identically within bandgaps; it forms smooth, band-like distributions in shared pass bands (a consequence of constructive eigenmode interactions); and, most notably, it exhibits a distinct fractal-like character in hybridisation regions. We demonstrate that this fractal-like behaviour stems from the limited interaction between eigenmodes within these hybridisation regions. Capitalising on this insight, we introduce an efficient meta-atom approach that enables rapid and accurate prediction of the density of states in these hybridisation regions. This approach is shown to extend to systems with quasiperiodic and hyperuniform arrangements of blocks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Reservoir Computing with Physical Neuromorphic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir Computing (RC) with physical systems requires an understanding of the underlying structure and internal dynamics of the specific physical reservoir. In this study, physical nano-electronic networks with neuromorphic dynamics are investigated for their use as physical reservoirs in an RC framework. These neuromorphic networks operate as dynamic reservoirs, with node activities in general coupled to the edge dynamics through nonlinear nano-electronic circuit elements, and the reservoir outputs influenced by the underlying network connectivity structure. This study finds that networks with varying degrees of sparsity generate more useful nonlinear temporal outputs for dynamic RC compared to dense networks. Dynamic RC is also tested on an autonomous multivariate chaotic time series prediction task with networks of varying densities, which revealed the importance of network sparsity in maintaining network activity and overall dynamics, that in turn enabled the learning of the chaotic Lorenz63 system's attractor behavior.</description>

      <title>Inducing a transition between thermal and many-body localized states and detecting many-body mobility edges through dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The many-body mobility edge (MBME) in energy, which separates thermal states from many-body localization (MBL) states, is a critical yet controversial concept in MBL physics. Here we examine the quasiperiodic $t_1-t_2$ model that features a mobility edge. With the addition of nearest-neighbor interactions, we suggest the potential existence of a MBME. Then we investigate the impact of a type of bond dissipation on the many-body system by calculating the steady-state density matrix and analyzing the transport behavior, and demonstrate that dissipation can cause the system to predominantly occupy either the thermal region or the MBL region, irrespective of the initial state. Finally, we discuss the effects of increasing system size. Our results indicate that dissipation can induce transitions between thermal and MBL states, providing a new approach for experimentally determining the existence of the MBME.</description>

      <title>Supervised and unsupervised learning of the many-body critical phase, phase transitions, and critical exponents in disordered quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we begin by questioning the existence of a new kind of nonergodic extended phase, namely, the many-body critical (MBC) phase in finite systems of an interacting quasiperiodic system. We find that this phase can be separately detected from the other phases such as the many-body ergodic (ME) and many-body localized (MBL) phases in the model through supervised neural networks made for both binary and multi-class classification tasks, utilizing, rather un-preprocessed, eigenvalue spacings and eigenvector probability densities as input features. Moreover, the output of our trained neural networks can also indicate the critical points separating ME, MBC and MBL phases, which are consistent with the same obtained from other conventional methods. We also employ unsupervised learning techniques, particularly principal component analysis (PCA) of eigenvector probability densities to investigate how this framework, without any training, captures the, rather unknown, many-body phases (ME, MBL and MBC) and single particle phases (delocalized, localized and critical) of the interacting and non-interacting systems, respectively. Our findings reveal that PCA entropy serves as an effective indicator (order parameter) for detecting phase transitions in the single-particle systems. Moreover, this method proves applicable to many-body systems when the data undergoes a suitable pre-processing. Interestingly, when it comes to extraction of critical (correlation length) exponents through a finite size-scaling, we find that for single-particle systems, scaling collapse of neural network outputs is obtained using components of inverse participation ratio (IPR) as input data. Remarkably, we observe identical critical exponents as obtained from scaling collapse of the IPR directly for different single-particle phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Solving and visualizing fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions with neural network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an attention-based fermionic neural network (FNN) to variationally solve the problem of two-dimensional Coulomb electron gas in magnetic fields, a canonical platform for fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids, Wigner crystals and other unconventional electron states. Working directly with the full Hilbert space of $N$ electrons confined to a disk, our FNN consistently attains energies lower than LL-projected exact diagonalization (ED) and learns the ground state wavefunction to high accuracy. In low LL mixing regime, our FNN reveals microscopic features in the short-distance behavior of FQH wavefunction beyond the Laughlin ansatz. For moderate and strong LL mixing parameters, the FNN outperforms ED significantly. Moreover, a phase transition from FQH liquid to a crystal state is found at strong LL mixing. Our study demonstrates unprecedented power and universality of FNN based variational method for solving strong-coupling many-body problems with topological order and electron fractionalization.</description>
