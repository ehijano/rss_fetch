      <title>A Topological Approach to Parameterizing Deep Hedging Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep hedging uses recurrent neural networks to hedge financial products that cannot be fully hedged in incomplete markets. Previous work in this area focuses on minimizing some measure of quadratic hedging error by calculating pathwise gradients, but doing so requires large batch sizes and can make training effective models in a reasonable amount of time challenging. We show that by adding certain topological features, we can reduce batch sizes substantially and make training these models more practically feasible without greatly compromising hedging performance.</description>

      <title>On Bellman equation in the limit order optimization problem for high-frequency trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An approximation method for construction of optimal strategies in the bid \&amp; ask limit order book in the high-frequency trading (HFT) is studied. The basis is the article by M. Avellaneda \&amp; S. Stoikov 2008, in which certain seemingly serious gaps have been found; in the present paper they are carefully corrected. However, a bit surprisingly, our corrections do not change the main answer in the cited paper, so that, in fact, the gaps turn out to be unimportant. An explanation of this effect is offered.</description>

      <title>A Mixed-Form PINNS (MF-PINNS) For Solving The Coupled Stokes-Darcy Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel physical information neural networks (P-PINNs) have been widely used to solve systems with
  multiple coupled physical fields, such as the coupled Stokes-Darcy equations with Beavers-Joseph-Saffman (BJS) interface
  conditions. However, excessively high or low physical constants in partial differential equations (PDE) often lead to ill conditioned loss functions and can even cause the failure of training numerical solutions for PINNs. To solve this problem,
  we develop a new kind of enhanced parallel PINNs, MF-PINNs, in this article. Our MF-PINNs combines the velocity pressure form (VP) with the stream-vorticity form (SV) and add them with adjusted weights to the total loss functions.
  The results of numerical experiments show our MF-PINNs have successfully improved the accuracy of the streamline fields
  and the pressure fields when kinematic viscosity and permeability tensor range from 1e-4 to 1e4. Thus, our MF-PINNs
  hold promise for more chaotic PDE systems involving turbulent flows. Additionally, we also explore the best combination of
  the activation functions and their periodicity. And we also try to set the initial learning rate and design its decay strategies.

      <title>On Time-subordinated Brownian Motion Processes for Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of time-subordinated Brownian motion models, Fourier theory and methodology are proposed to modelling the stochastic distribution of time increments. Gaussian Variance-Mean mixtures and time-subordinated models are reviewed with a key example being the Variance-Gamma process. A non-parametric characteristic function decomposition of subordinated Brownian motion is presented. The theory requires an extension of the real domain of certain characteristic functions to the complex plane, the validity of which is proven here. This allows one to characterise and study the stochastic time-change directly from the full process. An empirical decomposition of S\&amp;P log-returns is provided to illustrate the methodology.</description>

      <title>A deep solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18297v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first deep-learning solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs) and their fully-coupled forward-backward variants. The method trains a neural network to approximate the two solution fields in a single stage, avoiding the use of nested time-stepping cycles that limit classical algorithms. For the decoupled case we prove a non-asymptotic error bound composed of an a posteriori residual plus the familiar square root dependence on the time step. Numerical experiments are consistent with this rate and reveal two key properties: \emph{scalability}, in the sense that accuracy remains stable from low dimension up to 500 spatial variables while GPU batching keeps wall-clock time nearly constant; and \emph{generality}, since the same method handles coupled systems whose forward dynamics depend on the backward solution. These results open practical access to a family of high-dimensional, time-inconsistent problems in stochastic control and quantitative finance.</description>

      <title>Optimal Exit Time for Liquidity Providers in Automated Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of optimal liquidity withdrawal for a representative liquidity provider (LP) in an automated market maker (AMM). LPs earn fees from trading activity but are exposed to impermanent loss (IL) due to price fluctuations. While existing work has focused on static provision and exogenous exit strategies, we characterise the optimal exit time as the solution to a stochastic control problem with an endogenous stopping time. Mathematically, the LP's value function is shown to satisfy a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality, for which we establish uniqueness in the viscosity sense. To solve the problem numerically, we develop two complementary approaches: a Euler scheme based on operator splitting and a Longstaff-Schwartz regression method. Calibrated simulations highlight how the LP's optimal exit strategy depends on the oracle price volatility, fee levels, and the behaviour of arbitrageurs and noise traders. Our results show that while arbitrage generates both fees and IL, the LP's optimal decision balances these opposing effects based on the pool state variables and price misalignments. Lastly, we find the optimal fee level for the representative LP when they play the exit strategy we derived. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of dynamic liquidity provision in AMMs and provides insights into the sustainability of passive LP strategies under different market regimes.</description>

      <title>Sharp Large Deviations and Gibbs Conditioning for Threshold Models in Portfolio Credit Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain sharp large deviation estimates for exceedance probabilities in dependent triangular array threshold models with a diverging number of latent factors. The prefactors quantify how latent-factor dependence and tail geometry enter at leading order, yielding three regimes: Gaussian or exponential-power tails produce polylogarithmic refinements of the Bahadur-Rao $n^{-1/2}$ law; regularly varying tails yield index-driven polynomial scaling; and bounded-support (endpoint) cases lead to an $n^{-3/2}$ prefactor. We derive these results through Laplace-Olver asymptotics for exponential integrals and conditional Bahadur-Rao estimates for the triangular arrays. Using these estimates, we establish a Gibbs conditioning principle in total variation: conditioned on a large exceedance event, the default indicators become asymptotically i.i.d., and the loss-given-default distribution is exponentially tilted (with the boundary case handled by an endpoint analysis). As illustrations, we obtain second-order approximations for Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall, clarifying when portfolios operate in the genuine large-deviation regime. The results provide a transferable set of techniques-localization, curvature, and tilt identification-for sharp rare-event analysis in dependent threshold systems.</description>
