      <title>The Variable Universe with the Gaia mission and AI methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia mission has observed over 2 billion stars repeatedly across the entire sky over 10 years, revealing the many astronomical objects that vary on human timescales from seconds to years. Its repeated astrometric, photometric, spectrophotometric and spectroscopic measurements create an unprecedented dataset to probe the variable celestial sources down to G ~ 21 mag. To extract meaningful results from these many time series for so many sources, we have used machine learning techniques for crossmatching, variability detection, and variability classification. This approach has now led to the largest catalogue of classified variable sources ever produced over the entire celestial sphere.</description>

      <title>Deconvolution for Large Astronomical Surveys: A Study of the Scaled Gradient Projection Method on Zwicky Transient Facility Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based astronomical observations will continue to produce resolution-limited images due to atmospheric seeing. Deconvolution reverses such effects and thus can benefit extracted science in multifaceted ways. We apply the Scaled Gradient Projection (SGP) algorithm for the single-band deconvolution of several observed images from the Zwicky Transient Facility and mainly discuss the performance on stellar sources. The method shows good photometric flux preservation, which deteriorates for fainter sources but significantly reduces flux uncertainties even for the faintest sources. Deconvolved sources have a well-defined Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum (FWHM) of roughly one pixel (one arcsecond for ZTF) regardless of the observed seeing. Detection after deconvolution results in catalogs with $\gtrsim$99.6% completeness relative to detections in the observed images. A few observed sources that could not be detected in the deconvolved image are found near saturated sources, whereas for others, the deconvolved counterparts are detected when slightly different detection parameters are used. The deconvolution reveals new faint sources previously undetectable, which are confirmed by crossmatching with the deeper DESI Legacy DR10 and with Pan-STARRS1 through forced photometry. The method could identify examples of serendipitous potential deblends that exceeded SExtractor's deblending capabilities, with as extreme as $\Delta m \approx 3$ and separations as small as one arcsecond between the deblended components. Our survey-agnostic approach is better and eight times faster than Richardson-Lucy deconvolution and could be a reliable method for incorporation into survey pipelines.</description>

      <title>BOOM and Babamul: a real-time, multi-survey, optical alert broker system operating at scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the arrival of ever higher throughput wide-field surveys and a multitude of multi-messenger and multi-wavelength instruments to complement them, software capable of harnessing these associated data streams is urgently required. To meet these needs, a number of community supported alert brokers have been built, currently focused on processing of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; $\sim 10^5$-$10^6$ alerts per night) with an eye towards Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST; $\sim 2 \times 10^7$ alerts per night). Building upon the system that successfully ran in production for ZTF's first seven years of operation, we introduce BOOM (Burst &amp; Outburst Observations Monitor), an analysis framework focused on real-time, joint brokering of these alert streams. BOOM harnesses the performance of a Rust-based software stack relying on a non-relational MongoDB database combined with a Valkey in-memory processing queue and a Kafka cluster for message sharing. With this system, we demonstrate feature parity with the existing ZTF system with a throughput $\sim 8 \times$ higher. We describe the workflow that enables the real-time processing as well as the results with custom filters we have built to demonstrate the system's capabilities. In conclusion, we present the development roadmap for both BOOM and Babamul - the public-facing LSST alert broker built atop BOOM - as we begin the Rubin era.</description>

      <title>StarDICE IV: Characterizing atmosphere gray extinction with thermal infrared observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The StarDICE experiment seeks to establish a metrology chain linking laboratory standards to astrophysical fluxes, targeting 1 mmag accuracy in the $\textit{griz}$ bands. Reaching this precision requires mitigating variable atmospheric effects, especially gray extinction from clouds, which remains a major challenge. To address this challenge, we present a novel method for correcting photometric data using simultaneous radiometric measurements from an infrared thermal camera. The gray extinction correction model is fitted on an image-by-image basis as a function of thermal radiance excess and difference between synthetic and instrumental fluxes of calibration stars. This approach stands out by avoiding any assumptions about spatial structure and leveraging a forward model combining in situ environmental monitoring, radiative transfer simulations and use of Gaia Data Release 3 star catalogs. We demonstrate the method using data collected from a dedicated experimental remote observation system, built to conduct repeated observations of two fields over several nights in varying atmosphere conditions. We show that applying the correction model to each source in the test sample results in a reduction of residuals between corrected and reference magnitudes. It delivers extinction correction maps for individual images with a resolution of 2 arcmin and an accuracy of $\sim$0.01 mag. This leads to a significant improvement in accuracy per image, with the mean absolute error decreasing from 0.64 to 0.11 mag for the most gray extinguished exposures. The temporal variations in extinction for non-ideal photometric sequences can be reduced to 0.025 mag per source, which is promising for its application in StarDICE.</description>

      <title>ATCAT: Astronomical Timeseries CAusal Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will capture light curves (LCs) for 10 billion sources and produce millions of transient candidates per night, necessitating scalable, accurate, and efficient classification. To prepare the community for this scale of data, the Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC) sought to simulate a diversity of LSST-like time-domain events. Using a small transformer-based model and refined light curve encoding logic, we present a new state of the art classification performance on ELAsTiCC, with 71.8% F1 on LC-only classifications, and 89.8% F1 on LC+metadata classifications. Previous state of the art was 65.5% F1 for LC-only, and for LC+metadata, 84% F1 with a different setup and 83.5% F1 with a directly comparable setup. Our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art models for fine-grained early detection at all time cutoffs, which should help prioritize candidate transients for follow-up observations. We demonstrate label-efficient training by removing labels from 90% of the training data (chosen uniformly at random), and compensate by leveraging regularization, bootstrap ensembling, and unsupervised pretraining. Even with only 10% of the labeled data, we achieve 67.4% F1 on LC-only and 87.1% F1 on LC+metadata, validating an approach that should help mitigate synthetic and observational data drift, and improve classification on tasks with less labeled data. We find that our base model is poorly calibrated via reliability diagrams, and correct it at a minimal cost to overall performance, enabling selections by classification precision. Finally, our GPU-optimized implementation is 9x faster than other state-of-the-art ELAsTiCC models, and can run inference at ~33000 LCs/s on a consumer-grade GPU, making it suitable for large-scale applications, and less expensive to train.</description>

      <title>Modeling dust dynamics in OpenGadget3 -- I. SPH implementation of the One-Fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust dynamics plays a critical role in astrophysical processes and has been modeled in hydrodynamical simulations using various approaches. Among particle-based methods like Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), the One-Fluid model has proven to be highly effective for simulating gas-dust mixtures. This study presents the implementation of the One-Fluid model in OpenGadget3, introducing improvements to the original formulation. These enhancements include time-dependent artificial viscosity and conductivity, as well as a novel treatment of dust diffusion using a pressure-like term. The improved model is tested using a suite of dust dynamics benchmark problems: DUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, and DUSTYSHOCK, with the latter extended to multidimensional scenarios, as well as a dusty Sedov-Taylor blast wave. Additional tests include simulations of Cold Keplerian Disks, dusty protoplanetary disks, and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities to evaluate the model's robustness in more complex flows. The implementation successfully passes all standard benchmark tests. It demonstrates stability and accuracy in both simple and complex simulations. The new diffusion term improves the handling of flows with large dust-to-gas ratios and low drag coefficients, although limitations of the One-Fluid model in these regimes remain. The enhanced One-Fluid model is a reliable and robust tool for simulating dust dynamics in OpenGadget3. While it retains some limitations inherent to the original formulation, the introduced improvements expand its applicability and address some challenges in gas-dust dynamics.</description>

      <title>Derivative-Aligned Anticipation of Forbush Decreases from Entropy and Fractal Markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a feature-based framework to anticipate Forbush decreases (FDs) from one-minute neutron-monitor data by tracking sliding-window invariants from information theory, scaling, and geometry. For each station and event, we compute marker series (Shannon, spectral, permutation, sample and approximate entropy; Lempel-Ziv complexity; Hurst via DFA; correlation dimension; Higuchi, Katz, and Petrosian fractal dimensions), smooth them with an exponentially weighted moving average, and analyze within-station standardized derivatives relative to the time of the minimum of the smoothed count derivative. Leads are reported in minutes (negative = precedes) and station-level significance is defined on a pre-onset window via a robust z-score detector with bilateral threshold and persistence; no cross-correlation or hypothesis testing is required. Applied to three recent FDs (2023-04-23, 2024-03-24, 2024-05-10), a compact, robust panel-Hurst (DFA), Katz fractal dimension, Shannon and sample entropy, and Lempel-Ziv-consistently precedes the count derivative with substantial station coverage, yielding actionable lead times from tens to several hundred minutes depending on morphology. Some descriptors are event-dependent: permutation and spectral entropy are strongly anticipatory in the extreme May 2024 episode but closer to contemporaneous in the rapid March 2024 case. Heatmaps, violin plots, and station overlays corroborate these patterns. The approach is reproducible from open code, operates on native station units without cross-station homogenization, and is qualitatively stable to window, smoothing, and detector settings. These results support derivative-aligned invariant panels as practical early-warning tools that complement amplitude thresholds and enable nowcasting workflows in space-weather operations.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Detection and Rejection for CSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a space telescope, the China Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) will face significant challenges from cosmic ray (CR) contamination. These CRs will severely degrade image quality and further influence scientific analysis. Due to the CSST's sky survey strategy, traditional multi-frame stacking methods become invalid. The limited revisits prompted us to develop an effective single-image CR processing method for CSST. We retrained the DeepCR model based on CSST simulated images and achieved 97.90+-0.18% recall and 98.67+-0.05% precision on CR detection. Moreover, this paper puts forward an innovative morphology-sensitive inpainting method, which focuses more on areas with higher scientific value. We trained a UNet++ model especially on contaminated stellar/galactic areas, alongside adaptive median filtering for background regions. This method achieves effective for CRs with different intensities and different distances from centers of scientific targets. By this approach, the photometric errors of CR-corrected targets could be restricted to the level comparable to those of uncontaminated sources. Also, it increases the detection rate by 13.6% compared to CR masking. This method will provide a robust CR mitigation for next-generation space telescopes.</description>

      <title>Keck Observatory as an HWO Testbed: validating wavefront sensing and control schemes on a large segmented aperture in parallel with high-contrast science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanet direct imaging allows us to directly probe and characterize an exoplanet's atmosphere, searching for signs of life in its atmospheric signatures. Directly imaging an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star requires reaching 10$^{-10}$ contrast levels and will be the goal of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). A key technical barrier to reaching such deep contrasts is maintaining wavefront stability on the order of tens of picometers, in particular in the presence of a segmented primary mirror. Keck Observatory is the only facility with all of the hardware components necessary for validating HWO segment phasing strategies: a large segmented primary mirror, capacitive edge sensors, deformable mirror, Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS), and high contrast science instruments. Taking advantage of these parallels, we are using Keck as a testbed for developing and validating HWO wavefront sensing and control loop strategies, as well as demonstrating the full system-level segment control architecture for HWO, using existing infrastructure. Recently, we set the stage for this work by using the ZWFS installed on the Keck II telescope to sense and correct the primary mirror segment pistons in closed-loop in parallel with science observations. This resulted in improved Strehl ratios on the NIRC2 science camera (Salama et al. 2024a). We now aim to directly address concerns related to control authority, actuator offload, and loop stability - tasks which require Keck's existing infrastructure, but which do not require picometer wavefront stability. Moreover, successful comparisons of observed and predicted performances will validate, on a real operating observatory, the HWO error budget methodology and in particular its approach to nested loops operating at multiple timescales.</description>

      <title>Extending to the Submillimeter Universe with the CCAT Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CCAT Observatory's Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope, a novel, high-throughput, 6-meter aperture telescope, is scheduled for first light in 2026. Located at 5600 m on Cerro Chajnantor in the Chilean Atacama Desert, the CCAT site enables unprecedented submillimeter measurement capabilities, fully overlapping with millimeter-wave surveys like the Simons Observatory. CCAT will address a suite of science goals, from Big Bang cosmology, star formation, and line-intensity mapping of cosmic reionization, to galactic magnetic fields, transients, and galaxy evolution over cosmic time. We highlight CCAT's science goals with Prime-Cam, a first generation science instrument for the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope. Prime-Cam will field over 100,000 kinetic inductance detectors across seven instrument modules to enable over ten times faster mapping speed than previous submillimeter observatories in windows between 1.4 - 0.3 mm (220 - 850 GHz). We give an instrument summary, discuss the project status, and outline preliminary plans for early science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AXIS Community Science Book represents the collective effort of more than 500 scientists worldwide to define the transformative science enabled by the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), a next-generation X-ray mission selected by NASA's Astrophysics Probe Program for Phase A study. AXIS will advance the legacy of high-angular-resolution X-ray astronomy with ~1.5'' imaging over a wide 24' field of view and an order of magnitude greater collecting area than Chandra in the 0.3-12 keV band. Combining sharp imaging, high throughput, and rapid response capabilities, AXIS will open new windows on virtually every aspect of modern astrophysics, exploring the birth and growth of supermassive black holes, the feedback processes that shape galaxies, the life cycles of stars and exoplanet environments, and the nature of compact stellar remnants, supernova remnants, and explosive transients. This book compiles over 140 community-contributed science cases developed by five Science Working Groups focused on AGN and supermassive black holes, galaxy evolution and feedback, compact objects and supernova remnants, stellar physics and exoplanets, and time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these studies establish the scientific foundation for next-generation X-ray exploration in the 2030s and highlight strong synergies with facilities of the 2030s, such as JWST, Roman, Rubin/LSST, SKA, ALMA, ngVLA, and next-generation gravitational-wave and neutrino networks.</description>

      <title>Sharp dynamic points in Earth-Sun physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The subsolar point, the closest location on Earth's surface to the Sun, marks the Sun-Earth line of gravity that governs Earth's coupled orbital-rotational cycle. We examined the dynamic interactions among the Sun meridian declination (SMD), the Equation of Time (EoT), Earth's rotational speed (ER$_\omega$) -- equatorial and with respect to the Sun -- and the path of the subsolar point (NBI) across longitude, including time derivatives up to the fourth order (snap). A central finding was that the function NBI$_\alpha$(SMD) traces a lemniscate whose temporal structure mirrors the analemma, EoT(SMD), and whose symmetry converges to the obliquity component of the EoT. The EoT velocity ($\omega^*$) peaks at solstices, troughs near the equinoxes, and crosses zero every mid-season. ER$_\omega$ decreases monotonically along trans-equinoctial phases where the net drives of EoT and SMD coincide, and increases along trans-solstitial phases, where their net drives oppose. Eight sharp kinematic periods were identified for the cycle SMD-EoT-ER$_\omega$: two equinoctial, two solstitial, and one within each season. The non-solstitial sharp terms, defined by ZCPs and troughs of $\omega^*$, display a consistent 3$^\circ$ northward offset from the function NBI$_\alpha$(SMD). These results reveal a direct dynamical link between SMD, EoT, and Earth's rotational speed, providing a novel framework for understanding Earth's rotation.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Black Hole Ringdown Signals with Data Gaps using a Deep-Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DenoiseGapFiller (DGF), a deep-learning framework specifically designed to reconstruct gravitational-wave ringdown signals corrupted by data gaps and instrumental noise. DGF employs a dual-branch encoder-decoder architecture, which is fused via mixing layers and Transformer-style blocks. Trained end-to-end on synthetic ringdown waveforms with gaps up to 20% of the segment length, DGF can achieve a mean waveform mismatch of 0.002. The residual amplitudes of the Time-domain shrink by roughly an order of magnitude and the power spectral density in the 0.01-1 Hz band is suppressed by 1-2 orders of magnitude, restoring the peak of quasi-normal mode(QNM) in the time-frequency representation around 0.01-0.1 Hz. The ability of the model to faithfully reconstruct the original signals, which implies milder penalties in the detection evidence and tighter credible regions for parameter estimation, lay a foundation for the following scientific work.</description>

      <title>Analytical sensitivity curves of the second-generation time-delay interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forthcoming space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors will employ second-generation time-delay interferometry (TDI) to suppress laser frequency noise and achieve the sensitivity required for GW detection. We introduce an inverse light-path operator $\mathcal{P}_{i_{1}i_{2}i_{3}\ldots i_{n-1}i_{n}}$, which enables simple representation of second-generation TDI combinations and a concise description of light propagation. Analytical expressions and high-accuracy approximate formulas are derived for the sky- and polarization-averaged response functions, noise power spectral densities (PSDs), and sensitivity curves of TDI Michelson, ($\alpha,\beta,\gamma$), Monitor, Beacon, Relay, and Sagnac combinations, as well as their orthogonal $A, E, T$ channels. Our results show that: (i) second-generation TDIs have the same sensitivities as their first-generation counterparts; (ii) the $A, E, T$ sensitivities and the optimal sensitivity are independent of the TDI generation and specific combination; (iii) the $A$ and $E$ channels have equal averaged responses, noise PSDs, and sensitivities, while the $T$ channel has much weaker response and sensitivity at low frequencies ($2\pi fL/c\lesssim3$); (iv) except for the $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ and $\zeta$ combinations and the $T$ channel, all sensitivity curves exhibit a flat section in the range $f_{n}&lt;f\lesssim 1.5/(2\pi L/c)$, where the noise-balance frequency $f_{n}$ separates the proof-mass- and optical-path-dominated regimes, while the response-transition frequency $\sim 1.5/(2\pi L/c)$ separates the response function's low- and high-frequency behaviors; (v) the averaged response, noise PSD, and sensitivity of $\zeta$ scales with those of the $T$ channel. These analytical and approximate formulations provide useful benchmarks for instrument optimization and data-analysis studies for future space-based GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Experiments reveal extreme water generation during planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most abundant type of planet discovered in the Galaxy has no analogue in our Solar System and is believed to consist of a rocky interior with an overlying thick H2 dominated envelope. Models have predicted that the reaction between the atmospheric hydrogen and the underlying magma ocean can lead to the production of significant amounts of water. The models suffer however from the current lack of experimental data on the reaction between hydrogen and silicate melt at high pressures and temperatures. Here we present novel experimental results designed to investigate this interaction. Laser heating diamond anvil cell experiments were conducted between 16 and 60 GPa at temperatures above 4000 K. We find that copious amounts of hydrogen dissolve into the silicate melt with a large dependence on temperature rather than pressure. We also find that the reduction of iron oxide leads to the production of significant amounts of water along with the formation of iron-enriched blebs. Altogether, the results predict that the typical processes attending planet formation will result in significant water production with repercussions for the chemistry and structure of the planetary interior as well as the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>MiniFool -- Physics-Constraint-Aware Minimizer-Based Adversarial Attacks in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new algorithm, MiniFool, that implements physics-inspired adversarial attacks for testing neural network-based classification tasks in particle and astroparticle physics. While we initially developed the algorithm for the search for astrophysical tau neutrinos with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, we apply it to further data from other science domains, thus demonstrating its general applicability. Here, we apply the algorithm to the well-known MNIST data set and furthermore, to Open Data data from the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The algorithm is based on minimizing a cost function that combines a $\chi^2$ based test-statistic with the deviation from the desired target score. The test statistic quantifies the probability of the perturbations applied to the data based on the experimental uncertainties. For our studied use cases, we find that the likelihood of a flipped classification differs for both the initially correctly and incorrectly classified events. When testing changes of the classifications as a function of an attack parameter that scales the experimental uncertainties, the robustness of the network decision can be quantified. Furthermore, this allows testing the robustness of the classification of unlabeled experimental data.</description>

      <title>Chasing the storm: Investigating the application of high-contrast imaging techniques in producing precise exoplanet light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Substellar companions such as exoplanets and brown dwarfs exhibit changes in brightness arising from top-of-atmosphere inhomogeneities, providing insights into their atmospheric structure and dynamics. This variability can be measured in the light curves of high-contrast companions from the ground by combining differential spectrophotometric monitoring techniques with high-contrast imaging. However, ground-based observations are sensitive to the effects of turbulence in Earth's atmosphere, and while adaptive optics (AO) systems and bespoke data processing techniques help to mitigate these, residual systematics can limit photometric precision. Here, we inject artificial companions to data obtained with an AO system and a vector Apodizing Phase Plate coronagraph to test the level to which telluric and other systematics contaminate such light curves, and thus how well their known variability signals can be recovered. We find that varying companions are distinguishable from non-varying companions, but that variability amplitudes and periods cannot be accurately recovered when observations cover only a small number of periods. Residual systematics remain above the photon noise in the light curves but have not yet reached a noise floor. We also simulate observations to assess how specific systematic sources, such as non-common path aberrations and AO residuals, can impact aperture photometry as a companion moves through pupil-stabilised data. We show that only the lowest-order aberrations are likely to affect flux measurements, but that thermal background noise is the dominant source of scatter in raw companion photometry. Predictive control and focal-plane wavefront sensing techniques will help to further reduce systematics in data of this type.</description>

      <title>$\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm Absorption Spectra Classification using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm absorption, an extremely useful tool to study the cold atomic hydrogen gas, can arise either from the intervening galaxies along the line-of-sight towards the background radio source or from the radio source itself. Determining whether $\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm absorption lines detected as part of large, blind surveys are `intervening' or `associated' using optical spectroscopy would be unfeasible. We therefore investigate a more efficient, machine learning (ML)-based method to classify $\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm absorption lines. Using a sample of 118 known $\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm absorption lines from the literature, we train six ML models (Gaussian naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, SVM and XGBoost) on the spectral parameters obtained by fitting the Busy function to the absorption spectra. We found that a random forest model trained on these spectral parameters gives the most reliable classification results, with an accuracy of 89%, a $F_1$-score of 0.9 and an AUC score of 0.94. We note that the linewidth parameter $w_{20}$ is the most significant spectral parameter that regulates the classification performance of this model. Retraining this random forest model only with this linewidth and the integrated optical depth parameters yields an accuracy of 88%, a $F_1$-score of 0.88 and an AUC score of 0.91. We have applied this retrained random forest model to predict the type of 30 new $\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm absorption lines detected in recent blind surveys, viz. FLASH, illustrating the potential of the techniques developed in this work for future large $\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ surveys with the Square Kilometre Array.</description>

      <title>Leveraging pre-trained vision Transformers for multi-band photometric light curve classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20479v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a pre-trained vision Transformer (VT) model, specifically the Swin Transformer V2 (SwinV2), to classify photometric light curves without the need for feature extraction or multi-band preprocessing. The goal is to assess whether this image-based approach can accurately differentiate astronomical phenomena and serve as a viable option for working with multi-band photometric light curves. We transformed each multi-band light curve into an image. These images serve as input to the SwinV2 model, which is pre-trained on ImageNet-21K. The datasets employed include the public Catalog of Variable Stars from the Massive Compact Halo Object (MACHO) survey, using both one and two bands, and the first round of the recent Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC), which includes six bands. The performance of the model was evaluated on six classes for the MACHO dataset and 20 distinct classes of variable stars and transient events for the ELAsTiCC dataset. The fine-tuned SwinV2 achieved better performance than models specifically designed for light curves, such as Astromer and the Astronomical Transformer for Time Series and Tabular Data (ATAT). When trained on the full MACHO dataset, it attained a macro F1-score of 80.2 and outperformed Astromer in single-band experiments. Incorporating a second band further improved performance, increasing the F1-score to 84.1. In the ELAsTiCC dataset, SwinV2 achieved a macro F1-score of 65.5, slightly surpassing ATAT by 1.3.</description>

      <title>SPECTER: An Instrument Concept for CMB Spectral Distortion Measurements with Enhanced Sensitivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\mu$-distortion) to late-time baryonic feedback processes ($y$-distortion). While the $y$-distortion can be detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the $\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\mu$ arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here, we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly detecting $\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we optimize the instrument's configuration to target $\mu$ while marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike Fourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the $\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion at $\approx 5\sigma$ (10$\sigma$) assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with $\sim$degree-scale angular resolution at $\sim150$ GHz and 1100 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally measure the $y$-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic correction at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Ariel's Survey Leverage for Population-Level Studies of Exoplanets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ESA's Ariel mission will be uniquely suited to performing population-level studies of exoplanets. Most of these studies consist of quantifying trends between an Ariel-measured quantity, y, and an a priori planetary property, x; for example, atmospheric metallicity as inferred from Ariel transit spectroscopy vs. planetary mass. The precision with which we can quantify such trends depends on the number of targets in the survey and their variance in the a priori parameter. We define the leverage of a survey with N targets as L = sqrt(N)stdev(x) and show that it quantitatively predicts the precision of population-level trends. The target selection challenge of Ariel can therefore be summarized as maximizing L along some axes of diversity for a given cumulative observing time. To this end, we consider different schemes to select the mission reference sample for a notional three year transit spectroscopy survey with Ariel. We divide the exoplanets in the mission candidate sample into logarithmic classes based on radius, equilibrium temperature and host star temperature. We then construct a target list by cyclically choosing the easiest remaining target in each class. We find that the leverage on a single axis of diversity can be increased by dividing that axis into many classes, but this sacrifices leverage along other axes of diversity. We conclude that a modest number of classes, possibly only one, should be defined when selecting Ariel targets. Lastly, we note that the statistical leverage of the Ariel transit survey would be significantly increased if current candidate planets were confirmed. This highlights the urgency of vetting and confirming the easiest transmission and emission spectroscopy targets in the Ariel mission candidate sample.</description>

      <title>CosmoBench: A Multiscale, Multiview, Multitask Cosmology Benchmark for Geometric Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Cosmological simulations provide a wealth of data in the form of point clouds and directed trees. A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions, and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning. For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far longer training time. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at https://cosmobench.streamlit.app</description>

      <title>Phased-Array Laser Power Beaming from Cislunar Space to the Lunar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent, end-to-end framework for laser power beaming from cislunar orbits to the lunar surface. The model links on-orbit generation (solar arrays and wall-plug to optical), terrain-masked visibility and range, beam propagation with realistic divergence and jitter, and surface conversion with thermal and dust limits, returning delivered daily energy. Baseline loads for early polar activities (habitat survival, mobility, comm/nav, pilot ISRU) set target Wh\,day$^{-1}$ and are used consistently in scaling laws and design maps. A near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) to a Shackleton-rim site provides a worked example: for a 2\,m-class phased array at 1064\,nm the reference geometry yields $\sim$0.6--0.8\,kWh\,day$^{-1}$ to a 1\,m$^2$ receiver (about 28\,W averaged over the day). We place this result in context by comparing on the same daily-energy metric to surface photovoltaics (PV) with storage and to compact fission, and by showing how delivered energy scales nearly linearly with transmit power and as $D_{\rm eff}^{2}$ via encircled-energy capture, with a multiplicative gain from visibility (constellations). The same framework indicates practical regimes already within reach: e.g., a 10\,m effective-aperture optical phased array at $P_{\rm tx}=100$\,kW delivers $\sim$30--50\,kWh\,day$^{-1}$ at polar sites with typical single-orbiter visibility, as quantified by the delivered-energy and sizing maps. Thus, laser beaming is mass-competitive where darkness or permanent shadow forces deep storage for PV, or where distributed and duty-cycled users can amortize a shared transmitter; compact fission retains advantage for continuous multi-kW baseload at fixed sites.</description>

      <title>Solar Low Energy X-ray Spectrometer on board Aditya-L1: Ground Calibration and In-flight Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Solar Low-Energy X-ray Spectrometer (SoLEXS) on board India's Aditya-L1 mission was launched on 2 September 2023 and commenced solar observations on 13 December 2023 following successful aperture cover deployment. Operating from the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrange point, SoLEXS has been providing continuous Sun-as-a-star soft X-ray spectroscopy across 2-22 keV with 170 eV resolution at 5.9 keV and 1-second temporal cadence since 6 January 2024. The instrument employs two Silicon Drift Detectors with aperture areas of 7.1 mm$^2$ and 0.1 mm$^2$ to accommodate the full dynamic range of solar activity from A-class to X-class flares. This paper presents comprehensive ground and on board calibration procedures that establish SoLEXS's quantitative spectroscopic capabilities. Ground calibration encompassed energy-channel relationships, spectral resolution characterization, instrument response functions, and collimator angular response measurements, with thermo-vacuum testing validating performance stability across operational temperature ranges. On board calibration utilizing an internal $^{55}$Fe source demonstrated preserved post-launch spectral resolution (164.9-171.2 eV), while cross-calibration with GOES-XRS and Chandrayaan-2/XSM confirmed radiometric accuracy and flux agreement. The instrument's 100% observational duty cycle at L1 enables unprecedented continuous monitoring of solar flare evolution across all intensity classes, providing calibrated data for advancing coronal heating mechanisms, flare energetics, and flare-coronal mass ejection relationship studies through soft X-ray spectroscopy.</description>
