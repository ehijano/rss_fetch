      <title>Buoyancy-driven flow regimes for a melting vertical ice cylinder in saline water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of salt in seawater significantly affects the melt rate and morphological evolution of ice. This study investigates the melting process of a vertical cylinder in saline water using a combination of laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations. The two-dimensional (2D) direct numerical simulations and 3D experiments achieve thermal Rayleigh numbers up to $\text{Ra}_{T}= \mathcal{O}\left(10^{9}\right)$ and saline Rayleigh numbers up to $\text{Ra}_{S}=\mathcal{O}\left(10^{12}\right)$. Some 3D simulations of the vertical ice cylinder are conducted at $\text{Ra}_{T}= \mathcal{O}\left(10^{5}\right)$ to confirm that the results in 2D simulations are qualitatively similar to those in 3D simulations. The mean melt rate exhibits a non-monotonic relationship with ambient salinity, initially decreasing towards the point that thermal and saline effects compensate each other, and then increasing again. Based on the ambient salinity, the flow can be categorized into three regimes: temperature-driven flow, salinity-driven flow, and thermal-saline competing flow. In the temperature-driven and competing flow regimes, we find that the mean melt rate follows a $\text{Ra}_{T}^{1/4}$ scaling. In contrast, in the salinity-driven flow regime, we see a transition from a $\text{Ra}_{T}^{1/4}$ to a $\text{Ra}_{T}^{1/3}$ scaling. Additionally, the mean melt rate follows a $\text{Ra}_{S}^{1/3}$ scaling in this regime. The ice cylinder develops distinct morphologies in different flow regimes. In the thermal-saline competing flow regime, distinctive scallop (dimpled) patterns emerge along the ice cylinder due to the competition between thermal buoyancy and saline buoyancy. We observe these scallop patterns to migrate downwards over time, due to local differences in the melt rate, for which we provide a qualitative explanation.</description>

      <title>Consistent Interface Capturing Adaptive Reconstruction Approach for Viscous Compressible Multicomponent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper proposes a physically consistent numerical discretization approach for simulating viscous compressible multicomponent flows. It has two main contributions. First, a contact discontinuity (and material interface) detector is developed. In those regions of contact discontinuities, the THINC (Tangent of Hyperbola for INterface Capturing) approach is used for reconstructing appropriate variables (phasic densities). For other flow regions, the variables are reconstructed using the Monotonicity-preserving (MP) scheme (or Weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme (WENO)). For reconstruction in the characteristic space, the THINC approach is used only for the contact (or entropy) wave and volume fractions and for the reconstruction of primitive variables, the THINC approach is used for phasic densities and volume fractions only, offering an effective solution for reducing dissipation errors near contact discontinuities. The second contribution is the development of an algorithm that uses a central reconstruction scheme for the tangential velocities, as they are continuous across material interfaces in viscous flows. In this regard, the Ducros sensor (a shock detector that cannot detect material interfaces) is employed to compute the tangential velocities using a central scheme across material interfaces. Using the central scheme does not produce any oscillations at the material interface. The proposed approach is thoroughly validated with several benchmark test cases for compressible multicomponent flows, highlighting its advantages. The numerical results of the benchmark tests show that the proposed method captured the material interface sharply compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Non-dissipative large-eddy simulation of wall-bounded transcritical turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A posteriori analysis based upon a recently proposed non-dissipative large-eddy simulation framework for transcritical wall-bounded turbulence has been carried out. Due to the complexities arisen in such flows, the discretization requires kinetic-energy- and pressure-equilibrium-preservation schemes to yield stable and non-dissipative scale-resolving simulations. On the basis of this framework, the objectives are to (i) compute wall-resolved and wall-modeled large-eddy simulations of a high-pressure transcritical turbulent channel flow, and (ii) assess the thermofluid performance with respect to a direct numerical simulation. In this regard, three different subgrid-scale stress tensor models have been considered, together with models for the unresolved scales of the filtered pressure transport equation and equation of state. In terms of wall-modeling, models based on the "standard law of the wall" and velocity-temperature coupled approaches have been assessed. The results show that for the wall-resolved approaches, the subgrid-scale stress tensors examined slightly deviate from the time-averaged velocity and temperature reference profiles. In terms of bulk performance, it has been found that the Nusselt number and skin-friction coefficient are relatively well captured at the cold and hot walls, respectively. While heat transfer phenomena are fairly well reproduced, particularly the Prandtl and heat flux trends along wall-normal direction. Additionally, the wall-modeled strategies improve the recovery of first-order statistics, although they do not attain the profile in the log-law region. However, they enhance the wall metrics and the heat flux prediction. It is, thus, concluded that dedicated efforts by the research community are needed to improve the prediction accuracy of existing subgrid-scale and wall models for wall-bounded transcritical turbulence.</description>

      <title>Scalable physics-guided data-driven component model reduction for steady Navier-Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational physics simulation can be a powerful tool to accelerate industry deployment of new scientific technologies. However, it must address the challenge of computationally tractable, moderately accurate prediction at large industry scales, and training a model without data at such large scales. A recently proposed component reduced order modeling (CROM) tackles this challenge by combining reduced order modeling (ROM) with discontinuous Galerkin domain decomposition (DG-DD). While it can build a component ROM at small scales that can be assembled into a large scale system, its application is limited to linear physics equations. In this work, we extend CROM to nonlinear steady Navier-Stokes flow equation. Nonlinear advection term is evaluated via tensorial approach or empirical quadrature procedure. Application to flow past an array of objects at moderate Reynolds number demonstrates $\sim23.7$ times faster solutions with a relative error of $\sim 2.3\%$, even at scales $256$ times larger than the original problem.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Simulations of Tropical Cyclones using Adaptive Mesh Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are powerful, natural phenomena that can severely impact populations and infrastructure. Enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms driving their intensification is crucial for mitigating these impacts. To this end, researchers are pushing the boundaries of TC simulation resolution down to scales of just a few meters. However, higher resolution simulations come with significant computational challenges, increasing both time and energy costs. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is a technique widely used in computational fluid dynamics but has seen limited application in atmospheric simulations. This study explores the use of h-adaptive grids using the spectral element discretization technique to accelerate TC simulations while allowing very high resolutions in certain parts of the domain. By applying AMR to a rapidly intensifying TC test case, we demonstrate that AMR can replicate the results of uniform grid simulations in terms of mean and local wind speed maxima while dramatically reducing computational costs. We show that AMR can speed up dry TC simulations by a factor of 2 - 13 for the set of tested refinement criteria. Additionally, we show that TC intensity changes as resolution is increased and that AMR can deliver high-resolution simulations at the cost of coarser static simulations. Our findings indicate that AMR and spectral element methods are promising tools for enhancing TC simulations.</description>

      <title>Bursting Drops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.04804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For decades, researchers worldwide have investigated phenomena related to natural, artificial oil leakages such as oil drop formation within water bodies, their rise, and oil slick evolution after they breach the water-air interface. Despite this, the event leading to slick formation -the bursting of oil drops at the liquid-air interface has remained unnoticed thus far. In this work, we investigate this and report a counterintuitive jetting reversal that releases a daughter oil droplet inside the bulk as opposed to the upwards shooting jets observed in bursting air bubbles. We show that the daughter droplet size thus produced can be correlated to the bulk liquid properties and that its formation can be suppressed by increasing the bulk viscosity or by the addition of microparticles. We further demonstrate the significance of our results by synthesizing colloidal pickered droplets and show applications of bursting compound drops in double emulsions and studies on raindrop impact on a slick. These results could be immensely transformative for diverse areas, including climatology, oceanic, atmospheric sciences, colloidal synthesis and drug delivery.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Quasi-Integrable Equations from traveling-wave data using the Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to study vortex solutions in the 2+1 dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations. These solutions include the regularized long-wave (RLW) equation and the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation, which are toy models of the geostrophic shallow water model in the planetary atmosphere. PINNs successfully solve these equations in the forward process and the solutions are obtained using the mesh-free approach and automatic differentiation while accounting for conservation laws. In the inverse process, the proper equations can be successfully derived from a given training data. Since these equations have a lot in common, there are situations when substantial misidentification arises during the inverse analysis. We consider PINNs with conservation laws (referred to as cPINNs), deformations of the initial profiles, and a friction approach that provides excellent discrimination of the equations to improve the identification's resolution.</description>

      <title>Mode sensitivity: Connecting Lagrangian coherent structures with modal analysis for fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the relationship between modal representations obtained from data-driven decomposition methods and Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs). Mode sensitivity is used to describe this analysis as an extension of the model sensitivity framework developed by Kasz\'as and Haller (2020). The method, based on the computation of the finite-time-Lyapunov exponent, uses modes from fluid data to compute the amplitude perturbations experienced by fluid particle trajectories along with their sensitivity to initial conditions. Demonstrations of the method are presented with both periodic and turbulent flows, including a kinematic flow model, experimental data from the wake past an oscillating foil, numerical data of the classical cylinder wake flow, and a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a turbulent channel flow. Mode sensitivity fields reveal both quantitatively and qualitatively how the finite-time Lyapunov exponent fields used to visualize LCSs change due to the influence of modes or external perturbations.</description>

      <title>Mass and energy cascade in collisionless dark matter flow and relevant constraints on the dark matter particle mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.09985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cascade phenomenon is fundamental to turbulence, a typical non-equilibrium system. In turbulence, energy is cascaded from large to small scales, where it is dissipated by fluid viscosity. Using Illustris and Virgo simulations, this paper presents the cascade in non-equilibrium collisionless dark matter flow. The cosmic energy of dark matter decreases with time, as if "dissipated" due to the expanding background. This is facilitated by the energy cascade from large to small haloes via halo merging and from large to small scales in individual haloes via particle migration in fluctuating non-uniform potential, such that the cosmic energy is "dissipated" on small scales. Inverse mass cascade across haloes of different sizes leads to a random walk of haloes in halo mass space. The halo mass function is naturally given by the Fokker-Planck equation for halo random walk. Similarly, the random walk of particles in haloes leads to the distribution of particles. The halo density profile can also be analytically derived. Universal scaling laws were identified for the halo density, mass, and velocity dispersion. The different inner density slopes of simulated haloes can be explained by the nonzero net mass and energy flux in individual haloes. The mass and energy cascade establishes a statistically steady state to continuously release energy and maximize entropy. The key feature of this state is scale-independent rates of cascade such that the statistical structures of the haloes are self-similar and scale-free, and there is no net accumulation of mass and energy on any intermediate scales. Since the waiting time and jumping length for particle random walk depends on the particle mass $m_p$, new mass constraints can be identified as $m_p\ge 10^{-15}$kg or $10^{12}$GeV. This constraint excludes standard WIMPs and suggests a heavy dark matter scenario (superheavy right-handed neutrinos, etc.).</description>

      <title>DeepLag: Discovering Deep Lagrangian Dynamics for Intuitive Fluid Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02425v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the future fluid is vital to extensive areas such as meteorology, oceanology, and aerodynamics. However, since the fluid is usually observed from the Eulerian perspective, its moving and intricate dynamics are seriously obscured and confounded in static grids, bringing thorny challenges to the prediction. This paper introduces a new Lagrangian-Eulerian combined paradigm to tackle the tanglesome fluid dynamics. Instead of solely predicting the future based on Eulerian observations, we propose DeepLag to discover hidden Lagrangian dynamics within the fluid by tracking the movements of adaptively sampled key particles. Further, DeepLag presents a new paradigm for fluid prediction, where the Lagrangian movement of the tracked particles is inferred from Eulerian observations, and their accumulated Lagrangian dynamics information is incorporated into global Eulerian evolving features to guide future prediction respectively. Tracking key particles not only provides a transparent and interpretable clue for fluid dynamics but also makes our model free from modeling complex correlations among massive grids for better efficiency. Experimentally, DeepLag excels in three challenging fluid prediction tasks covering 2D and 3D, simulated and real-world fluids.

      <title>Equivalence between Geometric Frequency and Lagrange Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper shows the equivalence between the geometric frequency of an electric quantity, namely, voltage and current, and the Lagrange derivative of a stream-line of a fluid. The geometric frequency is a concept recently proposed by the author and is a generalization of the instantaneous frequency, a quantity that is particularly important for the analysis and the control of electric power systems. On the other hand, the Lagrange derivative is mostly utilized in fluid dynamics and helps decomposing the time derivative into various components. The paper shows how these components relate to the elements of the geometric frequency. The paper also shows, through a variety of numerical examples, how the decomposition of the Lagrange derivative helps identifying the distortion of the waveform of a measured electric quantity and how this information can be utilized to classify system operating conditions.</description>
