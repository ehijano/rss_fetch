      <title>Convergence of linear solutions through convergence of periodic initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When studying the stability of $T$-periodic solutions to partial differential equations, it is common to encounter subharmonic perturbations, i.e. perturbations which have a period that is an integer multiple (say $n$) of the background wave, and localized perturbations, i.e. perturbations that are integrable on the line. Formally, we expect solutions subjected to subharmonic perturbations to converge to solutions subjected to localized perturbations as $n$ tends to infinity since larger $n$ values force the subharmonic perturbation to become more localized. In this paper, we study the convergence of solutions to linear initial value problems when subjected to subharmonic and localized perturbations. In particular, we prove the formal intuition outlined above; namely, we prove that if the subharmonic initial data converges to some localized initial datum, then the linear solutions converge.</description>

      <title>Some questions about the regularity and the uniqueness of solutions of parabolic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work obtains a fixed-point equation for the solution of linear parabolic partial differential problems based on solutions to heat problems. This is a pointwise equality, so we have required non-standard techniques that involve the study of the sign of certain solutions to linear parabolic problems. This fixed-point equation implies regularity properties of solutions to parabolic problems, not necessarily linear, and this allows us to prove the uniqueness of the solution in three dimensions for the Navier-Stokes problem.</description>

      <title>On an inverse problem for tree-like networks of elastic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the in-plane motion of elastic strings on tree-like network, observed from the 'leaves'. We investigate the inverse problem of recovering not only the physical properties i.e. the 'optical lengths' of each string, but also the topology of the tree which is represented by the edge degrees and the angles between branching edges. To this end use the boundary control method for wave equations established in~\cite{AK,B}. It is shown that under generic assumptions the inverse problem can be solved by applying measurements at all leaves, the root of the tree being fixed.</description>

      <title>On the inverse problem of the two-velocity tree-like graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article the authors continue the discussion in \cite{ALM}
  about inverse problems for second order elliptic and hyperbolic equations
  on metric trees from boundary measurements. In the present paper we prove
  the identifiability of varying densities of a planar tree-like network of
  strings along with the complete information on the graph, i.e. the lengths
  of the edges, the edge degrees and the angles between neighbouring edges.
  The results are achieved using the Titchmarch-Weyl function for the spectral
  problem and the Steklov-Poincar{\'e} operator for the dynamic wave equation
  on the tree. The general result is obtained by a peeling argument which reduces
  the inverse problem layer-by-layer from the leaves to the clamped
  root of the tree.</description>

      <title>Discrete stochastic maximal regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate discrete regularity estimates for a broad class of temporal numerical schemes for parabolic stochastic evolution equations. We provide a characterization of discrete stochastic maximal $\ell^p$-regularity in terms of its continuous counterpart, thereby establishing a unified framework that yields numerous new discrete regularity results. Moreover, as a consequence of the continuous-time theory, we establish several important properties of discrete stochastic maximal regularity such as extrapolation in the exponent $p$ and with respect to a power weight. Furthermore, employing the $H^\infty$-functional calculus, we derive a powerful discrete maximal estimate in the trace space norm $D_A(1-\frac1p,p)$ for $p \in [2,\infty)$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of sequences of solutions, energies functionals, and the first eigenvalues associated with the Finsler $p$-Laplace operator, also known as the anisotropic $p$-Laplace operator on a sequence of bounded cylinders whose length tends to infinity. We prove that the solutions on the bounded cylinders converge to the solution on the cross-section, with a polynomial rate of convergence in the general case and exponential convergence in some special cases. We show that energies on finite cylinders, with the multiplication of a scaling factor, converge to the energy on the cross-section. Finally, we investigate the convergence of the first eigenvalue and, for a specific subclass, we provide the optimal convergence rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the invariance of the Gibbs measure for the defocusing quintic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the real line. This builds on earlier work by Bourgain, who treated the cubic nonlinearity. The key new ingredient is a growth estimate for the infinite-volume $\Phi^{p+1}_1$-measures, which is proven via the stochastic quantization method.</description>

      <title>A recursive method for computing singular solutions in corners with homogeneous Dirichlet-Robin boundary condition with power-law coefficient variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a recursive method for computing asymptotic solutions of the Laplace equation in corner domains with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition on one side and the Robin boundary condition with a power-law coefficient variation with exponent $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}$ on the other side (D-R corner problem). An asymptotic solution of this D-R corner problem is given as the sum of a main term, the solution of either a homogeneous Dirichlet-Neumann (D-N) or Dirichlet-Dirichlet (D-D) corner problem, and a finite or infinite series of the associated higher-order shadow terms by using harmonic basis functions with power-logarithmic terms. To determine this series of shadow terms, it is shown that the recursive procedures based on recursive non-homogeneous D-N or D-D corner problems are always convergent for $\alpha &gt; -1$ or $\alpha &lt; -1$, respectively. For the critical case $\alpha=-1$, the closed form expression of the asymptotic solution is given. Asymptotic solutions for several relevant D-R corner problems are derived and analysed. Two of these examples are applied to the problem of bridged cracks in antiplane Mode III in linear elastic fracture mechanics. The results presented can be applied to many other physical and engineering applications, such as heat transfer with the thermal resistance condition, acoustics and electrostatics with the impedance condition, and elasticity and structural analysis with the Winkler spring boundary condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For hyperbolic Monge-Amp\`ere systems, a well-known solution of the equivalence problem yields two invariant tensors, ${S}_1$ and ${S}_2$, defined on the underlying $5$-manifold, where ${S}_2=0$ characterizes systems that are Euler-Lagrange. In this article, we consider the `opposite' case, ${S}_1 = 0$, and show that the local generality of such systems is `$2$ arbitrary functions of $3$ variables'. In addition, we classify all $S_1=0$ systems with cohomogeneity at most one, which turn out to be linear up to contact transformations.</description>

      <title>Soliton resolution for the coupled complex short pulse equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the long-time asymptotics of the solution to the Cauchy problem of ccSP (coupled complex short pulse) equation on the line for decaying initial data that can support solitons. The ccSP system describes ultra-short pulse propagation in optical fibers, which is a completely integrable system and posses a $4\times4$ matrix Wadati--Konno--Ichikawa type Lax pair. Based on the $\bar{\partial}$-generalization of the Deift--Zhou steepest descent method, we obtain the long-time asymptotic approximations of the solution in two kinds of space-time regions under a new scale $(\zeta,t)$. The solution of the ccSP equation decays as a speed of $O(t^{-1})$ in the region $\zeta/t&gt;\varepsilon$ with any $\varepsilon&gt;0$; while in the region $\zeta/t&lt;-\varepsilon$, the solution is depicted by the form of a multi-self-symmetric soliton/composite breather and $t^{-1/2}$ order term arises from self-symmetric soliton/composite breather-radiation interactions as well as an residual error order $O(t^{-1}\ln t)$.</description>

      <title>Surface plasmons in metamaterial cavities: Scattering by obstacles with negative wave speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study scattering by metamaterials with negative indices of refraction, which are known to support \emph{surface plasmons} -- long-lived states that are highly localized at the boundary of the cavity. This type of states has found uses in a variety of modern technologies. In this article, we study surface plasmons in the setting of non-trapping cavities; i.e. when all billiard trajectories outside the cavity escape to infinity. We characterize the indices of refraction which support surface plasmons, show that the corresponding resonances lie super-polynomially close to the real axis, describe the localization properties of the corresponding resonant states, and give an asymptotic formula for their number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the null-controllability of a system of {\em mixed parabolic-elliptic pdes} at any given time $T&gt;0$. More precisely, we consider the \textit{Kuramoto-Sivashinsky--Korteweg-de Vries equation} coupled with a second order elliptic equation posed in the interval $(0,1)$. We first show that the linearized system is globally null-controllable by means of a localized interior control acting on either the KS-KdV or the elliptic equation. Using the \textit{Carleman approach}, we provide the existence of a control with the explicit cost $Ce^{C/T}$ with some constant $C&gt;0$ independent in $T$. Then, applying the source term method followed by the \textit{Banach fixed point theorem}, we conclude the small-time local null-controllability result of the nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Concavity and perturbed concavity for $p$-Laplace equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study convexity properties for quasilinear Lane-Emden-Fowler equations of the type $$\begin{cases} -\Delta_p u = a(x) u^q &amp; \quad \hbox{ in $\Omega$},\\ u &gt;0 &amp; \quad \hbox{ in $\Omega$}, \\ u =0 &amp; \quad \hbox{ on $\partial \Omega$}, \end{cases}$$ when $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is a convex domain. In particular, in the subhomogeneous case $q \in [0,p-1]$, the solution $u$ inherits concavity properties from $a$ whenever assumed, while it is proved to be concave up to an error if $a$ is near to a constant. More general problems are also taken into account, including a wider class of nonlinearities. These results generalize some contained in [Kennington, Indiana Univ. Math. J., 1985] and [Sakaguchi, Ann. Sc. Norm. Super. Pisa, 1987].
  Additionally, some results for the singular case $q \in [-1,0)$ and the superhomogeneous case $q&gt;p-1$, $q \approx p-1$ are obtained. Some properties for the $p$-fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^s_p$, $s\in (0,1)$, $s \approx 1$, are shown as well.
  We highlight that some results are new even in the semilinear framework $p=2$; in some of these cases, we deduce also uniqueness (and nondegeneracy) of the critical point of $u$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an elementary new proof of the hot spots conjecture for L-shaped domains. This result, in addition to a new eigenvalue inequality, allows us to locate the hot spots in Swiss cross translation surfaces. We then prove, in several cases, that first mixed Dirichlet-Neumann eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on L-shaped domains also have no interior critical points. As a combination of these results, we prove the hot spots conjecture for five classes of domains tiled by L-shaped domains, including a class of non-simply connected domains. An interesting feature of the proofs is that we make positive use of the lack of regularity of eigenfunctions on non-convex polygons.</description>

      <title>A hot spots theorem for the mixed eigenvalue problem with small Dirichlet region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that on convex domains, first mixed Laplace eigenfunctions have no interior critical points if the Dirichlet region is connected and sufficiently small. We also find two seemingly new estimates on the first mixed eigenvalue to give explicit examples of when the Dirichlet region is sufficiently small.</description>

      <title>Fitting parameters of a Fokker-Planck-like equation with constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse a Fokker-Planck like equation, driven by a scalar parameter in order to reach an integral constraint. We exhibit criteria guaranteeing existence-uniqueness of a solution. We also provide counter-examples. This problem is motivated by an application to the immune control of tumor growth.</description>

      <title>Regularity and positivity of solutions of the Consensus-Based Optimization equation: unconditional global convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introduced in 2017 \cite{B1-pinnau2017consensus}, Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) has rapidly emerged as a significant breakthrough in global optimization. This straightforward yet powerful multi-particle, zero-order optimization method draws inspiration from Simulated Annealing and Particle Swarm Optimization. Using a quantitative mean-field approximation, CBO dynamics can be described by a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation with degenerate diffusion, which does not follow a gradient flow structure.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that solutions to the CBO equation remain positive and maintain full support. Building on this foundation, we establish the {\it unconditional} global convergence of CBO methods to global minimizers. Our results are derived through an analysis of solution regularity and the proof of existence for smooth, classical solutions to a broader class of drift-diffusion equations, despite the challenges posed by degenerate diffusion.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems for semilinear elliptic equations with low regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a general nonlinearity $a(x,u)$ is uniquely determined, possibly up to a gauge, in a neighborhood of a fixed solution from boundary measurements of the corresponding semilinear equation. The main theorems are low regularity counterparts of the results in Johansson-Nurminen-Salo (2023).</description>

      <title>Global hypoellipticity of systems of Fourier multipliers on compact Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the characterization of global hypoellipticity for $G$-invariant operators on homogeneous vector bundles obtained by Cardona and Kowacs [J. Pseudo-Differ. Oper. Appl. 16, 23 (2025)] to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for an arbitrary system of left-invariant operators on a compact Lie group to be globally hypoelliptic, providing a full proof independent of the bundle structure of that paper. We then prove alternative sufficient conditions for globally hypoellipticity for a large class of particular cases of systems making use of lower bounds for the smallest singular value of complex matrices.</description>

      <title>The stability threshold for 3D MHD equations around Couette with rationally aligned magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address a stability threshold problem of the Couette flow $(y,0,0)$ in a uniform magnetic fleld $\alpha(\sigma,0,1)$ with $\sigma\in\mathbb{Q}$ for the 3D MHD equations on $\mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$. Previously, the authors in \cite{L20,RZZ25} obtained the threshold $\gamma=1$ for $\sigma\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ satisfying a generic Diophantine condition, where they also proved $\gamma = 4/3$ for a general $\sigma\in\mathbb{R}$. In the present paper, we obtain the threshold $\gamma=1$ in $H^N(N&gt;13/2)$, hence improving the above results when $\sigma$ is a rational number. The nonlinear inviscid damping for velocity $u^2_{\neq}$ is also established. Moreover, our result shows that the nonzero modes of magnetic field has an amplification of order $\nu^{-1/3}$ even on low regularity, which is very different from the case considered in \cite{L20,RZZ25}.</description>

      <title>Inequalities between Neumann and Dirichlet Laplacian eigenvalues on planar domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize a classical inequality between the eigenvalues of the Laplacians with Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions on bounded, planar domains: in 1955, Payne proved that below the $k$-th eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian there exist at least $k + 2$ eigenvalues of the Neumann Laplacian, provided the domain is convex. It has, however, been conjectured that this should hold for any domain. Here we show that the statement indeed remains true for all simply connected planar Lipschitz domains. The proof relies on a novel variational principle.</description>
