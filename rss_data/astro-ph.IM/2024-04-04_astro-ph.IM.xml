      <title>Data availability and requirements relevant for the Ariel space mission and other exoplanet atmosphere applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this white paper is to provide a snapshot of the data availability and data needs primarily for the Ariel space mission, but also for related atmospheric studies of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. It covers the following data-related topics: molecular and atomic line lists, line profiles, computed cross-sections and opacities, collision-induced absorption and other continuum data, optical properties of aerosols and surfaces, atmospheric chemistry, UV photodissociation and photoabsorption cross-sections, and standards in the description and format of such data. These data aspects are discussed by addressing the following questions for each topic, based on the experience of the "data-provider" and "data-user" communities: (1) what are the types and sources of currently available data, (2) what work is currently in progress, and (3) what are the current and anticipated data needs. We present a GitHub platform for Ariel-related data, with the goal to provide a go-to place for both data-users and data-providers, for the users to make requests for their data needs and for the data-providers to link to their available data. Our aim throughout the paper is to provide practical information on existing sources of data whether in databases, theoretical, or literature sources.</description>

      <title>Astrophotonics: recent and future developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophotonics is a burgeoning field that lies at the interface of photonics and modern astronomical instrumentation. Here we provide a pedagogical review of basic photonic functions that enable modern instruments, and give an overview of recent and future applications. Traditionally, optical fibres have been used in innovative ways to vastly increase the multiplex advantage of an astronomical instrument, e.g. the ability to observe hundreds or thousands of stars simultaneously. But modern instruments are using many new photonic functions, some emerging from the telecom industry, and others specific to the demands of adaptive optics systems on modern telescopes. As telescopes continue to increase in size, we look to a future where instruments exploit the properties of individual photons. In particular, we envisage telescopes and interferometers that build on international developments in quantum networks, the so-called quantum internet. With the aid of entangled photons and quantum logic gates, the new infrastructures seek to preserve the photonic state and timing of individual photons over a coherent network.</description>

      <title>Efficient ultra-broadband low-resolution astrophotonic spectrographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadband low-resolution near-infrared spectrographs in a compact form are crucial for ground- and space-based astronomy and other fields of sensing. Astronomical spectroscopy poses stringent requirements including high efficiency, broad band operation ($&gt;$ 300 nm), and in some cases, polarization insensitivity. We present and compare experimental results from the design, fabrication, and characterization of broadband (1200 - 1650 nm) arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) spectrographs built using the two most promising low-loss platforms - Si$_3$N$_4$ (rectangular waveguides) and doped-SiO$_2$ (square waveguides). These AWGs have a resolving power ($\lambda/\Delta\lambda$) of ~200, a free spectral range of ~ 200-350 nm, and a small footprint of ~ 50-100 mm$^2$. The peak overall (fiber-chip-fiber) efficiency of the doped-SiO$_2$ AWG was ~ 79\% (1 dB), and it exhibited a negligible polarization-dependent shift compared to the channel spacing. For Si$_3$N$_4$ AWGs, the peak overall efficiency in TE mode was ~ 50\% (3 dB), and the main loss component was found to be fiber-to-chip coupling losses. These broadband AWGs are key to enabling compact integrations such as multi-object spectrographs or dispersion back-ends for other astrophotonic devices such as photonic lanterns or nulling interferometers.</description>

      <title>Adaptation of the Phase Distance Correlation Periodogram to Account for Measurement Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an improvement of the phase distance correlation (PDC) periodogram to account for uncertainties in the time-series data. The PDC periodogram, which we introduced in previous papers, is based on the statistical concept of distance correlation. By viewing each measurement and its accompanying error estimate as a probability distribution, we use the concept of energy distance to design a distance function (metric) between measurement-uncertainty pairs. We use this metric as the basis for the PDC periodogram, instead of the simple absolute difference. We demonstrate the periodogram performance using both simulated and real-life data. This adaptation makes the PDC periodogram much more useful, and it can be helpful for the exploration of large time-resolved astronomical databases, from Gaia radial velocity and photometry data releases to those of smaller surveys, such as APOGEE and LAMOST. We have made a public GitHub repository with a Python implementation of the new tools available to the community.</description>

      <title>Polarimetric differential imaging with VLT/NACO. A comprehensive PDI pipeline for NACO data (PIPPIN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed diversity of exoplanets can possibly be traced back to the planet formation processes. Planet-disk interactions induce sub-structures in the circumstellar disk that can be revealed via scattered light observations. However, a high-contrast imaging technique such as polarimetric differential imaging (PDI) must first be applied to suppress the stellar diffraction halo. In this work we present the PDI PiPelIne for NACO data (PIPPIN), which reduces the archival polarimetric observations made with the NACO instrument at the Very Large Telescope. Prior to this work, such a comprehensive pipeline to reduce polarimetric NACO data did not exist. We identify a total of 243 datasets of 57 potentially young stellar objects observed before NACO's decommissioning. The PIPPIN pipeline applies various levels of instrumental polarisation correction and is capable of reducing multiple observing setups, including half-wave plate or de-rotator usage and wire-grid observations. A novel template-matching method is applied to assess the detection significance of polarised signals in the reduced data. In 22 of the 57 observed targets, we detect polarised light resulting from a scattering of circumstellar dust. The detections exhibit a collection of known sub-structures, including rings, gaps, spirals, shadows, and in- or outflows of material. Since NACO was equipped with a near-infrared wavefront sensor, it made unique polarimetric observations of a number of embedded protostars. This is the first time detections of the Class I objects Elia 2-21 and YLW 16A have been published. Alongside the outlined PIPPIN pipeline, we publish an archive of the reduced data products, thereby improving the accessibility of these data for future studies.</description>

      <title>Signals for invisible matter from solar-terrestrial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The composition of the dark universe although hypothesised, remains one of the biggest mysteries in modern physics. On smaller scales, there are various solar puzzling phenomena which known physics cannot explain like the coronal heating problem, the origin of sunspots, the trigger mechanism of solar flares, but also the open issue since the 1850's on the planetary impact of the active Sun. At the same time, several terrestrial observations in the dynamic Earth's atmosphere such as the ionospheric ionisation around December are unexpected within conventional physics. Following this work, the suggested common solution of all these conventionally unexplained phenomena is based on an external triggering caused by low-speed streaming constituents from the dark sector, being gravitationally focused or deflected by the Sun and the orbiting planets. Evidence in support of this hypothesis and on the existence of one or more streams or clusters has been provided based on a coincidence analysis of long-term astrophysical and planetary datasets. Of note, the planetary correlation is the novel key signature. Finally, a redefined strategy for direct Dark Matter searches focused on streaming Dark Matter is proposed. This novel procedure has been successfully implemented in the CAST-CAPP detector at CERN searching for Dark Matter axions.</description>

      <title>Fast marginalization algorithm for optimizing gravitational wave detection, parameter estimation and sky localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm to marginalize the likelihood for a gravitational wave signal from a quasi-circular binary merger over its extrinsic parameters, accounting for the effects of higher harmonics and spin-induced precession. The algorithm takes as input the matched-filtering time series of individual waveform harmonics against the data in all operational detectors, and the covariances of the harmonics. The outputs are the Gaussian likelihood marginalized over extrinsic parameters describing the merger time, location and orientation, along with samples from the conditional posterior of these parameters. Our algorithm exploits the waveform's known analytical dependence on extrinsic parameters to efficiently marginalize over them using a single waveform evaluation. Our current implementation achieves a 10% precision on the marginalized likelihood within $\approx 50$ ms on a single CPU core and is publicly available through the package `cogwheel`. We discuss applications of this tool for gravitational wave searches involving higher modes or precession, efficient and robust parameter estimation, and generation of sky localization maps in low latency for electromagnetic followup of gravitational-wave alerts. The inclusion of higher modes can improve the distance measurement, providing an advantage over existing low-latency localization methods.</description>

      <title>Solar synthetic imaging: Introducing denoising diffusion probabilistic models on SDO/AIA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the rarity of significant solar flares compared to smaller ones, training effective machine learning models for solar activity forecasting is challenging due to insufficient data. This study proposes using generative deep learning models, specifically a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), to create synthetic images of solar phenomena, including flares of varying intensities. By employing a dataset from the AIA instrument aboard the SDO spacecraft, focusing on the 171 {\AA} band that captures various solar activities, and classifying images with GOES X-ray measurements based on flare intensity, we aim to address the data scarcity issue. The DDPM's performance is evaluated using cluster metrics, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and F1-score, showcasing promising results in generating realistic solar imagery. We conduct two experiments: one to train a supervised classifier for event identification and another for basic flare prediction, demonstrating the value of synthetic data in managing imbalanced datasets. This research underscores the potential of DDPMs in solar data analysis and forecasting, suggesting further exploration into their capabilities for solar flare prediction and application in other deep learning and physical tasks.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable lasers: investigations of crystalline mirrors and closed cycle cooling at 124 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated crystalline AlGaAs/GaAs optical coatings with three ultra-stable cavities operating at 4 K, 16 K, 124 K and 297 K. The response of the resonance frequencies of cavities to variations in optical power indicates effects beyond the photo-thermo-optic effect observed in dielectric coatings. These effects are strongly dependent on the intensity of the intracavity light at 1.5~\textmu m. When the rear side of the mirrors is illuminated with external light, we observe a prominent photo-modified birefringence for photon energies above the GaAs bandgap, which points to a possible mechanism relating our observations to the semiconductor properties of the coatings. Separately, we also present a low maintenance evolution of our 124 K silicon cavity system where the liquid nitrogen based cooling system is replaced with closed cycle cooling from a pulse-tube cryo-cooler.</description>

      <title>An Error-Bounded Lossy Compression Method with Bit-Adaptive Quantization for Particle Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents error-bounded lossy compression tailored for particle datasets from diverse scientific applications in cosmology, fluid dynamics, and fusion energy sciences. As today's high-performance computing capabilities advance, these datasets often reach trillions of points, posing significant visualization, analysis, and storage challenges. While error-bounded lossy compression makes it possible to represent floating-point values with strict pointwise accuracy guarantees, the lack of correlations in particle data's storage ordering often limits the compression ratio. Inspired by quantization-encoding schemes in SZ lossy compressors, we dynamically determine the number of bits to encode particles of the dataset to increase the compression ratio. Specifically, we utilize a k-d tree to partition particles into subregions and generate ``bit boxes'' centered at particles for each subregion to encode their positions. These bit boxes ensure error control while reducing the bit count used for compression. We comprehensively evaluate our method against state-of-the-art compressors on cosmology, fluid dynamics, and fusion plasma datasets.</description>

      <title>Optimal Fitting and Debiasing for Detectors Read Out Up-the-Ramp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper derives the optimal fit to a pixel's count rate in the case of an ideal detector read out nondestructively in the presence of both read and photon noise. The approach is general for any readout scheme, provides closed-form expressions for all quantities, and has a computational cost that is linear in the number of resultants (groups of reads). I also derive the bias of the fit from estimating the covariance matrix and show how to remove it to first order. The ramp-fitting algorithm I describe provides the $\chi^2$ value of the fit of a line to the accumulated counts, which can be interpreted as a goodness-of-fit metric. I provide and describe a pure Python implementation of these algorithms that can process a 10-resultant ramp on a $4096 \times 4096$ detector in $\approx$8 seconds with bias removal on a single core of a 2020 Macbook Air. This Python implementation, together with tests and a tutorial notebook, are available at \url{https://github.com/t-brandt/fitramp}. A companion paper describes a jump detection algorithm based on hypothesis testing of ramp fits and demonstrates all algorithms on data from JWST.</description>

      <title>Windows on the Universe: Establishing the Infrastructure for a Collaborative Multi-messenger Ecosystem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this White Paper, we present recommendations for the scientific community and funding agencies to foster the infrastructure for a collaborative multi-messenger and time-domain astronomy (MMA/TDA) ecosystem. MMA/TDA is poised for breakthrough discoveries in the coming decade. In much the same way that expanding beyond the optical bandpass revealed entirely new and unexpected discoveries, cosmic messengers beyond light (i.e., gravitational waves, neutrinos, and cosmic rays) open entirely new windows to answer some of the most fundamental questions in (astro)physics: heavy element synthesis, equation of state of dense matter, particle acceleration, etc. This field was prioritized as a frontier scientific pursuit in the 2020 Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics via its "New Windows on the Dynamic Universe" theme. MMA/TDA science presents technical challenges distinct from those experienced in other disciplines. Successful observations require coordination across myriad boundaries -- different cosmic messengers, ground vs. space, international borders, etc. -- all for sources that may not be well localized, and whose brightness may be changing rapidly with time. Add that all of this work is undertaken by real human beings, with distinct backgrounds, experiences, cultures, and expectations, that often conflict. To address these challenges and help MMA/TDA realize its full scientific potential in the coming decade (and beyond), the second in a series of community workshops sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and NASA titled "Windows on the Universe: Establishing the Infrastructure for a Collaborative Multi-Messenger Ecosystem" was held on October 16-18, 2023 in Tucson, AZ. Here we present the primary recommendations from this workshop focused on three key topics -- hardware, software, and people and policy. [abridged]</description>

      <title>FLUID: A rocket-borne pathfinder instrument for high efficiency UV band selection imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Far- and Lyman-Ultraviolet Imaging Demonstrator (FLUID) is a rocket-borne arcsecond-level ultraviolet (UV) imaging instrument covering four bands between 92 -- 193 nm. FLUID will observe nearby galaxies to find and characterize the most massive stars that are the primary drivers of the chemical and dynamical evolution of galaxies, and the co-evolution of the surrounding galactic environment. The FLUID short wave channel is designed to suppress efficiency at Lyman-$\alpha$ (121.6 nm), while enhancing the reflectivity of shorter wavelengths. Utilizing this technology, FLUID will take the first ever images of local galaxies isolated in the Lyman ultraviolet (90 -- 120 nm). As a pathfinder instrument, FLUID will employ and increase the TRL of band-selecting UV coatings, and solar-blind UV detector technologies including microchannel plate and solid state detectors; technologies prioritized in the 2022 NASA Astrophysical Biennial Technology Report. These technologies enable high throughput and high sensitivity observations in the four co-aligned UV imaging bands that make up the FLUID instrument. We present the design of FLUID, status on the technology development, and results from initial assembly and calibration of the FLUID instrument.</description>

      <title>Thermal control of long delay lines in a high-resolution astrophotonic spectrograph</title>

Abstract: High-resolution astronomical spectroscopy carried out with a photonic Fourier transform spectrograph (FTS) requires long asymmetrical optical delay lines that can be dynamically tuned. For example, to achieve a spectral resolution of R = 30,000, a delay line as long as 1.5 cm would be required. Such delays are inherently prone to phase errors caused by temperature fluctuations. This is due to the relatively large thermo-optic coefficient and long lengths of the waveguides, in this case composed of SiN, resulting in thermally dependent changes to the optical path length. To minimize phase error to the order of 0.05 radians, thermal stability of the order of 0.05{\deg} C is necessary. A thermal control system capable of stability such as this would require a fast thermal response and minimal overshoot/undershoot. With a PID temperature control loop driven by a Peltier cooler and thermistor, we minimized interference fringe phase error to +/- 0.025 radians and achieved temperature stability on the order of 0.05{\deg} C. We present a practical system for precision temperature control of a foundry-fabricated and packaged FTS device on a SiN platform with delay lines ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 cm in length using inexpensive off-the-shelf components, including design details, control loop optimization, and considerations for thermal control of integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Beyond radial profiles: Using log-normal distributions to model the multiphase circumgalactic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03717</link>

Abstract: Recent observations and simulations reveal that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding galaxies is multiphase, with the gas temperatures spanning a wide range at most radii, $\sim 10^4\ {\rm K}$ to the virial temperature ($\sim 10^6$ K for Milky Way). Traditional CGM models using simple density profiles are inadequate at reproducing observations that indicate a broad temperature range. Alternatively, a model based on probability distribution functions (PDFs) with parameters motivated by simulations can better match multi-wavelength observations. In this work, we use log-normal distributions, commonly seen in the simulations of the multiphase interstellar and circumgalactic media, to model the multiphase CGM. We generalize the isothermal background model by Faerman et al. 2017 to include more general CGM profiles. We extend the existing probabilistic models from 1D-PDFs in temperature to 2D-PDFs in density-temperature phase space and constrain its parameters using a Milky Way-like {\tt Illustris TNG50-1} halo. We generate various synthetic observables such as column densities of different ions, UV/X-ray spectra, and dispersion and emission measures. X-ray and radio (Fast Radio Burst) observations mainly constrain the hot gas properties. However, interpreting cold/warm phase diagnostics is not straightforward since these phases are patchy, with inherent variability in intercepting these clouds along arbitrary lines of sight. We provide a tabulated comparison of model predictions with observations and plan to expand this into a comprehensive compilation of models and data. Our modeling provides a simple analytic framework that is useful for describing important aspects of the multiphase CGM.</description>

      <title>How much information can be extracted from galaxy clustering at the field level?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present optimal Bayesian field-level cosmological constraints from nonlinear tracers of the large-scale structure, specifically the amplitude $\sigma_8$ of linear matter fluctuations inferred from rest-frame simulated dark matter halos in a comoving volume of $8\,(h^{-1}\mathrm{Gpc})^3$. Our constraint on $\sigma_8$ is entirely due to nonlinear information, and obtained by explicitly sampling the initial conditions along with bias and noise parameters via a Lagrangian EFT-based forward model, LEFTfield. The comparison with a simulation-based inference analysis employing the power spectrum and bispectrum -- likewise using the LEFTfield forward model -- shows that, when including precisely the same modes of the same data up to $k_{\mathrm{max}}= 0.10\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ ($0.12\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), the field-level approach yields a factor of 3.5 (5.2) improvement on the $\sigma_8$ constraint, from 20.0% to 5.7% (17.0% to 3.3%). This study provides direct insights into cosmological information encoded in galaxy clustering beyond low-order $n$-point functions.</description>

      <title>Observations of the Polarized Solar Corona during the Annular Eclipse of October 14, 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results of a dual eclipse expedition to observe the solar corona from two sites during the annular solar eclipse of 2023 October 14, using a novel coronagraph designed to be accessible for amateurs and students to build and deploy. The coronagraph "CATEcor" builds on the standardized eclipse observing equipment developed for the Citizen CATE 2024 experiment. The observing sites were selected for likelihood of clear observations, for historic relevance (near the Climax site in the Colorado Rocky Mountains), and for centrality to the annular eclipse path (atop Sandia Peak above Albuquerque, New Mexico). The novel portion of CATEcor is an external occulter assembly that slips over the front of a conventional dioptric telescope, forming a "shaded-truss" externally occulted coronagraph. CATEcor is specifically designed to be easily constructed in a garage or "makerspace" environment. We successfully observed some bright features in the solar corona to an altitude of approximately 2.25 R$_\odot$ during the annular phases of the eclipse. Future improvements to the design, in progress now, will reduce both stray light and image artifacts; our objective is to develop a design that can be operated successfully by amateur astronomers at sufficient altitude even without the darkened skies of a partial or annular eclipse.</description>
