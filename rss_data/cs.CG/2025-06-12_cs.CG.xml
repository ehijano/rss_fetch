      <title>Straight-line Orthogonal Drawing of Complete Ternary Tree Requires $O(n^{1.032})$ Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve a conjecture posed by Covella, Frati and Patrignani by proving the straight-line orthogonal drawing of the complete ternary tree with $n$ nodes satisfying the subtree separation property with smallest area has area $\Omega(n^{1.031})$. We also improve the upper bound of this area to $O(n^{1.032})$.</description>

      <title>Power Diagram Enhanced Adaptive Isosurface Extraction from Signed Distance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting high-fidelity mesh surfaces from Signed Distance Fields has become a fundamental operation in geometry processing. Despite significant progress over the past decades, key challenges remain namely, how to automatically capture the intricate geometric and topological structures encoded in the zero level set of SDFs. In this paper, we present a novel isosurface extraction algorithm that introduces two key innovations: 1. An incrementally constructed power diagram through the addition of sample points, which enables repeated updates to the extracted surface via its dual regular Delaunay tetrahedralization; and 2. An adaptive point insertion strategy that identifies regions exhibiting the greatest discrepancy between the current mesh and the underlying continuous surface. As the teaser figure shows, our framework progressively refines the extracted mesh with minimal computational cost until it sufficiently approximates the underlying surface. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms sofa methods, particularly for models with intricate geometric variations and complex topologies.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized contextuality is a hallmark of nonclassical theories like quantum mechanics. Yet, three fundamental computational problems concerning its decidability and complexity remain open. First, determining the complexity of deciding if a theory admits a noncontextual ontological model; Second, determining the complexity of deciding if such a model is possible for a specific dimension $k$; Third, efficiently computing the smallest such model when it exists, given that finding the smallest ontological model is NP-hard. We address the second problem by presenting an algorithm derived from a geometric formulation and its reduction to the intermediate simplex problem in computational geometry. We find that the complexity of deciding the existence of a noncontextual ontological model of dimension $k$ is at least exponential in the dimension of the theory and at most exponential in $k$. This, in turn, implies that computing the smallest noncontextual ontological model is inefficient in general. Finally, we demonstrate the fundamental difference between finding the smallest noncontextual ontological model and the smallest ontological model using an explicit example wherein the respective minimum ontic sizes are five and four.</description>

      <title>Don't be Afraid of Cell Complexes! An Introduction from an Applied Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell complexes (CCs) are a higher-order network model deeply rooted in algebraic topology that has gained interest in signal processing and network science recently. However, while the processing of signals supported on CCs can be described in terms of easily-accessible algebraic or combinatorial notions, the commonly presented definition of CCs is grounded in abstract concepts from topology and remains disconnected from the signal processing methods developed for CCs. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by providing a simplified definition of CCs that is accessible to a wider audience and can be used in practical applications. Specifically, we first introduce a simplified notion of abstract regular cell complexes (ARCCs). These ARCCs only rely on notions from algebra and can be shown to be equivalent to regular cell complexes for most practical applications. Second, using this new definition we provide an accessible introduction to (abstract) cell complexes from a perspective of network science and signal processing. Furthermore, as many practical applications work with CCs of dimension 2 and below, we provide an even simpler definition for this case that significantly simplifies understanding and working with CCs in practice.</description>

      <title>Crossing numbers of dense graphs on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide upper and lower bounds on the crossing numbers of dense graphs on surfaces, which match up to constant factors. First, we prove that if $G$ is a dense enough graph with $m$ edges and $\Sigma$ is a surface of genus $g$, then any drawing of $G$ on $\Sigma$ incurs at least $\Omega \left(\frac{m^2}{g} \log ^2 g\right)$ crossings. The poly-logarithmic factor in this lower bound is new even in the case of complete graphs and disproves a conjecture of Shahrokhi, Sz\'ekely and Vrt'o from 1996. Then we prove a geometric converse to this lower bound: we provide an explicit family of hyperbolic surfaces such that for any graph $G$, sampling the vertices uniformly at random on this surface and connecting them with shortest paths yields $O\left(\frac{m^2}{g} \log ^2 g\right)$ crossings in expectation.</description>

      <title>Graphs with single interval Cayley configuration spaces in 3-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a conjectured graph theoretic characterization of a geometric property of 3 dimensional linkages posed 15 years ago by Sitharam and Gao, motivated by their equivalent characterization for $d\le 2$ that does not generalize to $d\ge 3$. A linkage $(G,\ell)$ contains a finite simple undirected graph $G$ and a map $\ell$ that assigns squared Euclidean lengths to the edges of $G$. A \emph{$d$-realization} of $(G,\ell)$ is an assignment of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to the vertices of $G$ for which pairwise squared distances between points agree with $\ell$. For any positive integer $d \leq 3$, we characterize pairs $(G,f)$, where $f$ is a nonedge of $G$, such that, for any linkage $(G,\ell)$, the lengths attained by $f$ form a single interval - over the (typically a disconnected set of) $d$-realizations of $(G,\ell)$.
  Although related to the minor closed class of $d$-flattenable graphs, the class of pairs $(G,f)$ with the above property is not closed under edge deletions, has no obvious well quasi-ordering, and there are infinitely many minimal graph-nonedge pairs - with respect to edge contractions - in the complement class. Our characterization overcomes these obstacles, is based on the forbidden minors for $d$-flattenability for $d \leq 3$, and contributes to the theory of Cayley configurations with many applications. Helper results and corollaries provide new tools for reasoning about configuration spaces and completions of partial 3-tree linkages, (non)convexity of Euclidean measurement sets in $3$-dimensions, their projections, fibers and sections. Generalizations to higher dimensions and efficient algorithmic characterizations are conjectured.</description>
