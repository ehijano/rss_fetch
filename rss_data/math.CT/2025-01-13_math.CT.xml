      <title>Skein Construction of Balanced Tensor Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of tensor categories has found applications across various fields, including representation theory, quantum field theory (conformal in 2 dimensions, and topological in 3 and 4 dimensions), quantum invariants of low-dimensional objects, topological phases of matter, and topological quantum computation. In essence, it is a categorification of the classical theory of algebras and modules. In this analogy, the Deligne tensor product $\boxtimes$ is to the linear tensor $\otimes_{\mathbb{C}}$ as the balanced tensor product $\boxtimes_C$ is to the tensor over algebra $\otimes_A$, where $\mathbb{C}$ is a field, $A$ is a $\mathbb{C}$-algebra, and $C$ is a tensor category.
  Before this work, several algebraic constructions for balanced tensor products were known, including categories of modules, internal Hom spaces, and generalized categorical centers. In this paper, we introduce a topological construction based on skein theory that offers a better mix of algebra and topology. This approach not only works for products of multiple module categories, but also provides the missing key to proving that the Turaev-Viro state sum model naturally arises from the 3-functor in the classification of fully extended field theories. Building on this result, we establish this long-anticipated proof in an upcoming work.</description>

      <title>The homological spectrum via definable subcategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an alternative approach to the homological spectrum of a tensor-triangulated category through the lens of definable subcategories. This culminates in a proof that the homological spectrum is homeomorphic to a quotient of the Ziegler spectrum. Along the way, we characterise injective objects in homological residue fields in terms of the definable subcategory corresponding to a given homological prime. We use these results to give a purity perspective on the relationship between the homological and Balmer spectrum.</description>

      <title>Arrow algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce arrow algebras, simple algebraic structures which induce elementary toposes through the tripos-to-topos construction. This includes localic toposes as well as various realizability toposes, in particular, those realizability toposes which are obtained from partial combinatory algebras. Since there are many examples of arrow algebras and arrow algebras have a number of closure properties, including a notion of subalgebra given by a nucleus, arrow algebras provide a flexible tool for constructing toposes; we illustrate this by providing some general tools for creating toposes for Kreisel's modified realizability.</description>

      <title>Drazin Inverses in Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drazin inverses are a fundamental algebraic structure which have been extensively deployed in semigroup theory, ring theory, and matrix theory. Drazin inverses can also be defined for endomorphisms in any category. However, beyond a paper by Puystjens and Robinson from 1987, not much has been done with Drazin inverses in category theory. Here we provide a survey of the theory of Drazin inverses from a categorical perspective. We introduce Drazin categories, in which every endomorphism has a Drazin inverse, and provide various examples including the category of matrices over a field, the category of finite length modules over a ring, and finite set enriched categories. We also introduce the notion of expressive rank and prove that a category with expressive rank is Drazin. Moreover, we study Drazin inverses in mere categories, in additive categories, and in dagger categories. In an arbitrary category, we show how a Drazin inverse corresponds to an isomorphism in the idempotent splitting, as well as explain how Drazin inverses relate to Leinster's notion of eventual image duality. In additive categories, we consider core-nilpotent decompositions, image-kernel decompositions, and Fitting decompositions. We also develop the notion of Drazin inverses for pairs of opposing maps, generalizing the usual notion of Drazin inverse for endomorphisms. As an application of this new kind of Drazin inverse, for dagger categories, we provide a novel characterization of the Moore-Penrose inverse in terms of being a Drazin inverse of the pair of a map and its adjoint.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Theorems of Calculus and Zinbiel Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Derivations are linear operators which satisfy the Leibniz rule, while integrations are linear operators which satisfy the Rota-Baxter rule. In this paper, we introduce the notion of an FTC-pair, which consists of an algebra and module with a derivation and integration between them which together satisfy analogues of the two Fundamental Theorems of Calculus. In the special case of when an algebra is seen as a module over itself, we show that this sort of FTC-pair is precisely the same thing as an integro-differential algebra. We provide various constructions of FTC-pairs, as well as numerous examples of FTC-pairs including some based on polynomials, smooth functions, Hurwitz series, and shuffle algebras. Moreover, it is well known that integrations are closely related to Zinbiel algebras. The main result of this paper is that the category of FTC-pairs is equivalent to the category of Zinbiel algebras.</description>
