      <title>Uncovering the truth about M101, NGC 3938, and their significant others through radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving the inverse problem in spiral galaxies, that allows the derivation of the spatial distribution of dust, gas and stars, together with their associated physical properties, directly from panchromatic imaging observations, is one of the main goals of this work. To this end we used radiative transfer models to decode the spatial and spectral distribution of the nearby face-on galaxies M101 and NGC 3938. In both cases we provide excellent fits to the surface-brightness distributions derived from GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS, Spitzer and Herschel imaging observations. Together with previous results from M33, NGC 628, M51 and the Milky Way, we obtain a small statistical sample of modelled nearby galaxies that we analyse in this work. We find that in all cases Milky Way-type dust with Draine-like optical properties provide consistent and successful solutions. We do not find any "submm excess", and no need for modified dust-grain properties. Intrinsic fundamental quantities like star-formation rates (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), dust opacities and attenuations are derived as a function of position in the galaxy and overall trends are discussed. In the SFR surface density versus stellar mass surface density space we find a structurally resolved relation (SRR) for the morphological components of our galaxies, that is steeper than the main sequence (MS). Exception to this is for NGC 628, where the SRR is parallel to the MS.</description>

      <title>The effect of outflow launching radial efficiency of accretion disk on the shape of emission-line profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a preliminary investigation into the influence of radial behavior of disk outflow on the structure and dynamics of the broad line region (BLR) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), with the emphasis on how the mass ejection rate contribute in shaping the broad emission line profiles. Specifically, we analyze how varying the radial efficiency of mass loss from accretion disks, driven by radiative dust-based mechanisms, contribute to the distribution of material in the BLR. By exploring different radial scenarios of disk mass loss behavior, we uncover connections between outflow radial efficiency and emission line profiles, particularly for lowly ionized lines. Our findings reveal that while the observed shape of broad emission lines is partially influenced by the radial behavior of the disk outflow, it ultimately depends more critically on the physical conditions of the clouds and the specific approach adopted to the emissivity for their contribution to the line formation.</description>

      <title>Variable gravitational potential of Milky Way analogues in HESTIA suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigations of trajectories of various objects orbiting the Milky Way (MW) halo with modern precision, achievable in observations by GAIA, requires sophisticated, non-stationary models of the Galactic potential. In this paper we analyze the evolution of the spherical harmonics expansion of MW analogues potential in constrained simulations of the Local Group (LG) from the HESTIA suite. We find that at distances $r&gt;50$~kpc the anisotropic part of the potential demonstrates a significant impact of the environment: ignoring the mass distribution outside the virial radius of the MW results in 20\% errors in the potential quadrupole at these distances. Spherical harmonics vary significantly during the last 6 Gyr. We attribute variations of the potential at $r\ge 30$~kpc to the motions of MW satellites and LG galaxies. We also predict that the anisotropy of the real MW potential should grow with distance in the range $r_\mathrm{vir}&lt;r&lt;500$~kpc, since all realizations of simulated MW-like objects demonstrate such a trend.</description>

      <title>Investigating chemical variations between interstellar gas clouds in the Solar neighbourhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) is a fundamental component of the Milky Way. Studying its chemical composition and the level of its chemical diversity gives us insight into the evolution of the Milky Way and the role of gas in the Galactic environment. In this paper, we use a novel simulation technique to model the distribution of total hydrogen between gas components, and therefore derive new constraints on the dust depletion and metallicity. We study individual gas components along the lines of sight towards eight bright O/B stars within 1.1 kpc of the Sun using high-resolution HST/STIS absorption spectra (R sim 114 000). We measure the level of dust depletion for these individual components and find components with higher levels of dust depletion compared to Milky Way sightlines in the literature. We find large ranges in the level of dust depletion among components along lines of sight, up to 1.19 dex. Although it is not possible to directly measure the metallicity of individual components due to the saturated and damped Ly-alpha line, we investigate possible metallicity ranges for individual gas components by exploring many different distributions of the total hydrogen gas between components. We select possible combinations of these gas fractions which produce the minimum metallicity difference between components, and for these cases we determine individual metallicities to accuracies that range between sim 0.1 to 0.4 dex. This work shows that full line-of-sight analyses wash out the level of diversity along lines of sight, and that component-by-component studies give a more in-depth understanding of the chemical intricacies of the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Open cluster dissolution rate and the initial cluster mass function in the solar neighbourhood. Modelling the age and mass distributions of clusters observed by Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The dissolution rate of open clusters (OCs) and integration of their stars into the Milky Way's field population has been previously explored using their age distribution. With the advent of the Gaia mission, we have an exceptional opportunity to revisit and enhance these studies with ages and masses from high quality data. Aims. To build a comprehensive Gaia-based OC mass catalogue which, combined with the age distribution, allows a deeper investigation of the disruption experienced by OCs within the solar neighbourhood. Methods. Masses were determined by comparing luminosity distributions to theoretical luminosity functions. The limiting and core radii of the clusters were obtained by fitting the King function to their observed density profiles. We examined the disruption process through simulations of the build-up and mass evolution of a population of OCs which were compared to the observed mass and age distributions. Results. Our analysis yielded an OC mass distribution with a peak at $log(M)$ = 2.7 dex ($\sim 500 M_{\odot}$), as well as radii for 1724 OCs. Our simulations showed that using a power-law Initial Cluster Mass Function (ICMF) no parameters were able to reproduce the observed mass distribution. Moreover, we find that a skew log-normal ICMF provides a good match to the observations and that the disruption time of a $10^4 M{_\odot}$ OC is $t_4^{tot} = 2.9 \pm 0.4$ Gyr. Conclusions. Our results indicate that the OC disruption time $t_4^{tot}$ is about twice longer than previous estimates based solely on OC age distributions. We find that the shape of the ICMF for bound OCs differs from that of embedded clusters, which could imply a low typical star formation efficiency of $\leq 20\%$ in OCs. Our results also suggest a lower limit of $\sim 60 M{_\odot}$ for bound OCs in the solar neighbourhood.</description>

      <title>The Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment Survey (HETDEX) Active Galactic Nuclei Catalog: the Fourth Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) catalog from the fourth data release (HDR4) of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment Survey (HETDEX). HETDEX is an untargeted spectroscopic survey. HDR4 contains 345,874 Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations from January 2017 to August 2023 covering an effective area of 62.9 deg2. With no imaging pre-selection, our spectroscopic confirmed AGN sample includes low-luminosity AGN, narrow-line AGN, and/or red AGN down to g~25. This catalog has 15,940 AGN across the redshifts of z=0.1~4.6, giving a raw AGN number density of 253.4 deg-2. Among them, 10,499 (66%) have redshifts either confirmed by line pairs or matched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Quasar Catalog. For the remaining 5,441 AGN, 2,083 are single broad line AGN candidates, while the remaining 3,358 are single intermediate broad line (full width at half maximum, FWHM ~ 1200 km s-1) AGN candidates. A total of 4,060 (39%) of the 10,499 redshift-confirmed AGN have emission-line regions $3\sigma$ more extended than the image quality which could be strong outflows blowing into the outskirts of the host galaxies or ionized intergalactic medium.</description>

      <title>Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using radius--luminosity relations involving monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the standardizability of a homogeneous sample of 41 lower-redshift ($0.00415\leq z \leq 0.474$) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reverberation-mapped (RM) using the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines. We find that these sources can be standardized using four radius$-$luminosity ($R-L$) relations incorporating H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ time delays and monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities. Although the $R-L$ relation parameters are well constrained and independent of the six cosmological models considered, the resulting cosmological constraints are weak. The measured $R-L$ relations exhibit slightly steeper slopes than predicted by a simple photoionization model and steeper than those from previous higher-redshift H$\beta$ analyses based on larger datasets. These differences likely reflect the absence of high-accreting sources in our smaller, lower-redshift sample, which primarily comprises lower-accreting AGNs. The inferred cosmological parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ (or better) with those from better-established cosmological probes. This contrasts with our earlier findings using a larger, heterogeneous sample of 118 H$\beta$ AGNs, which yielded cosmological constraints differing by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ from better-established cosmological probes. Our analysis demonstrates that sample homogeneity$-$specifically, the use of a consistent time-lag determination method$-$is crucial for developing RM AGNs as a cosmological probe.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields on different spatial scales of the L328 cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: L328 core has three sub-cores S1, S2, and S3, among which the sub-core S2 contains L328-IRS, a Very Low Luminosity Object (VeLLO), which shows a CO bipolar outflow. Earlier investigations of L328 mapped cloud/envelope (parsec-scale) magnetic fields (B-fields). In this work, we used JCMT/POL-2 submillimeter (sub-mm) polarisation measurements at 850 $\mu$m to map core-scale B-fields in L328. The B-fields were found to be ordered and well-connected from cloud to core-scales, i.e., from parsec- to sub-parsec-scale. The connection in B-field geometry is shown using $Planck$ dust polarisation maps to trace large-scale B-fields, optical and near-infrared (NIR) polarisation observations to trace B-fields in the cloud and envelope, and 850 $\mu$m polarisation mapping core-scale field geometry. The core-scale B-field strength, estimated using the modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi relation, was found to be 50.5 $\pm$ 9.8 $\mu$G, which is $\sim$2.5 times higher than the envelope B-field strength found in previous studies. This indicates that B-fields are getting stronger on smaller (sub-parsec) scales. The mass-to-flux ratio of 1.1 $\pm$ 0.2 suggests that the core is magnetically transcritical. The energy budget in the L328 core was also estimated, revealing that the gravitational, magnetic, and non-thermal kinetic energies were comparable with each other, while thermal energy was significantly lower.</description>

      <title>MPI-Rockstar: a Hybrid MPI and OpenMP Parallel Implementation of the Rockstar Halo finder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18629v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MPI-Rockstar is a massively parallel halo finder based on the Rockstar phase-space temporal halo finder code, which is one of the most extensively used halo finding codes. Compared to the original code, parallelized by a primitive socket communication library, we parallelized it in a hybrid way using MPI and OpenMP, which is suitable for analysis on the hybrid shared and distributed memory environments of modern supercomputers. This implementation can easily handle the analysis of more than a trillion particles on more than 100,000 parallel processes, enabling the production of a huge dataset for the next generation of cosmological surveys. As new functions to the original Rockstar code, MPI-Rockstar supports HDF5 as an output format and can output additional halo properties such as the inertia tensor.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of black holes embedded in halos of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the (axial) quasinormal modes of black holes embedded in generic matter profiles. Our results reveal that the axial QNMs experience a redshift when the black hole is surrounded by various matter environments, proportional to the compactness of the matter halo. Our calculations demonstrate that for static black holes embedded in galactic matter distributions, there exists a universal relation between the matter environment and the redshifted vacuum quasinormal modes. In particular, for dilute environments the leading order effect is a redshift $1+U$ of frequencies and damping times, with $U \sim -{\cal C}$ the Newtonian potential of the environment at its center, which scales with its compactness ${\cal C}$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Post-Collision of Fuzzy Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) equations, fuzzy dark matter (FDM) can form a stable equilibrium configuration, the so-called FDM soliton. The SP system can also determine the evolution of FDM solitons, such as head-on collision. In this paper, we first propose a new adimensional unit of length, time and mass. And then, we simulate the adimensional SP system with $\mathtt{PyUltraLight}$ to study the GWs from post-collision of FDM solitons when the linearized theory is valid and the GW back reaction on the evolution of FDM solitons is ignored. Finally, we find that the GWs from post-collisions have a frequency of (few ten-years)$^{-1}$ or (few years)$^{-1}$ when FDM mass is $m=10^{-18}\rm{eV}/c^2$ or $m=10^{-17}\rm{eV}/c^2$. Therefore, future detection of such GWs will constrain the property of FDM particle and solitons.</description>

      <title>The possible long-term periodic variability of the extremely luminous quasar WISE J090924.01+000211.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extremely luminous infrared galaxy (ELIRG), WISE J090924.01+000211.1 (hereafter; WISE J0909+0002, $z=1.87$) is an extraordinary object with a quasar aspect. This study performs monitoring observations of WISE J0909+0002 with the 105 cm Murikabushi telescope, Okayama and Akeno 50 cm telescopes/MITSuME ($g'$, $R_{\rm c}$, and $I_{\rm c}$ bands), and the SaCRA 55 cm telescope/MuSaSHI ($r$, $i$, and $z$ bands). We obtain the following results by combining the UV/optical light curves of the CRTS, Pan-STARRS, and ZTF archive data, and our observational data: (1) the light curves of WISE J0909+0002 present quasi-periodic (sinusoidal) oscillations with the rest-frame period of $\sim$ 660$-$689 day; (2) the structure functions of WISE J0909+0002 do not show a damped random walk (DRW) trend; (3) the mock DRW light curves present periodic-like trend on rare occasions in 10000 simulations; (4) the relativistic boost scenario is favored, since the relation between variability amplitude and power-law slope ratio is consistent with the theoretical prediction of this scenario, and a substantial parameter space exists between the inclination angles and the black hole mass; (5) the circumbinary disk model is difficult to explain the spectral energy distribution of our target; (6) the significant radio flux density of WISE J0909+0002 is not detected from the VLA FIRST Survey, thus the radio jet precession scenario is ruled out. From our results, the Doppler boost scenario is likely as a cause of the periodic variability, consequently the quasi-periodic oscillations in WISE J0909+0002 is possibly interpreted by a supermassive blackhole binary. Additional observations to investigate the continuity of the periodic trend would bring new insights into mechanisms of the quasi-periodic oscillations and/or ELIRGs.</description>

Abstract: The distance to the stars is a fundamental parameter, which is determined via two primary methods - parallax and luminosity. While the parallax is a direct trigonometric method, the luminosity distance is usually influenced by interstellar extinction. As long as the optical properties of dust grains are wavelength-dependent this contamination can be corrected. With increasing grain size, however, the extinction properties become grey, i.e. they contribute at wavelengths but can no longer be detected by photometry. However, as the grain size increases, the extinction properties become grey, meaning these particles contribute by a constant at wavelengths below 1 mic, making them undetectable by photometry in the optical. In this study, we compare the parallactic and luminosity distances of a pristine sample of 33 well-known early-type stars with non-peculiar reddening curves and find that the luminosity distance overestimates the parallactic distance in 80% of the cases. This discrepancy can be removed when incorporating a population of large, submicrometer-sized dust grains in a dust model that provides grey extinction which diminishes the luminosity distance accordingly.</description>

      <title>RUBIES: JWST/NIRSpec Confirmation of an Infrared-luminous, Broad-line Little Red Dot with an Ionized Outflow</title>

Abstract: The JWST discovery of ``little red dots'' (LRDs) is reshaping our picture of the early Universe, yet the physical mechanisms driving their compact size and UV-optical colors remain elusive. Here we report an unusually bright LRD ($z=3.1$) observed as part of the RUBIES program. This LRD exhibits broad emission lines (FWHM $\sim4000$km/s), a blue UV continuum, a clear Balmer break and a red continuum sampled out to rest 4 $\mu$m with MIRI. We develop a new joint galaxy and AGN model within the Prospector Bayesian inference framework and perform spectrophotometric modeling using NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/Prism observations. Our fiducial model reveals a $M_*\sim 10^9M_\odot$ galaxy alongside a dust-reddened AGN driving the optical emission. Explaining the rest-frame optical color as a reddened AGN requires $A_{\rm v}\gtrsim3$, suggesting that a great majority of the accretion disk energy is re-radiated as dust emission. Yet despite clear AGN signatures, we find a surprising lack of hot torus emission, which implies that either the dust emission in this object must be cold, or the red continuum must instead be driven by a massive, evolved stellar population of the host galaxy -- seemingly inconsistent with the high EW broad lines (H$\alpha$ EW $\sim800$\AA). The widths and luminosities of Pa$\beta$, Pa$\delta$, Pa$\gamma$, and H$\alpha$ imply a modest black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^8M_\odot$. Additionally, we identify a narrow blue-shifted HeI absorption in G395M spectra, signaling an ionized outflow with kinetic energy up to $\sim1$\% the luminosity of the AGN. The low redshift of RUBIES-BLAGN-1 combined with the depth and richness of the JWST imaging and spectroscopic observations provide a unique opportunity to build a physical model for these so-far mysterious LRDs, which may prove to be a crucial phase in the early formation of massive galaxies and their supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Probing cold gas with Mg II and Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer</title>

Abstract: The Mg II resonance doublet at 2796 {\AA} and 2803 {\AA} is an increasingly important tool to study cold, $T \sim 10^{4}\,$K, gas -- an observational driven development requiring theoretical support. We develop a new Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to systematically study the joined Mg II and Ly$\alpha$ escape through homogeneous and `clumpy' multiphase gas with dust in arbitrary 3D geometries. Our main findings are: (i) The Mg II spectrum differs from Ly$\alpha$ due to the large difference in column densities, even though the atomic physics of the two lines are similar. (ii) the Mg II escape fraction is generally higher than that of Ly$\alpha$ because of lower dust optical depths and path lengths -- but large variations due to differences in dust models and the clumpiness of the cold medium exist. (iii) Clumpy media possess a `critical covering factor' above which Mg II radiative transfer matches a homogeneous medium. The critical covering factors for Mg II and Ly$\alpha$ differ, allowing constraints on the cold gas structure. (iv) The Mg II doublet ratio $R_{\rm MgII}$ varies for strong outflows/inflows ($\gtrsim 700 \mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$), in particular, $R_{\rm MgII}&lt;1$ being an unambiguous tracer for powerful galactic winds. (v) Scattering of stellar continuum photons can decrease $R_{\rm MgII}$ from two to one, allowing constraints on the scattering medium. Notably, we introduce a novel probe of the cold gas column density -- the halo doublet ratio -- which we show to be a powerful indicator of ionizing photon escape. We discuss our results in the context of interpreting and modeling observations as well as their implications for other resonant doublets.</description>

      <title>Detection of the [O I] 63 $\mu$m emission line from the $z = 6.04$ quasar J2054-0005</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the highest-redshift detection of [O I] 63 $\mu$m from a luminous quasar, J2054-0005, at $z=6.04$ based on the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array Band 9 observations. The [O I] 63 $\mu$m line luminosity is $(4.5\pm1.5) \times 10^{9}~L_{\rm \odot}$, corresponding to the [O I] 63 $\mu$m-to-far-infrared luminosity ratio of $\approx 6.7\times10^{-4}$, which is consistent with the value obtained in the local universe. Remarkably, [O I] 63 $\mu$m is as bright as [C II] 158 $\mu$m, resulting in the [O I]-to-[C II] line luminosity ratio of $1.3\pm0.5$. Based on a careful comparison of the luminosity ratios of [O I] 63 $\mu$m, [C II] 158 $\mu$m, and dust continuum emission to models of photo-dissociation regions, we find that J2054-0005 has a gas density log($n_{\rm H}$/cm$^{-3}$)$=3.7\pm0.3$ and an incident far-ultraviolet radiation field of log($G/G_{\rm 0}$)$= 3.0\pm0.1$, showing that [O I] 63 $\mu$m serves as an important coolant of the dense and warm gas in J2054-0005. A close examination of the [O I] and [C II] line profiles suggests that the [O I] line may be partially self-absorbed, however deeper observations are needed to verify this conclusion. Regardless, the gas density and incident radiation field are in a broad agreement with the values obtained in nearby star-forming galaxies and objects with [O I] 63 $\mu$m observations at $z=1-3$ with the Herschel Space Observatory. These results demonstrate the power of ALMA high-frequency observations targeting [O I] 63 $\mu$m to examine the properties of photo-dissociation regions in high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters within some theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14280v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass of galaxy clusters (GCs) can be determined by calculating the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. In this work, we derive the hydrostatic mass of GCs within Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory, beyond Horndeski gravity (BHG), and modified emergent Newtonian gravity (MENG) with generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) correction. We apply the formulations on the masses of 10 GCs. We compare our results with the Newtonian mass of GCs. Within a regime, we get an insight that all formulations could match the Newtonian mass. Thus, the impact of the modified theories of gravity used in this work can be neglected in this regime. The noteworthy impact starts if we set $\kappa=5\times10^{40}$ m$^2$ for EiBI theory, $\Upsilon=-0.1655\times10^{69}$ for BHG, and $\beta_0=-1.656\times10^{110}$ for MENG. We also compare our results from EiBI theory and BHG with the baryonic masses $M_{bar}$ of the GCs. A better linear fit is achieved by EiBI theory with $\kappa=5.80\times10^{40}$ m$^2$, which gives the slope $\mathcal{M}$ of $0.126\pm0.086$. This value is closer to unity than the one of BHG. This leads us to the fact that EiBI theory is more effective than BHG in alleviating the mass discrepancy between hydrostatic mass and baryonic mass in GCs. Nevertheless, neither EiBI theory nor BHG completely addresses the mass discrepancy problem.</description>

      <title>MSA-3D: Metallicity Gradients in Galaxies at $z\sim1$ with JWST/NIRSpec Slit-stepping Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radial gradient of gas-phase metallicity is a powerful probe of the chemical and structural evolution of star-forming galaxies, closely tied to disk formation and gas kinematics in the early universe. We present spatially resolved chemical and dynamical properties for a sample of 25 galaxies at $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.7$ from the \msasd survey. These innovative observations provide 3D spectroscopy of galaxies at a spatial resolution approaching JWST's diffraction limit and a high spectral resolution of $R\simeq2700$. The metallicity gradients measured in our galaxy sample range from $-$0.03 to 0.02 dex~kpc$^{-1}$. Most galaxies exhibit negative or flat radial gradients, indicating lower metallicity in the outskirts or uniform metallicity throughout the entire galaxy. We confirm a tight relationship between stellar mass and metallicity gradient at $z\sim1$ with small intrinsic scatter of 0.02 dex~kpc$^{-1}$. Our results indicate that metallicity gradients become increasingly negative as stellar mass increases, likely because the more massive galaxies tend to be more ``disky". This relationship is consistent with the predictions from cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations with strong stellar feedback. This work presents the effort to harness the multiplexing capability of JWST NIRSpec/MSA in slit-stepping mode to map the chemical and kinematic profiles of high-redshift galaxies in large samples and at high spatial and spectral resolution.</description>

      <title>The initial mass function of stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial mass function (IMF) is one of the most important functions in astrophysics because it is key to reconstructing the cosmological matter cycle, understanding the formation of super-massive black holes, and deciphering the light from high-redshift observations. The IMF's dependency on the physical conditions of the gas and its connection to the galaxy-wide IMF connects the molecular clumps to the cosmological scale. The extraction of the IMF from observational data requires a thorough understanding of stellar evolution, the time-dependent stellar multiplicity, the stellar-dynamical evolution of dense stellar populations, and the structures, star formation histories, and chemical enrichment histories of galaxies. The IMF in galaxies, referred to as the galaxy-wide IMF (gwIMF), and the IMF in individual star-forming regions (the stellar IMF) need not be the same, although the former must be related to the latter. Observational surveys inform on whether star-forming regions provide evidence for the stellar IMF being a probability density distribution function. They may also indicate star formation to optimally follow an IMF shaped by the physical conditions of the star-forming gas. Both theoretical and observational evidence suggest a relationship between the initial mass function of brown dwarfs and that of stars. Late-type stars may arise from feedback-regulated fragmentation of molecular cloud filaments, which build up embedded clusters. In contrast, early-type stars form under more violent accretion and feedback-regulated conditions near the centers of these clusters. The integration over all star-forming molecular cloud clumps and their stellar IMFs in a galaxy via the IGIMF theory yields its gwIMF which sensitively depends on the physical properties of the molecular cloud clumps and the range of their masses that depends on the SFR of the galaxy.</description>

      <title>Implication of a galaxy-scale negative feedback by one of the most powerful multi-phase outflows in a hyper-luminous infrared galaxy at the intermediate redshift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Powerful, galactic outflows driven by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are commonly considered as a main mechanism to regulate star formation in massive galaxies. Ultra- and hyper-luminous IR galaxies (U/HyLIRGs) are thought to represent a transition phase of galaxies from a rapidly growing period to a quiescent status as gas swept out by outflows, providing a laboratory to investigate outflows and their feedback effects on the hosts. In this paper we report recent Gemini and ALMA observations of a HyLIRG, J1126 at $z=0.46842$, which has been identified with a puzzling co-existence of a fast ionized outflow ($&gt;2000$ km s$^{-1}$) and an intense starburst (star formation rate of 800 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). The Gemini observation shows the fast ionized outflow is extended to several kpc with a mass-loss rate of 180 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. A massive molecular outflow with a high mass-loss rate (2500 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is revealed by ALMA. The multi-phase outflows show large factors of momentum boost and loading of kinetic power, indicating a driving by thermal pressure of a nuclear hot wind and/or radiation pressure of a highly obscured AGN. In addition to ejection of kinetic energy, it is also found that the powerful outflow can induce an ionizing shock in the galaxy disk and enhance the excitation and dissociation of molecular gas. The powerful outflow probably results in an instantaneous negative feedback and shows potential to regulate the host growth in a long term.</description>

Abstract: Recent observations by JWST have revealed supersolar $^{14}$N abundances in galaxies at very high redshift. On the other hand, these galaxies show subsolar metallicity. The observed N/O ratios are difficult to reproduce in the framework of chemical evolution models for the Milky Way. Our aim is to reproduce these high N/O ratios with chemical evolution models assuming different histories of star formation triggering galactic winds coupled with detailed nucleosynthesis prescriptions for $^{14}$N, $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O and $^{56}$Fe. We compute several models for small galaxies ($10^{9}\text{ - }10^{10}\text{ M}_{\odot}$) with high star formation efficiency and strong galactic winds. These winds are assumed to be differential, carrying out mainly the products of the explosion of core-collapse supernovae. We find that only models with high star formation rates, normal initial mass function, and differential galactic winds can reproduce the observed chemical abundances. We also find that with the same assumptions about star formation and galactic winds, but with a very rapid formation resulting from fast gas infall, we can also reproduce the estimated ages of these objects. We find no necessity to invoke peculiar nucleosynthesis from Population III stars, very massive stars and supermassive stars.</description>

      <title>The supermassive black hole population from seeding via collisions in Nuclear Star Clusters</title>

Abstract: The coexistence of nuclear star clusters (NSCs) and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galaxies with stellar masses $\sim 10^{10}~$M$_\odot$, the scaling relations between their properties and properties of the host galaxy (e.g., $M_{NSC}^{stellar}-M_{galaxy}^{stellar}$, $M_{BH}-M_{galaxy}^{stellar}$), and the fact that NSCs seem to take on the role of SMBHs in less massive galaxies and vice versa in the more massive ones, suggest that the origin of NSCs and SMBHs is related. In this study, we implement an 'in-situ' NSC formation scenario, where NSCs are formed in the center of galaxies due to star formation in the accumulated gas. We explore the impact of the free parameter $A_{res}$ which regulates the amount of gas transferred to the NSC reservoir, playing a crucial role in shaping the cluster's growth. Simultaneously, we include a BH seed formation recipe based on stellar collisions within NSCs in the Semi-Analytical Model (SAM) Galacticus to explore the resulting population of SMBHs. We determine the parameter space of the NSCs that form a BH seed and find that in initially more compact NSCs the formation of these BH seeds is more favorable, leading to the formation of light, medium and heavy BH seeds which finally reach masses up to $\sim 10^9$~M$_\odot$ and is comparable with the observed SMBH mass function at masses above $10^8$~M$_\odot$. Additionally, we compare the resulting population of NSCs with a derived NSC mass function from the stellar mass function of galaxies from the GAMA survey at $z&lt;0.06$ finding a well agreement in shape terms. We also find a considerable overlap in the observed scaling relations between the NSC mass, and the host galaxy stellar mass and velocity dispersion which is independent of the value of $A_{res}$. However, the chi-square analysis suggests that the model requires further refinement to achieve better quantitative agreement.</description>

      <title>Study of the physical and chemical properties of dense clumps at different evolutionary stages in several regions of massive star and stellar cluster formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive stars play an important role in the Universe. Unlike low-mass stars, the formation of these objects located at great distances is still unclear. It is expected to be governed by some combination of self-gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields. In this work, we aim to study the chemical and physical conditions of dense clumps at different evolutionary stages. We performed observations towards 5 regions of massive star and stellar cluster formation (L1287, S187, S231, DR 21(OH), NGC 7538) with the IRAM-30m telescope. We covered the 2 and 3$-$4 mm wavelength bands and analysed the lines of HCN, HNC, HCO$^+$, HC$_3$N, HNCO, OCS, CS, SiO, SO$_2$, and SO. Using astrodendro algorithm on the 850 $\mu$m dust emission data from the SCUBA Legacy catalogue, we determined the masses, H$_2$ column densities, and sizes of the clumps. Furthermore, the kinetic temperatures, molecular abundances, and dynamical state were obtained. The Red Midcourse Space Experiment Source survey (RMS) was used to determine the clump types. A total of 20 clumps were identified. Three clumps were found to be associated with the Hii regions, 10 with young stellar objects (YSOs), and 7 with submillimetre emission. The clumps have typical sizes of about 0.2 pc and masses ranging from 1 to $10^{2}\,M_\odot$, kinetic temperatures ranging from 20 to 40 K and line widths of $\rm H^{13}CO^{+} (1-0)$ approximately 2 $\rm km\,s^{-1}$. We found no significant correlation in the line width$-$size and the line width$-$mass relationships. However, a strong correlation is observed in mass$-$size relationships. The virial analysis indicated that three clumps are gravitationally bound. Furthermore, we suggested that magnetic fields of about 1 mG provide additional support for clump stability. The molecular abundances relative to H$_2$ are approximately $10^{-10}-10^{-8}$.</description>

Abstract: We have constructed a non-relativistic theory of quantum mechanics and gravity based on local modulus symmetry. Our theory has three main new features compared to conventional quantum mechanics and Newtonian gravity. They include a new quantum metric function needed to modify the complex conjugate of the wave function, a gravitational Poisson equation that accounts for part of the gravitational potential energy but not all, and a new background energy term in the quantum particle equation of motion. In an expanding universe, these theoretical features produce new effects that deviate from predictions of conventional quantum mechanics and Newtonian gravity. The quantum metric function yields negligible change for microscopic objects but produces quantum pointer states for macroscopic objects, thus providing a solution to the quantum measurement problem. The extra term in the gravitational potential energy is negligible in smaller bound systems but can become dominant at the galactic scales. Its potential association with the mass discrepancy problem in the galactic systems is discussed. The new background energy term turns out to be half of the Planck constant multiplied by the Hubble constant. It has a peculiar numerical value related to the Planck energy density and the current estimate of the dark energy.</description>

      <title>Extracting Astrophysical Information of Highly-Eccentric Binaries in the Millihertz Gravitational Wave Band</title>

Abstract: Wide, highly eccentric ($e&gt;0.9$) compact binaries can naturally arise as progenitors of gravitational wave (GW) mergers. These systems are expected to have a significant population in the mHz band (e.g., $\sim 3-45$ detectable stellar-mass binary black holes with $e&gt;0.9$ in the Milky Way), with their GW signals characterized by "repeated bursts" emitted upon each pericenter passage. In this study, we show that the detection of mHz GW signals from highly eccentric stellar mass binaries in the local universe can strongly constrain their orbital parameters. Specifically, it can achieve a relative measurement error of $\sim 10^{-6}$ for orbital frequency and $\sim 1\%$ for eccentricity (as $1-e$) in most of the detectable cases. On the other hand, the binary's mass ratio, distance, and intrinsic orbital orientation may be less precisely determined due to degeneracies in the GW waveform. We also perform mock LISA data analysis to evaluate the realistic detectability of highly eccentric compact binaries. Our results show that highly eccentric systems could be efficiently identified when multiple GW sources and stationary Gaussian instrumental noise are present in the detector output. This work highlights the potential of extracting the signal of "bursting'' LISA sources to provide valuable insights into their orbital evolution, surrounding environment, and formation channels.</description>

      <title>Photometric Stellar Parameters for 195,478 Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16930</link>

Abstract: The stellar atmospheric parameters and physical properties of stars in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) are of great significance for the study of exoplanets, stellar activity, and asteroseismology. However, despite extensive effort over the past decades, accurate spectroscopic estimates of these parameters are available for only about half of the stars in the full KIC catalog. In our work, by training relationships between photometric colors and spectroscopic stellar parameters from Gaia DR3, the Kepler Issac-Newton Survey, LAMOST DR10, and APOGEE DR17, we have obtained atmospheric-parameter estimates for over 195,000 stars, accounting for 97$\%$ of the total sample of KIC stars. We obtain 1$\sigma$ uncertainties of 0.1 dex on metallicity [Fe/H], 100 K on effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$, and 0.2 dex on surface gravity log $g$. In addition, based on these atmospheric parameters, we estimated the ages, masses, radii, and surface gravities of these stars using the commonly adopted isochrone-fitting approach. External comparisons indicate that the resulting precision for turn-off stars is 20$\%$ in age; for dwarf stars, it is 0.07 $M_{\odot}$ in mass, 0.05 $R_{\odot}$ in radius, and 0.12 dex in surface gravity; and for giant stars, it is 0.14 $M_{\odot}$ in mass, 0.73 $R_{\odot}$ in radius, and 0.11 dex in surface gravity.</description>
