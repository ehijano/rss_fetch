      <title>Asymptotic properties of maximum composite likelihood estimators for max-stable Brown-Resnick random fields over a fixed-domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Likelihood inference for max-stable random fields is in general impossible because their finite-dimensional probability density functions are unknown or cannot be computed efficiently. The weighted composite likelihood approach that utilizes lower dimensional marginal likelihoods (typically pairs or triples of sites that are not too distant) is rather favored. In this paper, we consider the family of spatial max-stable Brown-Resnick random fields associated with isotropic fractional Brownian fields. We assume that the sites are given by only one realization of a homogeneous Poisson point process restricted to $\mathbf{C}=(-1/2,1/2]^{2}$ and that the random field is observed at these sites. As the intensity increases, we study the asymptotic properties of the composite likelihood estimators of the scale and Hurst parameters of the fractional Brownian fields using different weighting strategies: we exclude either pairs that are not edges of the Delaunay triangulation or triples that are not vertices of triangles.</description>

      <title>BASIC: Bipartite Assisted Spectral-clustering for Identifying Communities in Large-scale Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection, which focuses on recovering the group structure within networks, is a crucial and fundamental task in network analysis. However, the detection process can be quite challenging and unstable when community signals are weak. Motivated by a newly collected large-scale academic network dataset from the Web of Science, which includes multi-layer network information, we propose a Bipartite Assisted Spectral-clustering approach for Identifying Communities (BASIC), which incorporates the bipartite network information into the community structure learning of the primary network. The accuracy and stability enhancement of BASIC is validated theoretically on the basis of the degree-corrected stochastic block model framework, as well as numerically through extensive simulation studies. We rigorously study the convergence rate of BASIC even under weak signal scenarios and prove that BASIC yields a tighter upper error bound than that based on the primary network information alone. We utilize the proposed BASIC method to analyze the newly collected large-scale academic network dataset from statistical papers. During the author collaboration network structure learning, we incorporate the bipartite network information from author-paper, author-institution, and author-region relationships. From both statistical and interpretative perspectives, these bipartite networks greatly aid in identifying communities within the primary collaboration network.</description>

      <title>The level of self-organized criticality in oscillating Brownian motion: $n$-consistency and stable Poisson-type convergence of the MLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For some discretely observed path of oscillating Brownian motion with level of self-organized criticality $\rho_0$, we prove in the infill asymptotics that the MLE is $n$-consistent, where $n$ denotes the sample size, and derive its limit distribution with respect to stable convergence. As the transition density of this homogeneous Markov process is not even continuous in $\rho_0$, the analysis is highly non-standard. Therefore, interesting and somewhat unexpected phenomena occur: The likelihood function splits into several components, each of them contributing very differently depending on how close the argument $\rho$ is to $\rho_0$. Correspondingly, the MLE is successively excluded to lay outside a compact set, a $1/\sqrt{n}$-neighborhood and finally a $1/n$-neigborhood of $\rho_0$ asymptotically. The crucial argument to derive the stable convergence is to exploit the semimartingale structure of the sequential suitably rescaled local log-likelihood function (as a process in time). Both sequentially and as a process in $\rho$, it exhibits a bivariate Poissonian behavior in the stable limit with its intensity being a multiple of the local time at $\rho_0$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of estimators for a regression function based on a sample following a qdistribution. Our approach is nonparametric, using kernel methods built from operations that leverage the properties of q-calculus. Furthermore, under appropriate assumptions, we establish the weak convergence and strong consistency of this family of estimators.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Local Geometric Structure on Manifolds from Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common observation in data-driven applications is that high-dimensional data have a low intrinsic dimension, at least locally. In this work, we consider the problem of point estimation for manifold-valued data. Namely, given a finite set of noisy samples of $\mathcal{M}$, a $d$ dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^D$, and a point $r$ near the manifold we aim to project $r$ onto the manifold. Assuming that the data was sampled uniformly from a tubular neighborhood of a $k$-times smooth boundaryless and compact manifold, we present an algorithm that takes $r$ from this neighborhood and outputs $\hat p_n\in \mathbb{R}^D$, and $\widehat{T_{\hat p_n}\mathcal{M}}$ an element in the Grassmannian $Gr(d, D)$. We prove that as the number of samples $n\to\infty$, the point $\hat p_n$ converges to $\mathbf{p}\in \mathcal{M}$, the projection of $r$ onto $\mathcal{M}$, and $\widehat{T_{\hat p_n}\mathcal{M}}$ converges to $T_{\mathbf{p}}\mathcal{M}$ (the tangent space at that point) with high probability. Furthermore, we show that $\hat p_n$ approaches the manifold with an asymptotic rate of $n^{-\frac{k}{2k + d}}$, and that $\hat p_n, \widehat{T_{\hat p_n}\mathcal{M}}$ approach $\mathbf{p}$ and $T_{\mathbf{p}}\mathcal{M}$ correspondingly with asymptotic rates of $n^{-\frac{k-1}{2k + d}}$.</description>

      <title>Detecting correlation efficiently in stochastic block models: breaking Otter's threshold by counting decorated trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a pair of sparse correlated stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n},\epsilon;s)$ subsampled from a common parent stochastic block model with two symmetric communities, average degree $\lambda=O(1)$ and divergence parameter $\epsilon \in (0,1)$. For all $\epsilon\in(0,1)$, we construct a statistic based on the combination of two low-degree polynomials and show that there exists a sufficiently small constant $\delta=\delta(\epsilon)&gt;0$ and a sufficiently large constant $\Delta=\Delta(\epsilon,\delta)$ such that when $\lambda&gt;\Delta$ and $s&gt;\sqrt{\alpha}-\delta$ where $\alpha\approx 0.338$ is Otter's constant, this statistic can distinguish this model and a pair of independent stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda s}{n},\epsilon)$ with probability $1-o(1)$. We also provide an efficient algorithm that approximates this statistic in polynomial time. The crux of our statistic's construction lies in a carefully curated family of multigraphs called \emph{decorated trees}, which enables effective aggregation of the community signal and graph correlation from the counts of the same decorated tree while suppressing the undesirable correlations among counts of different decorated trees.</description>

      <title>Extremes of structural causal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of extreme observations is well-understood for time series or spatial data, but little is known if the data generating process is a structural causal model (SCM). We study the behavior of extremes in this model class, both for the observational distribution and under extremal interventions. We show that under suitable regularity conditions on the structure functions, the extremal behavior is described by a multivariate Pareto distribution, which can be represented as a new SCM on an extremal graph. Importantly, the latter is a sub-graph of the graph in the original SCM, which means that causal links can disappear in the tails. We further introduce a directed version of extremal graphical models and show that an extremal SCM satisfies the corresponding Markov properties. Based on a new test of extremal conditional independence, we propose two algorithms for learning the extremal causal structure from data. The first is an extremal version of the PC-algorithm, and the second is a pruning algorithm that removes edges from the original graph to consistently recover the extremal graph. The methods are illustrated on river data with known causal ground truth.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for One-Dimensional Homogenized Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two limit theorems, a mean ergodic and a central limit theorem, for a specific class of one-dimensional diffusion processes that depend on a small-scale parameter $\varepsilon$ and converge weakly to a homogenized diffusion process in the limit $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$. In these results, we allow for the time horizon to blow up such that $T_\varepsilon \rightarrow \infty$ as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$. The novelty of the results arises from the circumstance that many quantities are unbounded for $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$, so that formerly established theory is not directly applicable here and a careful investigation of all relevant $\varepsilon$-dependent terms is required. As a mathematical application, we then use these limit theorems to prove asymptotic properties of a minimum distance estimator for parameters in a homogenized diffusion equation.</description>

      <title>Is a Good Foundation Necessary for Efficient Reinforcement Learning? The Computational Role of the Base Model in Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language model alignment (or, reinforcement learning) techniques that leverage active exploration -- deliberately encouraging the model to produce diverse, informative responses -- offer the promise of super-human capabilities. However, current understanding of algorithm design primitives for computationally efficient exploration with language models is limited. To better understand how to leverage access to powerful pre-trained generative models to improve the efficiency of exploration, we introduce a new computational framework for RL with language models, in which the learner interacts with the model through a sampling oracle. Focusing on the linear softmax model parameterization, we provide new results that reveal the computational-statistical tradeoffs of efficient exploration:
  1. Necessity of coverage: Coverage refers to the extent to which the pre-trained model covers near-optimal responses -- a form of hidden knowledge. We show that coverage, while not necessary for data efficiency, lower bounds the runtime of any algorithm in our framework.
  2. Inference-time exploration: We introduce a new algorithm, SpannerSampling, which obtains optimal data efficiency and is computationally efficient whenever the pre-trained model enjoys sufficient coverage, matching our lower bound. SpannerSampling leverages inference-time computation with the pre-trained model to reduce the effective search space for exploration.
  3. Insufficiency of training-time interventions: We contrast the result above by showing that training-time interventions that produce proper policies cannot achieve similar guarantees in polynomial time.
  4. Computational benefits of multi-turn exploration: Finally, we show that under additional representational assumptions, one can achieve improved runtime (replacing sequence-level coverage with token-level coverage) through multi-turn exploration.</description>

      <title>Concentration via Metastable Mixing, with Applications to the Supercritical Exponential Random Graph Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a folklore belief that metastable wells in low-temperature statistical mechanics models exhibit high-temperature behavior. We prove a rigorous version of this phenomenon in the setting of the exponential random graph model (ERGM) through the lens of concentration of measure. To do this, we first present a new general result deriving concentration inequalities in a metastable well from the metastable mixing of a Markov chain with the appropriate stationary distribution, extending a result of Chatterjee [Cha05] which is suited for more traditional forms of global mixing. We then apply this result to the supercritical (low-temperature) ERGM which was recently proven to exhibit metastable mixing by Bresler, Nagaraj, and Nichani [BNN24], and obtain a novel concentration inequality for Lipschitz observables of the supercritical ERGM conditioned on a large metastable well, answering a question posed by [BNN24]. This extends a result of Ganguly and Nam [GN24] from the subcritical (high-temperature) regime to a metastable well in the supercritical regime, and we are also able to extend the applications of their concentration inequality to these metastable wells. Namely, we obtain an upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between the ERGM conditioned on a metastable well and an appropriate Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model, as well as derive a central limit theorem for the count of edges in certain small subcollections of possible edges. Finally, to supplement the mathematical content of the article, we also discuss the results of what appears to be the first simulation study of a metastable well in the supercritical ERGM.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Time to Event Predictions using the Restricted Mean Survival Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The restricted mean survival time (RMST) is a widely used quantity in survival analysis due to its straightforward interpretation. For instance, predicting the time to event based on patient attributes is of great interest when analyzing medical data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for evaluating RMST estimations. A criterion that estimates the mean squared error of an RMST estimator using Inverse Probability Censoring Weighting (IPCW) is presented. A model-agnostic conformal algorithm adapted to right-censored data is also introduced to compute prediction intervals and to evaluate local variable importance. Finally, a model-agnostic statistical test is developed to assess global variable importance. Our framework is valid for any RMST estimator that is asymptotically convergent and works under model misspecification.</description>

Abstract: A very simple example demonstrates that Fisher's application of the conditionality principle to regression ("fixed-$x$ regression"), endorsed by Sprott and many other followers, makes prediction impossible in the context of statistical learning theory. On the other hand, relaxing the requirement of conditionality makes it possible via, e.g., conformal prediction.</description>

      <title>Equality between two general ridge estimators and equivalence of their residual sums of squares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General ridge estimators are typical linear estimators in a general linear model. The class of them includes some shrinkage estimators in addition to classical linear unbiased estimators such as the ordinary least squares estimator and the weighted least squares estimator. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which two general ridge estimators coincide. In particular, two noteworthy conditions are added to those from previous studies. The first condition is given as a seemingly column space relationship to the covariance matrix of the error term, and the second one is based on the biases of general ridge estimators. Another problem studied in this paper is to derive an equivalence condition such that equality between two residual sums of squares holds when general ridge estimators are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems driven by non-linear parabolic partial differential equations with initial condition $\theta$ modelled by a Gaussian process `prior' probability measure. Given discrete samples of the state of the system evolving in space-time, one obtains updated `posterior' measures on a function space containing all possible trajectories. We give a general set of conditions under which these non-Gaussian posterior distributions are approximated, in Wasserstein distance for the supremum-norm metric, by the law of a Gaussian random function. We demonstrate the applicability of our results to periodic non-linear reaction diffusion equations \begin{align*} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} u - \Delta u &amp;= f(u) \\ u(0) &amp;= \theta \end{align*} where $f$ is any smooth and compactly supported reaction function. In this case the limiting Gaussian measure can be characterised as the solution of a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with `rough' Gaussian initial conditions whose covariance operator we describe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study projection determinantal point processes and their connection to the squared Grassmannian. We prove that the log-likelihood function of this statistical model has $(n - 1)!/2$ critical points, all of which are real and positive, thereby settling a conjecture of Devriendt, Friedman, Reinke, and Sturmfels.</description>

      <title>Singularities in bivariate normal mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate mappings $F = (f_1, f_2) \colon \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2 $ where $ f_1, f_2 $ are bivariate normal densities from the perspective of singularity theory of mappings, motivated by the need to understand properties of two-component bivariate normal mixtures. We show a classification of mappings $ F = (f_1, f_2) $ via $\mathcal{A}$-equivalence and characterize them using statistical notions. Our analysis reveals three distinct types, each with specific geometric properties. Furthermore, we determine the upper bounds for the number of modes in the mixture for each type.</description>

      <title>Stochastic orders and shape properties for a new distorted proportional odds model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on recent developments in models focused on the shape properties of odds ratios, this paper introduces two new models that expand the class of available distributions while preserving specific shape characteristics of an underlying baseline distribution. The first model offers enhanced control over odds and log-odds functions, facilitating adjustments to skewness, tail behaviour, and hazard rates. The second model, with even greater flexibility, describes odds ratios as quantile distortions. This approach leads to an enlarged log-logistic family capable of capturing these quantile transformations and diverse hazard behaviours, including non-monotonic and bathtub-shaped rates. Central to our study are the shape relations described through stochastic orders; we establish conditions that ensure stochastic ordering both within each family and across models under various ordering concepts, such as hazard rate, likelihood ratio, and convex transform orders</description>

      <title>Testing LRD in the spectral domain for functional time series in manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A statistical hypothesis test for long range dependence (LRD) is formulated in the spectral domain for functional time series in manifolds. The elements of the spectral density operator family are assumed to be invariant with respect to the group of isometries of the manifold. The proposed test statistic is based on the weighted periodogram operator. A Central Limit Theorem is derived to obtain the asymptotic Gaussian distribution of the proposed test statistic operator under the null hypothesis. The rate of convergence to zero, in the Hilbert--Schmidt operator norm, of the bias of the integrated empirical second and fourth order cumulant spectral density operators is obtained under the alternative hypothesis. The consistency of the test follows from the consistency of the integrated weighted periodogram operator under LRD. Practical implementation of our testing approach is based on the random projection methodology. A simulation study illustrates, in the context of spherical functional time series, the asymptotic normality of the test statistic under the null hypothesis, and its consistency under the alternative. The empirical size and power properties are also computed for different functional sample sizes, and under different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Free Anytime Validity by Sequentializing a Test and Optional Continuation with Tests as Future Significance Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03982v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anytime valid sequential tests permit us to stop and continue testing based on the current data, without invalidating the inference. Given a maximum number of observations $N$, one may believe this must come at the cost of power when compared to a conventional test that waits until all $N$ observations have arrived. Our first contribution is to show that this is false: for any valid test based on $N$ observations, we derive an anytime valid sequential test that matches it after $N$ observations. Our second contribution is that the outcome of a continuously-interpreted test can be used as a significance level in subsequent testing, leading to an overall procedure that is valid at the original significance level. This shows anytime validity and optional continuation are readily available in traditional testing, without requiring explicit use of e-values. We illustrate this by deriving the anytime valid sequentialized $z$-test and $t$-test, which at time $N$ coincide with the traditional $z$-test and $t$-test. Lastly, we show the popular log-optimal sequential $z$-test can be interpreted as desiring a rejection by the traditional $z$-test at some tiny significance level in the distant future.</description>

      <title>Power-Enhanced Two-Sample Mean Tests for High-Dimensional Compositional Data with Application to Microbiome Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Testing differences in mean vectors is a fundamental task in the analysis of high-dimensional compositional data. Existing methods may suffer from low power if the underlying signal pattern is in a situation that does not favor the deployed test. In this work, we develop two-sample power-enhanced mean tests for high-dimensional compositional data based on the combination of $p$-values, which integrates strengths from two popular types of tests: the maximum-type test and the quadratic-type test. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees on the proposed tests, showing accurate Type-I error rate control and enhanced testing power. Our method boosts the testing power towards a broader alternative space, which yields robust performance across a wide range of signal pattern settings. Our theory also contributes to the literature on power enhancement and Gaussian approximation for high-dimensional hypothesis testing. We demonstrate the performance of our method on both simulated data and real-world microbiome data, showing that our proposed approach improves the testing power substantially compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Highly Multivariate Large-scale Spatial Stochastic Processes -- A Cross-Markov Random Field Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Key challenges in the analysis of highly multivariate large-scale spatial stochastic processes, where both the number of components (p) and spatial locations (n) can be large, include achieving maximal sparsity in the joint precision matrix, ensuring efficient computational cost for its generation, accommodating asymmetric cross-covariance in the joint covariance matrix, and delivering scientific interpretability. We propose a cross-MRF model class, consisting of a mixed spatial graphical model framework and cross-MRF theory, to collectively address these challenges in one unified framework across two modelling stages. The first stage exploits scientifically informed conditional independence (CI) among p component fields and allows for a step-wise parallel generation of joint covariance and precision matrix, enabling a simultaneous accommodation of asymmetric cross-covariance in joint covariance matrix and sparsity in joint precision matrix. The second stage extends the first-stage CI to doubly CI among both p and n and unearths the cross-MRF via an extended Hammersley-Clifford theorem for multivariate spatial stochastic processes. This results in the sparsest possible representation of the joint precision matrix and ensures its lowest generation complexity. We demonstrate with 1D simulated comparative studies and 2D real-world data.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of One-Sided Representations for the Generalised Dynamic Factor Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Generalised Dynamic Factor Model (GDFM) under the assumption that the dynamic common component is purely non-deterministic. We show that, under thisassumption, the common shocks - and consequently, the dynamic common component - can be represented in terms of current and past observed variables. This generalises existing results on the so-called "One-Sidedness Problem" of the GDFM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach towards approximating the density-to-pair-density map based on copula theory from statistics. We extend the copula theory to multi-dimensional marginals, and deduce that one can describe any (exact or approximate) pair density by the single-particle density and a copula. We present analytical formulas for the exact copula in scaling limits, numerically compute the copula for dissociating systems with two to four particles in one dimension, and propose accurate approximations of the copula between equilibrium and dissociation for two-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based estimators for functional causal effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose causal effect estimators based on empirical Fr\'{e}chet means and operator-valued kernels, tailored to functional data spaces. These methods address the challenges of high-dimensionality, sequential ordering, and model complexity while preserving robustness to treatment misspecification. Using structural assumptions, we obtain compact representations of potential outcomes, enabling scalable estimation of causal effects over time and across covariates. We provide both theoretical, regarding the consistency of functional causal effects, as well as empirical comparison of a range of proposed causal effect estimators.
  Applications to binary treatment settings with functional outcomes illustrate the framework's utility in biomedical monitoring, where outcomes exhibit complex temporal dynamics. Our estimators accommodate scenarios with registered covariates and outcomes, aligning them to the Fr\'{e}chet means, as well as cases requiring higher-order representations to capture intricate covariate-outcome interactions. These advancements extend causal inference to dynamic and non-linear domains, offering new tools for understanding complex treatment effects in functional data settings.</description>

      <title>Comparing regularisation paths of (conjugate) gradient estimators in ridge regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider standard gradient descent, gradient flow and conjugate gradients as iterative algorithms for minimizing a penalized ridge criterion in linear regression. While it is well known that conjugate gradients exhibit fast numerical convergence, the statistical properties of their iterates are more difficult to assess due to inherent nonlinearities and dependencies. On the other hand, standard gradient flow is a linear method with well known regularizing properties when stopped early. By an explicit non-standard error decomposition we are able to bound the prediction error for conjugate gradient iterates by a corresponding prediction error of gradient flow at transformed iteration indices. This way, the risk along the entire regularisation path of conjugate gradient iterations can be compared to that for regularisation paths of standard linear methods like gradient flow and ridge regression. In particular, the oracle conjugate gradient iterate shares the optimality properties of the gradient flow and ridge regression oracles up to a constant factor. Numerical examples show the similarity of the regularisation paths in practice.</description>
