      <title>On the behavior of a distributed network of capacitive constant phase elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a generalization of integer-order calculus, fractional calculus has seen tremendous applications in the past few years especially in the description of anomalous viscoelastic properties, transport processes in complex media as well as in dielectric and impedance spectroscopy of materials and electrode/electrolyte interfaces. The fractional-order capacitor or constant phase element (CPE) is a fractional-order model with impedance $z_c(s) = 1/(C_{\alpha} s^{\alpha})$ ($s=j \omega$, $C_{\alpha}&gt;0$, $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$) and is widely used in modeling impedance spectroscopy data in dispersive materials. In this study, we investigate the behavior of a network of distributed-order CPEs, each of which described by a Caputo-type time fractional differential equation relating the current on the CPE to its voltage, but with a non-negative, time-invariant weight function $\phi(\alpha)$. The behavior of the distributed-order network in terms of impedance and time-domain response to a constant current excitation is derived for two simple cases of $\phi(\alpha)$: (i) $\phi(\alpha)=1$ for $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$ and zero otherwise, and $(ii)$ $\phi(\alpha) = \sum_i C_{\alpha_i}\, \delta(\alpha-\alpha_i)$ corresponding to the general case of parallel-connected elemental CPEs of different orders $\alpha$, and pseudocapacitances $C_{\alpha}$. Our results show that the overall network is not equivalent to a single CPE, contrary to what would of been expected with ideal capacitors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The longitudinal oscillations of air columns composed of contractions and rarefaction make up sound. Sound amplification is widely used in medical, electronic and communication fields. A simplistic technique for producing and amplifying can be rewarding. In this study, we investigate a simplistic DIY speaker configuration that can be utilized for sound creation and modulation by implementing response of magnets and a solenoid to an oscillating input signal. We use steady state solution of forced simple harmonic oscillator with damping parameters to analyze our design and show its characteristic frequencies. We present an analytical way of obtaining optimal parameters of the setup to theoretically obtain experimental characteristic frequencies and provide an in-depth investigation of the setup.</description>

      <title>Novel crossbar array of silicon nitride resistive memories on SOI enables memristor rationed logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the fabrication of crossbar arrays of silicon nitride resistive memories on silicon-on-insulator substrate and their utilization to realize multi-rationed logic circuits are presented. Typical electrical characterization of the memristors revealed their ability of multi-state operation by the presence of 12 well separated resistance levels. Through a dedicated modeling and fitting procedure of these levels, a reconfigurable logic based on memristor rationed logic scheme is designed and a crossbar integration methodology was proposed. Finally, several circuitry aspects were simulated in SPICE with a silicon nitride SOI crossbar array calibrated model and power optimization prospects were discussed.</description>

      <title>Random Telegraph Noise of MIS and MIOS Silicon Nitride memristors at different resistance states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistive memories (RRAM) are promising candidates for replacing present nonvolatile memories and realizing storage class memories; hence resistance switching devices are of particular interest. These devices are typically memristive, with a large number of discrete resistance levels and in some configurations, they perform as analog memories. Noise studies have been used to enlighten further the resistance switching mechanism in these devices. Recently, a strong interest arose on the noise generated by RRAM/memristors because due to their inherent stochasticity can be used for cryptography and other security applications. In this work, two fully CMOS compatible memristive devices both with silicon nitride as switching material, were examined in terms of multi-level resistance operation. Using appropriate SET/RESET pulse sequences through a flexible analog tuning protocol, four stable resistance states were investigated through random telegraph noise measurements and analysis. A possible model enlightening the role of silicon nitride defects in the observed noise signals at different resistive states is presented.</description>

      <title>Self Biased Integrated Magnonic Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the race towards "beyond 6G" telecommunication platforms, magnonics emerges as a promising solution due to its wide tunability within the FR3 band (7-24 GHz). So far, however, the need for an external magnetic bias field to allow the coherent excitation of spin waves has been a major bottleneck. Conventional bulky electromagnets are power-intensive and challenging to integrate on-chip, restricting magnonic applications largely to academic research. Here, we present the first demonstration of a standalone, tunable magnonic device featuring all-electric input and output, fully integrated on a silicon substrate with a compact footprint of 100 x 150 $\mu$m. The device consists of a CoFeB waveguide equipped with two radio frequency antennas, flanked by a symmetric configuration of T-shaped magnetic flux concentrators and rectangular SmCo permanent micromagnets. By varying the distance D between the flux concentrators and the permanent magnets from 0 to 12 $\mu$m, the transverse bias field can be tuned from 20.5 mT to 11 mT, respectively. This variation directly modulates the dispersion relation of Damon-Eshbach spin wave modes in the CoFeB waveguide. In these proof-of-concept devices, the spin wave frequency band ranges from 3 to 8 GHz, with precise phase shift tuning of up to 120 degrees at 6 GHz achieved by varying D within the 0-8 $\mu$m range. The operational frequency band could even be pushed to higher frequencies through optimized micromagnet engineering.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Strong Cylindrical and Spherical Shock Waves in Solid Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a description of the behaviour of shock-compressed solid materials following the Geometrical Shock Dynamics (GSD) theory. GSD has been successfully applied to various gas dynamics problems, and here we have employed it to investigate the propagation of cylindrically and spherically symmetric converging shock waves in solid materials. The analytical solution of shock dynamics equations has been obtained in strong-shock limit, assuming the solid material to be homogeneous and isotropic and obeying the Mie-Gruneisen equation of state. The non-dimensional expressions are obtained for the velocity of shock, the pressure, the mass density, the particle velocity, the temperature, the speed of sound, the adiabatic bulk modulus, and the change-in-entropy behind the strong converging shock front. The influences as a result of changes in (i) the propagation distance r from the axis or centre (r=0) of convergence, (ii) the Gruneisen parameter, and (iii) the material parameter are explored on the shock velocity and the domain behind the converging shock front. The results show that as the shock focuses at the axis or origin, the shock velocity, the pressure, the temperature, and the change-in-entropy increase in the shock-compressed titanium Ti6Al4V, stainless steel 304, aluminum 6061-T6, etc.</description>

      <title>High performance vacuum annealed beta-(AlxGa1-x)2O3/Ga2O3 HFET with f_T/f_MAX of 32/65 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter reports high performance beta-(AlxGa1-x)2O3/Ga2O3 Heterostructure FET (HFET) with improved regrowth process. Highly scaled I shaped gate have been fabricated with degenerately doped (N++) source/drain contact regrown by ozone molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Aiming to address the limitations observed in previous generation devices, this work incorporates a low-power BCl3/Ar and SF6/Ar plasma etching process to remove the AlGaO barrier layer and Ga2O3 layer respectively before regrowth. Additionally, the surface was cleaned and vacuum annealing was carried out before MBE regrowth to reduce any interface resistance between highly doped regrowth N++ and 2DEG layer. These meticulously designed fabrication steps enabled us to achieve the high DC current 0.5 A/mm at 5V drain bias with 6.1 $\mathrm{\Omega}$.mm on resistance (R\textsubscript{ON}) at V_GS=3V, peak transconductance (g_m) of 110 mS/mm at room temperature (V_DS=15V) and around 0.8 A/mm (V_DS=5V) peak I_ON} at low temperature (100K). Current gain cut-off frequency (f_T) of 32 GHz and peak power gain cut-off frequency (f_MAX) of 65 GHz were extracted from RF measurements. f_T.L_G product was estimated to be 6.1 GHz-$\mu$m for 191 nm L_G and 32 GHz f_T, which is one of the highest reported among Ga2O3 devices. With thicker Al2O3, device shows no current collapse demonstrating first time successful traps passivation with Al2O3 for Ga2O3 devices.</description>

      <title>Tunable Tamm plasmon polariton based planar hot-electron photodetector from O- to U- telecommunication band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing tunable photodetectors that can operate over a wide range of wavelengths and integrating them into integrated circuits is a significant challenge in today's technology. These devices must be miniaturized, inexpensive, and easily manufactured. To address this challenge, we propose the development of a tunable planar hot-electron photodetector based on Tamm plasmon polariton. The tuning of the operational wavelength is achieved by incorporation of a material with a phase transition, Sb2S3, into Tamm plasmon polariton based structure. This allows for tuning of the detection wavelength over a broad range, encompassing all bands of the telecommunications spectrum.</description>

      <title>Exclusive Generation of Single-Atom Sulfur for Ultrahigh Quality Monolayer MoS$_2$ Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparation of high-quality two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is the precondition for realizing their applications. However, the synthesized 2D TMDCs (e.g., MoS$_2$) crystals suffer from low quality due to the massive defects formed during the growth. Here, we report the single-atom sulfur (S1) as a highly reactive sulfur species to grow ultrahigh-quality monolayer MoS$_2$. Derived from battery waste, the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) is found to be exclusive and efficient in releasing S1. The monolayer MoS$_2$ prepared by SPAN exhibits an ultralow defect density of $~7\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ and the narrowest photoluminescence (PL) emission peak with full-width at half-maximum of ~47.11 meV at room temperature. Moreover, the statistical resonance Raman and low-temperature PL results further verify the significantly lower defect density and higher optical quality of SPAN-grown MoS$_2$ than the conventional S-powder-grown samples. This work provides an effective approach for preparing ultrahigh-quality 2D single crystals, facilitating their industrial applications.</description>

      <title>A Corrugated All-Metal Vivaldi Antenna for 5G Phased Array Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a corrugated Vivaldi phased array antenna in the 28 GHz frequency band is proposed for 5G communication applications. The presented configuration features an all-metal antipodal antenna structure with a broad bandwidth ranging from 26 to 30 GHz and beam steering capabilities from -30 to +30 degrees. The proposed antenna consists of a 4x4 array configuration, where each element has dimensions of 6.46x6.46x14.25 mm, resulting in an overall antenna structure with dimensions of 25.84x25.84x14.25 mm. The corrugation method is applied to minimize surface currents, resulting in a reduction in interelement mutual couplings. Therefore, the return loss in the array structure for central elements is decreased, and the antenna gain and radiation efficiency are improved. Moreover, the improved radiation efficiency allows for higher power transmission and reception from an antenna, resulting in potentially higher data rates and better performance.</description>

      <title>Optical Properties of Aluminium-Doped Zinc Oxide Thin Films Synthesized via AACVD Using Nitrogen as a Carrier Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study uses AACVD technology with nitrogen carrier gas to make AZO thin films through which it determines structural, optical, and morphological changes from 0 to 20 percent aluminum doping. The depositions took place at 400 degrees Celsius on soda-lime glass before the samples received an annealing process at 450 degrees Celsius inside a nitrogen chamber. The X-ray diffraction analysis identified superior crystalline structure in films processed with nitrogen gas through their strong signals at the 220, 311 and 222 peaks. The increasing levels of aluminum doping decreased the crystallite dimensions and elevated grain boundary concentrations because of intensified crystal tension and defective structural formation. The profilometry assessment determined film thickness increased mildly from 102 nanometers in undoped ZnO to 115 nanometers in 20 percent aluminum-doped ZnO. The presence of nitrogen annealing in the films led to increased absorbance while the strongest absorbance peaks occurred when the material contained 5 percent dopants. The bandgap energy expanded through the change from undoped ZnO with 3.21 electron volts to 3.33 electron volts at 20 percent aluminum doping which matched Burstein-Moss effect results. The optoelectronic devices gain enhanced optical characteristics from the doping levels exceeding 15 percent.</description>

      <title>Optical bound states in the continuum in subwavelength gratings made of an epitaxial van der Waals material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High refractive index (4.4 at 1100 nm), negligibly small absorption in near-infrared spectral range, and ease of processing make MoSe$_2$ a perfect material for applications in near-infrared photonics. So far, implementation of MoSe$_2$-based photonic structures has been hindered by the lack of large surface MoSe$_2$ substrates. The use of molecular beam epitaxy allows the production of homogeneous layers of MoSe$_2$ with a few-inch surface and a thickness controlled at the sub-nm level. In the present work, we design by theoretical calculations and fabricate by a simple lithography process an ultrathin subwavelength grating out of 42-nm thick, epitaxially-grown MoSe$_2$ layer. Our polarization-resolved reflectivity measurements confirm that the gratings host a peculiar type of a confined optical mode that is a bound state in the continuum. Moreover, the fabricated structures enhance the efficiency of the third harmonic generation by over three orders of magnitude as compared to the unstructured MoSe$_2$ layer. The presented results are promising for the realization of flat, ultra-compact devices for lasing, wavefront control, and higher-order topological states of the light.</description>

Our findings show that these lattices undergo magnetic collapse at higher temperatures than their continuous film counterparts. This behavior is attributed to the additive fabrication process, which induces an inhomogeneous Fe concentration within the lattice building blocks. Moreover, the implantation process creates a magnetic depth profile, enabling temperature-dependent tunability of the magnetic thickness. These additional internal degrees of freedom broaden the design possibilities for magnetic metamaterials, allowing precise fine-tuning of their static and dynamic properties to achieve complex and customizable behaviors.</description>

      <title>Temporal multilayer structures for designing higher-order transfer functions using time-varying metamaterials</title>

Abstract: Temporal metamaterials are artificial materials whose electromagnetic properties change over time. In analogy with spatial media and metamaterials, where their properties change smoothly or abruptly over space, temporal metamaterials can exhibit a smooth variation over time, realizing a temporal non-homogeneous medium, or a stepwise transition, realizing the temporal version of dielectric slabs or multilayer structures. In this Letter, we focus our attention on temporal multilayer structures, and we propose the synthesis of higher-order transfer functions by modeling the wave propagation through a generalized temporal multilayer structure, consisting of a cascade over time of different media. The tailoring of the scattering response of temporal structure as a function of frequency is presented, deriving the corresponding scattering coefficients for a properly designed set of medium properties, i.e., permittivity and permeability, and application time, in analogy with what is typically done in optical and electromagnetic spatial multilayered structures. This allows us to design novel electromagnetic and optical devices with higher-order transfer functions by exploiting the temporal dimension instead of the spatial one.</description>

      <title>Mutual control of critical temperature, RRR, stress, and surface quality for sputtered Nb films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting single quantum logic integrated circuits traditionally exploit magnetron sputtered niobium thin films on silicon oxide substrates. The sputtering depends on multiple process parameters, which dramatically affect mechanical, electrical, and cryogenic properties of Nb thin films. In this work, we focus on the comprehensive relationship study between 200-nm Nb film characteristics and their intrinsic stress. It is shown that there is a critical value of the working pressure pcritical at the fixed sputtering power above which stress in the film relaxes whereas the film properties degrade significantly. Below pcritical one can control intrinsic stress in the wide range from -400 MPa to +600 MPa maintaining perfect film surface with a 0.8 nm roughness (Rq), electrical resistivity less than 20 uOhm*cm, critical superconducting transition temperature above 8.9 K and residual resistance ratio over 6.4. We suggest a modified kinetic model to predict Nb films stress with the linear dependence of high-energy parameters on the working pressure replaced with an exponential one, which allowed reduction of the approximation error from 20 to 8%.</description>

      <title>Spatial-offset pump-probe imaging of nonradiative dynamics at optical resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonradiative photothermal (PT) and photoacoustic (PA) processes have found widespread applications in imaging, stimulation, and therapy. Mapping the generation and propagation of PA and PT waves with resolution is important to elucidate how these fields interact with biological systems. To this end, we introduce spatial offset pump-probe imaging (SOPPI). By spatially offsetting the pump beam and the probe beam, SOPPI can image simultaneously PA and PT wave propagation with nanosecond temporal resolution, micrometer spatial resolution, 65 MHz detection bandwidth, and a sensitivity of 9.9 Pa noise equivalent pressure. We first map the PA and PT evolution from a fiber emitter, and how the wave interacting with a mouse skull and brain slices. SOPPI imaging of PA waves from a tapered fiber with water as an absorber shows a wavelength-dependent generation, evanescent wave generated PA, and back-propagated acoustic Mach Cone. At last, a SOPPI-PACT is developed to reconstruct the pigment distribution inside a zebrafish larva with high precision and signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Demagnetisation effects in single-domain particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the classical laws of magnetism, the shape of magnetically soft objects limits the effective susceptibility. For example, spherical soft magnets cannot display an effective susceptibility larger than 3. Although true for macroscopic multi-domain magnetic materials, we show that magnetic nanoparticles in a single-domain state do not suffer from this limitation. We find that the differences between demagnetisation factors along principal axes are relevant and can influence susceptibility for single-domain particles, but do not limit the susceptibility as in the case for multi-domain particles. We validate this result experimentally on spherical nanoparticles with varying diameter (8 to 150 nm) and varying volume fraction (0.1 to 47 vol%). In agreement with our predictions, we measure susceptibilities largely above 3, in fact up to more than 250, for single-domain particles. Moreover, contrary to an existing model, we find that the susceptibility of non-interacting single-domain particles in a non-magnetic matrix scales simply linearly with the volume fraction of particles.</description>

      <title>Thermal Boundary Resistance Measurement and Analysis Across SiC/SiO2 Interface</title>

Abstract: Silicon Carbide (SiC) is a typical material for third-generation semiconductor. The thermal boundary resistance (TBR) of 4H-SiC/SiO2 interface, was investigated by both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. The structure of 4H-SiC/SiO2 was characterized by using transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The TBR is measured as 8.11*10-8 m2K/W by 3-omega method. Furthermore, the diffuse mismatch model was employed to predict the TBR of different interfaces which is in good agreement with measurements. Heat transport behavior based on phonon scattering perspective was also discussed to understand the variations of TBR across different interfaces. Besides, the intrinsic thermal conductivity of SiO2 thin films (200~1,500 nm in thickness) on 4H-SiC substrates was measured by 3 omega procedure, as 1.42 W/mK at room temperature. It is believed the presented results could provide useful insights on the thermal management and heat dissipation for SiC devices.</description>

      <title>A prelude to the multibeam photoacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The research focuses on the introduction and validation of the lock-in photoacoustics of condensed systems in the presence of two simultaneous probing beams. The experiments, performed on three model systems: a perfect absorber - carbon black membrane, a multilayer system - acrylic coated copper plate, and a luminescent sample - ruby, were aimed at the comparative analysis of the frequency domain photoacoustic responses to a single probe beam (classical approach) and to two probe beams (of different wavelength). A modulation frequency shift criterion allowing the simultaneous acquisition of two independent signals was recognized. No synergistic or cross effects of the two-beam excitation on the photoacoustic signal generation (beam intensity effects or modulation frequency effects) were observed. The multibeam photoacoustic data appear to be (at least) equivalent to classically obtained results for stationary systems. It is expected that the multibeam approach will extend the applicability of photothermal methods to time-dependent systems, where the evolution of distinct absorption bands is of particular interest. An application of the developed method, related to the site-dependent energy storage efficiency of photosynthetically active samples, was described and validated on a three-beam experiment performed on a model Ficus benjamina L. leaf.</description>

      <title>Low Temperature Properties of Low-Loss Macroscopic Lithium Niobate Bulk Acoustic Wave Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate gram scale macroscopic bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators manufactured from plates of piezoelectric lithium niobate. The intrinsic competing loss mechanisms were studied at cryogenic temperature through precision measurements of various BAW modes. Exceptional quality factors were measured for the longitudinal BAW modes in the 1-100 MHz range, with a maximum quality factor of 8.9 million, corresponding to a quality factor $\times$ frequency product of 3.8 $\times 10^{14}$ Hz. Through measurements of the acoustic response to a strong drive tone, anomalous self induced absorption and transparency effects are observed. We show that such observations can be explained by microscopic impurities and defect sites in the crystal bulk by the use of a non linear model of acoustic dissipation. The losses associated with these defects provide the ultimate limit of resonator performance, which could be improved in the future if more pure samples were available.</description>
