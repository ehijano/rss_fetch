      <title>An intuitive model for illustrating the classical Doppler effect equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Doppler effect has many applications in science and engineering fields. Although the format of the classical Doppler effect equation is simple, the derivation for the equation in physics textbooks is not intuitive to many students. This article provides a simple but effective model to illustrate the derivation for the classical Doppler effect equation. This model visualizes frequency, wavelength, and wave speed, which helps students to establish an intuitive and clear understanding of mechanical waves. This model also provides a clear visualization that the wave speed is unchanging in an underlying medium, which is a key point to understand the classical Doppler effect.</description>

      <title>Representing and Analysing Conceptual Understanding of Cloud Physics Using Graph Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of conceptual understanding in cloud physics among 138 learners, ranging from bachelor's students to disciplinary experts and representing diverse academic backgrounds. To do so, we apply the mathematical framework of network analysis. Using a quasi-longitudinal study, we highlight the main changes in metrics associated with knowledge structures and understanding in cloud physics, and with the representation of the discipline and its inherent conceptual complexities. Overall, our results both qualify and quantify the epistemological shift in the description of the life-cycle of a cloud (from the general physics of the water cycle to detailed description of cloud microphysical processes) as learners mature in their understanding of the discipline. A triangulation of data sources with a panel of experts complements and confirms our findings. These can be used by lecturers to tailor their teaching towards the identified expert-like concepts, and by students to anticipate the main complexities in the field during their learning process.</description>
