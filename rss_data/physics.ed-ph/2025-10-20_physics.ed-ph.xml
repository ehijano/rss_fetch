      <title>Investigating High School and Pre-High School Teachers' Perceptions and Experiences Introducing Quantum Concepts: A Survey of QuanTime and other Quantum-related Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the experiences of pre-high and high school teachers in implementing QuanTime and other quantum-related activities aiming to promote quantum literacy and introduce foundational quantum concepts to K-12 students. The ultimate goal is to help prepare a diverse future workforce in quantum information science and technology (QIST). Teachers were divided into two groups: pre-high school (grades 4-8) and high school (grades 9-12). We used a survey featuring 12 Likert-scale questions and 14 open-ended responses to assess teachers' perceptions, engagement, and feedback about engaging in QuanTime and other quantum-related activities. Approximately two-thirds of the teachers responding to the survey implemented QuanTime activities in their classes. High school teachers who responded to the survey were most likely to use activities like Wave-Particle Duality and Electron Transitions while pre-high school teachers showed a strong interest in Art &amp; Polarization. Open-ended feedback highlighted the ease of integrating these activities into existing curricula and the minimal preparation required, making them accessible for educators. The positive reception across both groups indicates that QuanTime and other quantum-related activities are valuable tools for early-age quantum education. By engaging students with quantum concepts from a young age, these activities have the potential to spark interest, which may contribute to their future engagement over time. It can inspire a diverse group of students and has the potential to get them interested in future opportunities in the growing field of QIST.</description>

      <title>Peer Influence on Physics Self-Efficacy and Grades: A comparative study of students in an introductory calculus-based course who typically worked alone or in groups before and during the pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engaging in meaningful collaborations with peers, both inside and outside the classroom, can greatly enhance students' understanding of physics and other STEM disciplines. We analyzed the characteristics of women and men who typically worked alone versus those who collaborated with peers in a calculus-based introductory physics course comparing pre pandemic traditional in-person classes to Zoom based pandemic classes. We discuss our findings by considering students' prior academic preparation, their physics grades and physics self-efficacy, as well as their perceptions of how effective peer collaboration is for their physics self-efficacy. We also compared our results to the first-semester algebra-based introductory physics course.</description>

      <title>Scaling Physical Reasoning with the PHYSICS Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00022v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on advanced reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding competitions. Meanwhile, physics, despite being both reasoning-intensive and essential to real-world understanding, received limited academic and industrial attention. This paper introduces PHYSICS, a dataset containing 16,568 high-quality physics problems spanning subjects and difficulty levels, to facilitate this issue. Specifically, PHYSICS is curated with exercises from over 100 textbooks through a carefully designed pipeline for quality control. It covers five major physics domains: Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Optics, and Modern Physics. It also spans a wide range of difficulty levels, from high school to graduate-level physics courses. To utilize the data for improving and evaluating the model's physical reasoning capabilities, we split the dataset into training and test sets, and provide reasoning paths generated by powerful reasoning models for the training data to facilitate model training. In addition, for the evaluation part, we find that existing evaluation frameworks exhibit biases in aspects such as units, simplification, and precision in physics domain. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we introduce a Rule+Model evaluation framework tailored to physics problems. Our evaluations on current state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models highlight the limitations of current models in handling physics-related tasks. We hope that our dataset and evaluation methodology will jointly advance the development of LLMs in the field of physics.
