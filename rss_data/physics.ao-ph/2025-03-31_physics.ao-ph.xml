      <title>Skilful global seasonal predictions from a machine learning weather model trained on reanalysis data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning weather models trained on observed atmospheric conditions can outperform conventional physics-based models at short- to medium-range (1-14 day) forecast timescales. Here we take the machine learning weather model ACE2, trained to predict 6-hourly steps in atmospheric evolution and which can remain stable over long forecast periods, and assess it from a seasonal forecasting perspective. Applying persisted sea surface temperature (SST) and sea-ice anomalies centred on 1st November each year, we initialise a lagged ensemble of winter predictions covering 1993/1994 to 2015/2016. Over this 23-year period there is remarkable similarity in the patterns of predictability with a leading physics-based model. The ACE2 model exhibits skilful predictions of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) with a correlation score of 0.47 (p=0.02), as well as a realistic global distribution of skill and ensemble spread. Surprisingly, ACE2 is found to exhibit a signal-to-noise error as seen in physics-based models, in which it is better at predicting the real world than itself. Examining predictions of winter 2009/2010 indicates potential limitations of ACE2 in capturing extreme seasonal conditions that extend outside the training data. Nevertheless, this study reveals that machine learning weather models can produce skilful global seasonal predictions and heralds a new era of increased understanding, development and generation of near-term climate predictions.</description>

      <title>Improving prediction of heavy rainfall in the Mediterranean with Neural Networks using both observation and Numerical Weather Prediction data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting Heavy Precipitation Events (HPE) in the Mediterranean is crucial but challenging due to the complexity of the processes involved. In this context, Artificial Intelligence methods have recently proven to be competitive with state-of-the-art Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). This work focuses on improving the prediction of the occurrence of HPE over periods from 1 h to 24 h based on Neural Network (NN) models. The proposed method uses both ground-station observations and data from M\'et\'eo France's Arome and Arpege NWP models, on two regions with oceanic and Mediterranean climates for the period 2016-2018. The verification metric is the Peirce Skill Score. Results show that the NN model using only observations or NWP data performs better for shorter and longer rainfall accumulation period respectively. In contrast, a hybrid method combining both observations and NWP data offers the best performance and remains stable with the rainfall accumulation period. The hybrid method also improves the performance in predicting increasingly intense rainfall, from the 5% to the 0.1% rarest events. The choice of the loss function is found to be an important aspect of this work, where only balanced loss functions provide results insensitive to rare event frequency. Finally, the hybrid method is particularly well suited for the prediction of HPE in the Mediterranean climate, especially during the fall season, period during which most HPE occur.</description>

      <title>LangYa: Revolutionizing Cross-Spatiotemporal Ocean Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ocean forecasting is crucial for both scientific research and societal benefits. Currently, the most accurate forecasting systems are global ocean forecasting systems (GOFSs), which represent the ocean state variables (OSVs) as discrete grids and solve partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the transitions of oceanic state variables using numerical methods. However, GOFSs processes are computationally expensive and prone to cumulative errors. Recently, large artificial intelligence (AI)-based models significantly boosted forecasting speed and accuracy. Unfortunately, building a large AI ocean forecasting system that can be considered cross-spatiotemporal and air-sea coupled forecasts remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce LangYa, a cross-spatiotemporal and air-sea coupled ocean forecasting system. Results demonstrate that the time embedding module in LangYa enables a single model to make forecasts with lead times ranging from 1 to 7 days. The air-sea coupled module effectively simulates air-sea interactions. The ocean self-attention module improves network stability and accelerates convergence during training, and the adaptive thermocline loss function improves the accuracy of thermocline forecasting. Compared to existing numerical and AI-based ocean forecasting systems, LangYa uses 27 years of global ocean data from the Global Ocean Reanalysis and Simulation version 12 (GLORYS12) for training and achieves more reliable deterministic forecasting results for OSVs. LangYa forecasting system provides global ocean researchers with access to a powerful software tool for accurate ocean forecasting and opens a new paradigm for ocean science.</description>
