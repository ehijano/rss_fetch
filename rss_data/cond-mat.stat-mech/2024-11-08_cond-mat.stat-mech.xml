      <title>Long-Range Correlations under Temperature Gradients: A Molecular Dynamics Study of Simple Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fluids under temperature gradients, long-range correlations (LRCs) emerge generically, leading to enhanced density fluctuations. This phenomenon, characterized by the $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence in the static structure factor (where $\boldsymbol{q}$ is the wavenumber), has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. However, they remain unexplored in Hamiltonian particle systems using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This Letter reports the first MD study to provide unambiguous observations of the LRCs. We demonstrate this by three distinct approaches: (1) measuring the static structure factor and directly observing the $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence characterizing the LRCs; (2) detecting the corresponding $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence in the dynamic structure factor; (3) establishing a quantitative agreement between MD results and predictions from fluctuating hydrodynamics, the phenomenological theory that predicts the LRCs. Our findings demonstrate that MD simulations offer a powerful complementary tool to theoretical and experimental investigations of LRCs.</description>

      <title>The tricritical point of tricritical directed percolation is determined based on neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, neural networks have increasingly been employed to identify critical points of phase transitions. For the tricritical directed percolation model, its steady-state configurations encompass both first-order and second-order phase transitions. Due to the presence of crossover effects, identifying the critical points of phase transitions becomes challenging. This study utilizes Monte Carlo simulations to obtain steady-state configurations under different probabilities $p$ and $q$, and by calculating the increments in average particle density, we observe first-order transitions, second-order transitions, and regions where both types of transitions interact.These Monte Carlo-generated steady-state configurations are used as input to construct and train a convolutional neural network, from which we determine the critical points $p_{c}$ for different probabilities $q$. Furthermore, by learning the steady-state configurations associated with the superheated point $p=p_u$, we locate the tricritical point at $q_{t}=0.893$. Simultaneously, we employed a three-output CNN model to obtain the phase transition boundaries and the range of the crossover regions. Our method offers a neural network-based approach to capture critical points and distinguish phase transition boundaries, providing a novel solution to this problem.</description>

      <title>Dipolar effects on the behavior of magnetically diluted spin-ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the magnetic behavior of diluted spin-ice systems, where magnetic moments are randomly removed at various concentrations. We concentrate on features in which the effect of long range dipolar interactions (usually masked by self-screening in these systems) is made visible by dilution. Our initial focus is on the configurations reached after cooling to low temperatures at zero-field, sweeping the whole density range of impurities. We observe that the missing magnetic moments induce a certain type of local, magnetic charge order. Next, using Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the behavior of the magnetization under an applied magnetic field in the [111] crystallographic direction. The inclusion of dipolar interactions allows to account for the main features observed in previous experimental results. Using the dumbbell model, where magnetic moments are represented as pairs of oppositely charged magnetic monopoles, we are able to understand the qualitative behavior of these curves as we increase doping. Additionally, we use this framework to calculate the critical fields corresponding to the phase transition observed in pure samples, and the characteristic fields appearing at very low doping.</description>

      <title>Self-similar gap dynamics in percolation and rigidity percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial self-similarity is a hallmark of critical phenomena. We investigate the dynamic process of percolation, in which bonds are incrementally inserted to an empty lattice until fully occupied, and track the gaps describing the changes in cluster sizes. Surprisingly, we find that the gap sizes follow a universal power-law distribution throughout the whole or a significant portion of process, revealing a previously unrecognized temporal self-similarity. This phenomenon appears across various percolation models, like standard, explosive and rigidity percolation. Furthermore, in rigidity percolation, we directly observe a cascading cluster-merging dynamics, triggered by single bond insertion, and further obtain a distinct temporal self-similarity in the number of merged clusters, which are hidden in static analyses. Our results also suggest that, for rigidity percolation, the temporal self-similarity is probably more intrinsic than the spatial one. These findings offer a fresh perspective on critical phenomena and broaden potential applications across complex systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized $XY$ model with competing antiferromagnetic and antinematic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study effects of $q$-order antinematic (AN$_q$) interactions on the critical behavior of the antiferromagnetic (AF) $XY$ model on a square lattice. It is found that the evolution of the phase diagram topology of such AF-AN$_q$ models with the parameter $q$ does not follow the same line as for the corresponding FM-N$_q$ models with the ferromagnetic (FM) and $q$-order nematic (N$_q$) interactions. Their phase diagrams are similar only for odd values of the parameter $q$. In such cases the respective phases reported in the FM-N$_q$ models are observed in the AF-AN$_q$ models on each of the two AF-coupled sublattices and the corresponding phase transitions are concluded to be of the same kind. On the other hand, for even values of $q$ the phase diagrams of the AF-AN$_q$ models are different from the FM-N$_q$ models and their topology does not change with $q$. Besides the pure AF and AN$_q$ phases, observed at higher temperatures in the regions of the dominant respective couplings, at low temperatures there is a new canted (C)AF phase, which results from the competition between the AF and AN$_q$ ordering tendencies and has no counterpart in the FM-N$_q$ model. The phase transitions to the CAF phase from both AF and AN$_q$ phases appear to be of the BKT nature.</description>

      <title>Machine learning and optimization-based approaches to duality in statistical physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of duality -- that a given physical system can have two different mathematical descriptions -- is a key idea in modern theoretical physics. Establishing a duality in lattice statistical mechanics models requires the construction of a dual Hamiltonian and a map from the original to the dual observables. By using simple neural networks to parameterize these maps and introducing a loss function that penalises the difference between correlation functions in original and dual models, we formulate the process of duality discovery as an optimization problem. We numerically solve this problem and show that our framework can rediscover the celebrated Kramers-Wannier duality for the 2d Ising model, reconstructing the known mapping of temperatures. We also discuss an alternative approach which uses known features of the mapping of topological lines to reduce the problem to optimizing the couplings in a dual Hamiltonian, and explore next-to-nearest neighbour deformations of the 2d Ising duality. We discuss future directions and prospects for discovering new dualities within this framework.</description>

      <title>Proof of the absence of local conserved quantities in the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic chain and its anisotropic extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the integrability and nonintegrability of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model with a uniaxial anisotropic field, which includes the Heisenberg model and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. It is rigorously shown that all systems, except for the known integrable systems, are nonintegrable, meaning that they do not have nontrivial local conserved quantities. In particular, this result guarantees the nonintegrability of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model, which is a fundamental assumption for quantum many-body scarring. Furthermore, we give simple necessary conditions for integrability in an extended model of the bilinear-biquadratic model with anisotropic interactions. Our result has accomplished a breakthrough in nonintegrability proofs by expanding their scope to spin-1 systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enumeration of polymer coverings on two-dimensional rectangular lattices is considered as "intractable". We prove that the number of coverings of $s$ polymer satisfies a simple recurrence relation $ \sum_{i=0}^{2s} (-1)^i \binom{2s}{i} a_{n-i, m-i} = 2^s {(2s)!} / {s!} $ on a $n \times m$ rectangular lattice with open boundary conditions in both directions.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of sampling from shallow Brownian circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While many statistical properties of deep random quantum circuits can be deduced, often rigorously and other times heuristically, by an approximation to global Haar-random unitaries, the statistics of constant-depth random quantum circuits are generally less well-understood due to a lack of amenable tools and techniques. We circumvent this barrier by considering a related constant-time Brownian circuit model which shares many similarities with constant-depth random quantum circuits but crucially allows for direct calculations of higher order moments of its output distribution. Using mean-field (large-n) techniques, we fully characterize the output distributions of Brownian circuits at shallow depths and show that they follow a Porter-Thomas distribution, just like in the case of deep circuits, but with a truncated Hilbert space. The access to higher order moments allows for studying the expected and typical Linear Cross-entropy (XEB) benchmark scores achieved by an ideal quantum computer versus the state-of-the-art classical spoofers for shallow Brownian circuits. We discover that for these circuits, while the quantum computer typically scores within a constant factor of the expected value, the classical spoofer suffers from an exponentially larger variance. Numerical evidence suggests that the same phenomenon also occurs in constant-depth discrete random quantum circuits, like those defined over the all-to-all architecture. We conjecture that the same phenomenon is also true for random brickwork circuits in high enough spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible duality and symmetry topological order of one-dimensional lattice models with spatially modulated symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between self-duality and spatially modulated symmetry of generalized $N$-state clock models, which include the transverse-field Ising model and ordinary $N$-state clock models as special cases. The spatially modulated symmetry of the model becomes trivial when the model's parameters satisfy a specific number-theoretic relation. We find that the duality is non-invertible when the spatially modulated symmetry remains nontrivial, and show that this non-invertibility is resolved by introducing a generalized $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, which manifests ultraviolet/infrared mixing, as the bulk topological order. In this framework, the boundary duality transformation corresponds to the boundary action of a bulk symmetry transformation, with the endpoint of the bulk symmetry defect realizing the boundary duality defect. Our results illuminate not only a holographic perspective on dualities but also a relationship between spatially modulated symmetry and ultraviolet/infrared mixing in one higher dimension.</description>

      <title>Topological Modes in Monitored Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum systems both driven by unitary evolutions and monitored through measurements have proved to be fertile ground for exploring new dynamical quantum matters. While the entanglement structure and symmetry properties of monitored systems have been intensively studied, the role of topology in monitored dynamics is much less explored. In this work, we investigate novel topological phenomena in the monitored dynamics through the lens of free-fermion systems. Free-fermion monitored dynamics were previously shown to be unified with the Anderson localization problem under the Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classification. Guided by this unification, we identify the topological area-law-entangled phases in the former setting through the topological classification of disordered insulators and superconductors in the latter. As examples, we focus on 1+1D free-fermion monitored dynamics in two symmetry classes, DIII and A. We construct quantum circuit models to study different topological area-law phases and their domain walls in the respective symmetry classes. We find that the domain wall between topologically distinct area-law phases hosts dynamical topological modes whose entanglement is protected from being quenched by the measurements in the monitored dynamics. We demonstrate how to manipulate these topological modes by programming the domain-wall dynamics. In particular, for topological modes in class DIII, which behave as unmeasured Majorana modes, we devise a protocol to braid them and study the entanglement generated in the braiding process.</description>

      <title>On Chord Dynamics and Complexity Growth in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the time evolution generated by the two-sided chord Hamiltonian in the double-scaled SYK model, which produces a probability distribution over operators in the double-scaled algebra. Via the bulk-to-boundary map, this distribution translates into dynamic profiles of bulk states within the chord Hilbert space. We derive analytic expressions for these states, valid across a wide parameter range and at all time scales. Additionally, we show how distinct semi-classical behaviors emerge by localizing within specific regions of the energy spectrum in the semi-classical limit.
  We reformulate the doubled Hilbert space formalism as an isometric map between the one-particle sector of the chord Hilbert space and the doubled zero-particle sector. Using this map, we obtain analytic results for correlation functions and examine the dynamical properties of operator Krylov complexity for chords, establishing an equivalence between the chord number generating function and the crossed four-point correlation function. We also consider finite-temperature effects, showing how operator spreading slows as temperature decreases.
  In the semi-classical limit, we apply a saddle point analysis and include the one-loop determinant to derive the normalized time-ordered four-point correlation function. The leading correction mirrors the \(1/N\) connected contribution observed in the large-\(p\) SYK model at infinite temperature. Finally, we analyze the time evolution of operator Krylov complexity for a matter chord in the triple-scaled regime, linking it to the renormalized two-sided length in JT gravity with matter.</description>

      <title>Odd Viscodiffusive Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of "odd viscodiffusive fluids," which exhibit three-dimensional odd transport phenomena through the coupling of viscous and diffusive transport. In these fluids, diffusive fluxes may arise from orthogonal velocity gradients and, reciprocally, stresses may arise from concentration gradients. We examine microscopic fluctuations using the recently proposed "flux hypothesis" to derive Green-Kubo and reciprocal relations for the governing transport coefficients. These relations suggest that only parity symmetry, and not time-reversal symmetry, must be broken at the microscopic scale to observe these couplings. Chiral liquids, whether passive or active, are therefore a natural choice as viscodiffusive fluids. We then introduce two analytically tractable model systems, namely a generator and a corresponding reciprocal engine, which illustrate the nature of viscodiffusive cross-coupling in chiral matter and enable the experimental measurement of the novel transport coefficients. Finally, we make the case for chiral bacterial suspensions to be odd viscodiffusive fluids, and use our theory to predict the behaviors exhibited in prior experimental microfluidic studies involving bacterial migration in response to shearing flows.</description>

      <title>Single replica spin-glass phase detection using field variation and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model used the replica symmetry method to find the phase transition of the system. In 1979-1980, Parisi proposed a solution based on replica symmetry breaking (RSB), which allowed him to identify the underlying phases of complex systems such as spin-glasses. Regardless of the method used for detection, the intrinsic phase of a system exists whether or not replicas are considered. We introduce a single replica method of spin-glass phase detection using the field's variation experienced by each spin in a system configuration. This method focuses on a single replica with quenched random couplings. Each spin inevitably observes a different field from the others. Our results show that the mean and variance of fields named "Spontaneous Configurational Field" experienced by spins are suitable indicators to explore different ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, and mixed phases. To classify different phases of the system with defined indicators we have developed an algorithm based on machine learning to analyze the desired samples.</description>

      <title>Strong anomalous diffusion for free-ranging birds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural and anomalous diffusion are widely observed and used to explore causes and consequences of movement across organisms, resulting in extensive use of the mean and mean-squared displacement (MSD). Using high-resolution data from over 70 million localizations of young and adult free-ranging Barn Owls (\textit{Tyto alba}), we demonstrate the necessity of a broad spectrum of displacement moments to characterize bird movement across scales. The mean and MSD -- interchangeable with moments $q=1$ and 2 -- are insufficient special cases. We reveal empirical strong anomalous diffusion as a nonlinear growth of displacement moments according to $\left&lt;|x(t)|^q\right&gt; \sim t^{\lambda(q)}$. The moment spectrum function $\lambda(q)$ displays piecewise linearity with a critical moment marking the crossover point between two scaling regimes, linked to a combination of age-specific behavioral modes. A critical timescale of five minutes marks an unexpected transition from a convex $\lambda_s(q)$ to a concave $\lambda_\ell(q)$, related to environmental and behavioral constraints. Using two stochastic models of varying ecological complexity, we demonstrate that strong anomalous diffusion may be widespread in animal movement, underscoring the importance of expanding analysis beyond the average and MSD.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric tensor determines the i.i.d. conversion rate in the resource theory of asymmetry for any compact Lie group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most significant foundational principles underlying nature. The resource theory of asymmetry (RTA) is a resource-theoretic framework for investigating asymmetry as a resource to break constraints imposed by symmetries. It has recently undergone significant developments, resulting in applications in a variety of research areas since symmetry and its breaking are ubiquitous in physics. Nevertheless, the resource conversion theory at the core of RTA remains incomplete. In the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) setup, where identical copies of a state are converted to identical copies of another state, conversion theory among pure states has been completed only for $U(1)$ group and finite groups. Here, we establish an i.i.d. conversion theory among any pure states in RTA for any continuous symmetry described by a compact Lie group, which includes the cases where multiple conserved quantities are involved. We show that the quantum geometric tensor is an asymmetry monotone for pure states that determines the optimal approximate asymptotic conversion rate. Our formulation achieves a unified understanding of conversion rates in prior studies for different symmetries. As a corollary of the formula, we also affirmatively prove the Marvian-Spekkens conjecture on reversible asymptotic convertibility in RTA, which has remained unproven for a decade.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Local Quantum Circuits under Nonunital Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely accepted that noisy quantum devices are limited to logarithmic depth circuits unless mid-circuit measurements and error correction are employed. However, this conclusion holds only for unital error channels, such as depolarizing noise. Building on the idea of the "quantum refrigerator" [Ben-Or, Gottesman and Hassidim (2013)], we improve upon previous results and show that geometrically local circuits in the presence of nonunital noise, in any dimension $d\geq 1$, can correct errors without mid-circuit measurements and extend computation to any depth, with only polylogarithmic overhead in the depth and the number of qubits. This implies that local quantum dynamics subjected to sufficiently weak nonunital noise is computationally universal and nearly as hard to simulate as noiseless dynamics. Additionally, we quantify the contraction property of local random circuits in the presence of nonunital noise.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of coupled time crystals with an application to energy storage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open many-body quantum systems can exhibit intriguing nonequilibrium phases of matter, such as time crystals. In these phases, the state of the system spontaneously breaks the time-translation symmetry of the dynamical generator, which typically manifests through persistent oscillations of an order parameter. A paradigmatic model displaying such a symmetry breaking is the boundary time crystal, which has been extensively analyzed experimentally and theoretically. Despite the broad interest in these nonequilibrium phases, their thermodynamics and their fluctuating behavior remain largely unexplored, in particular for the case of coupled time crystals. In this work, we consider two interacting boundary time crystals and derive a consistent interpretation of their thermodynamic behavior. We fully characterize their average dynamics and the behavior of their quantum fluctuations, which allows us to demonstrate the presence of quantum and classical correlations in both the stationary and the time-crystal phases displayed by the system. We furthermore exploit our theoretical derivation to explore possible applications of time crystals as quantum batteries, demonstrating their ability to efficiently store energy.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum algorithm for Gibbs state preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is of great interest to understand the thermalization of open quantum many-body systems, and how quantum computers are able to efficiently simulate that process. A recently introduced disispative evolution, inspired by existing models of open system thermalization, has been shown to be efficiently implementable on a quantum computer. Here, we prove that, at high enough temperatures, this evolution reaches the Gibbs state in time scaling logarithmically with system size. The result holds for Hamiltonians that satisfy the Lieb-Robinson bound, such as local Hamiltonians on a lattice, and includes long-range systems. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results rigorously establishing the rapid mixing property of high-temperature quantum Gibbs samplers, which is known to give the fastest possible speed for thermalization in the many-body setting. We then employ our result to the problem of estimating partition functions at high temperature, showing an improved performance over previous classical and quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum pseudorandomness under conservation laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of locally generating unitary designs, which capture statistical notions of quantum pseudorandomness, lies at the heart of wide-ranging areas in physics and quantum information technologies. While there are extensive potent methods and results for this problem, the evidently important setting where continuous symmetries or conservation laws (most notably U(1) and SU(d)) are involved is known to present fundamental difficulties. In particular, even the basic question of whether any local symmetric circuit can generate 2-designs efficiently (in time that grows at most polynomially in the system size) remains open with no circuit constructions provably known to do so, despite intensive efforts. In this work, we resolve this long-standing open problem for both U(1) and SU(d) symmetries by explicitly constructing local symmetric quantum circuits which we prove to converge to symmetric unitary 2-designs in polynomial time using a combination of representation theory, graph theory, and Markov chain methods. As a direct application, our constructions can be used to efficiently generate near-optimal random covariant quantum error-correcting codes, confirming a conjecture in [PRX Quantum 3, 020314 (2022)].</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions to the Generalized Hydrodynamics Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) equation is the equivalent of the Euler equations of hydrodynamics for integrable models. Systems of hyperbolic equations such as the Euler equations usually develop shocks and are plagued by problems of uniqueness. We establish for the first time the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the full GHD equation and the absence of shocks, from a large class of initial conditions with bounded occupation function. We assume only absolute integrability of the two-body scattering shift. In applications to quantum models of fermionic type, this includes all commonly used physical initial states, such as locally thermal states and zero-entropy states. We show in particular that differentiable initial conditions give differentiable solutions at all times and that weak initial conditions such as the Riemann problem have unique weak solutions which preserve entropy. For this purpose, we write the GHD equation as a new fixed-point problem (announced in a companion paper). We show that the fixed point exists, is unique, and is approached, under an iterative solution procedure, in the Banach topology on functions of momenta.</description>

      <title>Long-range entanglement from spontaneous non-onsite symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the states of matter arising from the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ non-onsite symmetries. In one spatial dimension, we construct a frustration-free lattice model exhibiting SSB of a non-onsite symmetry, which features the coexistence of two ground states with distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders. We analytically prove the two-fold ground-state degeneracy and the existence of a finite energy gap. Fixing the symmetry sector yields a long-range entangled ground state that features long-range correlations among non-invertible charged operators. We also present a constant-depth measurement-feedback protocol to prepare such a state with a constant success probability in the thermodynamic limit, which may be of independent interest. Under a symmetric deformation, the SSB persists up to a critical point, beyond which a gapless phase characterized by a conformal field theory emerges. In two spatial dimensions, the SSB of 1-form non-onsite symmetries leads to a long-range entangled state (SPT soup) - a condensate of 1d SPT along any closed loops. On a torus, there are four such locally indistinguishable states that exhibit algebraic correlations between local operators, which we derived via a mapping to the critical $O(2)$ loop model. This provides an intriguing example of `topological quantum criticality'. Our work reveals the exotic features of SSB of non-onsite symmetries, which may lie beyond the framework of topological holography (SymTFT).</description>

      <title>On the implementation of zero-determinant strategies in repeated games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-determinant strategies are a class of strategies in repeated games which unilaterally control payoffs. Zero-determinant strategies have attracted much attention in studies of social dilemma, particularly in the context of evolution of cooperation. So far, not only general properties of zero-determinant strategies have been investigated, but zero-determinant strategies have been applied to control in the fields of information and communications technology and analysis of imitation. Here, we further deepen our understanding on general mathematical properties of zero-determinant strategies. We first prove that zero-determinant strategies, if exist, can be implemented by some one-dimensional transition probability. Next, we prove that, if a two-player game has a non-trivial potential function, a zero-determinant strategy exists in its repeated version. These results assist us to implement zero-determinant strategies in broader situations.</description>

Abstract: Fluctuation dynamics of an experimentally measured observable offer a primary signal for nonequilibrium systems, along with dynamics of the mean. While universal speed limits for the mean have actively been studied recently, constraints for the speed of the fluctuation have been elusive. Here, we develop a theory concerning rigorous limits to the rate of fluctuation growth. We find a principle that the speed of an observable's fluctuation is upper bounded by the fluctuation of an appropriate observable describing velocity, which also indicates a tradeoff relation between the changes for the mean and fluctuation. We demonstrate the advantages of our inequalities for processes with non-negligible dispersion of observables, quantum work extraction, and the entanglement growth in free fermionic systems. Our results open an avenue toward a quantitative theory of fluctuation dynamics in various non-equilibrium systems encompassing quantum many-body systems and nonlinear population dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Chaotic Floquet systems at sufficiently low driving frequencies are known to heat up to an infinite temperature ensemble in the thermodynamic limit. However at high driving frequencies, Floquet systems remain energetically stable in a robust prethermal phase with exponentially long heating times. We propose sensitivity (susceptibility) of Floquet eigenstates against infinitesimal deformations of the drive, as a sharp and sensitive measure to detect this heating transition. It also captures various regimes (timescales) of Floquet thermalization accurately. Particularly, we find that at low frequencies near the onset of unbounded heating, Floquet eigenstates are maximally sensitive to perturbations and consequently the scaled susceptibility develops a sharp maximum. We further connect our results to the relaxation dynamics of local observables to show that near the onset of Floquet heating, the system is nonergodic with slow glassy dynamics despite being nonintegrable at all driving frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robert May famously used random matrix theory to predict that large, complex systems cannot admit stable fixed points. However, this general conclusion is not always supported by empirical observation: from cells to biomes, biological systems are large, complex, and often stable. In this paper, we revisit May's argument in light of recent developments in both ecology and random matrix theory. We focus on competitive systems, and, using a nonlinear generalization of the competitive Lotka-Volterra model, we show that there are, in fact, two kinds of complexity-stability relationships in disordered dynamical systems: if self-interactions grow faster with density than cross-interactions, complexity is destabilizing; but if cross-interactions grow faster than self-interactions, complexity is stabilizing.</description>

Abstract: We study systems of active particles, whose perception is constrained by a vision cone, that are attracted to other particles and repelled from static obstacles. We report a novel self-trapping mechanism: active particles with non-reciprocal attraction form particle chains, which eventually become closed loops that shrink around one or many obstacles. These closed loops act as effective aggregation centers. Long-lived, self-organized closed loops require to enclose obstacles to exist. Furthermore, we find that closed loops that initially exhibit local polar order, transition to a nematic state as they absorb more particles. The unveiled mechanism corresponds to a pinning behavior that strongly hinders particle diffusion. In short, closed loops dominate the large-scale properties of active systems with non-reciprocal attraction in disordered media.</description>

      <title>Sampling metastable systems using collective variables and Jarzynski-Crooks paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling a high dimensional multimodal target probability measure. We assume that a good proposal kernel to move only a subset of the degrees of freedoms (also known as collective variables) is known a priori. This proposal kernel can for example be built using normalizing flows. We show how to extend the move from the collective variable space to the full space and how to implement an accept-reject step in order to get a reversible chain with respect to a target probability measure. The accept-reject step does not require to know the marginal of the original measure in the collective variable (namely to know the free energy). The obtained algorithm admits several variants, some of them being very close to methods which have been proposed previously in the literature. We show how the obtained acceptance ratio can be expressed in terms of the work which appears in the Jarzynski-Crooks equality, at least for some variants. Numerical illustrations demonstrate the efficiency of the approach on various simple test cases, and allow us to compare the variants of the algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Gauge symmetries and Higgs mechanisms are key features of theories describing high-energy particle physics and collective phenomena in statistical and condensed-matter physics. In this review we address the collective behavior of systems of multicomponent scalar fields interacting with gauge fields, which can be already present in the underlying microscopic system or emerge only at criticality. The interplay between local gauge and global symmetries determines the phase diagram, the nature of the Higgs phases, and the nature of phase transitions between the high-temperature disordered and the low-temperature Higgs phases. However, additional crucial features determine the universal properties of the critical behavior at continuous transitions. Specifically, their nature also depends on the role played by the gauge modes at criticality. Effective (Abelian or non-Abelian) gauge Higgs field theories emerge when gauge modes develop critical correlations. On the other hand, a more standard critical behavior, which admits an effective description in terms of Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\Phi^4$ theories, occurs when gauge-field modes are short ranged at the transition. In the latter case, gauge fields only prevent non-gauge invariant correlation functions from becoming critical. This review covers the recent progress made in the study of Higgs systems with Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields. We discuss the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of systems with a classical partition function, focusing mainly on three-dimensional systems, and only briefly discussing two-dimensional models. However, by using the quantum-to-classical mapping, the results on the critical behavior for classical systems in $D=d+1$ dimensions can be extended to quantum transitions in $d$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Classical Geometric Fluctuation Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By defining an analogous stochastic quantity called Stochastic Fisher Information (SFI), we uncover two fluctuation relations with an inherent geometric nature, as the SFI acts as a single nonequilibrium trajectory metric. The geometric nature of these relations is expressed through a stochastic length derived from the system entropy associated with a nonequilibrium trajectory. We also explore the possibility of trajectory-dependent uncertainty relations linked to the time SFI. Finally, we test the newly discovered relations using two simple stochastic models.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Theory of Stellar Systems: A Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar systems - star clusters, galaxies, dark matter haloes, and so on - are ubiquitous characters in the evolutionary tale of our Universe. This tutorial article is an introduction to the collective dynamical evolution of the very large numbers of stars and/or other self-gravitating objects that comprise such systems, i.e. their kinetic theory.
  We begin by introducing the basic phenomenology of stellar systems, and explaining why and when we must develop a kinetic theory that transcends the traditional two-body relaxation picture of Chandrasekhar. We study the orbits that comprise stellar systems, how those orbits are modified by perturbations, how a system responds self-consistently to fluctuations in its gravitational potential, and how one can predict the long term fate of a stellar system in various dynamical regimes. Though our treatment is necessarily mathematical, we develop the formalism only to the extent that it facilitates real calculations. We give many examples throughout the text of the equations being applied to topics of major astrophysical importance.
  Furthermore, in the 1960s and 1970s the kinetic theory of stellar systems was a fledgling subject which developed in tandem with the kinetic theory of plasmas. However, the two fields have long since diverged. Yet once one has become fluent in both Plasmaish and Galacticese, and has a dictionary relating the two, one can pull ideas directly from one field to solve a problem in the other. Therefore, another aim of this tutorial article is to provide our plasma colleagues with a jargon-light understanding of the key properties of stellar systems, to point out the many direct analogies between stellar- and plasma-kinetic calculations, and ultimately to convince them that stellar dynamics and plasma kinetics are, in a deep and beautiful and useful sense, the same thing.</description>

      <title>Dual-isometric Projected Entangled Pair States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16783v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient characterization of higher dimensional many-body physical states presents significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a new class of Project Entangled Pair State (PEPS) that incorporates two isometric conditions. This new class facilitates the efficient calculation of general local observables and certain two-point correlation functions, which have been previously shown to be intractable for general PEPS, or PEPS with only a single isometric constraint. Despite incorporating two isometric conditions, our class preserves the rich physical structure while enhancing the analytical capabilities. It features a large set of tunable parameters, with only a subleading correction compared to that of general PEPS. Furthermore, we analytically demonstrate that this class can encode universal quantum computations and can represent a transition from topological to trivial order.</description>

      <title>Relativistic theory of the viscosity of fluids across the entire energy spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18434v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement mechanism of viscosity. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory provides a new analytical formula which reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with various estimates for hot dense matter and the QGP-type fluid.</description>

      <title>Understanding long-range opposite charge repulsion in multivalent salt solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electrostatic correlations between ions profoundly influence the structure and forces within electrical double layers. Here, we apply the modified Gaussian Renormalized Fluctuation theory to investigate the counter-intuitive phenomenon of repulsion between two oppositely charged surfaces and discuss its relationship with overcharging. By accurately accounting for the effect of spatially varying ion-ion correlations, we capture these repulsive forces for divalent, trivalent as well as tetravalent ions, in quantitative agreement with reported simulation results. We show that the opposite-charge repulsion is long-ranged with an effective length scale of a few nanometers. The strength of opposite-charge repulsion increases monotonically with the multivalent salt concentration, in stark contrast with the non-monotonic salt concentration dependence of other ion correlation-driven phenomena, such as overcharging and like-charge attraction. We also elucidate that the origin of the opposite-charge repulsion is the large amount of ions attracted to the double layer as a result of ion-ion correlations, leading to higher osmotic pressure and stronger screening of the electrostatic attraction, which results in an overall repulsive force between two oppositely charged surfaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there is no causal relationship between opposite-charge repulsion and the overcharging of the surface. Opposite-charge repulsion is accompanied by overcharging at large separation distances, but can also occur in normal double layers without overcharging at intermediate separation distances.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang-zero ratios for locating a critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to numerically determine the location of a critical point in general systems using the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeros. This method makes use of the fact that the ratios of Lee-Yang zeros on various spatial volumes intersect at the critical point. While the method is similar to the Binder-cumulant analysis, it is advantageous in suppressing the finite-volume effects arising from the mixing of variables in general systems. We show that the method works successfully for numerically locating the CP in the three-dimensional three-state Potts model with a nonzero external field.</description>

      <title>Effect of Random Pinning on the Yielding Transition of Amorphous Solid under Oscillatory Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of random pinning, where we freeze the relaxation degrees of freedom for a fraction of randomly selected particles, on the yielding transition under oscillatory shear through extensive computer simulations. Using Kob-Anderson model as our model glass former, we pin a fraction of the particles. These pinned particles can move affinely under the imposed oscillatory shear deformation but are not allowed to relax through subsequent rearrangements due to plastic events. As the fraction of pinned particles increases, the system transitions from being a fragile glass former to a strong glass former. This gives us opportunity to examine how changes in fragility impact the yielding transition. Our results demonstrate notable differences in the yielding transition between strong and fragile glass formers under random pinning. This aligns with previous observations where fragility was altered by changing the packing fraction in soft sphere model albeit with a main difference that random pinning significantly suppresses the formation of shear bands, even in well-annealed glass samples.</description>
