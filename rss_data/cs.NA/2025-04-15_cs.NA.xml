      <title>Exact inequalities and optimal recovery by inaccurate information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers a multidimensional problem of optimal recovery of an operator whose action is represented by multiplying the original function by a weight function of a special type, based on inaccurately specified information about the values of operators of a similar type. An exact inequality for the norms of such operators is obtained. The problem under consideration is a generalization of the problem of optimal recovery of a derivative based on other inaccurately specified derivatives in the space $\mathbb R^d$ and the problem of an exact inequality, which is an analogue of the Hardy-Littlewood-Polya inequality.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Score Filter for Data Assimilation of Two-Phase Flow Models in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical modeling and simulation of two-phase flow in porous media is challenging due to the uncertainties in key parameters, such as permeability. To address these challenges, we propose a computational framework by utilizing the novel Ensemble Score Filter (EnSF) to enhance the accuracy of state estimation for two-phase flow systems in porous media. The forward simulation of the two-phase flow model is implemented using a mixed finite element method, which ensures accurate approximation of the pressure, the velocity, and the saturation. The EnSF leverages score-based diffusion models to approximate filtering distributions efficiently, avoiding the computational expense of neural network-based methods. By incorporating a closed-form score approximation and an analytical update mechanism, the EnSF overcomes degeneracy issues and handles high-dimensional nonlinear filtering with minimal computational overhead. Numerical experiments demonstrate the capabilities of EnSF in scenarios with uncertain permeability and incomplete observational data.</description>

      <title>A $P$-Adaptive Hermite Method for Nonlinear Dispersive Maxwell's Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel Hermite method to handle Maxwell's equations for nonlinear dispersive media. The proposed method achieves high-order accuracy and is free of any nonlinear algebraic solver, requiring solving instead small local linear systems for which the dimension is independent of the order. The implementation of order adaptive algorithms is straightforward in this setting, making the resulting p-adaptive Hermite method appealing for the simulations of soliton-like wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Essentially Non-oscillatory Spectral Volume Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new Essentially Non-oscillatory (ENO) recovery algorithm is developed and tested in a Finite Volume method. The construction is hinged on a reformulation of the reconstruction as the solution to a variational problem. The sign property of the classical ENO algorithm is expressed as restrictions on the admissible set of solutions to this variational problem. In conjunction with an educated guessing algorithm for possible locations of discontinuities an ENO reconstruction algorithm without divided differences or smoothness indicators is constructed. No tunable parameters exist apart from the desired order and stencil width. The desired order is in principle arbitrary, but growing stencils are needed. While classical ENO methods consider all connected stencils that surround a cell under consideration the proposed recovery method uses a fixed stencil, simplifying efficient high order implementations.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous multiscale methods for fourth-order singular perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a numerical homogenization method for fourth-order singular perturbation problems within the framework of heterogeneous multiscale method. These problems arise from heterogeneous strain gradient elasticity and elasticity models for architectured materials. We establish an error estimate for the homogenized solution applicable to general media and derive an explicit convergence for the locally periodic media with the fine-scale $\varepsilon$. For cell problems of size $\delta=\mathbb{N}\varepsilon$, the classical resonance error $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon/\delta)$ can be eliminated due to the dominance of the higher-order operator. Despite the occurrence of boundary layer effects, discretization errors do not necessarily deteriorate for general boundary conditions. Numerical simulations corroborate these theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Stong order 1 adaptive approximation of jump-diffusion SDEs with discontinuous drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an adaptive approximation scheme for jump-diffusion SDEs with discontinuous drift and (possibly) degenerate diffusion. This transformation-based doubly-adaptive quasi-Milstein scheme is the first scheme that has strong convergence rate $1$ in $L^p$ for $p\in[1,\infty)$ with respect to the average computational cost for these SDEs. To obtain our result, we prove that under slightly stronger assumptions which are still weaker than those in existing literature, a related doubly-adaptive quasi-Milstein scheme has convergence order $1$. This scheme is doubly-adaptive in the sense that it is jump-adapted, i.e.~all jump times of the Poisson noise are grid points, and it includes an adaptive stepsize strategy to account for the discontinuities of the drift.</description>

      <title>The Whitney method of fundamental solutions with Lusin wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the theoretical foundation for a variant of the method of fundamental solutions (MFS), where the source points $\{q_j\}_{j=1}^\infty$ accumulate towards the domain in a Whitney fashion, meaning that their separation is proportional to the distance to the domain. We prove that the normalized Lusin wavelets $\psi_j(w) = b_j(w-q_j)^{-2}$ constitute a generalized basis, known as a frame, for the Hardy subspace of $L_2$-traces of holomorphic functions on the domain. Consequently, our method, where $\psi_j$ are used as basis functions in the MFS, enables a numerically stable approximation of solutions to Laplace boundary value problems, even when the solutions lack analytic continuation across the boundary. Despite the source points accumulating towards the domain, our computations show no loss of accuracy near the boundary, in contrast to the boundary integral equation method.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Radial Kernels for Solving Weakly Singular Fredholm Integral Equations: Balancing Accuracy and Stability in Meshless Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, kernel-based approximation methods had achieved astonishing success in solving different problems in the field of science and engineering. However, when employing the direct or standard method of performing computations using infinitely smooth kernels, a conflict arises between the accuracy that can be theoretically attained and the numerical stability. In other words, when the shape parameter tends to zero, the operational matrix for the standard bases with infinitely smooth kernels become severely ill-conditioned. This conflict can be managed applying hybrid kernels. The hybrid kernels extend the approximation space and provide high flexibility to strike the best possible balance between accuracy and stability. In the current study, an innovative approach using hybrid radial kernels (HRKs) is provided to solve weakly singular Fredholm integral equations (WSFIEs) of the second kind in a meshless scheme. The approach employs hybrid kernels built on dispersed nodes as a basis within the discrete collocation technique. This method transforms the problem being studied into a linear system of algebraic equations. Also, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to calculate the optimal parameters for the hybrid kernels, which is based on minimizing the maximum absolute error (MAE). We also study the error estimate of the suggested scheme. Lastly, we assess the accuracy and validity of the hybrid technique by carrying out various numerical experiments. The numerical findings show that the estimates obtained from hybrid kernels are significantly more accurate in solving WSFIEs compared to pure kernels. Additionally, it was revealed that the hybrid bases remain stable across various values of the shape parameters.</description>

      <title>Super-Exponential Approximation of the Riemann-Liouville Fractional Integral via Shifted Gegenbauer Pseudospectral Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a shifted Gegenbauer pseudospectral (SGPS) method for high-precision approximation of the left Riemann-Liouville fractional integral (RLFI). By using precomputable fractional-order shifted Gegenbauer integration matrices (FSGIMs), the method achieves super-exponential convergence for smooth functions, delivering near machine-precision accuracy with minimal computational cost. Tunable shifted Gegenbauer (SG) parameters enable flexible optimization across diverse problems, while rigorous error analysis confirms rapid error decay under optimal settings. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the SGPS method outperforms MATLAB's integral, MATHEMATICA's NIntegrate, and existing techniques by up to two orders of magnitude in accuracy, with superior efficiency for varying fractional orders 0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1. Its adaptability and precision make the SGPS method a transformative tool for fractional calculus, ideal for modeling complex systems with memory and non-local behavior.</description>

      <title>Hybrid discontinuous Galerkin discretizations for the damped time-harmonic Galbrun's equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the damped time-harmonic Galbrun's equation which models solar and stellar oscillations. We introduce and analyze hybrid discontinuous Galerkin discretizations, which are stable and convergent for any polynomial degree greater or equal than one and are computationally more efficient than discontinuous Galerkin discretizations. Additionally, the methods are stable with respect to the drastic changes in the magnitude of the coefficients occurring in stars. The analysis is based on the concept of discrete approximation schemes and weak T-compatibility, which exploits the weakly T-coercive structure of the equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish optimal convergence rates for the P1 finite element approximation of the Sobolev constant in arbitrary dimensions N\geq 2 and for Lebesgue exponents 1&lt;p&lt;N. Our analysis relies on a refined study of the Sobolev deficit in suitable quasi-norms, which have been introduced and utilized in the context of finite element approximations of the p- Laplacian. The proof further involves sharp estimates for the finite element approximation of Sobolev minimizers.</description>

      <title>Analysis and structure-preserving approximation of a Cahn-Hilliard-Forchheimer system with solution-dependent mass and volume source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a coupled Cahn-Hilliard-Forchheimer system featuring concentration-dependent mobility, mass source and convective transport. The velocity field is governed by a generalized quasi-incompressible Forchheimer equation with solution-dependent volume source. We impose Dirichlet boundary conditions for the pressure to accommodate the source term. Our contributions include a novel well-posedness result for the generalized Forchheimer subsystem via the Browder-Minty theorem, and existence of weak solutions for the full coupled system established through energy estimates at the Galerkin level combined with compactness techniques such as Aubin-Lions' lemma and Minty's trick. Furthermore, we develop a structure-preserving discretization using Raviart-Thomas elements for the velocity that maintains exact mass balance and discrete energy-dissipation balance, with well-posedness demonstrated through relative energy estimates and inf-sup stability. Lastly, we validate our model through numerical experiments, demonstrating optimal convergence rates, structure preservation, and the role of the Forchheimer nonlinearity in governing phase-field evolution dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic generative methods for stable and accurate closure modeling of chaotic dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional deterministic subgrid-scale (SGS) models are often dissipative and unstable, especially in regions of chaotic and turbulent flow. Ongoing work in climate science and ocean modeling motivates the use of stochastic SGS models for chaotic dynamics. Further, developing stochastic generative models of underlying dynamics is a rapidly expanding field. In this work, we aim to incorporate stochastic integration toward closure modeling for chaotic dynamical systems. Further, we want to explore the potential stabilizing effect that stochastic models could have on linearized chaotic systems. We propose parametric and generative approaches for closure modeling using stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We derive and implement a quadratic diffusion model based on the fluctuations, demonstrating increased accuracy from bridging theoretical models with generative approaches. Results are demonstrated on the Lorenz-63 dynamical system.</description>

      <title>High-Order Interior Penalty Finite Element Methods for Fourth-Order Phase-Field Models in Fracture Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for solving fourth-order phase-field models in brittle fracture mechanics using the Interior Penalty Finite Element Method (IP-FEM). The fourth-order model improves numerical stability and accuracy compared to traditional second-order phase-field models, particularly when simulating complex crack paths. The IP-FEM provides an efficient framework for discretizing these models, effectively handling nonconforming trial functions and complex boundary conditions.
  In this study, we leverage the FEALPy framework to implement a flexible computational tool that supports high-order IP-FEM discretizations. Our results show that as the polynomial order increases, the mesh dependence of the phase-field model decreases, offering improved accuracy and faster convergence. Additionally, we explore the trade-offs between computational cost and accuracy with varying polynomial orders and mesh sizes. The findings offer valuable insights for optimizing numerical simulations of brittle fracture in practical engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Maximum bound preservation of exponential integrators for Allen-Cahn equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a class of arbitrarily high-order, maximum bound preserving time-stepping schemes for solving Allen-Cahn equations. These schemes are constructed within the iterative framework of exponential integrators, combined with carefully chosen numerical quadrature rules, including the Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule and the left Gauss-Radau quadrature rule. Notably, the proposed schemes are rigorously proven to unconditionally preserve the maximum bound without requiring any additional postprocessing techniques, while simultaneously achieving arbitrarily high-order temporal accuracy. A thorough error analysis in the $L^2$ norm is provided. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and highlight that an inappropriate choice of quadrature rules may violate the maximum bound principle, leading to incorrect dynamics.</description>

      <title>NR-SSOR right preconditioned RRGMRES for arbitrary singular systems and least squares problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GMRES is known to determine a least squares solution of $ A x = b $ where $ A \in R^{n \times n} $ without breakdown for arbitrary $ b \in R^n $, and initial iterate $ x_0 \in R^n $ if and only if $ A $ is range-symmetric, i.e. $ R(A^T) = R(A) $, where $ A $ may be singular and $ b $ may not be in the range space $ R(A) $ of $ A $.
  In this paper, we propose applying the Range Restricted GMRES (RRGMRES) to $ A C A^T z = b $, where $ C \in R^{n \times n} $ is symmetric positive definite. This determines a least squares solution $ x = C A^T z $ of $ A x = b $ without breakdown for arbitrary (singular) matrix $ A \in R^{n \times n} $ and $ b, x_0 \in R^n $, and is much more stable and accurate compared to GMRES, RRGMRES and MINRES-QLP applied to $ A x = b $ for inconsistent problems when $ b \notin R(A) $. In particular, we propose applying the NR-SSOR as the inner iteration right preconditioner, which also works efficiently for least squares problems $ \min_{x \in R^n} \| b - A x\|_2 $ for $ A \in R^{m \times n} $ and arbitrary $ b \in R^m $.
  Numerical experiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Semi-implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta method for nonlinear differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semi-implicit-explicit (semi-IMEX) Runge-Kutta (RK) method is proposed for the numerical integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form $\mathbf{u}' = \mathbf{f}(t,\mathbf{u}) + G(t,\mathbf{u}) \mathbf{u}$, where $\mathbf{f}$ is a non-stiff term and $G\mathbf{u}$ represents the stiff terms. Such systems frequently arise from spatial discretizations of time-dependent nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). For instance, $G$ could involve higher-order derivative terms with nonlinear coefficients. Traditional IMEX-RK methods, which treat $\mathbf{f}$ explicitly and $G\mathbf{u}$ implicitly, require solving nonlinear systems at each time step when $G$ depends on $\mathbf{u}$, leading to increased computational cost and complexity. In contrast, the proposed semi-IMEX scheme treats $G$ explicitly while keeping $\mathbf{u}$ implicit, reducing the problem to solving only linear systems. This approach eliminates the need to compute Jacobians while preserving the stability advantages of implicit methods. A family of semi-IMEX RK schemes with varying orders of accuracy is introduced. Numerical simulations for various nonlinear equations, including nonlinear diffusion models, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Cahn-Hilliard equation, confirm the expected convergence rates and demonstrate that the proposed method allows for larger time step sizes without triggering stability issues.</description>

      <title>An efffcient numerical scheme for two-dimensional nonlinear time fractional Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a linearized fully discrete scheme is proposed to solve the two-dimensional nonlinear time fractional Schr\"odinger equation with weakly singular solutions, which is constructed by using L1 scheme for Caputo fractional derivative, backward formula for the approximation of nonlinear term and five-point difference scheme in space. We rigorously prove the unconditional stability and pointwise-in-time convergence of the fully discrete scheme, which does not require any restriction on the grid ratio. Numerical results are presented to verify the accuracy of the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Computing the unitary best approximant to the exponential function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitary best approximation to the exponential function on an interval on the imaginary axis has been introduced recently. In the present work two algorithms are considered to compute this best approximant: an algorithm based on rational interpolation in successively corrected interpolation nodes and the AAA-Lawson method. Moreover, a posteriori bounds are introduced to evaluate the quality of a computed approximant and to show convergence to the unitary best approximant in practice. Two a priori estimates -- one based on experimental data, and one based on an asymptotic error estimate -- are introduced to determine the underlying frequency for which the unitary best approximant achieves a given accuracy. Performance of algorithms and estimates is verified by numerical experiments. In particular, the interpolation-based algorithm converges to the unitary best approximant within a small number of iterations in practice.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of a Stochastic Interacting Particle-Field Algorithm for 3D Parabolic-Parabolic Keller-Segel Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemotaxis models describe the movement of organisms in response to chemical gradients. In this paper, we present a stochastic interacting particle-field algorithm with random batch approximation (SIPF-$r$) for the three-dimensional (3D) parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel (KS) system, also known as the fully parabolic KS system. The SIPF-$r$ method approximates the KS system by coupling particle-based representations of density with a smooth field variable computed using spectral methods. By incorporating the random batch method (RBM), we bypass the mean-field limit and significantly reduce computational complexity. Under mild assumptions on the regularity of the original KS system and the boundedness of numerical approximations, we prove that, with high probability, the empirical measure of the SIPF-$r$ particle system converges to the exact measure of the limiting McKean-Vlasov process in the $1$-Wasserstein distance. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical convergence rates and demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the SIPF-$r$ method.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein convergence rates for stochastic particle approximation of Boltzmann models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish quantitative convergence rates for stochastic particle approximation based on Nanbu-type Monte Carlo schemes applied to a broad class of collisional kinetic models. Using coupling techniques and stability estimates in the Wasserstein-1 (Kantorovich-Rubinstein) metric, we derive sharp error bounds that reflect the nonlinear interaction structure of the models. Our framework includes classical Nanbu Monte Carlo method and more recent developments as Time Relaxed Monte Carlo methods. The results bridge the gap between probabilistic particle approximations and deterministic numerical error analysis, and provide a unified perspective for the convergence theory of Monte Carlo methods for Boltzmann-type equations. As a by-product, we also obtain existence and uniqueness of solutions to a large class of Boltzmann-type equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel stochastic multigrid minimization method for ptychographic phase retrieval. In our formulation, the challenging nonconvex and ill-posed inverse problem is recast as the iterative minimization of a quadratic surrogate model that majorizes the original objective function. Our general framework encompasses the Ptychographic Iterative Engine (PIE) family of algorithms. By efficiently solving the surrogate problem using a multigrid method, our approach delivers significant improvements in both convergence speed and reconstruction quality compared with conventional PIE techniques.</description>

      <title>An initial-boundary corrected splitting method for diffusion-reaction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strang splitting is a widely used second-order method for solving diffusion-reaction problems. However, its convergence order is often reduced to order $1$ for Dirichlet boundary conditions and to order $1.5$ for Neumann and Robin boundary conditions, leading to lower accuracy and reduced efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new splitting approach, called an initial-boundary corrected splitting, which avoids order reduction while improving computational efficiency for a wider range of applications. In contrast to the corrections proposed in the literature, it does not require the computation of correction terms that depend on the boundary conditions and boundary data. Through rigorous analytical convergence analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate the improved accuracy and performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Energy-preserving iteration schemes for Gauss collocation integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop energy-preserving iterative schemes for the (non-)linear systems arising in the Gauss integration of Poisson systems with quadratic Hamiltonian. Exploiting the relation between Gauss collocation integrators and diagonal Pad\'e approximations, we establish a Krylov-subspace iteration scheme based on a $Q$-Arnoldi process for linear systems that provides energy conservation not only at convergence --as standard iteration schemes do--, but also at the level of the individual iterates. It is competitive with GMRES in terms of accuracy and cost for a single iteration step and hence offers significant efficiency gains, when it comes to time integration of high-dimensional Poisson systems within given error tolerances. On top of the linear results, we consider non-linear Poisson systems and design non-linear solvers for the implicit midpoint rule (Gauss integrator of second order), using the fact that the associated Pad\'e approximation is a Cayley transformation. For the non-linear systems arising at each time step, we propose fixed-point and Newton-type iteration schemes that inherit the convergence order with comparable cost from their classical versions, but have energy-preserving iterates.</description>

      <title>WG-IDENT: Weak Group Identification of PDEs with Varying Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) identification is a data-driven method for mathematical modeling, and has received a lot of attentions recently. The stability and precision in identifying PDE from heavily noisy spatiotemporal data present significant difficulties. This problem becomes even more complex when the coefficients of the PDEs are subject to spatial variation. In this paper, we propose a Weak formulation of Group-sparsity-based framework for IDENTifying PDEs with varying coefficients, called WG-IDENT, to tackle this challenge. Our approach utilizes the weak formulation of PDEs to reduce the impact of noise. We represent test functions and unknown PDE coefficients using B-splines, where the knot vectors of test functions are optimally selected based on spectral analysis of the noisy data. To facilitate feature selection, we propose to integrate group sparse regression with a newly designed group feature trimming technique, called GF-trim, to eliminate unimportant features. Extensive and comparative ablation studies are conducted to validate our proposed method. The proposed method not only demonstrates greater robustness to high noise levels compared to state-of-the-art algorithms but also achieves superior performance while exhibiting reduced sensitivity to hyperparameter selection.</description>

      <title>Dual-grid parameter choice method with application to image deblurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational regularization of ill-posed inverse problems is based on minimizing the sum of a data fidelity term and a regularization term. The balance between them is tuned using a positive regularization parameter, whose automatic choice remains an open question in general. A novel approach for parameter choice is introduced, based on the use of two slightly different computational models for the same inverse problem. Small parameter values should give two very different reconstructions due to amplification of noise. Large parameter values lead to two identical but trivial reconstructions. Optimal parameter is chosen between the extremes by matching image similarity of the two reconstructions with a pre-defined value. Efficacy of the new method is demonstrated with image deblurring using measured data and two different regularizers.</description>

      <title>What metric to optimize for suppressing instability in a Vlasov-Poisson system?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilizing plasma dynamics is an important task in green energy generation via nuclear fusion. One common strategy is to introduce an external field to prevent the plasma distribution from developing turbulence. However, finding such external fields efficiently remains an open question, even for simplified models such as the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) system. In this work, we leverage two different approaches to build such fields: for the first approach, we use an analytical derivation of the dispersion relation of the VP system to find a range of reasonable fields that can potentially suppress instability, providing a qualitative suggestion. For the second approach, we leverage PDE-constrained optimization to obtain a locally optimal field using different loss functions. As the stability of the system can be characterized in several different ways, the objective functions need to be tailored accordingly. We show, through extensive numerical tests, that objective functions such as the relative entropy (KL divergence) and the $L^{2}$ norm result in a highly non-convex problem, rendering the global minimum difficult to find. However, we show that using the electric energy of the system as a loss function is advantageous, as it has a large convex basin close to the global minimum. Unfortunately, outside the basin, the electric energy landscape consists of unphysical flat local minima, thus rendering a good initial guess key for the overall convergence of the optimization problem, particularly for solvers with adaptive steps.</description>

      <title>Stable Determination and Reconstruction of a Quasilinear Term in an Elliptic Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the inverse problem of determining a quasilinear term appearing in a nonlinear elliptic equation from the measurement of the conormal derivative on the boundary. This problem arises in several practical applications, e.g., heat conduction. We derive novel H\"older stability estimates for both multi- and one-dimensional cases: in the multi-dimensional case, the stability estimates are stated with one single boundary measurement, whereas in the one-dimensional case, due to dimensionality limitation, the stability results are stated for the Dirichlet boundary condition varying in a space of dimension one. We derive these estimates using different properties of solution representations. We complement the theoretical results with numerical reconstructions of the quasilinear term, which illustrate the stable recovery of the quasilinear term in the presence of data noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the existence of Arnold diffusion in the planar full three-body problem, which is expressed as a perturbation of a Kepler problem and a planar circular restricted three-body problem, with the perturbation parameter being the mass of the smallest body. In this context, we obtain Arnold diffusion in terms of a transfer of energy, in an amount independent of the perturbation parameter, between the Kepler problem and the restricted three-body problem. Our argument is based on a topological method based on correctly aligned windows which is implemented into a computer assisted proof. This approach can be applied to physically relevant masses of the bodies, such as those in a Neptune-Triton-asteroid system. In this case, we obtain explicit estimates for the range of the perturbation parameter and for the diffusion time.</description>

      <title>Epsilon-Neighborhood Decision-Boundary Governed Estimation (EDGE) of 2D Black Box Classifier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating decision boundaries in black box systems is critical when ensuring safety, quality, and feasibility in real-world applications. However, existing methods iteratively refine boundary estimates by sampling in regions of uncertainty, without providing guarantees on the closeness to the decision boundary and also result in unnecessary exploration that is especially disadvantageous when evaluations are costly. This paper presents the Epsilon-Neighborhood Decision-Boundary Governed Estimation (EDGE), a sample efficient and function-agnostic algorithm that leverages the intermediate value theorem to estimate the location of the decision boundary of a black box binary classifier within a user-specified epsilon-neighborhood. Evaluations are conducted on three nonlinear test functions and a case study of an electric grid stability problem with uncertain renewable power injection. The EDGE algorithm demonstrates superior sample efficiency and better boundary approximation than adaptive sampling techniques and grid-based searches.</description>

      <title>Level-set topology optimisation with unfitted finite elements and automatic shape differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop automatic shape differentiation techniques for unfitted discretisations and link these to recent advances in shape calculus for unfitted methods. We extend existing analytic shape calculus results to the case where the domain boundary intersects with the boundary of the background domain. We further show that we can recover these analytic derivatives to machine precision regardless of the mesh size using the developed automatic shape differentiation techniques. In addition, we show that we can also recover the symmetric shape Hessian. We implement these techniques for both serial and distributed computing frameworks in the Julia package GridapTopOpt and the wider Gridap ecosystem. As part of this implementation we propose a novel graph-based approach for isolated volume detection. We demonstrate the applicability of the unfitted automatic shape differentiation framework and our implementation by considering the three-dimensional minimum compliance topology optimisation of a linear elastic wheel and of a linear elastic structure in a fluid-structure interaction problem with Stokes flow. The implementation is general and allows GridapTopOpt to solve a wide range of problems without analytic calculation of shape derivatives and avoiding issues that arise when material properties are smoothed at the domain boundary. The software is open source and available at https://github.com/zjwegert/GridapTopOpt.jl.</description>

      <title>BO-SA-PINNs: Self-adaptive physics-informed neural networks based on Bayesian optimization for automatically designing PDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is becoming a popular alternative method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they require dedicated manual modifications to the hyperparameters of the network, the sampling methods and loss function weights for different PDEs, which reduces the efficiency of the solvers. In this paper, we pro- pose a general multi-stage framework, i.e. BO-SA-PINNs to alleviate this issue. In the first stage, Bayesian optimization (BO) is used to select hyperparameters for the training process, and based on the results of the pre-training, the network architecture, learning rate, sampling points distribution and loss function weights suitable for the PDEs are automatically determined. The proposed hyperparameters search space based on experimental results can enhance the efficiency of BO in identifying optimal hyperparameters. After selecting the appropriate hyperparameters, we incorporate a global self-adaptive (SA) mechanism the second stage. Using the pre-trained model and loss information in the second-stage training, the exponential moving average (EMA) method is employed to optimize the loss function weights, and residual-based adaptive refinement with distribution (RAR-D) is used to optimize the sampling points distribution. In the third stage, L-BFGS is used for stable training. In addition, we introduce a new activation function that enables BO-SA-PINNs to achieve higher accuracy. In numerical experiments, we conduct comparative and ablation experiments to verify the performance of the model on Helmholtz, Maxwell, Burgers and high-dimensional Poisson equations. The comparative experiment results show that our model can achieve higher accuracy and fewer iterations in test cases, and the ablation experiments demonstrate the positive impact of every improvement.</description>

      <title>Truncated Matrix Completion - An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank Matrix Completion (LRMC) describes the problem where we wish to recover missing entries of partially observed low-rank matrix. Most existing matrix completion work deals with sampling procedures that are independent of the underlying data values. While this assumption allows the derivation of nice theoretical guarantees, it seldom holds in real-world applications. In this paper, we consider various settings where the sampling mask is dependent on the underlying data values, motivated by applications in sensing, sequential decision-making, and recommender systems. Through a series of experiments, we study and compare the performance of various LRMC algorithms that were originally successful for data-independent sampling patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method of obtaining a posteriori estimates which does not use the duality theory and which applies to variational inequalities with monotone operators, without assuming the potentiality of operators. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on problems driven by nonlinear operators of the $p$-Laplacian type, including the anisotropic $p$-Laplacian, polyharmonic $p$-Laplacian, and fractional $p$-Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimal experimental design with Wasserstein information criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) provides a principled framework for selecting the most informative observational settings in experiments. With rapid advances in computational power, Bayesian OED has become increasingly feasible for inference problems involving large-scale simulations, attracting growing interest in fields such as inverse problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel design criterion based on the expected Wasserstein-$p$ distance between the prior and posterior distributions. Especially, for $p=2$, this criterion shares key parallels with the widely used expected information gain (EIG), which relies on the Kullback--Leibler divergence instead. First, the Wasserstein-2 criterion admits a closed-form solution for Gaussian regression, a property which can be also leveraged for approximative schemes. Second, it can be interpreted as maximizing the information gain measured by the transport cost incurred when updating the prior to the posterior. Our main contribution is a stability analysis of the Wasserstein-1 criterion, where we provide a rigorous error analysis under perturbations of the prior or likelihood. We partially extend this study also to the Wasserstein-2 criterion. In particular, these results yield error rates when empirical approximations of priors are used. Finally, we demonstrate the computability of the Wasserstein-2 criterion and demonstrate our approximation rates through simulations.</description>

      <title>Sidecar: A Structure-Preserving Framework for Solving Partial Differential Equations with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with neural networks (NNs) has shown great potential in various scientific and engineering fields. However, most existing NN solvers mainly focus on satisfying the given PDEs, without explicitly considering intrinsic physical properties such as mass conservation or energy dissipation. This limitation can result in unstable or nonphysical solutions, particularly in long-term simulations. To address this issue, we propose Sidecar, a novel framework that enhances the accuracy and physical consistency of existing NN solvers by incorporating structure-preserving knowledge. Inspired by the Time-Dependent Spectral Renormalization (TDSR) approach, our Sidecar framework introduces a small copilot network, which is trained to guide the existing NN solver in preserving physical structure. This framework is designed to be highly flexible, enabling the incorporation of structure-preserving principles from diverse PDEs into a wide range of NN solvers. Our experimental results on benchmark PDEs demonstrate the improvement of the existing neural network solvers in terms of accuracy and consistency with structure-preserving properties.</description>

      <title>DUE: A Deep Learning Framework and Library for Modeling Unknown Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equations, particularly differential equations, are fundamental for understanding natural phenomena and predicting complex dynamics across various scientific and engineering disciplines. However, the governing equations for many complex systems remain unknown due to intricate underlying mechanisms. Recent advancements in machine learning and data science offer a new paradigm for modeling unknown equations from measurement or simulation data. This paradigm shift, known as data-driven discovery or modeling, stands at the forefront of AI for science, with significant progress made in recent years. In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework for data-driven modeling of unknown equations using deep learning. This versatile framework is capable of learning unknown ODEs, PDEs, DAEs, IDEs, SDEs, reduced or partially observed systems, and non-autonomous differential equations. Based on this framework, we have developed Deep Unknown Equations (DUE), an open-source software package designed to facilitate the data-driven modeling of unknown equations using modern deep learning techniques. DUE serves as an educational tool for classroom instruction, enabling students and newcomers to gain hands-on experience with differential equations, data-driven modeling, and contemporary deep learning approaches such as FNN, ResNet, generalized ResNet, operator semigroup networks (OSG-Net), and Transformers. Additionally, DUE is a versatile and accessible toolkit for researchers across various scientific and engineering fields. It is applicable not only for learning unknown equations from data but also for surrogate modeling of known, yet complex, equations that are costly to solve using traditional numerical methods. We provide detailed descriptions of DUE and demonstrate its capabilities through diverse examples, which serve as templates that can be easily adapted for other applications.</description>

      <title>A reduced 3D-0D FSI model of the aortic valve including leaflet curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.00571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an innovative lumped-parameter model of the aortic valve, designed to efficiently simulate the impact of valve dynamics on blood flow. Our reduced model includes the elastic effects associated with the leaflets' curvature and the stress exchanged with the blood flow. The introduction of a lumped-parameter model based on momentum balance entails an easier calibration of the model parameters: phenomenological-based models, on the other hand, typically have numerous parameters. This model is coupled to 3D Navier-Stokes equations describing the blood flow, where the moving valve leaflets are immersed in the fluid domain by a resistive method. A stabilized finite element method with a BDF time scheme is adopted for the discretization of the coupled problem, and the computational results show the suitability of the system in representing the leaflet motion, the blood flow in the ascending aorta, and the pressure jump across the leaflets. Both physiological and stenotic configurations are investigated, and we analyze the effects of different treatments for the leaflet velocity on the blood flow.</description>

      <title>The Hermite-Taylor Correction Function Method for Embedded Boundary and Maxwell's Interface Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel Hermite-Taylor correction function method to handle embedded boundary and interface conditions for Maxwell's equations. The Hermite-Taylor method evolves the electromagnetic fields and their derivatives through order $m$ in each Cartesian coordinate. This makes the development of a systematic approach to enforce boundary and interface conditions difficult. Here we use the correction function method to update the numerical solution where the Hermite-Taylor method cannot be applied directly. Time derivatives of boundary and interface conditions, converted into spatial derivatives, are enforced to obtain a stable method and relax the time-step size restriction of the Hermite-Taylor correction function method. The proposed high-order method offers a flexible systematic approach to handle embedded boundary and interface problems, including problems with discontinuous solutions at the interface. This method is also easily adaptable to other first order hyperbolic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an isogeometric mortar method for solving fourth-order elliptic problems. Specifically, our approach focuses on discretizing the biharmonic equation on $C^0$-conforming multi-patch domains, employing the mortar technique to weakly enforce $C^1$-continuity across interfaces. To guarantee discrete inf-sup stability, we introduce a carefully designed Lagrange multiplier space. In this formulation, the multipliers are splines with a degree reduced by two relative to the primal space and feature enhanced smoothness (or merged elements for splines with maximum smoothness) near the vertices. Within this framework, we establish optimal a priori error estimates and validate the theoretical results through numerical tests.</description>

      <title>An Antithetic Multilevel Monte Carlo-Milstein Scheme for Stochastic Partial Differential Equations with non-commutative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel multilevel Monte Carlo approach for estimating quantities of interest for stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). Drawing inspiration from [Giles and Szpruch: Antithetic multilevel Monte Carlo estimation for multi-dimensional SDEs without L\'evy area simulation, Annals of Appl. Prob., 2014], we extend the antithetic Milstein scheme for finite-dimensional stochastic differential equations to Hilbert space-valued SPDEs. Our method has the advantages of both Euler and Milstein discretizations, as it is easy to implement and does not involve intractable L\'evy area terms. Moreover, the antithetic correction in our method leads to the same variance decay in a MLMC algorithm as the standard Milstein method, resulting in significantly lower computational complexity than a corresponding MLMC Euler scheme. Our approach is applicable to a broader range of non-linear diffusion coefficients and does not require any commutative properties. The key component of our MLMC algorithm is a truncated Milstein-type time stepping scheme for SPDEs, which accelerates the rate of variance decay in the MLMC method when combined with an antithetic coupling on the fine scales. We combine the truncated Milstein scheme with appropriate spatial discretizations and noise approximations on all scales to obtain a fully discrete scheme and show that the antithetic coupling does not introduce an additional bias.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a class of algorithms combining classical fixed point iterations with repeated random sparsification of approximate solution vectors has been successfully applied to eigenproblems with matrices as large as $10^{108} \times 10^{108}$. So far, a complete mathematical explanation for their success has proven elusive.
  The family of methods has not yet been extended to the important case of linear system solves. In this paper we propose a new scheme based on repeated random sparsification that is capable of solving sparse linear systems in arbitrarily high dimensions. We provide a complete mathematical analysis of this new algorithm. Our analysis establishes a faster-than-Monte Carlo convergence rate and justifies use of the scheme even when the solution vector itself is too large to store.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT) scheme based on closed Newton-Cotes rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper improves the accuracy of the one-dimensional fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) by leveraging closed Newton-Cotes quadrature rules. Using the weights derived from the Composite Newton-Cotes rules of order QN, we demonstrate that the FRFT of a QN-long weighted sequence can be expressed as two composites of FRFTs. The first composite consists of an FRFT of a Q-long weighted sequence and an FRFT of an N-long sequence. Similarly, the second composite comprises an FRFT of an N-long weighted sequence and an FRFT of a Q-long sequence. Empirical results suggest that the composite FRFTs exhibit the commutative property and maintain consistency both algebraically and numerically. The proposed composite FRFT approach is applied to the inversion of Fourier and Laplace transforms, where it outperforms both the standard non-weighted FRFT and the Newton-Cotes integration method, though the improvement over the latter is less pronounced.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Expectation Inference for Efficient Uncertainty Quantification and History Matching of Transient Darcy Flows in Porous Media with Random Parameters Under Distribution Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uncertainty quantification of Darcy flows using history matching is important for the evaluation and prediction of subsurface reservoir performance. Conventional methods aim to obtain the maximum a posterior or maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) using gradient-based, heuristic or ensemble-based methods. These methods can be computationally expensive for high-dimensional problems since forward simulation needs to be run iteratively as physical parameters are updated. In the current study, we propose a nonlinear expectation inference (NEI) method for efficient history matching and uncertainty quantification accounting for distribution or Knightian uncertainty. Forward simulation runs are conducted on prior realisations once, and then a range of expectations are computed in the data space based on subsets of prior realisations with no repetitive forward runs required. In NEI, no prior probability distribution for data is assumed. Instead, the probability distribution is assumed to be uncertain with prior and posterior uncertainty quantified by nonlinear expectations. The inferred result of NEI is the posterior subsets on which the expected flow rates cover the varying interval of observation. The accuracy and efficiency of the new method are validated using single- and two-phase Darcy flows in 2D and 3D heterogeneous reservoirs.</description>

      <title>On Schr\"odingerization based quantum algorithms for linear dynamical systems with inhomogeneous terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the Schr\"odingerization method for quantum simulation of a general class of non-unitary dynamics with inhomogeneous source terms. The Schr\"odingerization technique, introduced in [31], transforms any linear ordinary and partial differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into a system under unitary dynamics via a warped phase transition that maps the equations into a higher dimension, making them suitable for quantum simulation. This technique can also be applied to these equations with inhomogeneous terms modeling source or forcing terms, or boundary and interface conditions, and discrete dynamical systems such as iterative methods in numerical linear algebra, through extra equations in the system. Difficulty arises with the presence of inhomogeneous terms since they can change the stability of the original system. In this paper, we systematically study-both theoretically and numerically-the important issue of recovering the original variables from the Schr\"odingerized equations, even when the evolution operator contains unstable modes. We show that, even with unstable modes, one can still construct a stable scheme; however, to recover the original variable, one needs to use suitable data in the extended space. We analyze and compare both the discrete and continuous Fourier transforms used in the extended dimension and derive corresponding error estimates, which allow one to use the more appropriate transform for specific equations. We also provide a smoother initialization for the Schr\"odingerized system to gain higher-order accuracy in the extended space. We homogenize the inhomogeneous terms with a stretch transformation, making it easier to recover the original variable. Our recovery technique also provides a simple and generic framework to solve general ill-posed problems in a computationally stable way.</description>

      <title>Discrete Poincar\'e and Trace Inequalities for the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive discrete Poincar\'e and trace inequalities for the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method. We employ the Crouzeix-Raviart space as a bridge, connecting classical discrete functional tools from Brenner's foundational work \cite{brenner2003poincare} with hybridizable finite element spaces comprised of piecewise polynomial functions defined both within the element interiors and on the mesh skeleton. This approach yields custom-tailored inequalities that underpin the stability analysis of HDG discretizations. The resulting framework is then used to demonstrate the well-posedness and robustness of HDG-based numerical schemes for second-order elliptic problems, even under minimal regularity assumptions on the source term and boundary data.</description>

      <title>Off-the-grid regularisation for Poisson inverse problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00810v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Off-the-grid regularisation has been extensively employed over the last decade in the context of ill-posed inverse problems formulated in the continuous setting of the space of Radon measures $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{X})$. These approaches enjoy convexity and counteract the discretisation biases as well the numerical instabilities typical of their discrete counterparts. In the framework of sparse reconstruction of discrete point measures (sum of weighted Diracs), a Total Variation regularisation norm in $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{X})$ is typically combined with an $L^2$ data term modelling additive Gaussian noise. To asses the framework of off-the-grid regularisation in the presence of signal-dependent Poisson noise, we consider in this work a variational model coupling the Total Variation regularisation with a Kullback-Leibler data term under a non-negativity constraint. Analytically, we study the optimality conditions of the composite functional and analyse its dual problem. Then, we consider an homotopy strategy to select an optimal regularisation parameter and use it within a Sliding Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Several numerical experiments on both 1D/2D simulated and real 3D fluorescent microscopy data are reported.</description>

      <title>Projection method for quasiperiodic elliptic equations and application to quasiperiodic homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06841v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we address the challenge of solving elliptic equations with quasiperiodic coefficients. To achieve accurate and efficient computation, we introduce the projection method, which enables the embedding of quasiperiodic systems into higher-dimensional periodic systems. To enhance the computational efficiency, we propose a compressed storage strategy for the stiffness matrix by its multi-level block circulant structure, significantly reducing memory requirements. Furthermore, we design a diagonal preconditioner to efficiently solve the resulting high-dimensional linear system by reducing the condition number of the stiffness matrix. These techniques collectively contribute to the computational effectiveness of our proposed approach. Convergence analysis shows the polynomial accuracy of the proposed method. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach through a series of numerical examples. Moreover, we apply our method to achieve a highly accurate computation of the homogenized coefficients for a quasiperiodic multiscale elliptic equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper, we develop a new method for the recovery of rational functions. Our idea is based on the property that Fourier coefficients of rational functions have the exponential structure and reconstruction of this exponential structure with the ESPRIT method in the frequency domain. Further we present sensitivity analysis for poles of rational functions reconstructed with our method in case of unstructured and structured perturbations. Finally, we consider several numerical experiments and, using sensitivities, explain the recovery errors for poles.</description>

      <title>On pattern formation in the thermodynamically-consistent variational Gray-Scott model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore pattern formation in a four-species variational Gary-Scott model, which includes all reverse reactions and introduces a virtual species to describe the birth-death process in the classical Gray-Scott model. This modification transforms the classical Gray-Scott model into a thermodynamically consistent closed system. The classical two-species Gray-Scott model can be viewed as a subsystem of the variational model in the limiting case when the small parameter $\epsilon$, related to the reaction rate of the reverse reactions, approaches zero. We numerically explore pattern formation in this physically more complete Gray-Scott model in one spatial dimension, using non-uniform steady states of the classical model as initial conditions. By decreasing $\epsilon$, we observed that the stationary pattern in the classical Gray-Scott model can be stabilized as the transient state in the variational model for a significantly small $\epsilon$. Additionally, the variational model admits oscillating and traveling-wave-like patterns for small $\epsilon$. The persistent time of these patterns is on the order of $O(\epsilon^{-1})$. We also analyze the energy stability of two uniform steady states in the variational Gary-Scott model for fixed $\epsilon$. Although both states are stable in a certain sense, the gradient flow type dynamics of the variational model exhibit a selection effect based on the initial conditions, with pattern formation occurring only if the initial condition does not converge to the boundary steady state, which corresponds to the trivial uniform steady state in the classical Gray-Scott model.</description>

      <title>A positive meshless finite difference scheme for scalar conservation laws with adaptive artificial viscosity driven by fault detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a meshless finite difference method for multivariate scalar conservation laws that generates positive schemes satisfying a local maximum principle on irregular nodes and relies on artificial viscosity for shock capturing. Coupling two different numerical differentiation formulas and the adaptive selection of the sets of influence allows to meet a local CFL condition without any {\it a priori}\ time step restriction. The artificial viscosity term is chosen in an adaptive way by applying it only in the vicinity of the sharp features of the solution identified by an algorithm for fault detection on scattered data. Numerical tests demonstrate a robust performance of the method on irregular nodes and advantages of adaptive artificial viscosity. The accuracy of the obtained solutions is comparable to that for standard monotone methods available only on Cartesian grids.</description>

      <title>An efficient scheme for approximating long-time dynamics of a class of non-linear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03689v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel, highly efficient, mean-reverting-SAV-BDF2-based, long-time unconditionally stable numerical scheme for a class of finite-dimensional nonlinear models important in geophysical fluid dynamics. The scheme is highly efficient in that only a fixed symmetric positive definite linear problem (with varying right-hand sides) is solved at each time step. The solutions remain uniformly bounded for all time. We show that the scheme accurately captures the long-time dynamics of the underlying geophysical model, with the global attractors and invariant measures of the scheme converging to those of the original model as the step size approaches zero.
  In our numerical experiments, we adopt an indirect approach, using statistics from long-time simulations to approximate the invariant measures. Our results suggest that the convergence rate of the long-term statistics, as a function of terminal time, is approximately first-order under the Jensen-Shannon metric and half-order under the total variation metric. This implies that extremely long simulations are required to achieve high-precision approximations of the invariant measure (or climate). Nevertheless, the second-order scheme significantly outperforms its first-order counterpart, requiring far less time to reach a small neighborhood of statistical equilibrium for a given step size.</description>

      <title>Data-driven parameterization refinement for the structural optimization of cruise ship hulls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the early design phase of cruise ship hulls, where the designers are tasked with ensuring the structural resilience of the ship against extreme waves while reducing steel usage and respecting safety and manufacturing constraints. At this stage the geometry of the ship is already finalized and the designer choose the thickness of the primary structural elements, such as decks, bulkheads, and the shell. Reduced order modeling and black-box optimization techniques reduce the use of expensive finite element analysis to only validate the most promising configurations, thanks to the efficient exploration of the domain of decision variables. However, the quality of the final results heavily relies on the problem formulation, and on how the structural elements are assigned to the decision variables. With the increased request for alternative fuels and engine technologies, the designers are often faced with novel configurations and risk producing ill-suited parameterizations. To address this issue, we enhanced a structural optimization pipeline for cruise ships developed in collaboration with Fincantieri S.p.A. with a novel data-driven hierarchical reparameterization procedure, based on the optimization of a series of sub-problems. Moreover, we implemented a multi-objective optimization module to provide the designers with insights into the efficient trade-offs between competing quantities of interest and enhanced the single-objective Bayesian optimization module. The new pipeline is tested on a simplified midship section and a full ship hull, comparing the automated reparameterization to a baseline model provided by the designers. The tests show that the iterative refinement outperforms the baseline, thus streamlining the initial design phase and helping tackle more innovative projects.</description>

      <title>Efficient cell-centered nodal integral method for multi-dimensional Burgers equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An efficient coarse-mesh nodal integral method (NIM), based on cell-centered variables and termed the cell-centered NIM (CCNIM), is developed and applied to solve multi-dimensional, time-dependent, nonlinear Burgers equations, extending the applicability of CCNIM to nonlinear problems. To overcome the existing limitation of CCNIM to linear problems, the convective velocity in the nonlinear convection term is approximated using two different approaches, both demonstrating accuracy comparable to or better than traditional NIM for nonlinear Burgers problems. Unlike traditional NIM, which utilizes surface-averaged variables as discrete unknowns, this innovative approach formulates the final expression of the numerical scheme using discrete unknowns represented by cell-centered (or node-averaged) variables. Using these cell centroids, the proposed CCNIM approach presents several advantages compared to traditional NIM. These include a simplified implementation process in terms of local coordinate systems, enhanced flexibility regarding the higher order of accuracy in time, straightforward formulation for higher-degree temporal derivatives, and offering a viable option for coupling with other physics. The multi-dimensional time-dependent Burgers problems (propagating shock, propagation, and diffusion of an initial sinusoidal wave, shock-like formation) with known analytical solutions are solved in order to validate the developed scheme. Furthermore, a detailed comparison between the proposed CCNIM approach and other traditional NIM schemes is conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness. The proposed approach has shown quadratic convergence in both space and time, i.e., O[$(\Delta x)^2, (\Delta t)^2$], for the considered test problems. The simplicity and robustness of the approach provide a strong foundation for its seamless extension to more complex fluid flow problems.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Optimization for the Evolve-Filter-Relax regularization of convection-dominated flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical stabilization techniques are often employed in under-resolved simulations of convection-dominated flows to improve accuracy and mitigate spurious oscillations. Specifically, the evolve--filter--relax (EFR) algorithm is a framework which consists in evolving the solution, applying a filtering step to remove high-frequency noise, and relaxing through a convex combination of filtered and original solutions. The stability and accuracy of the EFR solution strongly depend on two parameters, the filter radius $\delta$ and the relaxation parameter $\chi$. Standard choices for these parameters are usually fixed in time, and related to the full order model setting, i.e., the grid size for $\delta$ and the time step for $\chi$. The key novelties with respect to the standard EFR approach are: (i) time-dependent parameters $\delta(t)$ and $\chi(t)$, and (ii) data-driven adaptive optimization of the parameters in time, considering a fully-resolved simulation as reference. In particular, we propose three different classes of optimized-EFR (Opt-EFR) strategies, aiming to optimize one or both parameters. The new Opt-EFR strategies are tested in the under-resolved simulation of a turbulent flow past a cylinder at $Re=1000$. The Opt-EFR proved to be more accurate than standard approaches by up to 99$\%$, while maintaining a similar computational time. In particular, the key new finding of our analysis is that such accuracy can be obtained only if the optimized objective function includes: (i) a global metric (as the kinetic energy), and (ii) spatial gradients' information.</description>

      <title>A novel multipoint stress control volume method for linear elasticity on quadrilateral grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel control volume method that is locally conservative and locking-free for linear elasticity problem on quadrilateral grids. The symmetry of stress is weakly imposed through the introduction of a Lagrange multiplier. As such, the method involves three unknowns: stress, displacement and rotation. To ensure the well-posedness of the scheme, a pair of carefully defined finite element spaces is used for the stress, displacement and rotation such that the inf-sup condition holds. An appealing feature of the method is that piecewise constant functions are used for the approximations of stress, displacement and rotation, which greatly simplifies the implementation. In particular, the stress space is defined delicately such that the stress bilinear form is localized around each vertex, which allows for the local elimination of the stress, resulting in a cell-centered system. By choosing different definitions of the space for rotation, we develop two variants of the method. In particular, the first method uses a constant function for rotation over the interaction region, which allows for further elimination and results in a cell-centered system involving displacement only. A rigorous error analysis is performed for the proposed scheme. We show the optimal convergence for $L^2$-error of the stress and rotation. Moreover, we can also prove the superconvergence for $L^2$-error of displacement. Extensive numerical simulations indicate that our method is efficient and accurate, and can handle problems with discontinuous coefficients.</description>

Abstract: Existing studies on the convergence of numerical methods for curvature flows primarily focus on first-order temporal schemes. In this paper, we establish a novel error analysis for parametric finite element approximations of genus-1 axisymmetric mean curvature flow, formulated using two classical second-order time-stepping methods: the Crank-Nicolson method and the BDF2 method. Our results establish optimal error bounds in both the L^2-norm and H^1-norm, along with a superconvergence result in the H^1-norm for each fully discrete approximation. Finally, we perform convergence experiments to validate the theoretical findings and present numerical simulations for various genus-1 surfaces. Through a series of comparative experiments, we also demonstrate that the methods proposed in this paper exhibit significant mesh advantages.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates enhancing option pricing by extending the Black-Scholes model to include stochastic volatility and interest rate variability within the Partial Differential Equation (PDE). The PDE is solved using the finite difference method. The extended Black-Scholes model and a machine learning-based LSTM model are developed and evaluated for pricing Google stock options. Both models were backtested using historical market data. While the LSTM model exhibited higher predictive accuracy, the finite difference method demonstrated superior computational efficiency. This work provides insights into model performance under varying market conditions and emphasizes the potential of hybrid approaches for robust financial modeling.</description>

      <title>Splitting Method for Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the two-dimensional stochastic steady-state Navier-Stokes(NS) equations with additive random noise. We introduce an innovative splitting method that decomposes the stochastic NS equations into a deterministic NS component and a stochastic equation. We rigorously analyze the proposed splitting method from the perspectives of equivalence, stability, existence and uniqueness of the solution. We also propose a modified splitting scheme, which simplified the stochastic equation by omitting its nonlinear terms. A detailed analysis of the solution properties for this modified approach is provided. Additionally, we discuss the statistical errors with both the original splitting format and the modified scheme. Our theoretical and numerical studies demonstrate that the equivalent splitting scheme exhibits significantly enhanced stability compared to the original stochastic NS equations, enabling more effective handling of nonlinear characteristics. Several numerical experiments were performed to compare the statistical errors of the splitting method and the modified splitting method. Notably, the deterministic NS equation in the splitting method does not require repeated solving, and the stochastic equation in the modified scheme is free of nonlinear terms. These features make the modified splitting method particularly advantageous for large-scale computations, as it significantly improves computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.</description>

      <title>Efficient Simulation of Singularly Perturbed Systems Using a Stabilized Multirate Explicit Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singularly perturbed systems (SPSs) are prevalent in engineering applications, where numerically solving their initial value problems (IVPs) is challenging due to stiffness arising from multiple time scales. Classical explicit methods require impractically small time steps for stability, while implicit methods developed for SPSs are computationally intensive and less efficient for strongly nonlinear systems. This paper introduces a Stabilized Multirate Explicit Scheme (SMES) that stabilizes classical explicit methods without the need for small time steps or implicit formulations. By employing a multirate approach with variable time steps, SMES allows the fast dynamics to rapidly converge to their equilibrium manifold while slow dynamics evolve with larger steps. Analysis shows that SMES achieves numerical stability with significantly reduced computational effort and controlled error. Its effectiveness is illustrated with a numerical example.</description>

Our method is directly applicable to the probabilistic analysis of systems that can be represented as probabilistic loops; i.e., algorithms that express and implement non-deterministic processes ranging from robotics to macroeconomics and biology to software and cyber-physical systems. K-series statically approximates the joint and marginal distributions of a vector of continuous random variables updated in a probabilistic non-nested loop with nonlinear assignments given a finite number of moments of the unknown density. Moreover, K-series automatically derives the distribution of the systems' random variables symbolically as a function of the loop iteration. K-series density estimates are accurate, easy and fast to compute. We demonstrate the feasibility and performance of our approach on multiple benchmark examples from the literature.</description>

      <title>Discrepancies are Virtue: Weak-to-Strong Generalization through Lens of Intrinsic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization is a type of finetuning (FT) where a strong (large) student model is trained on pseudo-labels generated by a weak teacher. Surprisingly, W2S FT often outperforms the weak teacher. We seek to understand this phenomenon through the observation that FT often occurs in intrinsically low-dimensional spaces. Leveraging the low intrinsic dimensionality of FT, we analyze W2S in the ridgeless regression setting from a variance reduction perspective. For a strong student - weak teacher pair with sufficiently expressive low-dimensional feature subspaces $\mathcal{V}_s, \mathcal{V}_w$, we provide an exact characterization of the variance that dominates the generalization error of W2S. This unveils a virtue of discrepancy between the strong and weak models in W2S: the variance of the weak teacher is inherited by the strong student in $\mathcal{V}_s \cap \mathcal{V}_w$, while reduced by a factor of $\dim(\mathcal{V}_s)/N$ in the subspace of discrepancy $\mathcal{V}_w \setminus \mathcal{V}_s$ with $N$ pseudo-labels for W2S. Further, our analysis casts light on the sample complexities and the scaling of performance gap recovery in W2S. The analysis is supported with experiments on synthetic regression and real vision and NLP tasks.</description>

      <title>Residual-based Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration for sparse Hermitian eigenvalue problems tolerant to inexact matrix-vector products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chebyshev Filtered Subspace Iteration (ChFSI) has been widely adopted for computing a small subset of extreme eigenvalues in large sparse matrices. This work introduces a residual-based reformulation of ChFSI, referred to as R-ChFSI, designed to accommodate inexact matrix-vector products while maintaining robust convergence properties. By reformulating the traditional Chebyshev recurrence to operate on residuals rather than eigenvector estimates, the R-ChFSI approach effectively suppresses the errors made in matrix-vector products, improving the convergence behaviour for both standard and generalized eigenproblems. This ability of R-ChFSI to be tolerant to inexact matrix-vector products allows one to incorporate approximate inverses for large-scale generalized eigenproblems, making the method particularly attractive where exact matrix factorizations or iterative methods become computationally expensive for evaluating inverses. It also allows us to compute the matrix-vector products in lower-precision arithmetic allowing us to leverage modern hardware accelerators. Through extensive benchmarking, we demonstrate that R-ChFSI achieves desired residual tolerances while leveraging low-precision arithmetic. For problems with millions of degrees of freedom and thousands of eigenvalues, R-ChFSI attains final residual norms in the range of 10$^{-12}$ to 10$^{-14}$, even with FP32 and TF32 arithmetic, significantly outperforming standard ChFSI in similar settings. In generalized eigenproblems, where approximate inverses are used, R-ChFSI achieves residual tolerances up to ten orders of magnitude lower, demonstrating its robustness to approximation errors. Finally, R-ChFSI provides a scalable and computationally efficient alternative for solving large-scale eigenproblems in high-performance computing environments.</description>

      <title>GLT hidden structures in mean-field quantum spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores structured matrix sequences arising in mean-field quantum spin systems. We express these sequences within the framework of generalized locally Toeplitz (GLT) $*$-algebras, leveraging the fact that each GLT matrix sequence has a unique GLT symbol. This symbol characterizes both the asymptotic singular value distribution and, for Hermitian or quasi-Hermitian sequences, the asymptotic spectral distribution. Specifically, we analyze two cases of real symmetric matrix sequences stemming from mean-field quantum spin systems and determine their associated distributions using GLT theory. Our study concludes with visualizations and numerical tests that validate the theoretical findings, followed by a discussion of open problems and future directions.</description>

      <title>Numerical solution by shape optimization method to an inverse shape problem in multi-dimensional advection-diffusion problem with space dependent coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on numerically solving a shape identification problem related to advection-diffusion processes with space-dependent coefficients using shape optimization techniques. Two boundary-type cost functionals are considered, and their corresponding variations with respect to shapes are derived using the adjoint method, employing the chain rule approach. This involves firstly utilizing the material derivative of the state system and secondly using its shape derivative. Subsequently, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) combined with the Sobolev-gradient-descent algorithm is applied to stably solve the shape reconstruction problem. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the methods.</description>

      <title>Pychop: Emulating Low-Precision Arithmetic in Numerical Methods and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the growing demand for low-precision arithmetic in computational science, we exploit lower-precision emulation in Python -- widely regarded as the dominant programming language for numerical analysis and machine learning. Low-precision training has revolutionized deep learning by enabling more efficient computation and reduced memory and energy consumption while maintaining model fidelity. To better enable numerical experimentation with and exploration of low precision computation, we developed the Pychop library, which supports customizable floating-point formats and a comprehensive set of rounding modes in Python, allowing users to benefit from fast, low-precision emulation in numerous applications. Pychop also introduces interfaces for both PyTorch and JAX, enabling efficient low-precision emulation on GPUs for neural network training and inference with unparalleled flexibility.
  In this paper, we offer a comprehensive exposition of the design, implementation, validation, and practical application of Pychop, establishing it as a foundational tool for advancing efficient mixed-precision algorithms. Furthermore, we present empirical results on low-precision emulation for image classification and object detection using published datasets, illustrating the sensitivity of the use of low precision and offering valuable insights into its impact. Pychop enables in-depth investigations into the effects of numerical precision, facilitates the development of novel hardware accelerators, and integrates seamlessly into existing deep learning workflows.
