      <title>High-Fidelity Cellular Network Control-Plane Traffic Generation without Domain Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With rapid evolution of mobile core network (MCN) architectures, large-scale control-plane traffic (CPT) traces are critical to studying MCN design and performance optimization by the R&amp;D community. The prior-art control-plane traffic generator SMM heavily relies on domain knowledge which requires re-design as the domain evolves. In this work, we study the feasibility of developing a high-fidelity MCN control plane traffic generator by leveraging generative ML models. We identify key challenges in synthesizing high-fidelity CPT including generic (to data-plane) requirements such as multimodality feature relationships and unique requirements such as stateful semantics and long-term (time-of-day) data variations. We show state-of-the-art, generative adversarial network (GAN)-based approaches shown to work well for data-plane traffic cannot meet these fidelity requirements of CPT, and develop a transformer-based model, CPT-GPT, that accurately captures complex dependencies among the samples in each traffic stream (control events by the same UE) without the need for GAN. Our evaluation of CPT-GPT on a large-scale control-plane traffic trace shows that (1) it does not rely on domain knowledge yet synthesizes control-plane traffic with comparable fidelity as SMM; (2) compared to the prior-art GAN-based approach, it reduces the fraction of streams that violate stateful semantics by two orders of magnitude, the max y-distance of sojourn time distributions of streams by 16.0%, and the transfer learning time in deriving new hourly models by 3.36x.</description>

      <title>Control Protocol for Entangled Pair Verification in Quantum Optical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quantum networks, where entangled photon pairs are distributed using fibre optic links from a centralized source to entangling nodes. The entanglement is then stored (via an entanglement swap) in entangling nodes' quantum memories until used in, e.g., distributed quantum computing, quantum key distribution, quantum sensing, and other applications. Due to the fibre loss, some photons are lost in transmission. Noise in the transmission link and the quantum memory also reduces fidelity. Thus, entangling nodes must keep updated records of photon-pair arrivals to each destination, and their use by the applications. This coordination requires classical information exchange between each entangled node pair. However, the same fibre link may not admit both classical and quantum transmissions, as the classical channels can generate enough noise (i.e., via spontaneous Raman scattering) to make the quantum link unusable. Here, we consider coordinating entanglement distribution using a standard Internet protocol (IP) network instead, and propose a control protocol to enable such. We analyse the increase in latency from transmission over an IP network, together with the effect of photon loss, quantum memory noise and buffer size, to determine the fidelity and rate of entangled pairs. We characterize the relationship between the latency of the non-ideal IP network and the decoherence time of the quantum memories, providing a comparison of promising quantum memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Network Topology Design for Task Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of delay-sensitive yet computing-intensive Internet of Things (IoT) applications poses challenges due to the limited processing power of IoT devices. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers a promising solution to address these challenges by placing computing servers close to end users. Despite extensive research on MEC, optimizing network topology to improve computational efficiency remains underexplored. Recognizing the critical role of network topology, we introduce a novel decentralized network topology design strategy for task offloading (DNTD-TO) that jointly considers topology design and task allocation. Inspired by communication and sensor networks, DNTD-TO efficiently constructs three-layered network structures for task offloading and generates optimal task allocations for these structures. Comparisons with existing topology design methods demonstrate the promising performance of our approach.</description>

      <title>Trust-Aware Sybil Attack Detection for Resilient Vehicular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles, or Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs), hold great promise, but concerns persist regarding safety, privacy, and security, particularly in the face of Sybil attacks, where malicious entities falsify neighboring traffic information. Despite advancements in detection techniques, many approaches suffer from processing delays and reliance on broad architecture, posing significant risks in mitigating attack damages. To address these concerns, our research proposes a Trust Aware Sybil Event Recognition (TASER) framework for assessing the integrity of vehicle data in VANETs. This framework evaluates information exchanged within local vehicle clusters, maintaining a cumulative trust metric for each vehicle based on reported data integrity. Suspicious entities failing to meet trust metric thresholds are statistically evaluated, and their legitimacy is challenged using directional antennas to verify their reported GPS locations. We evaluate our framework using the OMNeT++ discrete event simulator, SUMO traffic simulator, and VEINS interface with TraCI API. Our approach reduces attack detection times by up to 66% in urban scenarios, with accuracy varying by no more than 3% across simulations containing up to 30% Sybil nodes and operates without reliance on roadside infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Service Function Chain Mapping in Network Function Virtualization through Simultaneous NF Decomposition and VNF Placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network function virtualization enables network operators to implement new services through a process called service function chain mapping. The concept of Service Function Chain (SFC) is introduced to provide complex services, which is an ordered set of Network Functions (NF). The network functions of an SFC can be decomposed in several ways into some Virtual Network Functions (VNF). Additionally, the decomposed NFs can be placed (mapped) as VNFs on different machines on the underlying physical infrastructure. Selecting good decompositions and good placements among the possible options greatly affects both costs and service quality metrics. Previous research has addressed NF decomposition and VNF placement as separate problems. However, in this paper, we address both NF decomposition and VNF placement simultaneously as a single problem. Since finding an optimal solution is NP-hard, we have employed heuristic algorithms to solve the problem. Specifically, we have introduced a multiobjective decomposition and mapping VNFs (MODMVNF) method based on the non-dominated sorting genetic multi-objective algorithm (NSGAII) to solve the problem. The goal is to find near-optimal decomposition and mapping on the physical network at the same time to minimize the mapping cost and communication latency of SFC. The comparison of the results of the proposed method with the results obtained by solving ILP formulation of the problem as well as the results obtained from the multi-objective particle swarm algorithm shows the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of cost and communication latency.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Software Defined Wide Area Networking (SD-WAN) for Optimizing Multi-site Enterprise Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enterprise networks are becoming increasingly complex, posing challenges for traditional WANs in terms of scalability, management, and operational costs. Software Defined Networking (SDN) and its application in Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN) offer solutions by decoupling the control plane from the data plane, providing centralized management, enhanced flexibility, and automated provisioning. This research investigates the challenging application of SD-WAN to optimize traditional multisite enterprise networks. Experimental scenarios are designed in which SD-WAN is implemented on a traditional multi-site network topology with complex architecture, then followed by comprehensive evaluations of its performance across various critical aspects, including hardware status, transmission performance, and security.</description>

      <title>RIFO: Pushing the Efficiency of Programmable Packet Schedulers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Packet scheduling is a fundamental networking task that recently received renewed attention in the context of programmable data planes. Programmable packet scheduling systems such as those based on Push-In First-Out (PIFO) abstraction enabled flexible scheduling policies, but are too resource-expensive for large-scale line rate operation. This prompted research into practical programmable schedulers (e.g., SP-PIFO, AIFO) approximating PIFO behavior on regular hardware. Yet, their scalability remains limited due to extensive number of memory operations. To address this, we design an effective yet resource-efficient packet scheduler, Range-In First-Out (RIFO), which uses only three mutable memory cells and one FIFO queue per PIFO queue. RIFO is based on multi-criteria decision-making principles and uses small guaranteed admission buffers. Our large-scale simulations in Netbench demonstrate that despite using fewer resources, RIFO generally achieves competitive flow completion times across all studied workloads, and is especially effective in workloads with a significant share of large flows, reducing flow completion time up to 4.91x in datamining workload compared to state-of-the-art solutions. Our prototype implementation using P4 on Tofino switches requires only 650 lines of code, is scalable, and runs at line rate.</description>

      <title>Effective ML Model Versioning in Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models, data and software need to be regularly updated whenever essential version updates are released and feasible for integration. This is a basic but most challenging requirement to satisfy in the edge, due to the various system constraints and the major impact that an update can have on robustness and stability. In this paper, we formulate for the first time the ML model versioning optimization problem, and propose effective solutions, including the update automation with reinforcement learning (RL) based algorithm. We study the edge network environment due to the known constraints in performance, response time, security, and reliability, which make updates especially challenging. The performance study shows that model version updates can be fully and effectively automated with reinforcement learning method. We show that for every range of server load values, the proper versioning can be found that improves security, reliability and/or ML model accuracy, while assuring a comparably lower response time.</description>

      <title>Optimizing AoI at Query in Multiuser Wireless Uplink Networks: A Whittle Index Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02108v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how to schedule multiple users to optimize information freshness in a pull-based wireless network, where the status updates from users are requested by randomly arriving queries at the destination. We use the age of information at query (QAoI) to characterize the performance of information freshness. Such a decision-making problem is naturally modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), which, however, is prohibitively high to be solved optimally by the standard method due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this issue, we employ Whittle index approach, which allows us to decouple the original MDP into multiple sub-MDPs by relaxing the scheduling constraints. However, the binary Markovian query arrival process results in a bi-dimensional state and complex state transitions within each sub-MDP, making it challenging to verify Whittle indexability using conventional methods. After a thorough analysis of the sub-MDP's structure, we show that it is unichain and its optimal policy follows a threshold-type structure. This facilitates the verification of Whittle indexability of the sub-MDP by employing an easy-to-verify condition. Subsequently, the steady-state probability distributions of the sub-MDP under different threshold-type policies are analyzed, constituting the analytical expressions of different Whittle indices in terms of the expected average QAoI and scheduling time of the sub-MDP. Building on these, we devise an efficient algorithm to calculate Whittle indices for the formulated sub-MDPs. The simulation results validate our analyses and show the proposed Whittle index policy outperforms baseline policies and achieves near-optimal performance.</description>
