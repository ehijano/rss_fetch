      <title>Spectral form factor and energy correlations in banded random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Banded random matrices were introduced as a more realistic alternative to full random matrices for describing the spectral statistics of heavy nuclei. Initially considered by Wigner, they have since become a paradigmatic model for investigating level statistics and the localization-delocalization transition in disordered quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate that, despite the absence of short-range energy correlations, weak long-range energy correlations persist in the nonergodic phase of banded random matrices. This result is supported by our numerical and analytical studies of quantities that probe both short- and long-range energy correlations, namely, the spectral form factor, level number variance, and power spectrum. We derive the timescales for the onset of spectral correlations (ramp) and for the saturation (plateau) of the spectral form factor. Unexpectedly, we find that in the nonergodic phase, these timescales decrease as the bandwidth of the matrices is reduced. We also show that the high-frequency behavior of the power spectrum of energy fluctuations can distinguish between the nonergodic and ergodic phases of the banded random matrices.</description>

      <title>From Kernels to Features: A Multi-Scale Adaptive Theory of Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretically describing feature learning in neural networks is crucial for understanding their expressive power and inductive biases, motivating various approaches. Some approaches describe network behavior after training through a simple change in kernel scale from initialization, resulting in a generalization power comparable to a Gaussian process. Conversely, in other approaches training results in the adaptation of the kernel to the data, involving complex directional changes to the kernel. While these approaches capture different facets of network behavior, their relationship and respective strengths across scaling regimes remains an open question. This work presents a theoretical framework of multi-scale adaptive feature learning bridging these approaches. Using methods from statistical mechanics, we derive analytical expressions for network output statistics which are valid across scaling regimes and in the continuum between them. A systematic expansion of the network's probability distribution reveals that mean-field scaling requires only a saddle-point approximation, while standard scaling necessitates additional correction terms. Remarkably, we find across regimes that kernel adaptation can be reduced to an effective kernel rescaling when predicting the mean network output of a linear network. However, even in this case, the multi-scale adaptive approach captures directional feature learning effects, providing richer insights than what could be recovered from a rescaling of the kernel alone.</description>

      <title>On the behavior of a distributed network of capacitive constant phase elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a generalization of integer-order calculus, fractional calculus has seen tremendous applications in the past few years especially in the description of anomalous viscoelastic properties, transport processes in complex media as well as in dielectric and impedance spectroscopy of materials and electrode/electrolyte interfaces. The fractional-order capacitor or constant phase element (CPE) is a fractional-order model with impedance $z_c(s) = 1/(C_{\alpha} s^{\alpha})$ ($s=j \omega$, $C_{\alpha}&gt;0$, $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$) and is widely used in modeling impedance spectroscopy data in dispersive materials. In this study, we investigate the behavior of a network of distributed-order CPEs, each of which described by a Caputo-type time fractional differential equation relating the current on the CPE to its voltage, but with a non-negative, time-invariant weight function $\phi(\alpha)$. The behavior of the distributed-order network in terms of impedance and time-domain response to a constant current excitation is derived for two simple cases of $\phi(\alpha)$: (i) $\phi(\alpha)=1$ for $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$ and zero otherwise, and $(ii)$ $\phi(\alpha) = \sum_i C_{\alpha_i}\, \delta(\alpha-\alpha_i)$ corresponding to the general case of parallel-connected elemental CPEs of different orders $\alpha$, and pseudocapacitances $C_{\alpha}$. Our results show that the overall network is not equivalent to a single CPE, contrary to what would of been expected with ideal capacitors.</description>

      <title>Monitored interacting Dirac fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically study interacting Dirac fermions, described by the Thirring model, under weak local particle number measurements with monitoring rate $\gamma$. This system maps to a bosonic replica field theory, analyzed via the renormalization group. For a nonzero attractive interaction, a phase transition occurs at a critical measurement strength $\gamma_c$. When $\gamma&gt;\gamma_c$, the system enters a localized phase characterized by exponentially decaying density-density correlations beyond a finite correlation length; for $\gamma&lt;\gamma_c$, the correlations decay algebraically. The transition is of BKT-type, reflected by a characteristic scaling of the correlation length. In the non-interacting limit, $\gamma_c\to0$ shifts to zero, reducing the algebraic phase to a single point in parameter space. This identifies weak measurements in the free case as an implicit double fine-tuning to the critical endpoint of the BKT phase transition. Along the non-interacting line, we compute the entanglement entropy from density-density correlation functions and find no entanglement transition at nonzero measurement strength in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport of amorphous hafnia across the glass transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat transport in glasses across a wide range of temperature is vital for applications in gate dielectrics and heat insulator. However, it remains poorly understood due to the challenges of modeling vibrational anharmonicity below glass transition temperature and capturing configurational dynamics across the transition. Interestingly, recent calculations predicted that amorphous hafnia (a-HfO$_2$) exhibits an unusual drop in thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) with temperature, contrasting with the typical rise or saturation observed in glasses upon heating. Using molecular dynamics simulations with a machine-learning-based neuroevolution potential, we compute the vibrational properties and $\kappa$ of a-HfO$_2$ from 50~K to 2000~K. At low temperatures, we employ the Wigner transport equation to incorporate both anharmonicity and Bose-Einstein statistics of atomic vibration in the calculation of $\kappa$. At above 1200~K, atomic diffusion breaks down the Lorentzian-shaped quasiparticle picture and makes the lattice-dynamics treatment invalid. We thus use molecular dynamics with the Green-Kubo method to capture convective heat transport in a-HfO$_2$ near the glass transition at around 1500~K. Additionally, by extending the Wigner transport equation to supercooled liquid states, we find the crucial role of low-frequency modes in facilitating heat convection. The computed $\kappa$ of a-HfO$_2$, based on both Green-Kubo and Wigner transport theories, reveals a continuous increase with temperature up to 2000~K.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution for the polydisperse random close packing problem in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytical theory for the random close packing density, $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$, of polydisperse hard disks is provided using a theoretical approach based on the equilibrium model of crowding [A. Zaccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 028002 (2022)], which was recently justified based on extensive numerical analysis of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) line in the hard-sphere phase diagram [Anzivino et al., J. Chem. Phys. 158, 044901 (2023)]. The solution relies on the underlying equations of state for the hard disk fluid and provides predictions of $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$ as a function of the ratio of the standard deviation of the disk diameter distribution to its mean $s$. For the power-law size distribution evaluated at $s=0.246$, the theory yields $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.892$, which compares well with the most recent numerical estimate $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.905$ based on the Monte-Carlo swap algorithms [Ghimenti, Berthier, van Wijland, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 028202 (2024)].</description>

Abstract: Electrons at the Fermi energy may lose their ability to propagate to long distances in certain disordered media. We use Green functions and solve parquet equations in high spatial dimensions to construct a conserving mean-field theory of the metallic and localized phases with the transition between them in the disordered Anderson model. We find that the static diffusion constant $D$ does not vanish at the Anderson localization transition. The divergence of a new time scale, proportional to the static electrical polarizability, signals the vanishing of diffusion. We introduce an extension of the diffusion equation to reach a consistent microscopic picture of the Anderson localization transition and the localized phase. Anderson localization is caused by the emergence of a spatially localized quantum bound state.</description>

      <title>Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim$$10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of heuristic approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5% for much more rugged planted-solution instances. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $&lt;$1% and approximation ratios of about 72-88%. A theoretical implication of our algorithm is that only quantum algorithms with sublinear time complexity may have time-complexity quantum advantage for heuristic approximate optimization of classical spin glasses that have decaying correlations. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic theory of in-context learning by linear attention</title>

Abstract: Transformers have a remarkable ability to learn and execute tasks based on examples provided within the input itself, without explicit prior training. It has been argued that this capability, known as in-context learning (ICL), is a cornerstone of Transformers' success, yet questions about the necessary sample complexity, pretraining task diversity, and context length for successful ICL remain unresolved. Here, we provide a precise answer to these questions in an exactly solvable model of ICL of a linear regression task by linear attention. We derive sharp asymptotics for the learning curve in a phenomenologically-rich scaling regime where the token dimension is taken to infinity; the context length and pretraining task diversity scale proportionally with the token dimension; and the number of pretraining examples scales quadratically. We demonstrate a double-descent learning curve with increasing pretraining examples, and uncover a phase transition in the model's behavior between low and high task diversity regimes: In the low diversity regime, the model tends toward memorization of training tasks, whereas in the high diversity regime, it achieves genuine in-context learning and generalization beyond the scope of pretrained tasks. These theoretical insights are empirically validated through experiments with both linear attention and full nonlinear Transformer architectures.</description>

      <title>Observable asymptotics of regularized Cox regression models with standard Gaussian designs: a statistical mechanics approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of the Regularized Maximum Partial Likelihood Estimator (RMPLE) in the proportional limit, considering an arbitrary convex regularizer and assuming that the covariates $\mathbf{X}_i\in\mathbb{R}^{p}$ follow a multivariate Gaussian law with covariance $\mathbf{I}_p/p$ for each $i=1, \dots, n$. In order to efficiently compute the estimator under investigation, we propose a modified Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm, that we name COX-AMP, and compare its performance with the Coordinate-wise Descent (CD) algorithm, which is taken as reference. By means of the Replica method, we derive a set of six Replica Symmetric (RS) equations that we show to correctly describe the average behaviour of the estimators when the sample size and the number of covariates is large and commensurate. These equations cannot be solved in practice, as the data generating process (that we are trying to estimate) is not known. However, the update equations of COX-AMP suggest the construction of a local field that can in turn be used to accurately estimate all the RS order parameters of the theory \emph{solely from the data}, \emph{without} actually solving the RS equations. We emphasize that this approach can be applied when the estimator is computed via any method and is not restricted to COX-AMP. Once the RS order parameters are estimated, we have access to the amount of signal and noise in the RMPLE, but also its generalization error, directly from the data. Although we focus on the Partial Likelihood objective, we envisage broader application of the methodology proposed here, for instance to GLMs with nuisance parameters, which include some non-proportional hazards models, e.g. Accelerated Failure Time models.</description>

      <title>Geometry Dependent Localization of Surface Plasmons on Random Gold Nanoparticle Assemblies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assemblies of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) support hybridized modes of localized surface plasmons (LSPs), which delocalize in geometrically well-ordered arrangements. Here, the hybridization behavior of LSPs in geometrically completely disordered arrangements of Au NPs fabricated by an e-beam synthesis method is studied. Employing electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope in combination with numerical simulations, the disorder-driven spatial and spectral localization of the coupled LSP modes that depend on the NP thickness is revealed. Below 0.4 nm sample thickness (flat NPs), localization increases towards higher hybridized LSP mode energies. In comparison, above 10 nm thickness, a decrease of localization (an increase of delocalization) with higher mode energies is observed. In the intermediate thickness regime, a transition of the energy dependence of the localization between the two limiting cases, exhibiting a transition mode energy with minimal localization, is observed. This behavior is mainly driven by the energy and thickness dependence of the polarizability of the individual NPs.</description>

      <title>$NVU$ view on energy polydisperse Lennard-Jones systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When energy polydispersity is introduced into the Lennard-Jones (LJ) system, there is little effect on structure and dynamics [Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, J. Phys. Chem. B 127, 2837 (2023)]. For instance, at a given state point both the radial distribution function and the mean-square displacement as a function of time are virtually unaffected by even large energy polydispersity; this is in stark contrast to what happens when size polydispersity is introduced. We here argue -- and validate by simulations of up to 30\% polydispersity -- that this almost invariance of structure and dynamics reflects an approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface. Because $NVU$ dynamics (defined as geodesic motion at constant potential energy) is equivalent to Newtonian dynamics in the thermodynamic limit, the approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface implies virtually the same physics of energy polydisperse LJ systems as of the standard single-component version. In contrast, the constant-potential-energy surface is significantly affected by introducing size polydispersity.</description>

      <title>Deep Linear Network Training Dynamics from Random Initialization: Data, Width, Depth, and Hyperparameter Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically characterize gradient descent dynamics in deep linear networks trained at large width from random initialization and on large quantities of random data. Our theory captures the ``wider is better" effect of mean-field/maximum-update parameterized networks as well as hyperparameter transfer effects, which can be contrasted with the neural-tangent parameterization where optimal learning rates shift with model width. We provide asymptotic descriptions of both non-residual and residual neural networks, the latter of which enables an infinite depth limit when branches are scaled as $1/\sqrt{\text{depth}}$. We also compare training with one-pass stochastic gradient descent to the dynamics when training data are repeated at each iteration. Lastly, we show that this model recovers the accelerated power law training dynamics for power law structured data in the rich regime observed in recent works.</description>
