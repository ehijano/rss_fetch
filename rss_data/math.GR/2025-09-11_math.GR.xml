      <title>A note on connecting multiplicative functions defined on finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we explore relationships between multiplicative functions defined in \cite{Garonzi_2018}, \cite{Lazorec}. To do so, we use other important quotients defined and studied in \cite{ndeg}, \cite{Marius}, thus establishing deeper connections that were previously little or not evaluated in some group families. Furthermore, we extract new characterizations and asymptotic patterns for some classes of groups.</description>

      <title>Ordered groups of formal series, and a conjugacy problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an ordered field $\mathbb{T}$ of formal series over an ordered field $\mathbf{R}$ equipped with a composition law $\circ \colon \mathbb{T} \times \mathbb{T}^{&gt;\mathbb{R}} \longrightarrow \mathbb{T}$, we give conditions for $(\mathbb{T}^{&gt;\mathbb{R}},\circ)$ to be a group. We show that classical fields of transseries and hyperseries satisfy these conditions. We then give further conditions on $\mathbb{T}$ under which $(\mathbb{T}^{&gt;\mathbb{R}},\circ,&lt;)$ is a linearly ordered group with exactly three conjugacy classes, and solve the open problem of existence of such a group.</description>

      <title>Growth and identities of monogenic free adequate monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in inverse semigroup theory, we investigate the growth of and identities satisfied by free left and free two-sided adequate monoids. We explicitly compute the growth of the monogenic free left adequate monoid with the usual unary monoid generating set and show it has intermediate growth owing to a connection with integer partitions. In the two-sided case, we establish a lower bound on the (idempotent) growth rate of the monogenic free adequate monoid, showing that it grows exponentially. We completely classify the enriched identities satisfied by the monogenic free left adequate monoid and deduce that it satisfies the same monoid identities as the sylvester monoid. In contrast, we show that the monogenic free two-sided adequate monoid satisfies no non-trivial monoid identities.</description>

      <title>Rigidifying simplicial complexes and realizing group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any action of a finite group on a finitely presentable group arises as the action of the group of self-homotopy equivalences of a space on its fundamental group. In doing so, we prove that any finite connected (abstract) simplicial complex $\mathbf{K}$ can be rigidified -- meaning it can be perturbed in a way that reduces the full automorphism group to any subgroup -- while preserving the homotopy type of the geometric realization $| \mathbf{K} |$.</description>

      <title>On the third and fourth Betti numbers of a homogeneous space of a Lie group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper "The second cohomology of nilpotent orbits in classical Lie algebras, Kyoto J. Math. 60 (2020), no. 2, 717-799" by I. Biswas, P. Chatterjee, and C. Maity, explicit descriptions of the second and first real de Rham cohomology groups of a general homogeneous space of a Lie group are given, extending an earlier result in "On the exactness of Kostant-Kirillov form and the second cohomology of nilpotent orbits, Internat. J. Math. 23 (2012), no. 8, 1250086" by I. Biswas and P. Chatterjee. From the computational viewpoint, they turned out to be new and very useful, and in fact played a crucial role in determining the second cohomology of nilpotent orbits as done in the above two papers. In this paper, we give computable and explicit descriptions of the third and fourth real de Rham cohomologies of a general homogeneous space, in terms of the associated Lie-theoretic data, along the lines mentioned above. We also draw numerous corollaries of our main results in important special settings. Moreover, as a consequence, we obtain a new and interesting invariant by showing that for a large class of homogeneous spaces, the difference between the third and fourth Betti numbers coincides with the difference between the numbers of simple factors of the ambient group and the associated closed subgroup.</description>

      <title>A new construction of uncountably many finitely generated simple groups of homeomorphisms of the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of chain groups of homeomorphisms of the interval was introduced by Kim, Koberda and Lodha as a generalization of Thompson's group $F$. In this paper, we study an $S^1$-version of chain groups: ring groups. We study the simplicity of the commutator subgroups of ring groups. We show that a ring group with a prechain subgroup acting minimally on its support has a simple commutator subgroup. We also study isometric actions of ring groups on R-trees. We give a construction of ring groups such that for every fixed point-free isometric action on an R-tree, there exists an invariant line upon which the group acts by translations. We also confirm that there are uncountably many finitely generated simple groups in the group of orientation preserving homeomorphisms of $S^1$, which are commutator groups of ring groups.</description>

      <title>Power quotients of surface groups and mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be the fundamental group of a closed, orientable, hyperbolic surface $S$. The $n$-power quotient, $\Gamma(n)$, is the quotient of $\Gamma$ by the $n$th powers of simple closed curves. We prove an analogue of the Dehn--Nielsen--Baer theorem for suitable large values of $n$: the outer automorphism group of $\Gamma(n)$ is isomorphic to the quotient of the extended mapping class group of $S$ by $n$th powers of Dehn twists. There is also a corresponding description of the automorphism group as the quotient of the extended mapping class group of the corresponding once-punctured surface, and we relate these groups via a Birman-type exact sequence. Along the way, and as consequences, we prove structural properties of $\Gamma(n)$ for suitable large values of $n$, including: $\Gamma(n)$ is virtually torsion-free, acylindrically hyperbolic, infinitely presented, with solvable word problem and finite asymptotic dimension.</description>

      <title>The anabelian restricted Burnside problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n,d \in \mathbb N$ and $w \in \mathbb F_n$ be non-trivial. We prove that the relatively free group of rank $d$ in the variety defined by the group law $w$ has a largest anabelian finite quotient and estimate its size. Here, a finite group is called anabelian if it has only non-abelian composition factors. The estimate is based on explicit bounds for the length of laws for finite simple groups obtained by Bradford and the author and on recent work by Fumagalli--Leinen--Puglisi.</description>

      <title>The Lattice of Group Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an infinite group $G$, the poset $\mathcal{L}_G$ of group topologies constitutes a complete lattice. Although $\mathcal{L}_G$ is modular when $G$ is abelian, this property fails to persist for nilpotent groups. Extending Arnautov's 2010 work on the semi-modularity of $\mathcal{L}_G$ for nilpotent groups, we present an alternative proof with enhanced structural clarity. Additionally, we resolve two open questions from the Kourovka Notebook regarding lattice-theoretic properties of $\mathcal{L}_G$: (1) explicit construction of a countably infinite non-abelian nilpotent group with modular topology lattice, and (2) establishing the absence of property $P_2$ in infinite abelian groups.</description>

Abstract: We show that the complex of partial bases of the free group of rank $n$, where vertices are seen up to conjugation, is Cohen--Macaulay of dimension $n-1$. This positively answers a conjecture raised by Day and Putman. We prove our results in the more general context of freely decomposable groups.</description>

      <title>On the source algebra equivalence class of blocks with cyclic defect groups, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This series of papers is a contribution to the program of classifying $p$-blocks of finite groups up to source algebra equivalence, starting with the case of cyclic blocks.
  To any $p$-block $\mathbf{B}$ of a finite group with cyclic defect group $D$, Linckelmann associated an invariant $W( \mathbf{B} )$, which is an indecomposable endo-permutation module over $D$, and which, together with the Brauer tree of $\mathbf{B}$, essentially determines its source algebra equivalence class. In Parts II-IV of our series of papers, we classify, for odd $p$, those endo-permutation modules of cyclic $p$-groups arising from $p$-blocks of quasisimple groups.
  In the present Part II, we reduce the desired classification for the quasisimple classical groups of Lie type $B$, $C$, and $D$ to the corresponding objective for the general linear and unitary groups; the classification is completed for the latter groups.</description>
