      <title>Coalition Structure and Polarization in Parliamentary Voting Networks: Evidence from the Italian Parliament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring legislative accountability in multi-party systems requires quantitative tools that reveal actual voting behavior beyond formal party affiliations. We present a network-based framework for analyzing parliamentary dynamics at multiple scales, capturing coalition structure, group coherence, and individual influence. Applied to over 4 million vote expressions from the Italian Parliament across three government formations (2018-2021), the methodology combines network modularity, voting distance metrics, and betweenness centrality to map the structure of collective decision-making. Using this framework, we show that system-level polarization, as captured by network modularity, varies systematically with coalition structure rather than coalition size. Technical governments display paradoxically lower global polarization despite broader formal support, reflecting structurally mixed voting patterns rather than unified blocs. On polarizing issues such as immigration, network polarization depends strongly on the fragmentation or cohesion of the opposition, even when the governing coalition votes cohesively. Betweenness analysis reveals that mediator roles are highly concentrated, with only about 2% of parliamentarians acting as structural bridges between communities. Community detection further uncovers implicit coalitions that are not apparent from declared alliances. The framework relies exclusively on public roll-call data, enabling reproducible analysis and direct applicability to any legislature with transparent voting records. By linking individual voting behavior to emergent system-level structure, the methodology provides quantitative infrastructure for comparative analysis of legislative voting networks and coalition monitoring, enabling systematic assessment of legislative behaviour.</description>

      <title>The impact of heterogeneity on the co-evolution of cooperation and epidemic spreading in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of herd immunity depend crucially on the interaction between collective social behavior and disease transmission, but the role of heterogeneity in this context frequently remains unclear. Here, we dissect this co-evolutionary feedback by coupling a public goods game with an epidemic model on complex networks, including multiplex and real-world networks. Our results reveals a dichotomy in how heterogeneity shapes outcomes. We demonstrate that structural heterogeneity in social networks acts as a powerful catalyst for cooperation and disease suppression. This emergent effect is driven by highly connected hubs who, facing amplified personal risk, adopt protective strategies out of self-interest. In contrast, heterogeneity in individual infection costs proves detrimental, undermining cooperation and amplifying the epidemic. This creates a ``weakest link'' problem, where individuals with low perceived risk act as persistent free-riders and disease reservoirs, degrading the collective response. Our findings establish that heterogeneity is a double-edged sword: its impact is determined by whether it creates an asymmetry of influence (leverage points) or an asymmetry of motivation (weakest links), recommending disease intervention policies that facilitate cooperative transition in hubs (strengthening the leverage point) and homogenize incentives to weakest links.</description>

      <title>Geometric Organization and Inference of Shortest Path Nodes in Soft Random Geometric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shortest path problem is related to many dynamic processes on networks, ranging from routing in communication networks to signaling in molecular interaction networks. When the network is fully known, the shortest path problem can be solved precisely and in polynomial time. If, however, the network of interest is only partially observable, the shortest path problem is no longer straightforward. Inspired by the shortest path problem in partially observable networks, we investigate the geometric properties of shortest paths in {\it Euclidean} Soft Random Geometric Graphs (SRGGs). We find that shortest paths are aligned along geodesic curves connecting shortest path endpoints. The strength of the shortest path alignment, as quantified by the average distance to geodesic from shortest path nodes and the average path stretch, is higher for larger SRGGs with short-range connections. In addition, we find that the strength of the shortest path alignment is non-monotonic with respect to the average degree of the SRGG. Based on these observations, we establish the conditions under which the alignment of shortest paths may be sufficiently strong to allow the identification of shortest path nodes based on their proximity to geodesic curves. We show that in partially observable networks with uncertain node positions, our geometric approach can outperform network-based shortest-path algorithms. In practical settings, our findings may have applications to navigation, wireless routing, and flow characterization in infrastructure networks.</description>

      <title>Opinion dynamics under electoral shocks in competitive campaigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a computational framework for modeling opinion dynamics in electoral competitions that combines two realistic features: voter memory and exogenous shocks. The population is represented by a fully-connected network of agents, each holding a binary opinion that reflects support for one of two candidates. First, inspired by the classical voter model, we introduce a memory-dependent opinion update: each agent's probability of adopting a neighbor's stance depends on how many times they agreed with that neighbor in the agent's past $m$ states, promoting inertia and resistance to change. Second, we define an electoral shock as an abrupt external influence acting uniformly over all agents during a finite interval $[t_0, t_0+\Delta t]$, favoring one candidate by switching opinions with probability $p_s$, representing the impact of extraordinary events such as political scandals, impactful speeches, or sudden news. We explore how the strength and duration of the shock, in conjunction with memory length, influence the transient and stationary properties of the model, as well as the candidates' advantage. Our findings reveal a rich dynamical behavior: memory slows down convergence and enhances system resilience, whereas shocks of sufficient intensity and duration can abruptly realign collective preferences, particularly when occurring close to the election date. Conversely, for long memory lengths or large election horizons, shock effects are dampened or delayed, depending on their timing. These results offer insights into why some sudden political events reshape electoral outcomes while others fade under strong individual inertia. Finally, a qualitative comparison with real electoral shocks reported in opinion polls illustrates how the model captures the competition between voter inertia and abrupt external events observed in actual elections.</description>

      <title>Community Detection with the Map Equation and Infomap: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world networks have a complex topology comprising many elements often structured into communities. Revealing these communities helps researchers uncover the organizational and functional structure of the system that the network represents. However, detecting community structures in complex networks requires selecting a community detection method among a multitude of alternatives with different network representations, community interpretations, and underlying mechanisms. This tutorial focuses on a popular community detection method called the map equation and its search algorithm Infomap. The map equation framework for community detection describes communities by analyzing dynamic processes on the network. Thanks to its flexibility, the map equation provides extensions that can incorporate various assumptions about network structure and dynamics. To help decide if the map equation is a suitable community detection method for a given complex system and problem at hand - and which variant to choose - we review the map equation's theoretical framework and guide users in applying the map equation to various research problems.</description>

      <title>Modeling individual attention dynamics on online social media</title>

Abstract: In the attention economy, understanding how individuals manage limited attention is critical. We introduce a simple model describing the decay of a user's engagement when facing multiple inputs. We analytically show that individual attention decay is determined by the overall duration of interactions, not their number or user activity. Our model is validated using data from Reddit's Change My View subreddit, where the user's attention dynamics is explicitly traceable. Despite its simplicity, our model offers a crucial microscopic perspective complementing macroscopic studies.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation of a longitudinal population-scale social network: Decreasing structural social cohesion in the Netherlands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Population-level dynamics of social cohesion and its underlying mechanisms remain difficult to study. In this paper, we propose a network approach to measure the evolution of social cohesion at the population scale and identify mechanisms driving the change. We use twelve annual snapshots (2010-2021) of a population-scale social network from the Netherlands linking all residents through family, household, work, school, and neighbor relations. Results show that over this period, social cohesion, quantified as average closure in the network, declines by more than 15%. We demonstrate that the decline is not due to changes in demographic composition, but to rewiring in individual ego networks. Statistical models confirm a decreasing overlap of social contexts and greater geographical mobility as drivers. Residential relocation, however, temporarily increases closure, suggesting that local cohesion-seeking behavior can yield global network fragmentation, with implications for policies related to housing, urban planning, and social integration.</description>

      <title>CoolPath Tool: A Thermal Comfort Path Planning Tool for Urban Mobility</title>

Abstract: Extreme heat poses a growing challenge for active transportation in cities where conventional weather reporting (e.g. limited air temperature measurement for the whole city) fails to capture the large microclimate variations that pedestrians and cyclists experience. We present a novel walking and biking route planning tool (''CoolPath Tool'') that selects paths based on thermal comfort using the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) rather than just distance or travel time. This system combines high-resolution thermal modeling with real-time route mapping. We generate city-scale UTCI maps using GPU version of Solar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry (SOLWEIG) model, to account for urban features (buildings, trees,) and weather conditions. The urban features are pre-mapped using satellite data products and the routes are the roadways. For any given origin and destination, our tool calculates the average UTCI along each possible route and recommends the ''coolest'' route, i.e. the path with the lowest heat stress (often the most shaded or otherwise thermally comfortable), while still being reasonably direct. We demonstrate this in a case study for Austin, Texas. The approach identifies routes that significantly reduce pedestrians' heat exposure (often recommending routes with a much larger proportion of shade). Such thermally-informed route planning has important public well-being, and economic implications: by helping people avoid dangerous heat hotspots and sun-exposed areas, it can reduce the risk of heat-related illness and make walking or biking a safer choice even on hot days. This tool is part of the Austin Digital Twin efforts developed as part the UT-City CoLab needs. The work while demonstrated for Austin, TX is scalable, and transferrable to other cities globally.</description>

      <title>Geometric Criticality in Scale-Invariant Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimension in physical systems determines universal properties at criticality. Yet, the impact of structural perturbations on dimensionality remains largely unexplored. Here, we characterize the attraction basins of structural fixed points in scale-invariant networks from a renormalization group perspective, demonstrating that basin stability connects to a structural phase transition. This topology-dependent effect, which we term geometric criticality, triggers a geometric breakdown hitherto unknown, which induces non-trivial fractal dimensions and unveils hidden LRG flows toward unstable structural fixed points. Our systematic study of how networks and lattices respond to disorder paves the way for future analysis of non-ergodic behavior induced by quenched disorder.</description>
