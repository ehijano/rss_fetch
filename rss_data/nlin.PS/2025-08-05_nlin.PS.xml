      <title>Using Dynamical Systems Theory to Quantify Complexity in Asymptotic Lenia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous cellular automata (CCAs) have evolved from discrete lookup tables to continuous partial differential equation (PDE) formulations in the search for novel forms of complexity. Despite innovations in qualitative behavior, analytical methods have lagged behind, reinforcing the notion that emergent complexity defies simple explanation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the PDE formulation of Asymptotic Lenia enables rigorous analysis using dynamical systems theory. We apply the concepts of symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimensions to characterize complex behaviors mathematically. Our contributions include: (1) a mathematical explanation for the four distinct solution classes (solitons, rotators, periodic and chaotic patterns), (2) conditions for the existence of a global attractor with fractal dimension $&gt;4$, (3) identification of Kaplan-Yorke dimension as an effective complexity measure for CCAs, and (4) an efficient open-source implementation for calculating Lyapunov exponents and the covariant Lyapunov vectors for CCAs. We conclude by identifying the minimal set of properties that enable complex behavior in a broader class of CCAs. This framework provides a foundation for understanding and measuring complexity in artificial life systems.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Focus Issue: Topics in Nonlinear Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear science has evolved significantly over the 35 years since the launch of the journal Chaos. This Focus Issue, dedicated to the 80th Birthday of its founding editor-in-chief, David K. Campbell, brings together a selection of contributions on influential topics, many of which were advanced by Campbell's own research program and leadership role. The topics include new phenomena and method development in the realms of network dynamics, machine learning, quantum and material systems, chaos and fractals, localized states, and living systems, with a good balance of literature review, original contributions, and perspectives for future research.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Model B: The role of mobilities and nonreciprocal interfacial forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a non-reciprocal version of Model B, as the continuum theory for non-reciprocal particle mixtures. In contrast to non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard models, it is important in this context to consider the dependence of mobility coefficients on the local concentrations. We show that a homogeneous state that is linearly stable for one form of the mobility can be unstable for a different form of mobility, an effect that would be impossible in equilibrium and implies a crucial role for mobilities in non-reciprocal mixtures. For unstable homogeneous states we study the spinodal dynamics governing the onset of phase separation. We find, again in contrast to non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard models, that exceptional point transitions between static and oscillatory instabilities are generically avoided by first order transitions where the spinodal lengthscale changes discontinuously. At these transitions we find intricate spinodal dynamics with two competing lengthscales, one governing a static instability and the other an oscillatory instability, i.e. one that generates travelling waves. We demonstrate that, depending on interaction strengths, more complex transitions can occur in the spinodal dynamics, including coexistence of three lengthscales and first order transition lines, terminated by critical points, between distinct static instabilities. Finally, we explore the effects of additional non-reciprocity in the interfacial chemical potentials, which would generically be expected when obtaining Model B by coarse graining from a non-reciprocal particle model. We show that interfacial non-reciprocity can increase the region in the spinodal phase diagram where oscillatory instabilities occur, but only up to a certain boundary that we establish analytically and demonstrate numerically.</description>

      <title>Phase domain walls in coherently driven Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09553v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider coherent states of weakly interacting bosons under the conditions of external resonant excitation, with a focus on a two-dimensional polariton fluid driven by a plane electromagnetic wave near the ground state. The coherent driving breaks the U(1) symmetry explicitly, which prevents the occurrence of quantum vortices in a uniform scalar condensate. Surprisingly, a spinor (two-component) system of the same kind admits topological excitations, such as domain walls of relative phase or confined half-vortex molecules, typical of a freely evolving spinor Bose system. Opposite-phase domains arise from the spontaneous breakdown of the spin symmetry $(\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Domain walls form with time even when the initial state of the system is uniform or completely disordered; they fall into different topological types distinguished by the total phase variation in the transverse direction.</description>
