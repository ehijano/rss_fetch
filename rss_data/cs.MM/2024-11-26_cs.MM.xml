      <title>Gotta Hear Them All: Sound Source Aware Vision to Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-to-audio (V2A) synthesis has broad applications in multimedia. Recent advancements of V2A methods have made it possible to generate relevant audios from inputs of videos or still images. However, the immersiveness and expressiveness of the generation are limited. One possible problem is that existing methods solely rely on the global scene and overlook details of local sounding objects (i.e., sound sources). To address this issue, we propose a Sound Source-Aware V2A (SSV2A) generator. SSV2A is able to locally perceive multimodal sound sources from a scene with visual detection and cross-modality translation. It then contrastively learns a Cross-Modal Sound Source (CMSS) Manifold to semantically disambiguate each source. Finally, we attentively mix their CMSS semantics into a rich audio representation, from which a pretrained audio generator outputs the sound. To model the CMSS manifold, we curate a novel single-sound-source visual-audio dataset VGGS3 from VGGSound. We also design a Sound Source Matching Score to measure localized audio relevance. This is to our knowledge the first work to address V2A generation at the sound-source level. Extensive experiments show that SSV2A surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both generation fidelity and relevance. We further demonstrate SSV2A's ability to achieve intuitive V2A control by compositing vision, text, and audio conditions. Our SSV2A generation can be tried and heard at https://ssv2a.github.io/SSV2A-demo .</description>

      <title>MUFM: A Mamba-Enhanced Feedback Model for Micro Video Popularity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surge in micro-videos is transforming the concept of popularity. As researchers delve into vast multi-modal datasets, there is a growing interest in understanding the origins of this popularity and the forces driving its rapid expansion. Recent studies suggest that the virality of short videos is not only tied to their inherent multi-modal content but is also heavily influenced by the strength of platform recommendations driven by audience feedback. In this paper, we introduce a framework for capturing long-term dependencies in user feedback and dynamic event interactions, based on the Mamba Hawkes process. Our experiments on the large-scale open-source multi-modal dataset show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various metrics by 23.2%. We believe our model's capability to map the relationships within user feedback behavior sequences will not only contribute to the evolution of next-generation recommendation algorithms and platform applications but also enhance our understanding of micro video dissemination and its broader societal impact.</description>

      <title>Advanced Learning-Based Inter Prediction for Future Video Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fourth generation Audio Video coding Standard (AVS4), the Inter Prediction Filter (INTERPF) reduces discontinuities between prediction and adjacent reconstructed pixels in inter prediction. The paper proposes a low complexity learning-based inter prediction (LLIP) method to replace the traditional INTERPF. LLIP enhances the filtering process by leveraging a lightweight neural network model, where parameters can be exported for efficient inference. Specifically, we extract pixels and coordinates utilized by the traditional INTERPF to form the training dataset. Subsequently, we export the weights and biases of the trained neural network model and implement the inference process without any third-party dependency, enabling seamless integration into video codec without relying on Libtorch, thus achieving faster inference speed. Ultimately, we replace the traditional handcraft filtering parameters in INTERPF with the learned optimal filtering parameters. This practical solution makes the combination of deep learning encoding tools with traditional video encoding schemes more efficient. Experimental results show that our approach achieves 0.01%, 0.31%, and 0.25% coding gain for the Y, U, and V components under the random access (RA) configuration on average.</description>

      <title>A review on Machine Learning based User-Centric Multimedia Streaming Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multimedia content and streaming are a major means of information exchange in the modern era and there is an increasing demand for such services. This coupled with the advancement of future wireless networks B5G/6G and the proliferation of intelligent handheld mobile devices, has facilitated the availability of multimedia content to heterogeneous mobile users. Apart from the conventional video, the 360$^o$ videos have gained popularity with the emerging virtual reality applications. All formats of videos (conventional and 360$^o$) undergo processing, compression, and transmission across dynamic wireless channels with restricted bandwidth to facilitate the streaming services. This causes video impairments, leading to quality degradation and poses challenges in delivering good Quality-of-Experience (QoE) to the viewers. The QoE is a prominent subjective quality measure to assess multimedia services. This requires end-to-end QoE evaluation. Efficient multimedia streaming techniques can improve the service quality while dealing with dynamic network and end-user challenges. A paradigm shift in user-centric multimedia services is envisioned with a focus on Machine Learning (ML) based QoE modeling and streaming strategies. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of the overall and continuous, time varying QoE modeling for the purpose of QoE management in multimedia services. It also examines the recent research on intelligent and adaptive multimedia streaming strategies, with a special emphasis on ML based techniques for video (conventional and 360$^o$) streaming. This paper discusses the overall and continuous QoE modeling to optimize the end-user viewing experience, efficient video streaming with a focus on user-centric strategies, associated datasets for modeling and streaming, along with existing shortcoming and open challenges.</description>

      <title>Sonic: Shifting Focus to Global Audio Perception in Portrait Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of talking face generation mainly explores the intricacies of synchronizing facial movements and crafting visually appealing, temporally-coherent animations. However, due to the limited exploration of global audio perception, current approaches predominantly employ auxiliary visual and spatial knowledge to stabilize the movements, which often results in the deterioration of the naturalness and temporal inconsistencies.Considering the essence of audio-driven animation, the audio signal serves as the ideal and unique priors to adjust facial expressions and lip movements, without resorting to interference of any visual signals. Based on this motivation, we propose a novel paradigm, dubbed as Sonic, to {s}hift f{o}cus on the exploration of global audio per{c}ept{i}o{n}.To effectively leverage global audio knowledge, we disentangle it into intra- and inter-clip audio perception and collaborate with both aspects to enhance overall perception.For the intra-clip audio perception, 1). \textbf{Context-enhanced audio learning}, in which long-range intra-clip temporal audio knowledge is extracted to provide facial expression and lip motion priors implicitly expressed as the tone and speed of speech. 2). \textbf{Motion-decoupled controller}, in which the motion of the head and expression movement are disentangled and independently controlled by intra-audio clips. Most importantly, for inter-clip audio perception, as a bridge to connect the intra-clips to achieve the global perception, \textbf{Time-aware position shift fusion}, in which the global inter-clip audio information is considered and fused for long-audio inference via through consecutively time-aware shifted windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the novel audio-driven paradigm outperform existing SOTA methodologies in terms of video quality, temporally consistency, lip synchronization precision, and motion diversity.</description>

      <title>Hindi audio-video-Deepfake (HAV-DF): A Hindi language-based Audio-video Deepfake Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepfakes offer great potential for innovation and creativity, but they also pose significant risks to privacy, trust, and security. With a vast Hindi-speaking population, India is particularly vulnerable to deepfake-driven misinformation campaigns. Fake videos or speeches in Hindi can have an enormous impact on rural and semi-urban communities, where digital literacy tends to be lower and people are more inclined to trust video content. The development of effective frameworks and detection tools to combat deepfake misuse requires high-quality, diverse, and extensive datasets. The existing popular datasets like FF-DF (FaceForensics++), and DFDC (DeepFake Detection Challenge) are based on English language.. Hence, this paper aims to create a first novel Hindi deep fake dataset, named ``Hindi audio-video-Deepfake'' (HAV-DF). The dataset has been generated using the faceswap, lipsyn and voice cloning methods. This multi-step process allows us to create a rich, varied dataset that captures the nuances of Hindi speech and facial expressions, providing a robust foundation for training and evaluating deepfake detection models in a Hindi language context. It is unique of its kind as all of the previous datasets contain either deepfake videos or synthesized audio. This type of deepfake dataset can be used for training a detector for both deepfake video and audio datasets. Notably, the newly introduced HAV-DF dataset demonstrates lower detection accuracy's across existing detection methods like Headpose, Xception-c40, etc. Compared to other well-known datasets FF-DF, and DFDC. This trend suggests that the HAV-DF dataset presents deeper challenges to detect, possibly due to its focus on Hindi language content and diverse manipulation techniques. The HAV-DF dataset fills the gap in Hindi-specific deepfake datasets, aiding multilingual deepfake detection development.</description>

      <title>ENCLIP: Ensembling and Clustering-Based Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining for Fashion Multimodal Search with Limited Data and Low-Quality Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal search has revolutionized the fashion industry, providing a seamless and intuitive way for users to discover and explore fashion items. Based on their preferences, style, or specific attributes, users can search for products by combining text and image information. Text-to-image searches enable users to find visually similar items or describe products using natural language. This paper presents an innovative approach called ENCLIP, for enhancing the performance of the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, specifically in Multimodal Search targeted towards the domain of fashion intelligence. This method focuses on addressing the challenges posed by limited data availability and low-quality images. This paper proposes an algorithm that involves training and ensembling multiple instances of the CLIP model, and leveraging clustering techniques to group similar images together. The experimental findings presented in this study provide evidence of the effectiveness of the methodology. This approach unlocks the potential of CLIP in the domain of fashion intelligence, where data scarcity and image quality issues are prevalent. Overall, the ENCLIP method represents a valuable contribution to the field of fashion intelligence and provides a practical solution for optimizing the CLIP model in scenarios with limited data and low-quality images.</description>

      <title>Speech2AffectiveGestures: Synthesizing Co-Speech Gestures with Generative Adversarial Affective Expression Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.00262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generative adversarial network to synthesize 3D pose sequences of co-speech upper-body gestures with appropriate affective expressions. Our network consists of two components: a generator to synthesize gestures from a joint embedding space of features encoded from the input speech and the seed poses, and a discriminator to distinguish between the synthesized pose sequences and real 3D pose sequences. We leverage the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and the text transcript computed from the input speech in separate encoders in our generator to learn the desired sentiments and the associated affective cues. We design an affective encoder using multi-scale spatial-temporal graph convolutions to transform 3D pose sequences into latent, pose-based affective features. We use our affective encoder in both our generator, where it learns affective features from the seed poses to guide the gesture synthesis, and our discriminator, where it enforces the synthesized gestures to contain the appropriate affective expressions. We perform extensive evaluations on two benchmark datasets for gesture synthesis from the speech, the TED Gesture Dataset and the GENEA Challenge 2020 Dataset. Compared to the best baselines, we improve the mean absolute joint error by 10--33%, the mean acceleration difference by 8--58%, and the Fr\'echet Gesture Distance by 21--34%. We also conduct a user study and observe that compared to the best current baselines, around 15.28% of participants indicated our synthesized gestures appear more plausible, and around 16.32% of participants felt the gestures had more appropriate affective expressions aligned with the speech.</description>

      <title>DanceAnyWay: Synthesizing Beat-Guided 3D Dances with Randomized Temporal Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present DanceAnyWay, a generative learning method to synthesize beat-guided dances of 3D human characters synchronized with music. Our method learns to disentangle the dance movements at the beat frames from the dance movements at all the remaining frames by operating at two hierarchical levels. At the coarser "beat" level, it encodes the rhythm, pitch, and melody information of the input music via dedicated feature representations only at the beat frames. It leverages them to synthesize the beat poses of the target dances using a sequence-to-sequence learning framework. At the finer "repletion" level, our method encodes similar rhythm, pitch, and melody information from all the frames of the input music via dedicated feature representations. It generates the full dance sequences by combining the synthesized beat and repletion poses and enforcing plausibility through an adversarial learning framework. Our training paradigm also enforces fine-grained diversity in the synthesized dances through a randomized temporal contrastive loss, which ensures different segments of the dance sequences have different movements and avoids motion freezing or collapsing to repetitive movements. We evaluate the performance of our approach through extensive experiments on the benchmark AIST++ dataset and observe improvements of about 7%-12% in motion quality metrics and 1.5%-4% in motion diversity metrics over the current baselines, respectively. We also conducted a user study to evaluate the visual quality of our synthesized dances. We note that, on average, the samples generated by our method were about 9-48% more preferred by the participants and had a 4-27% better five-point Likert-scale score over the best available current baseline in terms of motion quality and synchronization.

      <title>Multimodal Fish Feeding Intensity Assessment in Aquaculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fish feeding intensity assessment (FFIA) aims to evaluate fish appetite changes during feeding, which is crucial in industrial aquaculture applications. Existing FFIA methods are limited by their robustness to noise, computational complexity, and the lack of public datasets for developing the models. To address these issues, we first introduce AV-FFIA, a new dataset containing 27,000 labeled audio and video clips that capture different levels of fish feeding intensity. Then, we introduce multi-modal approaches for FFIA by leveraging the models pre-trained on individual modalities and fused with data fusion methods. We perform benchmark studies of these methods on AV-FFIA, and demonstrate the advantages of the multi-modal approach over the single-modality based approach, especially in noisy environments. However, compared to the methods developed for individual modalities, the multimodal approaches may involve higher computational costs due to the need for independent encoders for each modality. To overcome this issue, we further present a novel unified mixed-modality based method for FFIA, termed as U-FFIA. U-FFIA is a single model capable of processing audio, visual, or audio-visual modalities, by leveraging modality dropout during training and knowledge distillation using the models pre-trained with data from single modality. We demonstrate that U-FFIA can achieve performance better than or on par with the state-of-the-art modality-specific FFIA models, with significantly lower computational overhead, enabling robust and efficient FFIA for improved aquaculture management.</description>

      <title>Structured Multi-Track Accompaniment Arrangement via Style Prior Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16334v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of music AI, arranging rich and structured multi-track accompaniments from a simple lead sheet presents significant challenges. Such challenges include maintaining track cohesion, ensuring long-term coherence, and optimizing computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel system that leverages prior modelling over disentangled style factors to address these challenges. Our method presents a two-stage process: initially, a piano arrangement is derived from the lead sheet by retrieving piano texture styles; subsequently, a multi-track orchestration is generated by infusing orchestral function styles into the piano arrangement. Our key design is the use of vector quantization and a unique multi-stream Transformer to model the long-term flow of the orchestration style, which enables flexible, controllable, and structured music generation. Experiments show that by factorizing the arrangement task into interpretable sub-stages, our approach enhances generative capacity while improving efficiency. Additionally, our system supports a variety of music genres and provides style control at different composition hierarchies. We further show that our system achieves superior coherence, structure, and overall arrangement quality compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>X-CrossNet: A complex spectral mapping approach to target speaker extraction with cross attention speaker embedding fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Target speaker extraction (TSE) is a technique for isolating a target speaker's voice from mixed speech using auxiliary features associated with the target speaker. It is another attempt at addressing the cocktail party problem and is generally considered to have more practical application prospects than traditional speech separation methods. Although academic research in this area has achieved high performance and evaluation scores on public datasets, most models exhibit significantly reduced performance in real-world noisy or reverberant conditions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel TSE model, X-CrossNet, which leverages CrossNet as its backbone. CrossNet is a speech separation network specifically optimized for challenging noisy and reverberant environments, achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as speaker separation under these conditions. Additionally, to enhance the network's ability to capture and utilize auxiliary features of the target speaker, we integrate a Cross-Attention mechanism into the global multi-head self-attention (GMHSA) module within each CrossNet block. This facilitates more effective integration of target speaker features with mixed speech features. Experimental results show that our method performs superior separation on the WSJ0-2mix and WHAMR! datasets, demonstrating strong robustness and stability.</description>
