      <title>Multipath Component Power Delay Profile Based Joint Range and Doppler Estimation for AFDM-ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems combine sensing and communication functionalities within a unified framework, enhancing spectral efficiency and reducing costs by utilizing shared hardware components. This paper investigates multipath component power delay profile (MPCPDP)-based joint range and Doppler estimation for Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM)-ISAC systems. The path resolvability of the equivalent channel in the AFDM system allows the recognition of Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) paths within a single pilot symbol in fast time-varying channels. We develop a joint estimation model that leverages multipath Doppler shifts and delays information under the AFDM waveform. Utilizing the MPCPDP, we propose a novel ranging method that exploits the range-dependent magnitude of the MPCPDP across its delay spread by constructing a Nakagami-m statistical fading model for MPC channel fading and correlating the distribution parameters with propagation distance in AFDM systems. This method eliminates the need for additional time synchronization or extra hardware. We also transform the nonlinear Doppler estimation problem into a bilinear estimation problem using a First-order Taylor expansion. Moreover, we introduce the Expectation Maximization algorithm to estimate the hyperparameters and leverage the Expectation Consistent algorithm to cope with high-dimensional integration challenges. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our MPCPDP-based joint range and Doppler estimation in ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Decode and Forward Relaying for SC-FDE Systems with a Multi-Antenna Relay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a cooperative relay network consisting of a single-antenna source, a multi-antenna relay, and a multi-antenna destination is considered. The relay operates in decode-and-forward (DF) mode under frequency-selective fading. To combat intersymbol interference (ISI), single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) with or without decision feedback is deployed at the relay and the destination. The equalization coefficients are obtained using minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion. Both equal and optimum power allocations for a constant total transmit power at the relay are considered. While, the optimum power allocation is a non-convex problem, the solution is obtained using strong duality.</description>

      <title>MobiVital: Self-supervised Time-series Quality Estimation for Contactless Respiration Monitoring Using UWB Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Respiration waveforms are increasingly recognized as important biomarkers, offering insights beyond simple respiration rates, such as detecting breathing irregularities for disease diagnosis or monitoring breath patterns to guide rehabilitation training. Previous works in wireless respiration monitoring have primarily focused on estimating respiration rate, where the breath waveforms are often generated as a by-product. As a result, issues such as waveform deformation and inversion have largely been overlooked, reducing the signal's utility for applications requiring breathing waveforms. To address this problem, we present a novel approach, MobiVital, that improves the quality of respiration waveforms obtained from ultra-wideband (UWB) radar data. MobiVital combines a self-supervised autoregressive model for breathing waveform extraction with a biology-informed algorithm to detect and correct waveform inversions. To encourage reproducible research efforts for developing wireless vital signal monitoring systems, we also release a 12-person, 24-hour UWB radar vital signal dataset, with time-synchronized ground truth obtained from wearable sensors. Our results show that the respiration waveforms produced by our system exhibit a 7-34% increase in fidelity to the ground truth compared to the baselines and can benefit downstream tasks such as respiration rate estimation.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based OTFS Channel Estimation and Symbol Detection with Plug and Play Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has recently attracted significant interest due to its potential for enabling reliable communication in high-mobility environments. One of the challenges for OTFS receivers is the fractional Doppler that occurs in practical systems, resulting in decreased channel sparsity, and then inaccurate channel estimation and high-complexity equalization. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised deep learning (DL)-based OTFS channel estimation and symbol detection scheme, capable of handling different channel conditions, even in the presence of fractional Doppler. In particular, we design a unified plug-and-play (PnP) framework, which can jointly exploit the flexibility of optimization-based methods and utilize the powerful data-driven capability of DL. A lightweight Unet is integrated into the framework as a powerful implicit channel prior for channel estimation, leading to better exploitation of the channel sparsity and the characteristic of the noise simultaneously. Furthermore, to mitigate the channel estimation errors, we realize the PnP framework with a fully connected (FC) network for symbol detection at different noise levels, thereby enhancing robustness. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Resource Allocation and Radar Receiver Selection in Integrated Communication-Radar Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a distributed multi-input multi-output and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) system, which enables simultaneous communication and sensing in different subcarrier sets. To obtain the best tradeoff between communication and sensing performance, we first derive Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) of targets in the detection area, and then maximize the transmission rate by jointly optimizing the power/subcarriers allocation and the selection of radar receivers under the constraints of detection performance and total transmit power. To tackle the non-convex mixed integer programming problem, we decompose the original problem into a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem and a convex quadratic integer problem and solve them iteratively. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, as well as the performance improvement brought by optimizing radar receivers selection.</description>

      <title>Flexible Intelligent Metasurface-Aided Wireless Communications: Architecture and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) implementations include metasurfaces with almost passive unit elements capable of reflecting their incident waves in controllable ways, enhancing wireless communications in a cost-effective manner. In this paper, we advance the concept of intelligent metasurfaces by introducing a flexible array geometry, termed flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM), which supports both element movement (EM) and passive beamforming (PBF). In particular, based on the single-input single-output (SISO) system setup, we first compare three modes of FIM, namely, EM-only, PBF-only, and EM-PBF, in terms of received signal power under different FIM and channel setups. The PBF-only mode, which only adjusts the reflect phase, is shown to be less effective than the EM-only mode in enhancing received signal strength. In a multi-element, multi-path scenario, the EM-only mode improves the received signal power by 125% compared to the PBF-only mode. The EM-PBF mode, which optimizes both element positions and phases, further enhances performance. Additionally, we investigate the channel estimation problem for FIM systems by designing a protocol that gathers EM and PBF measurements, enabling the formulation of a compressive sensing problem for joint cascaded and direct channel estimation. We then propose a sparse recovery algorithm called clustering mean-field variational sparse Bayesian learning, which enhances estimation performance while maintaining low complexity.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Optimization for Flexible Cylindrical Arrays-Enabled Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible-geometry arrays have garnered much attention in wireless communications, which dynamically adjust wireless channels to improve the system performance. In this paper, we propose a novel flexible-geometry array for a $360^\circ$ coverage, named flxible cylindrical array (FCLA), comprised of multiple flexible circular arrays (FCAs). The elements in each FCA can revolve around the circle track to change their horizontal positions, and the FCAs can move along the vertical axis to change the elements' heights. Considering that horizontal revolving can change the antenna orientation, we adopt both the omni-directional and the directional antenna patterns. Based on the regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding scheme, we formulate a particular compressive sensing (CS) problem incorporating joint precoding and antenna position optimization, and propose two effective methods, namely FCLA-J and FCLA-A, to solve it. Specifically, the first method involves jointly optimizing the element's revolving angle, height, and precoding coefficient within a single CS framework. The second method decouples the CS problem into two subproblems by utilizing an alternative sparse optimization approach for the revolving angle and height, thereby reducing time complexity. Simulation results reveal that, when utilizing directional radiation patterns, FCLA-J and FCLA-A achieve substantial performance improvements of 43.32\% and 25.42\%, respectively, compared to uniform cylindrical arrays (UCLAs) with RZF precoding.</description>

      <title>Beamforming for Movable and Rotatable Antenna Enabled Multi-User Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the development of wireless communication technology, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology has emerged as a key enabler, significantly enhancing the capacity of communication systems. However, traditional MIMO systems, which rely on fixed-position antennas (FPAs) with spacing limitations, cannot fully exploit the channel variations in the continuous spatial domain, thus limiting the system's spatial multiplexing performance and diversity. To address these limitations, movable antennas (MAs) have been introduced, offering a breakthrough in signal processing and spatial multiplexing by overcoming the constraints of FPA-based systems. Furthermore, this paper extends the functionality of MAs by introducing movable rotatable antennas (MRAs), which enhance the system's ability to optimize performance in the spatial domain by adding rotational degrees of freedom. By incorporating a dynamic precoding framework based on both antenna position and rotation angle optimization, and employing the zero-forcing (ZF) precoding method, this paper proposes an efficient optimization approach aimed at improving signal quality, mitigating interference, and solving the non-linear, constrained optimization problem using the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm. This approach effectively enhances the communication system's performance.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Learning for Grant-Free Activity Detection in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grant-free random access (GF-RA) is a promising access technique for massive machine-type communications (mMTC) in future wireless networks, particularly in the context of 5G and beyond (6G) systems. Within the context of GF-RA, this study investigates the efficiency of employing supervised machine learning techniques to tackle the challenges on the device activity detection (AD). GF-RA addresses scalability by employing non-orthogonal pilot sequences, which provides an efficient alternative comparing to conventional grant-based random access (GB-RA) technique that are constrained by the scarcity of orthogonal preamble resources. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight data-driven algorithmic framework specifically designed for activity detection in GF-RA for mMTC in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) networks. We propose two distinct framework deployment strategies, centralized and decentralized, both tailored to streamline the proposed approach implementation across network infrastructures. Moreover, we introduce optimized post-detection methodologies complemented by a clustering stage to enhance overall detection performances. Our 3GPP-compliant simulations have validated that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art model-based activity detection accuracy while significantly reducing complexity. Achieving 99% accuracy, it demonstrates real-world viability and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Exploration of Elevation Cues in HRTFs: An Explainable AI Perspective Across Multiple Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise elevation perception in binaural audio remains a challenge, despite extensive research on head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) and spectral cues. While prior studies have advanced our understanding of sound localization cues, the interplay between spectral features and elevation perception is still not fully understood. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of over 600 subjects from 11 diverse public HRTF datasets, employing a convolutional neural network (CNN) model combined with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to investigate elevation cues. In addition to testing various HRTF pre-processing methods, we focus on both within-dataset and inter-dataset generalization and explainability, assessing the model's robustness across different HRTF variations stemming from subjects and measurement setups. By leveraging class activation mapping (CAM) saliency maps, we identify key frequency bands that may contribute to elevation perception, providing deeper insights into the spectral features that drive elevation-specific classification. This study offers new perspectives on HRTF modeling and elevation perception by analyzing diverse datasets and pre-processing techniques, expanding our understanding of these cues across a wide range of conditions.</description>

      <title>Topological Dictionary Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce a novel dictionary learning algorithm for sparse representation of signals defined over combinatorial topological spaces, specifically, regular cell complexes. Leveraging Hodge theory, we embed topology into the dictionary structure via concatenated sub-dictionaries, each as a polynomial of Hodge Laplacians, yielding localized spectral topological filter frames. The learning problem is cast to jointly infer the underlying cell complex and optimize the dictionary coefficients and the sparse signal representation. We efficiently solve the problem via iterative alternating algorithms. Numerical results on both synthetic and real data show the effectiveness of the proposed procedure in jointly learning the sparse representations and the underlying relational structure of topological signals.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented Spectrum Sharing: Trading Edge Inference Power for Data Streaming Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of spectrum sharing between goal-oriented (GO) and legacy data-oriented (DO) systems. For the former, data quality and representation is no longer optimized based on classical communication key performance indicators, but rather configured on the fly to achieve the goal of communication with the least resource overhead. This paradigm can be followed to flexibly adapt wireless and in-network artificial intelligence operations across different nodes (e.g., access points, users, sensors or actuators) to data traffic, channel conditions, energy availability and distributed computing capabilities. In this paper, we argue and demonstrate that computing and learning/inference operation performance strongly affect lower layers, calling for a real cross-layer optimization that encompasses physical and computation resource orchestration, up to the application level. Focusing on a communication channel shared among a GO and a DO user, we define a goal-effective achievable rate region (GEARR), to assess the maximum data rate attainable by the latter, subject to goal achievement guarantees for the former. Finally, we propose a cross-layer dynamic resource orchestration able to reach the boundaries of the GEARR, under different goaleffectiveness and compute resource consumption constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air pollution remains one of the most pressing environmental challenges of the modern era, significantly impacting human health, ecosystems, and climate. While traditional air quality monitoring systems provide critical data, their high costs and limited spatial coverage hinder effective real-time pollutant identification. Recent advancements in micro-sensor technology have improved data collection but still lack efficient methods for source identification. This paper explores the innovative application of machine learning (ML) models to classify pollutants in real-time using only data from optical micro-sensors. We propose a novel classification framework capable of distinguishing between four pollutant scenarios: Background Pollution, Ash, Sand, and Candle. Three Machine Learning (ML) approaches - XGBoost, Long Short-Term Memory networks, and Hidden Markov Chains - are evaluated for their effectiveness in sequence modeling and pollutant identification. Our results demonstrate the potential of leveraging micro-sensors and ML techniques to enhance air quality monitoring, offering actionable insights for urban planning and environmental protection.</description>

      <title>TAU: Modeling Temporal Consistency Through Temporal Attentive U-Net for PPG Peak Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors have been widely used in consumer wearable devices to monitor heart rates (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV). Despite the prevalence, PPG signals can be contaminated by motion artifacts induced from daily activities. Existing approaches mainly use the amplitude information to perform PPG peak detection. However, these approaches cannot accurately identify peaks, since motion artifacts may bring random and significant amplitude variations. To improve the performance of PPG peak detection, the time information can be used. Specifically, heart rates exhibit temporal consistency that consecutive heartbeat intervals in a normal person can have limited variations. To leverage the temporal consistency, we propose the Temporal Attentive U-Net, i.e., TAU, to accurately detect peaks from PPG signals. In TAU, we design a time module that encodes temporal consistency in temporal embeddings. We integrate the amplitude information with temporal embeddings using the attention mechanism to estimate peak labels. Our experimental results show that TAU outperforms eleven baselines on heart rate estimation by more than 22.4%. Our TAU model achieves the best performance across various Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels. Moreover, we achieve Pearson correlation coefficients higher than 0.9 (p &lt; 0.01) on estimating HRV features from low-noise-level PPG signals.</description>

Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RIS) have emerged as a transformative technology for enhancing wireless communication by intelligently manipulating the propagation environment. Its interconnected elements offer enhanced control over signal redirection, making it a promising solution for integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). This paper explores the potential of BD-RIS in improving cognitive radio enabled multilayer non-terrestrial networks. We formulate a joint optimization problem that maximizes the achievable spectral efficiency by optimizing BD-RIS phase shifts and secondary transmitter power allocation while controlling the interference temperature from the secondary network to the primary network. To solve this problem efficiently, we decouple the original problem and propose a novel solution based on an alternating optimization approach. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of BD-RIS in cognitive radio enabled multilayer NTNs.</description>

      <title>In Shift and In Variance: Assessing the Robustness of HAR Deep Learning Models against Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors can revolutionize healthcare by enabling continual health monitoring, disease prediction, and routine recognition. Despite the high accuracy of Deep Learning (DL) HAR models, their robustness to real-world variabilities remains untested, as they have primarily been trained and tested on limited lab-confined data. In this study, we isolate subject, device, position, and orientation variability to determine their effect on DL HAR models and assess the robustness of these models in real-world conditions. We evaluated the DL HAR models using the HARVAR and REALDISP datasets, providing a comprehensive discussion on the impact of variability on data distribution shifts and changes in model performance. Our experiments measured shifts in data distribution using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and observed DL model performance drops due to variability. We concur that studied variabilities affect DL HAR models differently, and there is an inverse relationship between data distribution shifts and model performance. The compounding effect of variability was analyzed, and the implications of variabilities in real-world scenarios were highlighted. MMD proved an effective metric for calculating data distribution shifts and explained the drop in performance due to variabilities in HARVAR and REALDISP datasets. Combining our understanding of variability with evaluating its effects will facilitate the development of more robust DL HAR models and optimal training techniques. Allowing Future models to not only be assessed based on their maximum F1 score but also on their ability to generalize effectively</description>

      <title>Pushing DSP-Free Coherent Interconnect to the Last Inch by Optically Analog Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To support the boosting interconnect capacity of the AI-related data centers, novel techniques enabled high-speed and low-cost optics are continuously emerging. When the baud rate approaches 200 GBaud per lane, the bottle-neck of traditional intensity modulation direct detection (IM-DD) architectures becomes increasingly evident. The simplified coherent solutions are widely discussed and considered as one of the most promising candidates. In this paper, a novel coherent architecture based on self-homodyne coherent detection and optically analog signal processing (OASP) is demonstrated. Proved by experiment, the first DSP-free baud-rate sampled 64-GBaud QPSK/16-QAM receptions are achieved, with BERs of 1e-6 and 2e-2, respectively. Even with 1-km fiber link propagation, the BER for QPSK reception remains at 3.6e-6. When an ultra-simple 1-sps SISO filter is utilized, the performance degradation of the proposed scheme is less than 1 dB compared to legacy DSP-based coherent reception. The proposed results pave the way for the ultra-high-speed coherent optical interconnections, offering high power and cost efficiency.</description>

      <title>Optimizing RIS Impairments through Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates how semantic communication can effectively influence and potentially redefine the limitations imposed by physical layer settings. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) enable the intelligent configuration of the physical layer of communication systems. However, its practical implementation is hampered by several limitations. The Semantic Communication (SemCom) paradigm introduces additional degrees of freedom that can be exploited to improve the robustness of communication against physical layer impairments. In essence, SemCom ensures that the data representation remains robust even under adverse physical conditions by emphasizing the transmission of meaningful information in a manner that is less susceptible to degradation. Through the use of SemCom, potential RIS gains are demonstrated in terms of RIS area size and the phase shift precision of its active elements.</description>

      <title>Unauthorized Radio Sensing and Privacy Risks: A Sampling Error-Based Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unauthorized sensing activities pose an increasing threat to individual privacy, yet effective countermeasures remain underdeveloped. This paper presents a novel methodology to characterize and counter such unauthorized surveillance. We model pedestrian trajectories as a random process and leverage the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) to evaluate sensing performance, interpreting it as sampling error within this random process. Through simulation, we verify our method's accuracy in monitoring unauthorized sensing activities in urban environments and validate the effectiveness of our proposed mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Uncertainty and Calibration on Likelihood-Ratio Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a membership inference attack (MIA), an attacker exploits the overconfidence exhibited by typical machine learning models to determine whether a specific data point was used to train a target model. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the likelihood ratio attack (LiRA) within an information-theoretical framework that allows the investigation of the impact of the aleatoric uncertainty in the true data generation process, of the epistemic uncertainty caused by a limited training data set, and of the calibration level of the target model. We compare three different settings, in which the attacker receives decreasingly informative feedback from the target model: confidence vector (CV) disclosure, in which the output probability vector is released; true label confidence (TLC) disclosure, in which only the probability assigned to the true label is made available by the model; and decision set (DS) disclosure, in which an adaptive prediction set is produced as in conformal prediction. We derive bounds on the advantage of an MIA adversary with the aim of offering insights into the impact of uncertainty and calibration on the effectiveness of MIAs. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived analytical bounds predict well the effectiveness of MIAs.</description>

      <title>EmT: A Novel Transformer for Generalized Cross-subject EEG Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating prior knowledge of neurophysiology into neural network architecture enhances the performance of emotion decoding. While numerous techniques emphasize learning spatial and short-term temporal patterns, there has been limited emphasis on capturing the vital long-term contextual information associated with emotional cognitive processes. In order to address this discrepancy, we introduce a novel transformer model called emotion transformer (EmT). EmT is designed to excel in both generalized cross-subject EEG emotion classification and regression tasks. In EmT, EEG signals are transformed into a temporal graph format, creating a sequence of EEG feature graphs using a temporal graph construction module (TGC). A novel residual multi-view pyramid GCN module (RMPG) is then proposed to learn dynamic graph representations for each EEG feature graph within the series, and the learned representations of each graph are fused into one token. Furthermore, we design a temporal contextual transformer module (TCT) with two types of token mixers to learn the temporal contextual information. Finally, the task-specific output module (TSO) generates the desired outputs. Experiments on four publicly available datasets show that EmT achieves higher results than the baseline methods for both EEG emotion classification and regression tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/yi-ding-cs/EmT.</description>

      <title>Content-based Wake-up for Energy-efficient and Timely Top-k IoT Sensing Data Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy efficiency and information freshness are key requirements for sensor nodes serving Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications, where a sink node collects informative and fresh data before a deadline, e.g., to control an external actuator. Content-based wake-up (CoWu) activates a subset of nodes that hold data relevant for the sink's goal, thereby offering an energy-efficient way to attain objectives related to information freshness. This paper focuses on a scenario where the sink collects fresh information on top-k values, defined as data from the nodes observing the k highest readings at the deadline. We introduce a new metric called top-k Query Age of Information (k-QAoI), which allows us to characterize the performance of CoWu by considering the characteristics of the physical process. Further, we show how to select the CoWu parameters, such as its timing and threshold, to attain both information freshness and energy efficiency. The numerical results reveal the effectiveness of the CoWu approach, which is able to collect top-k data with higher energy efficiency while reducing k-QAoI when compared to round-robin scheduling, especially when the number of nodes is large and the required size of k is small.</description>

      <title>Local Flaw Detection with Adaptive Pyramid Image Fusion Across Spatial Sampling Resolution for SWRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inspection of local flaws (LFs) in Steel Wire Ropes (SWRs) is crucial for ensuring safety and reliability in various industries. Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) imaging is commonly used for non-destructive testing, but its effectiveness is often hindered by the combined effects of inspection speed and sampling rate. To address this issue, the impacts of inspection speed and sampling rate on image quality are studied, as variations in these factors can cause stripe noise, axial compression of defect features, and increased interference, complicating accurate detection. We define the relationship between inspection speed and sampling rate as spatial sampling resolution (SSR) and propose an adaptive SSR target-feature-oriented (AS-TFO) method. This method incorporates adaptive adjustment and pyramid image fusion techniques to enhance defect detection under different SSR scenarios. Experimental results show that under high SSR scenarios, the method achieves a precision of 94.73% and a recall of 96.77%. It remains robust under low SSR scenarios with a precision of 94.30% and recall of 97.32%. The overall results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. This improvement in detection accuracy and robustness is particularly valuable for handling complex inspection conditions, where inspection speed and sampling rate can vary significantly, making detection more robust and reliable in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Generative Multi-Agent Q-Learning for Policy Optimization: Decentralized Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Q-learning is a widely used reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for optimizing wireless networks, but faces challenges with large state-spaces. Recently proposed multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ) algorithm addresses these challenges by employing multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple synthetically generated, distinct but structurally related environments, so-called digital cousins. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ (M-MEMQ) for cooperative decentralized wireless networks with multiple networked transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs). TXs do not have access to global information (joint state and actions). The new concept of coordinated and uncoordinated states is introduced. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs and update local Q-functions. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state and update the joint Q-functions. The cost of information-sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. Several theoretical guarantees, including deterministic and probabilistic convergence, bounds on estimation error variance, and the probability of misdetecting the joint states, are given. Numerical simulations show that M-MEMQ outperforms several decentralized and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms by achieving 55% lower average policy error (APE), 35% faster convergence, 50% reduced runtime complexity, and 45% less sample complexity. Furthermore, M-MEMQ achieves comparable APE with significantly lower complexity than centralized methods. Simulations validate the theoretical analyses.</description>
