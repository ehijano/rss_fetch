      <title>Field-independent Kronecker-plethysm isomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an explicit field-independent SL$_2$-equivariant isomorphism between an invariant space of tensors and a plethysm space. The existence of such an isomorphism was only known in characteristic 0, and only indirectly via character theory. Our isomorphism naturally extends the web of field-independent isomorphisms given by Hermite reciprocity, Hodge duality, and the Wronskian isomorphism. This is a characteristic free generalization of a classical situation in characteristic zero: certain rectangular Kronecker coefficients coincide with certain plethysm coefficients, and their non-negativiy proves the unimodality of the $q$-binomial coefficient.
  We also give a short combinatorial field-independent proof that the Hermite reciprocity map over the standard basis is a triangular matrix with 1s on the main diagonal.</description>

      <title>Resolving subcategories for gentle algebras II: Resolving subcategories for gentle trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the second part of a series that intends to study the resolving subcategories for gentle algebras over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{K}$. As in the first part, we continue to focus on gentle quivers $(Q,R)$, where $Q$ is a directed tree, known as gentle trees. In our previous work, via a modified surface model for gentle algebras with finite global dimension, we studied the join-irreducible elements of the lattice of resolving subcategories of $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R \rangle - \text{mod}$, which happen to be those generated by a non-projective indecomposable object. In this paper, we notice that this lattice is not semidistributive in general and, accordingly, introduce a so-called upper join-decomposition, replacing the canonical one. Together with the techniques we develop in our geometric model, it allows us to describe the resolving subcategories of any gentle tree. These same techniques let us explicitly construct the resolving subcategory generated by any collection of indecomposable $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R\rangle$-modules.</description>

      <title>Induced structures of averaging commutative and cocommutative infinitesimal bialgebras via a new splitting of perm algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that an averaging operator on a commutative associative algebra gives rise to a perm algebra. This paper lifts this process to the level of bialgebras. For this purpose, we first give an infinitesimal bialgebra structure for averaging commutative associative algebras and characterize it by double constructions of averaging Frobenius commutative algebras. To find the bialgebra counterpart of perm algebras that is induced by such averaging bialgebras, we need a new two-part splitting of the multiplication in a perm algebra, which differs from the usual splitting of the perm algebra (into the pre-perm algebra) by the characterized representation. This gives rise to the notion of an averaging-pre-perm algebra, or simply an apre-perm algebra. Furthermore, the notion of special apre-perm algebras which are apre-perm algebras with the second multiplications being commutative is introduced as the underlying algebra structure of perm algebras with nondegenerate symmetric left-invariant bilinear forms. The latter are also the induced structures of symmetric Frobenius commutative algebras with averaging operators. Consequently, a double construction of averaging Frobenius commutative algebra gives rise to a Manin triple of special apre-perm algebras. In terms of bialgebra structures, this means that an averaging commutative and cocommutative infinitesimal bialgebra gives rise to a special apre-perm bialgebra.</description>

      <title>Hopf formulae for cocommutative Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adjunction between coalgebras and Hopf algebras, first described by Takeuchi, allows one to prove that the semi-abelian category of cocommutative Hopf algebras has enough $\mathcal E$-projective objects with respect to the class $\mathcal{E}$ of cleft extensions. One then proves that, for any cocommutative Hopf algebra, there exists a weak $\mathcal{E}$-universal normal (=central) extension. This fact allows one to apply the methods of categorical Galois theory to classify normal $\mathcal{E}$-extensions and to provide an explicit description of the fundamental group of a cocommutative Hopf algebra in terms of a generalized Hopf formula. Moreover, with any cleft extension, we associate a 5-term exact sequence in homology that can be seen as a Hopf-theoretic analogue of the classical Stallings-Stammbach exact sequence in group theory.</description>

      <title>On the semi-infinite cohomology of graded-unitary vertex algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the first author with A. Ardehali, M. Lemos, and L. Rastelli introduced the notion of graded unitarity for vertex algebras. This generalization of unitarity is motivated by the SCFT/VOA correspondence and introduces a novel Hilbert space structure on the state space of a large class of vertex algebras that are not unitary in the conventional sense. In this paper, we study the relative semi-infinite cohomology of graded-unitary vertex algebras that admit a chiral quantum moment map for an affine current algebra at twice the critical level. We show that the relative semi-infinite chain complex for such a graded-unitary vertex algebra has a structure analogous to that of differential forms on a compact K\"ahler manifold, generalizing a strong form of the classic construction of Banks--Peskin and Frenkel--Garland--Zuckerman. We deduce that the relative semi-infinite cohomology is itself graded-unitary, which establishes graded unitarity for a large class of vertex operator algebras arising from three- and four-dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theories. We further establish an outer USp$(2)$ action on the semi-infinite cohomology (which does not respect cohomological grading), analogous to the Lefschetz $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ in K\"ahler geometry. We also show that the semi-infinite chain complex is quasi-isomorphic as a differential graded vertex algebra to its cohomology, in analogy to the formality result of Deligne--Griffiths--Morgan--Sullivan for the de Rham cohomology of compact K\"ahler manifolds. We conclude by observing consequences of these results to the associated Poisson vertex algebras and related finite-type derived Poisson reductions.</description>

Abstract: Let G be a connected reductive group defined over a non-archimedean local field of characteristic 0. We assume G is quasi-split, adjoint and absolutly simple. Let g be the Lie algebra of G. We consider the space of the invariant distributions on g(F), which are stable and supported by the set of nilpotent elements of g(F). Magdy Assem has stated several conjectures which describe this space. We prove some of these conjectures, assuming that the residual characteristic of F is ''very large'' relatively to G.</description>

      <title>Splitting the difference: Computations of the Reynolds operator in classical invariant theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $G$ is a linearly reductive group acting rationally on a polynomial ring $S$, then the inclusion $S^{G} \hookrightarrow S$ possesses a unique $G$-equivariant splitting, called the Reynolds operator. We describe algorithms for computing the Reynolds operator for the classical actions as in Weyl's book. The groups are the general linear group, the special linear group, the orthogonal group, and the symplectic group, with their classical representations: direct sums of copies of the standard representation and copies of the dual representation.</description>

      <title>On The Relative Cohomology For Algebraic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an algebraic group over a field $k$, and $M$ and $N$ be $G$-modules. In 1961, Hochschild showed how one can define the cohomology groups $\text{Ext}_{G}^{i}(M,N)$. Kimura, in 1965, showed that one can generalize this to get relative cohomology for algebraic groups. The original cohomology groups play an important role in understanding the representation theory of $G$, but the role of relative cohomology is still not well understood.
  In this paper the author expands upon the work of Kimura to prove foundational results about the relative cohomology. The author starts by giving the definitions of relative exact sequences and relative injective modules and proves a variety of basic properties for each that will be essential to define relative cohomology and obtain a relative Grothendieck spectral sequence. In particular, the induction functor will play an important role when studying the relative injective modules. Once the necessary ground work is laid, the definition of relative cohomology is given. Finally, it is stated when there is a relative Grothendieck spectral sequence, and many consequences and examples are provided.</description>
