      <title>Central series' and ($n$)-isoclinism of skew left braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to advance the knowledge on the theory of skew left braces. We introduce a sub class of skew left braces, which we denote by $\mathcal{I}_n$, $n \ge 1$, such that elements of the annihilator and lower central series' interact 'nicely' with respect to commutation. That allows us to define a concept of $n$-isoclinism of skew left braces in $\mathcal{I}_n$, by using a concept of brace commutator words, which we have introduced. We prove various results on $1$-isoclinism (isoclinism) of skew left braces analogous to results in group theory. For any two symmetric $n$-isoclinic skew left braces $A$ and $B$, we prove that, there exist skew left braces $C$ and $R$ such that both $A$ and $B$ are $n$-isoclinic to both $C$ and $R$ and (i) $A$ and $B$ are quotient skew left braces of $C$; (ii) $A$ and $B$ are sub skew left braces of $R$. Connections between a skew left brace and the group which occurs as a natural semi-direct product of additive and multiplicative groups of the skew left brace are investigated, and it is proved that $n$-isoclinism is preserved from braces to groups. We also show that various nilpotency concepts on skew left braces are invariant under $n$-isoclinism.</description>

      <title>Exact Borel subalgebras, idempotent quotients and idempotent subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies the compatibility of Koenig's notion of an exact Borel subalgebra of a quasi-hereditary or, more generally, standardly stratified algebra with taking idempotent subalgebras or quotients. As an application, we provide bounds for the multiplicities of indecomposable projectives in the principal blocks of BGG category $\mathcal{O}$ having basic regular exact Borel subalgebras.</description>

      <title>A Module-theoretic Introduction to Abstract Elementary Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first-order model theory of modules has been studied for decades. More recently, the model theoretic study of nonelementary classes of modules--especially Abstract Elementary Classes of modules--has produced interesting results. This survey aims to discuss these recent results and give an introduction to the framework of Abstract Elementary Classes for module theorists.</description>

      <title>Further properties and representations of the W-weighted m-weak group inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explore more properties and representations of the W-weighted m-weak group (in short, W-m-WG) inverse. We first explore an interesting relation between two projectors with respect to the W-m-WG inverse. Then, the W-m-WG inverse is represented by various generalized inverses including W-weighted Drazin inverse, W-weighted weak group inverse, W-weighted core inverse, etc. We also give three concise explicit expressions for the W-m-WG inverse. Moreover, a canonical form of the W-m-WG inverse is presented in terms of the singular value decomposition. Finally, several numerical examples are designed to illustrate some results given in the paper.</description>

      <title>On the Nowicki Conjecture for the free Lie algebra of rank 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let K[X_n]=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n] be the polynomial algebra in n variables over a field K of characteristic zero. A locally nilpotent linear derivation \delta of K[X_n] is called Weitzenb\"ock due to his well known result from 1932 stating that the algebra \text{\rm ker}(\delta)=K[X_n]^{\delta} of constants of $\delta$ is finitely generated. The explicit form of a generating set of $K[X_n,Y_n]^{\delta}$ was conjectured by Nowicki in 1994 in the case \delta was such that \delta(y_{i})=x_{i}$, $\delta(x_i)=0, i=1,\ldots,n. Nowicki's conjecture turned out to be true and, recently, has been applied to several relatively free associative algebras. In this paper, we consider the free Lie algebra \mathcal{L}(x,y) of rank 2 generated by x and y over K and we assume the Weitzenb\"ock derivation \delta sending y to x, and x to zero. We introduce the idea of pseudodeterminants and we present a characterization of Hall monomials that are constants showing they are not so far from being pseudodeterminants. We also give a complete list of generators of the constants of degree less than 7 which are, of course, pseudodeterminants.</description>
