      <title>Chaos and integrability in triangular billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize quantum dynamics in triangular billiards in terms of five properties: (1) the level spacing ratio (LSR), (2) spectral complexity (SC), (3) Lanczos coefficient variance, (4) energy eigenstate localisation in the Krylov basis, and (5) dynamical growth of spread complexity. The billiards we study are classified as integrable, pseudointegrable or non-integrable, depending on their internal angles which determine properties of classical trajectories and associated quantum spectral statistics. A consistent picture emerges when transitioning from integrable to non-integrable triangles: (1) LSRs increase; (2) spectral complexity growth slows down; (3) Lanczos coefficient variances decrease; (4) energy eigenstates delocalize in the Krylov basis; and (5) spread complexity increases, displaying a peak prior to a plateau instead of recurrences. Pseudo-integrable triangles deviate by a small amount in these charactertistics from non-integrable ones, which in turn approximate models from the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). Isosceles pseudointegrable and non-integrable triangles have independent sectors that are symmetric and antisymmetric under a reflection symmetry. These sectors separately reproduce characteristics of the GOE, even though the combined system approximates characteristics expected from integrable theories with Poisson distributed spectra.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos in Liouville CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast scrambling is a distinctive feature of quantum gravity, which by means of holography is closely tied to the behaviour of large$-c$ conformal field theories. We study this phenomenon in the context of semiclassical Liouville theory, providing both insights into the mechanism of scrambling in CFTs and into the structure of Liouville theory, finding that it exhibits a maximal Lyapunov exponent despite not featuring the identity in its spectrum. However, as we show, the states contributing to the relevant correlation function can be thought of as dressed scramblons. At a technical level we we first use the path integral picture in order to derive the Euclidean four-point function in an explicit compact form. Next, we demonstrate its equivalence to a conformal block expansion, revealing an explicit but non-local map between path integral saddles and conformal blocks. By analytically continuing both expressions to Lorentzian times, we obtain two equivalent formulations of the OTOC, which we use to study the onset of chaos in Liouville theory. We take advantage of the compact form in order to extract a Lyapunov exponent and a scrambling time. From the conformal block expansion formulation of the OTOC we learn that scrambling shifts the dominance of conformal blocks from heavy primaries at early times to the lightest primary at late times. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of holography.</description>

      <title>Harnessing an elastic flow instability to improve the kinetic performance of chromatographic columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of research and development, the optimal efficiency of slurry-packed HPLC columns is still hindered by inherent long-range flow heterogeneity from the wall to the central bulk region of these columns. Here, we show an example of how this issue can be addressed through the straightforward addition of a semidilute amount (500~ppm) of a large, flexible, synthetic polymer (18~MDa partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide, HPAM) to the mobile phase (1\% NaCl aqueous solution) during operation of a 4.6 mm $\times$ 300 mm column packed with 10~$\mu$m BEH$^{\mathrm{TM}}$ 125~\AA \ Particles. Addition of the polymer imparts elasticity to the mobile phase, causing the flow in the interparticle pore space to become unstable above a threshold flow rate. We verify the development of this elastic flow instability using pressure drop measurements of the friction factor versus Reynolds number. In prior work, we showed that this flow instability is characterized by large spatiotemporal fluctuations in the pore-scale flow velocities that may promote analyte dispersion across the column. Axial dispersion measurements of the quasi non-retained tracer thiourea confirm this possibility: they unequivocally reveal that operating above the onset of the instability improves column efficiency by significantly reducing peak asymmetry. These experiments thereby provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that elastic flow instabilities can be harnessed to mitigate the negative impact of trans-column flow heterogeneities on the efficiency of slurry-packed HPLC columns. While this approach has its own inherent limitations and constraints, our work lays the groundwork for future targeted development of polymers that can impart elasticity when dissolved in commonly used liquid chromatography mobile phases, and can thereby generate elastic flow instabilities to help improve the resolution of HPLC columns.</description>

      <title>Behavior of correlation functions in the dynamics of the Multiparticle Quantum Arnol'd Cat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-particle Arnol'd cat is a generalization of the Hamiltonian system, both classical and quantum, whose period evolution operator is the renown map that bears its name. It is obtained following the Joos-Zeh prescription for decoherence, by adding a number of scattering particles in the configuration space of the cat. Quantization follows swiftly, if the Hamiltonian approach, rather than the semiclassical, is adopted. I have studied this system in a series of previous works, focusing on the problem of quantum-classical correspondence. In this paper I test the dynamics of this system by two related yet different indicators: the time autocorrelation function of the canonical position and the out of time correlator of position and momentum.</description>

      <title>Memory principle of the Matlab code for Lyapunov Exponents of fractional order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper presents two representative classes of Impulsive Fractional Differential Equations defined with generalized Caputo\'s derivative, with fixed lower limit and changing lower limit, respectively. Memory principle is studied and numerical examples are considered. The problem of the memory principle of the Matlab code for Lyapunov exponents of fractional order systems [Danca &amp; Kuznetsov, 2018] is analyzed.</description>
