      <title>Wavelength calibration and spectral sensitivity correction of luminescence measurements for dosimetry applications: method comparison tested on the IR-RF of K-feldspar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic investigations provide important insights into the composition of luminescence emissions relevant to trapped-charge dating of sediments. Accurate wavelength calibration and a correction for the wavelength-dependent detection efficiency of the spectrometer system are crucial to ensure the correct spectrum interpretation and allow for its comparison with those obtained from other systems. However, to achieve an accurate detection efficiency correction, it is necessary to obtain the device-specific spectral response function (SRF). Here, we compare two SRF approximation methods by using either a calibration lamp of known irradiance or calculating the product of efficiency curves provided by the manufacturers of all known optical elements. We discuss the results using radiofluorescence (RF) measurements of two K-feldspar samples as an example. Feldspar infra-red (IR) RF spectra are known to be composed of several overlapping emissions, whose variation with sample mineralogy is still poorly understood and requires more extensive investigations. We find that both methods of sensitivity correction yield broadly similar results. However, the observed differences can alter a spectrum's interpretation. For example, we observe that after peak deconvolution the maximum signal wavelength of the IR-RF peak used for dating applications differs by ~3-13 nm between the two methods, depending on sample and diffraction grating. We recommend using calibration lamps to determine a device's SRF but highlight the need to consider issues such as higher-order signals in the choice of filters to establish the SRF's reliable wavelength range. Additionally, we find that a simple and inexpensive fluorescent white light yields an acceptable wavelength calibration comparable to that obtained from a specialized light source.</description>

      <title>Machine learning from limited data: Predicting biological dynamics under a time-varying external input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is known as a powerful machine learning approach for learning complex dynamics from limited data. Here, we use RC to predict highly stochastic dynamics of cell shapes. We find that RC is able to predict the steady state climate from very limited data. Furthermore, the RC learns the timescale of transients from only four observations. We find that these capabilities of the RC to act as a dynamic twin allows us to also infer important statistics of cell shape dynamics of unobserved conditions.</description>

      <title>Scale-bridging within a complex model hierarchy for investigation of a metal-fueled circular energy economy by use of Bayesian model calibration with model error quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal energy carriers recently gained growing interest in research as a promising storage and transport material for renewable electricity. Within the development of a metal-fueled circular energy economy, research involves a model hierarchy spanning from micro to macro scales, making the transfer of information among different levels of complexity a crucial task for the implementation of the new technology. Chemical reactor networks (CRNs) are models of reduced complexity and a promising approach to accomplish the scale-bridging task. This holds if valid information from CRNs can be obtained on a much denser set of operating conditions than available from experiments and elaborated simulation methods like Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). An approach for CRN calibration from recent literature, including model error quantification, is further developed to construct a CRN model of a laboratory reactor for flash ironmaking, using data from the literature. By introducing a meta model of a CRN parameter, a simple CRN model on an extended set of operating conditions has successfully been calibrated. This way, the employed coupled calibration and uncertainty quantification framework has proven promising for the task of scale-bridging in the model hierarchy under investigation.</description>
