      <title>Learning Stochastic Hamiltonian Systems via Stochastic Generating Function Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel neural network model for learning stochastic Hamiltonian systems (SHSs) from observational data, termed the stochastic generating function neural network (SGFNN). SGFNN preserves symplectic structure of the underlying stochastic Hamiltonian system and produces symplectic predictions. Our model utilizes the autoencoder framework to identify the randomness of the latent system by the encoder network, and detects the stochastic generating function of the system through the decoder network based on the random variables extracted from the encoder. Symplectic predictions can then be generated by the stochastic generating function. Numerical experiments are performed on several stochastic Hamiltonian systems, varying from additive to multiplicative, and from separable to non-separable SHSs with single or multiple noises. Compared with the benchmark stochastic flow map learning (sFML) neural network, our SGFNN model exhibits higher accuracy across various prediction metrics, especially in long-term predictions, with the property of maintaining the symplectic structure of the underlying SHSs.</description>

      <title>A Multidimensional Birkhoff Theorem for Recurrent Lagrangian Submanifolds by a Tonelli Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a closed manifold $M$ and a time-periodic Tonelli Hamiltonian $H : \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} \times T^*M \to \mathbb{R}$ with flow $\phi_H$. Let $\mathcal{L} \subset T^*M$ be a Lagrangian submanifold Hamiltonianly isotopic to the zero section. We prove that if $\phi_H^n(\mathcal{L})$ admits convergent subsequences in both positive and negative times, in the Hausdorff topology and with control on the Liouville primitives, to two Lagrangian submanifolds, then $\mathcal{L}$ is a graph over the zero section $0_{T^*M}$ of $T^*M$. Furthermore, we show that $\mathcal{L}$ is recurrent in both positive and negative times for the same type of convergence.</description>

      <title>Intermittent--synchronization in non-weakly coupled piecewise linear expanding map lattice: a geometric-combinatorics method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupled (chaotic) map lattices (CMLs) characterizes the collective dynamics of a spatially distributed system consisting of locally or globally coupled maps. The current research on the dynamic behavior of CMLs is based on the framework of the Perron-Frobenius operator and mainly focuses on weakly-coupled cases. In this paper, a novel geometric-combinatorics method for for non weakly-coupled CMLs is provided on the dynamical behavior of a two-node CMLs with identical piecewise linear expanding maps. We obtain a necessary-sufficient condition for the uniqueness of absolutely continuous invariant measure (ACIM) and for the occurrence of intermittent-synchronization, that is, almost each orbit enters and exits an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the diagonal for an infinite number of times.</description>

      <title>System identification of Fokker-Planck equations via transport maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework that simultaneously reconstructs system dynamics and probability density functions from time-evolving data. Leveraging the Knothe-Rosenblatt rearrangements, we model the transport map from a fixed reference distribution to the target distribution, and derive the velocity fields of the dynamics from the trajectory of transport maps. We further introduce an extension to a Bayesian setting using variational inference through the evidence lower bound (ELBO) which enables uncertainty quantification. The approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments in spaces of up to five dimensions.</description>

      <title>Spatial Stark-Zeeman Systems and Their Regularizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study spatial Stark-Zeeman systems which describe the dynamics of a charged particle moving in three-dimensional space under the influence of a Coulomb potential, a magnetic field, and an electric field, possibly time-dependent. Such systems are modeled by Hamiltonian flows on the cotangent bundle of an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^3, $ equipped with a twisted symplectic structure. The presence of the Coulomb singularity leads to the study of collision orbits, and hence understanding the regularization of these orbits is essential for global dynamical properties.
  We investigate regularization techniques for spatial Stark-Zeeman systems, both in time-independent and time-dependent cases. In particular, in the time-dependent case, following a new regularization method developed by Barutello, Ortega, and Verzini, we formulate the corresponding regularized variational principles and carefully analyze the effects of magnetic and electric terms under the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation. The resulting regularized action functional yields a variational characterization of collision orbits and facilitates further analysis of periodic solutions.
  Our results provide a general scheme for regularizing spatial Stark-Zeeman systems, opening the door for further applications in symplectic geometry, Floer theory, and celestial mechanics.</description>

      <title>Higher-Dimensional Moving Averages and Submanifold Genericity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize results of Bellow, Jones, and Rosenblatt on moving ergodic averages to measure-preserving actions of $\mathbb Z^d$ and $\mathbb R^d$ for $d\geq 1$. In particular, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the pointwise convergence of certain sequences of functions defined by averaging over families of boxes in $\mathbb Z^d$ and $\mathbb R^d$. As an application of our characterization, we show that averages along dilates of "locally flat" submanifolds in $\mathbb R^d$ do not necessarily converge point-wise for bounded measurable functions. This is closely related to the concept of submanifold-genericity recently introduced in [BFK25].</description>

Abstract: We show that if $p_1,p_2$ are injective, integer polynomials that vanish at the origin, such that either both are of degree $1$ or both are of degree $2$ or higher, then double recurrence fails for non-commuting, mixing, zero entropy transformations. This answers a question of Frantzikinakis and Host completely.</description>

      <title>A new construction for Melnikov chaos in piecewise-smooth planar systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a piecewise smooth $2$-dimensional system \[ \dot{\vec{x}}=\vec{g} (\vec{x})+\varepsilon\vec{g}(t,\vec{x},\varepsilon) \] where $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is a small parameter and $\vec{f}$ is discontinuous along a curve $\Omega^0$. We assume that $\vec{0}$ is a critical point for any $\varepsilon \geq 0$, and that for $\varepsilon=0$ the system admits a trajectory $\vec{\gamma}(t)$ homoclinic to $\vec{0}$ and crossing transversely $\Omega^0$ in $\vec{\gamma}(0)$.
  In a previous paper we have shown that, also in an $n$-dimensional setting, the classical Melnikov condition is enough to guarantee the persistence of the homoclinic to perturbations, but more recently we have found an open condition, a geometric obstruction which is not possible in the smooth case, which prevents chaos for $2$-dimensional systems when $\vec{g}$ is periodic in $t$.
  In this paper we show that when this obstruction is removed we have chaos as in the smooth case. The proofs involve a new construction of the set $\Sigma$ from which the chaotic pattern originates.
  The results are illustrated by examples.</description>

      <title>Mixed Mode Oscillations and Bifurcation Mechanism in a Nonlinear Beam-Elastic Foundation Under Parametric and External Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to study existence condition of possible bursting oscillations generated by low frequency excitation of a nonlinear vibratory system in the presence of parametric excitation. Slow-fast dissection technique and numerical bifurcation analysis are employed to extract qualitative changes in system response originated from its nonlinear dynamics. Role of all parameters of elastic foundation and excitation model are studies and it is shown that the system exhibits the phenomena of folding, cusp and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations which are potentially routes to bi-stability and chaos. It can be found that slow excitation of the nonlinear foundation is the main generating factor of fold bifurcation and stiffness of elastic foundation has a remarkable effect on stability region of the beam. In addition, the base excitation of an elastic foundation in form of a traveling wave, adds multi-frequency excitation and parametric resonances necessarily to the system. This study showed investigating nonlinear oscillator under low frequency excitations in framework of slow-fast plays an invaluable role in understanding instabilities in systems that are not captured by standard methods.</description>

      <title>A Recursive Lie-Group Formulation for the Second-Order Time Derivatives of the Inverse Dynamics of parallel Kinematic Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Series elastic actuators (SEA) were introduced for serial robotic arms. Their model-based trajectory tracking control requires the second time derivatives of the inverse dynamics solution, for which algorithms were proposed. Trajectory control of parallel kinematics manipulators (PKM) equipped with SEAs has not yet been pursued. Key element for this is the computationally efficient evaluation of the second time derivative of the inverse dynamics solution. This has not been presented in the literature, and is addressed in the present paper for the first time. The special topology of PKM is exploited reusing the recursive algorithms for evaluating the inverse dynamics of serial robots. A Lie group formulation is used and all relations are derived within this framework. Numerical results are presented for a 6-DOF Gough-Stewart platform (as part of an exoskeleton), and for a planar PKM when a flatness-based control scheme is applied.</description>

      <title>A Simple Intermediate Coupled MJO-ENSO Model: Multiscale Interactions and ENSO Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are two dominant modes of tropical climate variability, each with profound global weather impacts. While their individual dynamics have been widely studied, their coupled interactions, particularly in the context of ENSO complexity, including spatial diversity (Central Pacific vs. Eastern Pacific events), temporal evolution (single-year and multi-year events), and intensity variations (moderate to extreme events), have received limited attention in modeling studies. In this paper, a simple intermediate coupled MJO-ENSO model is developed to address critical gaps in understanding their bidirectional feedback and its role in modulating ENSO complexity. The model integrates multiscale processes, bridging intraseasonal (MJO), interannual (ENSO), and decadal (Walker circulation) variability. Key mechanisms include: (1) interannual SST modulating MJO through latent heat and background states, (2) MJO-induced wind forcing triggering diverse ENSO events, and (3) decadal variability modulating the strength and occurrence frequency of Eastern Pacific and Central Pacific events. Effective stochastic parameterizations are incorporated to improve the characterization of multiscale MJO-ENSO interactions and the emergence of intermittency and extremes. The model captures several crucial observed MJO and ENSO features, including non-Gaussian statistics, seasonal cycles, energy spectra, and spatial event patterns. It also reproduces critical MJO-ENSO interactions: warm pool edge extension, convective activity adjustments that modulate SST, and ENSO's dependence on MJO-driven easterly and westerly wind anomalies. The model provides a useful tool to analyze long-term variations. It also advances the understanding of ENSO extreme events and their remote impacts, as well as seasonal forecasting and climate resilience.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically Consistent Modeling and Stable ALE Approximations of Reactive Semi-Permeable Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reactive, semi-permeable interfaces play important roles in key biological processes such as targeted drug delivery, lipid metabolism, and signal transduction. These systems involve coupled surface reactions, transmembrane transport, and interfacial deformation, often triggered by local biochemical signals. The strong mechanochemical couplings complicate the modeling of such interfacial dynamics. We propose a thermodynamically consistent continuum framework that integrates bulk fluid motion, interfacial dynamics, surface chemistry, and selective solute exchange, derived via an energy variation approach to ensure mass conservation and energy dissipation. To efficiently solve the resulting coupled system, we develop a finite element scheme within an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework, incorporating the Barrett-Garcke-Nurnberg (BGN) strategy to maintain mesh regularity and preserve conservation laws. Numerical experiments verify the convergence and conservation properties of the scheme and demonstrate its ability in capturing complex interfacial dynamics. Two biologically inspired examples showcase the model's versatility: cholesterol efflux via the ABCG1 pathway, involving multistage interfacial reactions and HDL uptake; and a self-propelled droplet system with reaction-activated permeability, mimicking drug release in pathological environments. This work provides a unified computational platform for studying strongly coupled biochemical and mechanical interactions at interfaces, offering new insights into reactive transport processes in both biological and industrial contexts.</description>

      <title>Strategy Evolution in the Adoption of Conservation Tillage Technology under Time Preference Heterogeneity and Lemon Market: Insights from Evolutionary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The promotion of Conservation Tillage Technology (CTT) is critical for mitigating global soil degradation, yet their actual adoption rates remain substantially lower than anticipated targets. Existing research predominantly focuses on static factor analyses, failing to adequately capture the dynamic evolutionary mechanisms of farmer strategic interactions and the impacts of information asymmetries in agricultural markets. This study constructs an evolutionary game model integrating heterogeneous time preferences and lemon market effects to reveal the dynamic equilibrium of technology adoption within farmer groups operating under bounded rationality. Key findings indicate that farmers with high time preferences significantly impede CTT adoption due to the excessive discounting of long-term benefits. Furthermore, the lemon market effect dictates the system's equilibrium states: 1) When the lemon market benefit ($P$) exceeds the lemon market loss ($Q$) ($P &gt; Q$), stable tripartite coexistence of adoption strategies emerges; 2) When $P &lt; Q$, the system evolves unpredictably, exhibiting dynamics characterized by heteroclinic cycles; 3) At the critical threshold $P = Q$, the system transforms into a conservative Hamiltonian system, yielding stable periodic oscillation solutions. Based on these insights, policy recommendations are proposed: implementing ecological certification schemes to mitigate information asymmetry, offering subsidies and insurance to reduce adoption risks, and utilizing environmental taxes to internalize the negative externalities associated with conventional tillage. This research not only provides a dynamic analytical paradigm for the diffusion of green agricultural technologies but also furnishes a theoretical foundation for designing sustainable agricultural policies in developing countries.</description>

      <title>Switching States: Heteroclinic Cycles as Organising Centres of Neuronal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuronal networks alternate between high- and low-activity regimes, known as up and down states. They also display rhythmic patterns essential for perception, memory consolidation, and sensory processing. Despite their importance, the principles behind such state transitions remain elusive. We propose necessary conditions for the existence of a novel bifurcation structure as a universal organising centre governing these transitions. Bifurcation analysis and simulations of canonical mean-field network models, including Wilson--Cowan, Tsodyks--Markram, and Jansen--Rit frameworks, show that this bifurcation structure emerges robustly across models. We demonstrate that the interplay between external input and (synaptic) connectivity converges onto this shared mechanism, providing a fundamental principle for understanding how diverse brain states arise and are regulated. Beyond phenomenological mean-field models, we show that a shared mathematical structure of nonlinear input-output relationships, rather than model-specific details, preserves the organising centre across frameworks, revealing a general mechanism for dynamic state transitions.</description>

Abstract: Large eddy simulation (LES) has become a central technique for simulating turbulent flows in engineering and applied sciences, offering a compromise between accuracy and computational cost by resolving large scale motions and modeling the effects of smaller, unresolved scales through a subgrid scale (SGS) model. The fidelity and robustness of LES depends critically on the SGS model, particularly in coarse simulations where much of the turbulence spectrum remains unresolved.
  In this work, we extend the tau-orthogonal (TO) method, a data-driven SGS modeling framework, to three-dimensional turbulent flows. The method reformulates the high-dimensional SGS closure problem as a low-dimensional prediction task focused on scale-aware quantities of interest (QoIs). We extend the model to incorporate QoI-state dependence and temporal correlations by combining regularized least-squares regression with a multivariate Gaussian residual model. This yields a simple yet effective stochastic time-series prediction model (the LRS model), with orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters than typical deep learning approaches which try to directly learn the high-dimensional SGS closure.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the TO LRS model in three-dimensional forced isotropic turbulence and turbulent channel flow. The model achieves accurate long-term QoI distributions, robust performance across hyperparameter settings, and good reproduction of key flow features such as kinetic energy spectra and coherent structures, despite being trained solely on QoI trajectories. Comparisons against classical SGS models, including Smagorinsky and WALE formulations, highlight the TO LRS model's balance of accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of sets of continued fractions with bounded odd and even order partial quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the continued fractions with bounded odd/even-order partial quotients. In particular, we investigate the sizes of the sets of continued fractions whose odd-order partial quotients are equal to 1. We demonstrate that the sum and the product of two sets of continued fractions whose odd-order partial quotients are equal to 1 both contain non-empty intervals. Our work compliments the results of Han\v{c}l and Turek on the set of continued fractions whose even-order partial quotients are equal to 1. Furthermore, we determine the Hausdorff dimensions of the sets of continued fractions whose odd-order partial quotients are equal to 1 and even-order partial quotients are growing at an exponential rate, a super-exponential rate, and in general a positive function rate.</description>

      <title>GeoHNNs: Geometric Hamiltonian Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental laws of physics are intrinsically geometric, dictating the evolution of systems through principles of symmetry and conservation. While modern machine learning offers powerful tools for modeling complex dynamics from data, common methods often ignore this underlying geometric fabric. Physics-informed neural networks, for instance, can violate fundamental physical principles, leading to predictions that are unstable over long periods, particularly for high-dimensional and chaotic systems. Here, we introduce \textit{Geometric Hamiltonian Neural Networks (GeoHNN)}, a framework that learns dynamics by explicitly encoding the geometric priors inherent to physical laws. Our approach enforces two fundamental structures: the Riemannian geometry of inertia, by parameterizing inertia matrices in their natural mathematical space of symmetric positive-definite matrices, and the symplectic geometry of phase space, using a constrained autoencoder to ensure the preservation of phase space volume in a reduced latent space. We demonstrate through experiments on systems ranging from coupled oscillators to high-dimensional deformable objects that GeoHNN significantly outperforms existing models. It achieves superior long-term stability, accuracy, and energy conservation, confirming that embedding the geometry of physics is not just a theoretical appeal but a practical necessity for creating robust and generalizable models of the physical world.</description>

      <title>Ubiquity of Uncertainty in Neuron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that final-state uncertainty is ubiquitous in multistable systems of coupled neuronal maps, meaning that predicting whether one such system will eventually be chaotic or nonchaotic is often nearly impossible. We propose a "chance synchronization" mechanism that governs the emergence of unpredictability in neuron systems and support it by using basin classification, uncertainty exponent, and basin entropy techniques to analyze five simple discrete-time systems, each consisting of a different neuron model. Our results illustrate that uncertainty in neuron systems is not just a product of noise or high-dimensional complexity; it is also a fundamental property of low-dimensional, deterministic models, which has profound implications for understanding brain function, modeling cognition, and interpreting unpredictability in general multistable systems.</description>

Abstract: This is a complete study of the dynamics of polynomial planar vector fields whose linear part is a multiple of the identity and whose nonlinear part is a homogeneous polynomial. It extends previous work by other authors that was mainly concerned with the existence and number of limit cycles. The general results are also applied to two classes of examples where the nonlinearities have degrees 2 and 3, for which we provide a complete set of phase portraits.</description>

Abstract: We first consider a non-primitive substitution subshift that is conjugate to the Chacon map. We then derive spectral estimates for a particular subshift and the speed of weak mixing for a class of observables with certain regularity conditions. After, we use these results to find the speed of weak mixing for the Chacon map on the interval and show that this bound is essentially sharp.</description>

      <title>Moments of Margulis functions and indefinite ternary quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a quantitative version of the Oppenheim conjecture for indefinite ternary quadratic forms: for any indefinite irrational ternary quadratic form $Q$ that is not extremely well approxiable by rational forms, and for $a&lt;b$ the number of integral vectors of norm at most $T$ satisfying $a&lt;Q(v)&lt;b$ is asymptotically equivalent to $\big(\mathsf{C}_Q(b-a)+\mathsf{I}_{Q}(a,b)\big)T$ as $T$ tends to infinity, where the constant $\mathsf{C}_Q&gt;0$ depends only on $Q$, and the term $\mathsf{I}_{Q}(a,b)T$ accounts for the contribution from rational isotropic lines and degenerate planes.
  The main technical ingredient is a uniform bound for the $\lambda$-moment of the Margulis $\alpha$-function along expanding translates of a unipotent orbit in $\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$, for some $\lambda&gt;1$. To establish this, we introduce a new height function $\widetilde{\alpha}$ on the space of lattices, which captures the failure of the classical Margulis inequality. This moment bound implies equidistribution of such translates with respect to a class of unbounded test functions, including the Siegel transform.</description>

Abstract: We prove the transitivity of real Anosov diffeomorphisms, which are Anosov diffeomorphisms where stable and unstable spaces decompose into a continuous sum of invariant one-dimensional sub-spaces with uniform contraction/expansion over the ambient manifold. We prove that if a stable/unstable curve has a well-defined length in a conformal hyperbolic distance, then it has a globally defined holonomy. We exhibit a conformal hyperbolic distance with well-defined length of stable/unstable curves for each real Anosov diffeomorphism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we extend to an infinite dimensional setting some results on the shadowing property that are known on finite dimensional compact manifolds without border and in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In fact, we show that if $\{\T(t):t\ge 0\}$ is a Morse-Smale semigroup defined in a Hilbert space with a global attractor $\mathcal{A}$ and non-wandering set given only by its equilibria, then $\T(1)|_{\mathcal{A}}:\mathcal{A}\to \mathcal{A} $ admits the Lipschitz Shadowing property. Moreover, for any positively invariant bounded neighborhood $\U\supset\mathcal{A}$ of the global attractor, the map $\T(1)|_{\U}:\U\to \U$ has the H\"{o}lder-Shadowing property. We obtain results related to the structural stability of Morse-Smale semigroups, that were only known on finite dimension and continuity of global attractors.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the penalty function for the $\mathbb{Z}^2$-hard square shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of maximizing measures for a penalty function of a two-dimensional subshift of finite type, building on the work of Gonschorowski et al. \cite{GQS}. In the one-dimensional case, such measures remain stable under Lipschitz perturbations for any subshift of finite type. However, instability arises for a penalty function of the Robinson tiling, which is a two-dimensional subshift of finite type with no periodic points and zero entropy. This raises the question of whether stability persists in two-dimensional subshifts of finite type with positive topological entropy. In this paper, we address this question by studying a nearest-neighbor subshift of finite type satisfying the single-site fillability property. Our main theorem establishes that, in contrast to previous results, a penalty function of such a subshift of finite type remains stable under Lipschitz perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that under general resonance the classical piecewise linear Fermi-Ulam accelerator behaves substantially different from its quantization in the sense that the classical accelerator exhibits typical recurrence and non-escaping while the quantum version enjoys quadratic energy growth in general. We also describe a procedure to locate the escaping orbits, though exceptionally rare in the infinite-volume phase space, for the classical accelerators, which in particular include Ulam's very original proposal and the linearly escaping orbits therein in the existing literature, and hence provide a complete (modulo a null set) answer to Ulam's original question. For the quantum accelerators, we reveal under resonance the direct and explicit connection between the energy growth and the shape of the quasi-energy spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.12128v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a closed Riemannian manifold $M$ of negative curvature and dimension at least 3 with marked length spectrum sufficiently close (multiplicatively) to that of a locally symmetric space $N$. Using the methods of Hamenst\"adt, we show the volumes of $M$ and $N$ are approximately equal. We then show the Besson-Courtois-Gallot map $F: M \to N$ is a diffeomorphism with derivative bounds close to 1 and depending on the ratio of the two marked length spectrum functions. Thus, we refine the results of Hamenst\"adt and Besson-Courtois-Gallot, which show $M$ and $N$ are isometric if their marked length spectra are equal. We also prove a similar result for compact negatively curved surfaces using the methods of Otal together with a version of the Gromov compactness theorem due to Pugh.</description>

Abstract: Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is a promising control method against insect pests and insect vectors. It consists in releasing males previously sterilized in laboratory, in order to reduce or eliminate a specific wild population. We study in this paper the implementation by feedback control of SIT-based elimination campaign of Aedes mosquitoes. We provide state-feedback and output-feedback control laws and establish their convergence, as well as their robustness properties. In this design procedure, a pivotal role is played by the average number of secondary female insects produced by a single female insect, called basic offspring number, and by the use of properties of monotone systems. Illustrative simulations are provided.</description>

      <title>Metastability in the stochastic nearest-neighbor Kuramoto model of coupled phase oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model (KM) of $n$ coupled phase-oscillators is analyzed in this work. The KM on a Cayley graph possesses a family of steady state solutions called twisted states. Topologically distinct twisted states are distinguished by the winding number $q\in\mathbb{Z}$. These states are known to be stable for small enough $q$. In the presence of small noise, the KM exhibits metastable transitions between $q$-twisted states: A typical trajectory remains in the basin of attraction of a given $q$-twisted state for an exponentially long time, but eventually transitions to the vicinity of another such state. In the course of this transition, it passes in close proximity of a saddle of Morse index $1$, called a relevant saddle. In this work, we provide an exhaustive analysis of metastable transitions in the stochastic KM with nearest-neighbor coupling. We start by analyzing the equilibria and their stability. First, we identify all equilibria in this model. Using the discrete Fourier transform and eigenvalue estimates for rank-1 perturbations of symmetric matrices, we classify the equilibria by their Morse indices. In particular, we identify all stable equilibria and all relevant saddles involved in the metastable transitions. Further, we use Freidlin-Wentzell theory and the potential-theoretic approach to metastability to establish the metastable hierarchy and sharp estimates of Eyring-Kramers type for the transition times. The former determines the precise order, in which the metastable transitions occur, while the latter characterizes the times between successive transitions. The theoretical estimates are complemented by numerical simulations and a careful numerical verification of the transition times. Finally, we discuss the implications of this work for the KM with other coupling types including nonlocal coupling and the continuum limit as $n$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate cocycle superrigidity in the setting of finite rank median spaces for product groups and Kazhdan groups. By employing a dynamical approach to superrigidity, we establish, for a median space X of finite rank, the superrigidity of Isom(X)-valued cocycles for a product of locally compact second countable groups. In the case of actions by irreducible lattices in such product groups, this approach yields a novel proof of the superrigidity of homomorphisms.</description>

Abstract: We consider motion of a material point placed in a constant homogeneous magnetic field restricted to the sphere $S^{n-1}$. We provide a Lax representation of the equations of motion and prove complete integrability of those systems for any $n$. The integrability is provided via first integrals of degree one and two.</description>
