      <title>A Luminous Red Optical Flare and Hard X-ray Emission in the Tidal Disruption Event AT2024kmq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the optical discovery and multiwavelength follow-up observations of AT2024kmq, a likely tidal disruption event (TDE) associated with a supermassive ($M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^{8} M_\odot$) black hole in a massive galaxy at $z=0.192$. The optical light curve of AT2024kmq exhibits two distinct peaks: an early fast (timescale 1 d) and luminous ($M\approx-20$ mag) red peak, then a slower (timescale 1 month) blue peak with a higher optical luminosity ($M\approx-22$ mag) and featureless optical spectra. The second component is similar to the spectroscopic class of "featureless TDEs" in the literature, and during this second component we detect highly variable, luminous ($L_X\approx 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and hard ($f_\nu \propto \nu^{-1.5}$) X-ray emission. Luminous ($10^{29} $erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ at 10 GHz) but unchanging radio emission likely arises from an underlying active galactic nucleus. The luminosity, timescale, and color of the early red optical peak can be explained by synchrotron emission, or alternatively by thermal emission from material at a large radius ($R\approx\mathrm{few}\times10^{15}$ cm). Possible physical origins for this early red component include an off-axis relativistic jet, and shocks from self-intersecting debris leading to the formation of the accretion disk. Late-time radio observations will help distinguish between the two possibilities.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray emission from decays of boosted nuclei in proto-magnetar jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the detectability of $\gamma$-ray emission originating from the radioactive decays of unstable nuclei that are synthesized in relativistic outflows launched in magneto-rotational core-collapse supernovae. The observed lines have enhanced energies due to the Lorentz boosted nuclei and can also be seen until later times due to time dilation of the rest-frame half-lives. We find that instruments like $\textit{e-ASTROGAM}$ and $\textit{INTEGRAL/SPI}$ are sensitive to these boosted line emissions from 100s of keV to 10s of MeV at a distance of 10 kpc over time scales of 10s of days. For favorable viewing angles, these decays can be detected to extragalactic distances for rapidly spinning proto-magnetar models. On the other hand, detection for off-axis jets is challenging, even for a supernova at the galactic center. Measuring multiple decay lines in addition to the integrated luminosity over $\sim$10 days post-bounce would allow for the ability to distinguish between models and shed light on central engine properties like magnetic field and spin.</description>

      <title>Long-Term X-ray Variability on the Benchmark YSO HL Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HL Tau is one of the most well-studied Class I young stellar objects, including frequent observations at near- and mid-infrared, (sub-) millimeter, and X-ray wavelengths. We present the results of an X-ray variability monitoring campaign with XMM-Newton in 2020 and X-ray gratings spectroscopy from Chandra/HETGS in 2018. We find that the X-ray spectrum of HL Tau is consistently hot (with characteristic plasma temperatures $T \gtrsim 30$ MK) over 31 epochs spanning 20 years, which is consistent in temperature with most Class I YSOs. The high-resolution HETG spectrum indicates the presence of some cooler plasma. We characterize the variability of the star across the 31 observations and find a subset of observations with significant variability on a $\sim$21-day timescale in the observed count rate and flux. We discuss the possible origins of this variability, and identify further observations that would better constrain the nature of the changes.</description>

      <title>Markarian 501 reincarnates with vigor as a temporary EHBL during VHE flaring in July 2014</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markarian 501, a well known high energy BL Lac object, has exhibited several epochs of very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray flaring events when its synchrotron peak frequency shifted above $10^{17}$ Hz, a signature of extreme behavior. From July 16 to July 31, 2014 such flaring events were observed for 15 days by various telescopes. On July 19 (MJD 56857.98), the X-ray outburst from the source was at its highest and on the same day an intriguing narrow peak-like feature around 3 TeV was observed by MAGIC telescopes, a feature inconsistent with standard interpretations. Using the well known two-zone photohadronic model, we study these VHE gamma-ray spectra on a day-by-day basis and offer explanation. Our two-zone photohadronic scenario shows that, on MJD 56857.98, the peak-like feature appears at a cutoff energy of $E^c_{\gamma}$ = 3.18 TeV. Below this energy the observed VHE spectrum increases slowly and above $E^c_{\gamma}$ it falls faster, thus resulting in a mild peak-like feature.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the stellar atmosphere and the focused wind in different accretion states of Cygnus X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), the compact object accretes the strong stellar wind of an O-B supergiant companion star. X-ray flux variations alter the stellar wind's ionization state and optical line profiles, which are key in the determination of the orbital parameters of the system. Using the method of Fourier Disentangling, we decomposed the spectral contributions from the stellar atmosphere close to the photosphere and the accreted stream of matter (i.e. the focused wind). High-resolution optical spectroscopy of Cyg X-1 in its hard and soft-intermediate X-ray states revealed state-dependent variability in the line profiles. In both states, we detect H-alpha and He II in both the focused wind and the stellar photosphere, whereas He I is not detected in the focused wind. Additionally, we observe an X-ray/optical anticorrelation, where the lines' intensity decreases in the soft-intermediate state and the lines are more absorbed at the inferior conjunction of the star. These results suggest a stronger wind in the low-hard state and the presence of high-density clumps in the line of sight at the conjunction.</description>

      <title>Comparing observed properties of winds in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei with theoretical predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical and numerical simulations of black hole hot accretion flows have shown the ubiquitous existence of winds and predicted their properties such as velocity and mass flux. In this paper, we have summarized from literature the physical properties of winds launched from low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN), which are believed to be powered by hot accretion flows, and compared them with theoretical predictions. We infer that for both ultra-fast outflows and hot winds, the observed wind velocity as a function of their launching radius and the ratio between wind mass flux and black hole accretion rate show good consistency with theoretical predictions. For the prototype LLAGN M81* with abundant observational data, we have examined various observed properties of wind in detail, including velocity, mass flux of the wind, the power-law index of the radial profile of inflow rate, and the jet-to-wind power ratio. Good agreements are found with theoretical predictions, providing strong support to the theory of wind launched from hot accretion flows.</description>

      <title>The ultra-high-energy event KM3-230213A within the global neutrino landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On February 13th, 2023, the KM3NeT/ARCA telescope detected a neutrino candidate with an estimated energy in the hundreds of PeVs. In this article, the observation of this ultra-high-energy neutrino is discussed in light of null observations above tens of PeV from the IceCube and Pierre Auger observatories. Performing a joint fit of all experiments under the assumption of an isotropic $E^{-2}$ flux, the best-fit single-flavour flux normalisation is $E^2 \Phi^{\rm 1f}_{\nu + \bar \nu} = 7.5 \times 10^{-10}~{\rm GeV cm^{-2} s^{-1} sr^{-1}}$ in the 90% energy range of the KM3NeT event. Furthermore, the ultra-high-energy data are then fit together with the IceCube measurements at lower energies, either with a single power law or with a broken power law, allowing for the presence of a new component in the spectrum. The joint fit including non-observations by other experiments in the ultra-high-energy region shows a slight preference for a break in the PeV regime if the ``High-Energy Starting Events'' sample is included, and no such preference for the other two IceCube samples investigated. A stronger preference for a break appears if only the KM3NeT data is considered in the ultra-high-energy region, though the flux resulting from such a fit would be inconsistent with null observations from IceCube and Pierre Auger. In all cases, the observed tension between KM3NeT and other datasets is of the order of $2.5\sigma-3\sigma$, and increased statistics are required to resolve this apparent tension and better characterise the neutrino landscape at ultra-high energies.</description>

      <title>Disk reflection and energetics from the accreting millisecond pulsar SRGA J144459.2-604207</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accreting millisecond pulsars (AMSPs) are excellent laboratories to study reflection spectra and their features from an accretion disk truncated by a rapidly rotating magnetosphere near the neutron star surface. These systems also exhibit thermonuclear (type-I) bursts that can provide insights on the accretion physics and fuel composition. We explore spectral properties of the AMSP SRGA J144459.2-0604207 observed during the outburst that recently led to its discovery in February 2024. We aim to characterize the spectral shape of the persistent emission, both its continuum and discrete features, and to analyze type-I bursts properties. We employ XMM and NuSTAR overlapping observations taken during the most recent outburst from SRGA J1444. We perform spectral analysis of the persistent (i.e., non-bursting) emission employing a semi-phenomenological continuum model composed of a dominant thermal Comptonization plus two thermal contributions, and a physical reflection model. We also perform time-resolved spectral analysis of a type-I burst employing a blackbody model. We observe a broadened iron emission line, thus suggesting relativistic effects, supported by the physical model accounting for relativistically blurred reflection. The resulting accretion disk extends down to 6 gravitational radii, inclined at ~$53^{\circ}$, and only moderately ionized (log$\xi\simeq2.3$). We observe an absorption edge at ~9.7 keV that can be interpreted as an Fe XXVI edge blueshifted by an ultrafast ($\simeq0.04$c) outflow. Our broadband observations of type-I bursts do not find evidence of photospheric radius expansion. The burst recurrence time shows a dependence on the count rate with the steepest slope ever observed in these systems. We also observe a discrepancy of ~3 between the observed and expected burst recurrence time, which we discuss in the framework of fuel composition and high NS mass scenarios.</description>

      <title>Exploring Unusual High-frequency Eclipses in MSP J1908+2105</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of the eclipse properties of the spider millisecond pulsar (MSP) J1908$+$2105, using wide-band observations from the uGMRT and Parkes UWL. For the first time, we observed that this pulsar exhibits extended eclipses up to 4 GHz, the highest frequency band of the UWL, making it one of only three MSPs known to have such high-frequency eclipses. This study reveals synchrotron absorption as the primary eclipse mechanism for J1908$+$2105. We present modeling of synchrotron optical depth with various possible combinations of the parameters to explain the observed eclipsing in this as well as other spider MSPs. Observed eclipses at unusually high frequencies for J1908$+$2105 significantly aided in constraining the magnetic field and electron column density in the eclipse medium while modeling the synchrotron optical depth. Combining our findings with data from other MSPs in the literature, for the first time we note that a higher cutoff frequency of eclipsing, particularly above 1 GHz, is consistently associated with a higher electron column density ($&gt;$ 10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$) in the eclipse medium. Additionally, we present the first evidence of lensing effects near eclipse boundaries in this MSP, leading to significant magnification of radio emissions. The orbital phase resolved polarization analysis presented in this paper further indicates variation in rotation measure and consequently stronger magnetic fields in the eclipse region.</description>

      <title>On the Potential Galactic Origin of the Ultra-High-Energy Event KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KM3NeT observatory detected the most energetic neutrino candidate ever observed, with an energy between 72 PeV and 2.6 EeV at the 90% confidence level. The observed neutrino is likely of cosmic origin. In this article, it is investigated if the neutrino could have been produced within the Milky Way. Considering the low fluxes of the Galactic diffuse emission at these energies, the lack of a nearby potential Galactic particle accelerator in the direction of the event and the difficulty to accelerate particles to such high energies in Galactic systems, we conclude that if the event is indeed cosmic, it is most likely of extragalactic origin.</description>

      <title>Characterising Candidate Blazar Counterparts of the Ultra-High-Energy Event KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KM3NeT experiment reported the detection of an ultra-high-energy neutrino with an energy estimate of ~ 220 PeV, the most energetic yet observed. The neutrino arrival direction has a 99% confidence region of 3{\deg} radius centred at RA 94.3{\deg}, Dec -7.8{\deg} (J2000). High-energy astrophysical neutrinos are a crucial messenger for understanding hadronic acceleration processes in the Universe and for identifying the origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Among the most powerful cosmic accelerators, blazars are proposed as promising neutrino sources. A sample of seventeen candidate blazars located in this region is selected through their multiwavelength properties, and studied using archival data and dedicated observations. One of the candidate counterparts exhibits a radio flare coinciding with the neutrino arrival time, with a pre-trial chance probability of 0.26%. Another candidate counterpart exhibits a rising trend in the X-ray flux in a one-year window around the neutrino arrival time. A third candidate undergoes a gamma-ray flare during the same period. While none of these candidates can conclusively be linked to the neutrino, the implications of a possible blazar origin for the KM3NeT event are discussed.</description>

      <title>On the potential cosmogenic origin of the ultra-high-energy event KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the 13th February 2023 the KM3NeT/ARCA telescope observed a track-like event compatible with a ultra-high-energy muon with an estimated energy of 120 PeV, produced by a neutrino with an even higher energy, making it the most energetic neutrino event ever detected. A diffuse cosmogenic component is expected to originate from the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with ambient photon and matter fields. The flux level required by the KM3NeT/ARCA event is however in tension with the standard cosmogenic neutrino predictions based on the observations collected by the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array over the last decade of the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays above the ankle (hence from the local Universe, $z\lesssim 1$). We show here that both observations can be reconciled by extending the integration of the equivalent cosmogenic neutrino flux up to a redshift of $z\simeq 6$ and assuming a subdominant fraction of protons in the ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray flux, thus placing constraints on known cosmic accelerators.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic dynamics of eccentric black-hole binaries in post-Newtonian theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eccentric black-hole binaries are among the most awaited sources of gravitational waves, yet their dynamics lack a consistent framework that provides a detailed and physically robust evolutionary description due to gauge issues. We present a new set of non-orbit-averaged equations, free from radiation-reaction gauge ambiguities, that accurately describe the evolution of orbital elements for eccentric, non-spinning black-hole binaries. We derive these equations by mapping the Keplerian orbital elements to a new set of characteristic parameters using energy and angular momentum definitions combined with near-identity transformations. The resulting framework is valid for arbitrary eccentricities, including parabolic and hyperbolic limits. Using this framework, we demonstrate the strictly observable effects of the non-adiabatic emission of gravitational waves -- characteristic of eccentric binaries -- on the orbital parameters. Furthermore, we assess the regime of validity of the widely used orbit-averaged equations first derived by Peters in 1964. Importantly, their breakdown becomes evident at the first pericenter passage, implying that the validity of the orbit-averaged approximation cannot be inferred solely from binary initial conditions. The formalism we introduce, accurate up to 2.5 post-Newtonian order, aims to provide a robust tool for making reliable astrophysical predictions and accurately interpreting current and future gravitational wave data, paving the way for deeper insights into the dynamics of eccentric black hole binaries.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Accretion Disks: Turbulence, Mode Excitation and Prospects for Future Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational-wave emission by turbulent flows in accretion disks around spinning black holes or neutron stars. We aim to understand how turbulence can stochastically excite black hole quasinormal ringing and contribute to a stochastic gravitational-wave background from accretion disks around compact objects. We employ general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and feed them as the source of the Teukolsky master equation to evaluate the gravitational wave energy spectrum of a single source. The stochastic gravitational wave background from accretion disks generated by the population of stellar-mass compact objects is far below the sensitivity of third-generation ground-based detectors. In contrast, the supermassive black hole population, in particular those actively accreting, could lead to $\Omega_{\mathrm{GW}}\sim 10^{-15}$ in the microHertz. This signal remains well below the sensitivities of pulsar-timing-arrays and LISA, making direct observation infeasible.</description>

      <title>Building Neutron Stars with the MUSES Calculation Engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the equation of state of dense matter is an essential part of interpreting the observable properties of neutron stars. We present here the first results for dense matter in the zero-temperature limit generated by the MUSES Calculation Engine, a composable workflow management system that orchestrates calculation and data processing stages comprising a collection of software modules designed within the MUSES framework. The modules presented in this work calculate equations of state using algorithms spanning three different theories/models: (1) Crust Density Functional Theory, valid starting at low densities, (2) Chiral Effective Field Theory, valid around saturation density, and (3) the Chiral Mean Field model, valid beyond saturation density. Lepton contributions are added through the Lepton module to each equation of state, ensuring charge neutrality and the possibility of $\beta$-equilibrium. Using the Synthesis module, we match the three equations of state using different thermodynamic variables and different methods. We then couple the complete equation of state to a novel full-general-relativity solver (QLIMR) module that calculates neutron star properties. We find that the matching performed using different thermodynamic variables affects differently the range obtained for neutron star masses and radii (although never beyond a few percent difference). We also investigate the universality of equation of state-independent relations for our matched stars. Finally, for the first time, we use the Flavor Equilibration module to estimate bulk viscosity and flavor relaxation charge fraction and rates (at low temperature) for Chiral Effective Field Theory and the Chiral Mean Field model.</description>

      <title>Impact of accretor size on the morphology of supersonic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast-moving accretors are ubiquitous in astrophysics. Their interaction with surrounding gas leaves characteristic imprints, forming structures like bow shocks, Mach cones, and density trails. We study how various physical processes affect the flow structure around an accretor with a one-way surface, its accretion rate, and accretion anisotropy. These processes correspond to distinct length scales: the Bondi radius, the bow shock's stand-off distance, and the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius. We conducted adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations using a spherical coordinate grid centred on the accretor. By varying the accretor's (numerical) size across scales -- from much smaller than the stand-off distance to much larger than the Bondi radius -- we analyse how these spatial scales affect steady-state flow physics. All simulations reach a steady state. When the accretor is smaller than the stand-off distance, a bow shock forms ahead, and a nearly spherically symmetric atmosphere develops within. Accretors smaller than the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius produce a Mach cone, while larger ones exhibit a supersonic-to-subsonic flow transition on larger scales. Fully resolved simulations align with Hoyle-Lyttleton theory, showing slightly anisotropic accretion with enhanced inflow from behind. In contrast, larger accretors approach the geometrical limit, accreting mainly from the flow direction, with a low-density 'shadow' forming behind. The accretor's size strongly influences small- and large-scale morphologies. Resolving the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius is essential for capturing large-scale flow characteristics. Resolving the stand-off distance is needed only to study the bow shock: since it determines the shock's position, its non-resolution does not affect large-scale flow morphology.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts as cosmological proxies: estimating the Hubble constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most challenging problems in cosmology is the Hubble tension, a discrepancy in the predicted expansion rate of the Universe. We leverage the sensitivity of the Dispersion Measure (DM) from Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with the Hubble factor to investigate the Hubble tension. We build a catalog of 98 localized FRBs and an independent mock catalog and employ 3 methods to calculate the best value of the $H_0$: i) the mean of $H_0$ values obtained through direct calculation, ii) the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and iii) the reconstruction of the cosmic expansion history $H(z)$ using two DM-$z$ relations. When the confirmed FRBs is employed, our predictions are compatible with reports from the Planck+2018, with $H_0=65.13\pm2.52\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ and $57.67\pm11.99\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ for MLE and the arithmetic mean, respectively. If we assume a linear and a power-law function for the DM-$z$ relation, our predictions for $H_0$ are $51.27^{+3.80}_{-3.31}\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ and $77.09^{+8.89}_{-7.64}\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$, respectively. Using 100 mock catalogs of simulated FRBs, we obtain larger values for $H_0$ with all methods considered: $H_{0;\text{ Like}}=67.30\pm0.91\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$, $H_{0;\text{ Mean}}=66.21\pm3.46\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$, $H_{0;\text{ Median}}=66.10\pm1.89\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$, $H_{0;\text{Linear}}=54.34\pm1.57\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ and $H_{0;\text{Power-law}}=91.84\pm1.82\,\text{km/s/Mpc}$ for the MLE, the arithmetic mean, and linear and power-law $\text{DM}-z$ relations, respectively. Our results for mock FRB catalogs increase the statistical precision, ranging from 1.4\% to 5.2\% for the MLE and arithmetic mean. Our result with the MLE applied to synthetic FRBs is at the same level of precision as reports from SH0ES. The increase in the number of confirmed FRBs will provide us, in combination with other observations, a robust prediction of the value of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>GECAM Observations of the Galactic Magnetar SGR J1935+2154 during the 2021 and 2022 Burst Active Episodes. I. Burst Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01010v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetar is a neutron star with an ultrahigh magnetic field ($\sim 10^{14}-10^{15}$ G). The magnetar SGR J1935+2154 is not only one of the most active magnetars detected so far, but also the unique confirmed source of fast radio bursts (FRBs). Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) is dedicated to monitor gamma-ray transients all over the sky, including magnetar short bursts. Here we report the GECAM observations of the burst activity of SGR J1935+2154 from January 2021 to December 2022, which results in a unique and valuable data set for this important magnetar. With a targeted search of GECAM data, 159 bursts from SGR J1935+2154 are detected by GECAM-B while 97 bursts by GECAM-C, including the X-ray burst associated with a bright radio burst. We find that both the burst duration and the waiting time between two successive bursts follow lognormal distributions. The period of burst activity is $134\pm20$ days, thus the burst activity could be generally divided into four active episodes over these two years. Interestingly, the hardness ratio of X-ray bursts tends to be softer during these two years, especially during the active episode with radio bursts detected.</description>

Abstract: This study comprehensively investigates the gamma-ray dim population of Fanaroff-Riley Type 0 (FR0) radio galaxies as potentially significant sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, E $&gt;$ 10$^{18}$ eV) detected on Earth. While individual FR0 luminosities are relatively low compared to the more powerful Fanaroff-Riley Type 1 and Type 2 galaxies, FR0s are substantially more prevalent in the local universe, outnumbering the more energetic galaxies by a factor of $\sim$5 within a redshift of z $\leq$ 0.05.
  Employing CRPropa3 simulations, we estimate the mass composition and energy spectra of UHECRs originating from FR0 galaxies for energies above 10$^{18.6}$ eV. This estimation fits data from the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) using three extensive air shower models; both constant and energy-dependent observed elemental fractions are considered. The simulation integrates an approximately isotropic distribution of FR0 galaxies, extrapolated from observed characteristics, with UHECR propagation in the intergalactic medium, incorporating various plausible configurations of extragalactic magnetic fields, both random and structured. We then compare the resulting emission spectral indices, rigidity cutoffs, and elemental fractions with recent Auger results. In total, 25 combined energy spectrum and mass composition fits are considered.
  Beyond the cosmic ray fluxes emitted by FR0 galaxies, this study predicts the secondary photon and neutrino fluxes from UHECR interactions with intergalactic cosmic photon backgrounds. The multi-messenger approach, encompassing observational data and theoretical models, helps elucidate the contribution of low luminosity FR0 radio galaxies to the total cosmic ray energy density.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh-energy neutrinos as a probe of espresso-shear acceleration in jets of Centaurus A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been suggested that Centaurus A (Cen A) could make a contribution to the observed ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) flux. We calculate the flux of astrophysical neutrinos produced by UHECRs accelerated in the jet of Cen A, a close-by jetted active galactic nucleus. We use a bottom-up approach, in which we follow the energization of protons and heavier elements in a magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a relativistic jet with proper parameters of Cen A, also accounting for attenuation losses based on the observed photon fields. We compare the expected neutrino flux with the sensitivity of current and planned neutrino detectors. We find that the detection of $\sim 10^{17}$-$10^{18}$ eV neutrinos from Cen A would require ultimate neutrino detectors that reach a point source sensitivity of $\sim {\rm a~few}\times10^{-13}~{\rm erg}~{\rm cm}^{-2}~{\rm s}^{-1}$. Successful detection, though challenging, would be useful in constraining the Cen A contribution to the UHECRs.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cosmic Gamma-ray Horizon: The 1CGH Catalogue of Fermi-LAT detections above 10 GeV</title>

Abstract: We present the First Cosmic Gamma-ray Horizon (1CGH) catalogue, featuring $\gamma$-ray detections above 10 GeV based on 16 years of observations with the Fermi-LAT satellite. After carefully selecting a sample of blazars and blazar candidates from catalogues in the literature, we performed a binned likelihood analysis and identified 2791 $\gamma$-ray emitters above 10 GeV, at &gt;3$\sigma$ level, including 62 that are new $\gamma$-ray detections. For each source, we estimated the mean energy of the highest-energy bin and analysed them in the context of the cosmic gamma-ray horizon. By adopting a reference model for the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL), we identified a subsample of 525 sources where moderate to severe $\gamma$-ray absorption could be detected across the redshift range of 0 to 3. This work provides the most up-to-date compilation of detections above 10 GeV, along with their redshift information. We condense extensive results from the literature, including reports on observational campaigns dedicated to blazars and $\gamma$-ray sources, thereby delivering an unprecedented review of the redshift information for sources detected above 10 GeV. Additionally, we highlight key 1CGH sources where redshift information remains incomplete, offering guidance for future optical observation campaigns. The 1CGH catalogue aims to track the most significant sources to study the $\gamma$-ray transparency of the universe. Furthermore, it provides a targeted subsample where the EBL optical depth, $\tau_{(E,z)}$, can be robustly measured using Fermi-LAT data.</description>

      <title>flashcurve: A machine-learning approach for the simple and fast generation of adaptive-binning light curves with Fermi-LAT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gamma rays measured by the Fermi-LAT satellite tell us a lot about the processes taking place in high-energetic astrophysical objects. The fluxes coming from these objects are, however, extremely variable. Hence, gamma-ray light curves optimally use adaptive bin sizes in order to retrieve most information about the source dynamics and to combine gamma-ray observations in a multi-messenger perspective. However, standard adaptive binning approaches are slow, expensive and inaccurate in highly populated regions. Here, we present a novel, powerful, deep-learning-based approach to estimate the necessary time windows for adaptive binning light curves in Fermi-LAT data using raw photon data. The approach is shown to be fast and accurate. It can also be seen as a prototype to train machine-learning models for adaptive binning light curves for other astrophysical messengers.</description>

      <title>Enabling high mass accretion rates onto massive main sequence stars by outer envelope mass removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the one-dimensional numerical code MESA, we simulate mass accretion at very high rates onto massive main sequence stars, M=30, 60, 80 Mo, and find that these stars can accrete up to 10% of their mass without expanding much if we consider a simultaneous mass removal by jets. In this jetted-mass-removal accretion scenario, the accretion is through an accretion disk that launches jets. When the star expands due to rapid mass accretion, it engulfs the inner zones of the accretion disk and the jets it launches. We assume that these jets remove the outer layers of the envelope. We mimic this in the one-dimensional numerical code by alternating mass addition and mass removal parts. We add mass and energy, the accretion energy, to the outer layers of the envelope, leading to rapid stellar expansion. When the star expands by a few tens of percent, we stop mass addition and start mass removal until the star returns to its initial radius. We also show that the density of the accretion disk is larger than the density of the outer layers of the inflated envelope, allowing the disk to launch jets inside the outer inflated envelope layers. Our results show that main sequence stars can accrete mass at high rates while maintaining the deep potential well, as some models of eruptive systems require, e.g., some luminous red novae, the grazing envelope evolution, and the 1837-1856 Great Eruption of Eta Carinae.</description>

      <title>Gaia 19cwm - an eclipsing dwarf nova of WZ Sge type with a magnetic white dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral and photometric studies of the cataclysmic variable Gaia 19cwm (or ZTF19aamkwxk) have been performed. Based on the analysis of long-term variability, it is concluded that the object belongs to WZ Sge type stars. The light curves show eclipses recurring with an orbital period of $86.32048 \pm 0.00005$ min, as well as an out-of-eclipse variability with a period of $\approx 6.45$ min. The latter period is stable for $\sim 4$ years and appears to correspond to the rotation of a magnetic white dwarf, i.e., Gaia 19cwm is an intermediate polar. The Gaia 19cwm spectra show photospheric lines of the white dwarf, and Doppler tomograms demonstrate the presence of an accretion disk and a hot spot. Analysis of the eclipse light curve gives an estimates of the white dwarf mass $M_1 = 0.66\pm0.06$ M$_{\odot}$, the donor mass $M_2 = 0.073 \pm 0.015$ M$_{\odot}$, and the orbital inclination $i=83.8 \pm 1.1^{\circ}$. Modeling of the spectral energy distribution gives the white dwarf temperature of $T_{eff}\approx 13000 $ K. The X-ray luminosity $L_X = (1.6 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{31}$ erg/s allows to assign Gaia 19cwm to a small group of low-luminosity intermediate polars.</description>
