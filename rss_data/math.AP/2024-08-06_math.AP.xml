      <title>Fujita exponent and blow-up rate for a mixed local and nonlocal heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the blow-up problem for a mixed local-nonlocal diffusion operator,
  \[
  u_t=a\Delta u -b(-\Delta)^s u+u^p.
  \]
  We show that the Fujita exponent is given by the nonlocal part, $p_F=1+2s/N$. We also determinate, in some cases, the blow-up rate.</description>

      <title>Standing waves with prescribed mass for Schrodinger equations with competing Van Der Waals type potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate standing waves with prescribed mass for a class of Schrodinger equations with competing Van Der Waals type potentials, arising in a model of non-relativistic bosonic atoms and molecules. By developing an approach based on a direct minimization of the energy functional on a new constrained manifold, we establish the existence of two normalized solutions for the corresponding stationary problem. One is a local minimizer with positive level and the other one is a global minimizer with negative level. Moreover, we find that the global minimizer is farther away from the origin than the local minimizer. Finally, we explore the relations between the ground state solution and the least action solution, and some dynamical behavior and scattering results are presented as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cahn--Hilliard/Navier--Stokes system with non-degenerate mobility in the space-periodic case, describing the flow of two viscous immiscible and incompressible Newtonian fluids with matched densities. We identify sufficient conditions on the velocity field for weak solutions to satisfy an energy identity, improving previous results on the literature.</description>

      <title>On a fractional harmonic oscillator: existence and inexistence of solution, regularity and decay properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under simple hypotheses on the nonlinearity $f$, we consider the fractional harmonic operator problem \begin{equation}\label{abstr}\sqrt{-\Delta+|x|^2}\,u=f(x,u)\ \ \textrm{in }\ \mathbb{R}^N\end{equation} or, since we work in the extension setting $\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+$, $$\left\{\begin{aligned} -\Delta v +|x|^2v&amp;=0, &amp;&amp;\mbox{in} \ \mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+,\\ -\displaystyle\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}(x,0)&amp;=f(x,v(x,0)) &amp;&amp;\mbox{on} \ \mathbb{R}^{N}\cong\partial \mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+.\end{aligned}\right.$$ Defining the space $$\mathcal{H}(\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+)=\left\{v\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+): \iint_{\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+}\left[|\nabla v|^2+|x|^2v^2\right]dx dy&lt;\infty\right\},$$ we prove that the embedding $$\mathcal{H}(\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+)\hookrightarrow L^{q}(\mathbb{R}^N)$$ is compact. We also obtain a Pohozaev-type identity for this problem, show that in the case $f(x,u)=|u|^{p^*-2}u$ the problem has no non-trivial solution, compare the extremal attached to this problem with the one of the space $H^1(\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+)$, prove that the solution $u$ of our problem belongs to $L^p(\mathbb{R}^N)$ for all $p\in [2,\infty]$ and satisfy the polynomial decay $|u(x)|\leq C/|x|$ for any $|x|&gt;M$. Finally, we prove the existence of a solution to a superlinear critical problem in the case $f(x,u)=|u|^{2^*-2}u+\lambda |u|^{q-1}$, $1&lt;q&lt;2^*-1$.</description>

      <title>Existence and symmetry breaking of vectorial ground states for Hartree-Fock type systems with potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Hartree-Fock type system as follows: \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} -\Delta u+V\left( x\right) u+\rho \left( x\right) \phi _{\rho ,\left(u,v\right) }u=\left\vert u\right\vert ^{p-2}u+\beta \left\vert v\right\vert^{\frac{p}{2}}\left\vert u\right\vert ^{\frac{p}{2}-2}u &amp; \text{ in }\mathbb{R}^{3}, \\ -\Delta v+V\left( x\right) v+\rho \left( x\right) \phi _{\rho ,\left( u,v\right) }v=\left\vert v\right\vert ^{p-2}v+\beta \left\vert u\right\vert ^{\frac{p}{2}}\left\vert v\right\vert ^{\frac{p}{2}-2}v &amp; \text{ in }\mathbb{R}^{3}, \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $\phi _{\rho ,\left( u,v\right) }=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}}\frac{\rho \left( y\right) \left( u^{2}(y)+v^{2}\left( y\right) \right) }{|x-y|}dy,$ the potentials $V(x),\rho (x)$ are positive continuous functions in $\mathbb{R}^{3},$ the parameter $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$ and $2&lt;p&lt;4$. Such system is viewed as an approximation of the Coulomb system with two particles appeared in quantum mechanics, whose main characteristic is the presence of the double coupled terms. When $2&lt;p&lt;3,$ under suitable assumptions on potentials, we shed some light on the behavior of the corresponding energy functional on $H^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{3})\times H^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{3}),$ and prove the existence of a global minimizer with negative energy. When $3\leq p&lt;4,$ we find vectorial ground states by developing a new analytic method and exploring the conditions on potentials. Finally, we study the phenomenon of symmetry breaking of ground states when $2&lt;p&lt;3.$</description>

      <title>Restriction of Schr\"odinger eigenfunctions to submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Burq-G\'erard-Tzvetkov and Hu established $L^p$ estimates for the restriction of Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions to submanifolds. We investigate the eigenfunctions of the Schr\"odinger operators with critically singular potentials, and estimate the $L^p$ norms and period integrals for their restriction to submanifolds. Recently, Blair-Sire-Sogge obtained global $L^p$ bounds for Schr\"odinger eigenfunctions by the resolvent method. Due to the Sobolev trace inequalities, the resolvent method cannot work for submanifolds of all dimensions. We get around this difficulty and establish spectral projection bounds by the wave kernel techniques and the bootstrap argument involving an induction on the dimensions of the submanifolds.</description>

      <title>Global strong solvability of the Navier-Stokes equations in exterior domains for rough initial data in critical spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the Navier-Stokes equations have unique global strong solutions for standard domains when initial data are small in $L^n_\sigma$. Global well-posedness has been extended to rough initial data in larger critical spaces. This paper explores the global strong solvability of the smooth exterior domain problem for initial data that is small in some critical spaces larger than $L^n_\sigma$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using the well-known mountain pass theorem and Ekeland's variational principle, we prove that there exist at least two fully-non-trivial solutions for a $(p,q)$-Kirchhoff elliptic system with the Dirichlet boundary conditions and perturbation terms on a locally weighted and connected finite graph $G=(V,E)$.We also present a necessary condition of the existence of semi-trivial solutions for the system. Moreover, by using Ekeland's variational principle and Clark's Theorem, respectively, we prove that the system has at least one or multiple semi-trivial solutions when the perturbation terms satisfy different assumptions. Finally, we present a nonexistence result of solutions.</description>

      <title>Clearing-out of dipoles for minimisers of 2-dimensional discrete energies with topological singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key question in the analysis of discrete models for material defects, such as vortices in spin systems and superconductors or isolated dislocations in metals, is whether information on boundary energy for a domain can be sufficient for controlling the number of defects in the interior. We present a general combinatorial dipole-removal argument for a large class of discrete models including XY systems and screw dislocation models, allowing to prove sharp conditions under which controlled flux and boundary energy guarantee to have minimizers with zero or one charges in the interior. The argument uses the max-flow min-cut theorem in combination with an ad-hoc duality for planar graphs, and is robust with respect to changes of the function defining the interaction energies.</description>

      <title>Path-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equations with u-dependence and time-measurable Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish existence and uniqueness of minimax solutions for a fairly general class of path-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equations. In particular, the relevant Hamiltonians can contain the solution and they only need to be measurable with respect to time. We apply our results to optimal control problems of (delay) functional differential equations with cost functionals that have discount factors and with time-measurable data. Our main results are also crucial for our companion paper Bandini and Keller (2024), where non-local path-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations associated to the stochastic optimal control of non-Markovian piecewise deterministic processes are studied.</description>

      <title>On Landis conjecture for positive Schr\"odinger operators on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we study Landis conjecture for positive Schr\"odinger operators on graphs. More precisely, we give a decay criterion that ensures when $ \mathcal{H} $-harmonic functions for a positive Schr\"odinger operator $ \mathcal{H} $ with potentials bounded from above by $ 1 $ are trivial. We then specifically look at the special cases of $ \mathbb{Z}^{d} $ and regular trees for which we get explicit decay criterion. Moreover, we consider the fractional analogue of Landis conjecture on $ \mathbb{Z}^{d} $. Our approach relies on the discrete version of Liouville comparison principle which is also proved in this article.</description>

      <title>A note on spatially inhomogeneous Cahn-Hilliard energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, Cristoferi, Fonseca and Ganedi proved that Cahn-Hilliard type energies with spatially inhomogeneous potentials converge to the usual (isotropic and homogeneous) perimeter functional if the length-scale $\delta$ of spatial inhomogeneity in the double-well potential is small compared to the length-scale $\varepsilon$ of phase transitions. We give a simple new proof under a slightly stronger assumption on the regularity of $W$ with respect to the phase parameter. The simplicity of the proof allows us to easily find multiple generalizations in other directions, including stochastic potentials and potentials which may become zero outside the wells ('voids'). The theoretical results are complemented by numerical experiments.
  Our main message is that, across a wide variety of settings, nothing that looks sufficiently homogeneous at the transition length scale between phases, affects the limiting behavior in the slightest. The notable exception is the setting of potentials with spatially varying potential wells, where a stronger scale separation $\delta \ll \varepsilon^{3/2}$ is needed. Based on the analysis, we further provide a modified Modica-Mortola type energy which does not require such a scale separation.
  The theoretical analysis is complemented by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>3D hard sphere Boltzmann equation: explicit structure and the transition process from polynomial tail to Gaussian tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Boltzmann equation with hard sphere in a near-equilibrium setting. The initial data is compactly supported in the space variable and has a polynomial tail in the microscopic velocity. We show that the solution can be decomposed into a particle-like part (polynomial tail) and a fluid-like part (Gaussian tail). The particle-like part decays exponentially in both space and time, while the fluid-like part corresponds to the behavior of the compressible Navier-Stokes equation, which dominates the long time behavior and exhibits rich wave motion. The nonlinear wave interactions in the fluid-like part are precisely characterized and therefore we are able to distinguish the linear and nonlinear wave of the solution. It is notable that although the solution has polynomial tail in the velocity initially, the transition process from the polynomial to the Gaussian tail can be quantitatively revealed due to the collision with the background global Maxwellian.</description>

      <title>Existence, Stability and Optimal Drug Dosage for a Reaction-Diffusion System Arising in a Cancer Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a reaction-diffusion system modeling injection of a chemotherapeutic drug on the surface of a living tissue during a treatment for cancer patients is studied. The system describes the interaction of the chemotherapeutic drug and the normal, tumor and immune cells. We first establish well-posedness for the nonlinear reaction-diffusion system, then investigate the long-time behavior of solutions. Particularly, it is shown that the cancer cells will be eliminated assuming that its reproduction rate is sufficiently small in a short time period in each treatment interval. The analysis is then essentially exploited to study an optimal drug injection rate problem during a chemotherapeutic drug treatment for tumor cells, which is formulated as an optimal boundary control problem with constraints. For this, we show that the existence of an optimal drug injection rate through the boundary, and derive the first-order optimality condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the free boundary problem for a 3-dimensional, incompressible, irrotational liquid drop of nearly spherical shape with capillarity. We study the problem from scratch, extending some classical results from the flat case (capillary water waves) to the spherical geometry: the reduction to a problem on the boundary, its Hamiltonian structure, the analyticity and tame estimates for the Dirichlet-Neumann operator in Sobolev class, and a linearization formula for it, both with the method of the good unknown of Alinhac and by a differential geometry approach. Then we prove the bifurcation of traveling waves, which are nontrivial (i.e., nonspherical) fixed profiles rotating with constant angular velocity.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal particle approximation for linear and fast diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct deterministic particle solutions for linear and fast diffusion equations using a nonlocal approximation. We exploit the $2$-Wasserstein gradient flow structure of the equations in order to obtain the nonlocal approximating PDEs by regularising the corresponding internal energy with suitably chosen mollifying kernels, either compactly or globally supported. Weak solutions are obtained by the JKO scheme. From the technical point of view, we improve known commutator estimates, fundamental in the nonlocal-to-local limit, to include globally supported kernels which, in particular cases, allow us to justify the limit without any further perturbation needed. Furthermore, we prove geodesic convexity of the nonlocal energies in order to prove convergence of the particle solutions to the nonlocal equations towards weak solutions of the local equations. We overcome the crucial difficulty of dealing with the singularity of the first variation of the free energies at the origin. As a byproduct, we provide convergence rates expressed as a scaling relationship between the number of particles and the localisation parameter. The analysis we perform leverages the fact that globally supported kernels yield a better convergence rate compared to compactly supported kernels. Our result is relevant in statistics, more precisely in sampling Gibbs and heavy-tailed distributions.</description>

Abstract: A novel continuum model has been developed to address the vehicle size heterogeneity in mixed traffic. By incorporating the principle of vehicle area conservation, a new set of traffic flow variables centered on the concept of vehicle area has been introduced. These variables, namely areal flow and areal density, exhibit the remarkable characteristic of being conserved across time and space and seamlessly related to the traditional space mean speed. Next, the study successfully established a bi-variate relationship among these newly introduced area-based traffic variables based on empirical data from three locations for stream and mode-specific. It is shown that the conventional solution methods for the hyperbolic conservation laws remain applicable to the proposed continuum model. Finally, a multi-class cell transmission model numerical scheme is developed and used to illustrate the performance of the proposed model in replicating the seepage and platoon dispersion behavior in mixed traffic conditions.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet problem on perturbed conical domains via converging generalized power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Poisson equation with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions in a family of domains in $R^{n}$ indexed by a small parameter $\epsilon$. The domains depend on $\epsilon$ only within a ball of radius proportional to $\epsilon$ and, as $\epsilon$ tends to zero, they converge in a self-similar way to a domain with a conical boundary singularity. We construct an expansion of the solution as a series of fractional powers of $\epsilon$, and prove that it is not just an asymptotic expansion as $\epsilon\to0$, but that, for small values of $\epsilon$, it converges normally in the Sobolev space $H^{1}$. The phenomenon that solutions to boundary value problems on singularly perturbed domains may have convergent expansions is the subject of the Functional Analytic Approach by Lanza de Cristoforis and his collaborators. This approach was originally adopted to study small holes shrinking to interior points of a smooth domain and heavily relies on integral representations obtained through layer potentials. To relax all regularity assumptions, we forgo boundary layer potentials and instead exploit expansions in terms of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the intersection of the cone with the unit sphere. Our analysis is based on a two-scale cross-cutoff ansatz for the solution. Specifically, we write the solution as a sum of a function in the slow variable multiplied by a cutoff function depending on the fast variable, plus a function in the fast variable multiplied by a cutoff function depending on the slow variable. While the cutoffs are considered fixed, the two unknown functions are solutions to a $2\times2$ system of partial differential equations that depend on $\epsilon$ in a way that can be analyzed in the framework of generalized power series when the right-hand side of the Poisson equation vanishes in a neighborhood of the perturbation.</description>

      <title>On multidimensional nonlocal conservation laws with BV kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish local-in-time existence and uniqueness results for nonlocal conservation laws in several space dimensions under weak (that is, Sobolev or BV) differentiability assumptions on the convolution kernel. In contrast to the case of a smooth kernel, in general the solution experiences finite-time blow-up. We provide an explicit example showing that solutions corresponding to different smooth approximations of the convolution kernel in general converge to different measures after the blow-up time. This rules out a fairly natural strategy for extending the notion of solution of the nonlocal conservation law after the blow-up time.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the growth-coagulation equation with singular kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-posedness of the growth-coagulation equation is established for coagulation kernels having singularity near the origin and growing atmost linearly at infinity. The existence of weak solutions is shown by means of the method of the characteristics and a weak $L_1$-compactness argument. For the existence result, we also show our gratitude to Banach fixed point theorem and a refined version of the Arzel\'{a}-Ascoli theorem. In addition, the continuous dependence of solutions upon the initial data is shown with the help of the DiPerna-Lions theory, Gronwall's inequality and moment estimates. Moreover, the uniqueness of solution follows from the continuous dependence. The results presented in this article extend the contributions made in earlier literature.</description>

      <title>Eternal solutions to a porous medium equation with strong nonhomogeneous absorption. Part II: Dead-core profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existence of a specific family of \emph{eternal solutions} in exponential self-similar form is proved for the following porous medium equation with strong absorption $$\partial_t u-\Delta u^m+|x|^{\sigma}u^q = 0 \;\;\text{ in }\;\; (0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^N,$$ with $m&gt;1$, $q\in(0,1)$ and $\sigma=2(1-q)/(m-1)$. Looking for solutions of the form $$ u(t,x)=e^{-\alpha t}f(|x|e^{\beta t}), \qquad \alpha=\frac{2}{m-1}\beta,$$ it is shown that, for $m+q&gt;2$, there exists a unique exponent $\beta_*\in(0,\infty)$ for which there exists a one-parameter family of compactly supported profiles presenting a \emph{dead core}. The precise behavior of the solutions at their interface is also determined. Moreover, these solutions show the optimal limitations for the finite time extinction property of genuine non-negative solutions to the Cauchy problem, studied in previous works.</description>

Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Voltage-Conductance kinetic equation arising in neuroscience. We establish the existence of solutions in a weighted $L^\infty$ framework in a weak interaction regime. We also prove the linear asymptotic exponential  stability of the steady state making constructive a recent estimate of Xu'an Dou et al. (2023). Both results are based in a fundamental way on some ultracontractivity property of theflow associated to the  linear (possibly time dependent) Voltage-Conductance kinetic equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the setting of a locally compact, non-complete metric measure space $(Z,d,\nu)$ equipped with a doubling measure $\nu$, under the condition that the boundary $\partial Z:=\overline{Z}\setminus Z$ (obtained by considering the completion of $Z$) supports a Radon measure $\pi$ which is in a $\sigma$-codimensional relationship to $\nu$ for some $\sigma&gt;0$. We explore existence, uniqueness, comparison property, and stability properties of solutions to inhomogeneous Dirichlet problems associated with certain nonlinear nonlocal operators on $Z$. We also establish interior regularity of solutions when the inhomogeneity data is in an $L^q$-class for sufficiently large $q&gt;1$, and verify a Kellogg-type property when the inhomogeneity data vanishes and the Dirichlet data is continuous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper continues the analysis of Schr\"odinger type equations with distributional coefficients initiated by the authors in [3]. Here we consider coefficients that are tempered distributions with respect to the space variable and are continuous in time. We prove that the corresponding Cauchy problem, which in general cannot even be stated in the standard distributional setting, admits a Schwartz very weak solution which is unique modulo negligible perturbations. Consistency with the classical theory is proved in the case of regular coefficients and Schwartz Cauchy data.</description>

      <title>On the Infinite-Nudging Limit of the Nudging Filter for Continuous Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies the intimate relationship between two filtering algorithms for continuous data assimilation, the synchronization filter and the nudging filter, in the paradigmatic context of the two-dimensional (2D) Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) for incompressible fluids. In this setting, the nudging filter can formally be viewed as an affine perturbation of the 2D NSE. Thus, in the degenerate limit of zero nudging parameter, the nudging filter converges to the solution of the 2D NSE. However, when the nudging parameter of the nudging filter is large, the perturbation becomes singular. It is shown that in the singular limit of infinite nudging parameter, the nudging filter converges to the synchronization filter. In establishing this result, the article fills a notable gap in the literature surrounding these algorithms. Numerical experiments are then presented that confirm the theoretical results and probes the issue of selecting a nudging strategy in the presence of observational noise. In this direction, an adaptive nudging strategy is proposed that leverages the insight gained from the relationship between the synchronization filter and the nudging filter that produces measurable improvement over the constant nudging strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an opinion model consisting of a large group of interacting agents, whose opinions are represented as numbers in $[-1,1]$. At each update time, two random agents are selected, and the opinion of the first agent is updated based on the opinion of the second (the ``persuader''). We derive the mean-field kinetic equation describing the large population limit of the model, and we provide several quantitative results establishing convergence to the unique equilibrium distribution. Surprisingly, in some range of the model parameters, the support of the equilibrium distribution exhibits a fractal structure. This provides a new mathematical description for the so-called opinion fragmentation phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the linear heat equation with a Wentzell-type boundary condition and a Dirichlet control. Such a boundary condition can be reformulated as one of dynamic type. First, we formulate the boundary controllability problem of the system within the framework of boundary control systems, proving its well-posedness. Then we reduce the question to a moment problem. Using the spectral analysis of the associated Sturm-Liouville problem and the moment method, we establish the null controllability of the system at any positive time $T$. Finally, we approximate minimum energy controls by a penalized HUM approach. This allows us to validate the theoretical controllability results obtained by the moment method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to explore whether a novel type of fractional space can be defined using Orlicz spaces and fractional calculus. This inquiry is fruitful, as extending classical results to new contexts can lead to a better and deeper understanding of those classical results. Our main objective is to introduce a new fractional Caputo-derivative Orlicz space, denoted by $\mathcal{O}^{\alpha,G}(\Lambda, \mathbb{R}) $. We are interested in several qualitative properties of this space, such as reflexivity, completeness, and separability. Additionally, we establish a continuous embedding results of this space into a suitable Orlicz space and the space of continuous functions. As an application, we use the mountain-pass theorem (MPT) to ensure the existence of a nontrivial weak solution for a new class of fractional-type problems in Orlicz space.</description>

      <title>Linear Stability of Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter spacetimes I: The system of gravitational perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the main paper of a series establishing the linear stability of Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes to gravitational perturbations. Specifically, we prove that solutions to the linearisation of the Einstein equations $\textrm{Ric}(g) = \Lambda g$ with $\Lambda&lt;0$ around a Schwarzschild-AdS metric arising from regular initial data and with standard Dirichlet-type boundary conditions imposed at the conformal boundary (inherited from fixing the conformal class of the non-linear metric) remain globally uniformly bounded on the black hole exterior and in fact decay inverse logarithmically in time to a linearised Kerr-AdS metric. The proof exploits a hierarchical structure of the equations of linearised gravity in double null gauge and crucially relies on boundedness and logarithmic decay results for the Teukolsky system, which are independent results proven in Part II of the series. Contrary to the asymptotically flat case, addition of a residual pure gauge solution to the original solution is not required to prove decay of all linearised null curvature and Ricci coefficients. One may however normalise the solution at the conformal boundary to be in standard AdS-form by adding such a pure gauge solution, which is constructed dynamically from the trace of the original solution at the conformal boundary and quantitatively controlled by initial data.</description>

Abstract: We prove boundedness and inverse logarithmic decay in time of solutions to the Teukolsky equations on Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter backgrounds with standard boundary conditions originating from fixing the conformal class of the non-linear metric on the boundary. The proofs rely on (1) a physical space transformation theory between the Teukolsky equations and the Regge-Wheeler equations on Schwarzschild-Anti de Sitter backgrounds and (2) novel energy and Carleman estimates handling the coupling of the two Teukolsky equations through the boundary conditions thereby generalising earlier work of \cite{Hol.Smu13} for the covariant wave equation. Specifically, we also produce purely physical space Carleman estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we derive partial differential equations (PDEs) for pricing interest rate derivatives under the generalized Forward Market Model (FMM) recently presented by A. Lyashenko and F. Mercurio in \cite{lyashenkoMercurio:Mar2019} to model the dynamics of the Risk Free Rates (RFRs) that are replacing the traditional IBOR rates in the financial industry. Moreover, for the numerical solution of the proposed PDEs formulation, we develop some adaptations of the finite differences methods developed in \cite{LopezPerezVazquez:sisc} that are very suitable to treat the presence of spatial mixed derivatives. This work is the first article in the literature where PDE methods are used to value RFR derivatives. Additionally, Monte Carlo-based methods will be designed and the results are compared with those obtained by the numerical solution of PDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first part we analyze space $\mathcal G^*(\mathbb R^{n}_+)$ and its dual through Laguerre expansions when these spaces correspond to a general sequence $\{M_p\}_{p\in\mathbb N_0}$, where $^*$ is a common notation for the Beurling and Roumieu cases of spaces. In the second part we are solving equation of the form $Lu=f,\; L=\sum_{j=1}^ka_jA_j^{h_j}+cE^{d}_y+bP(x,D_x),$ where $f$ belongs to the tensor product of ultradistribution spaces over compact manifolds without boundaries as well as ultradistribution spaces on $\mathbb R^n_+$ and $\mathbb R^m$; $A_j, j=1,...,k$, $E_y$ and $P(x,D_x)$ are operators whose eigenfunctions form orthonormal basis of corresponding $L^2-$space. The sequence space representation of solutions enable us to study the solvability and the hypoellipticity in the specified spaces of ultradistributions.</description>

      <title>On Probabilistic Embeddings in Optimal Dimension Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimension reduction algorithms are a crucial part of many data science pipelines, including data exploration, feature creation and selection, and denoising. Despite their wide utilization, many non-linear dimension reduction algorithms are poorly understood from a theoretical perspective. In this work we consider a generalized version of multidimensional scaling, which is posed as an optimization problem in which a mapping from a high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional embedding space seeks to preserve either inner products or norms of the distribution in feature space, and which encompasses many commonly used dimension reduction algorithms. We analytically investigate the variational properties of this problem, leading to the following insights: 1) Solutions found using standard particle descent methods may lead to non-deterministic embeddings, 2) A relaxed or probabilistic formulation of the problem admits solutions with easily interpretable necessary conditions, 3) The globally optimal solutions to the relaxed problem actually must give a deterministic embedding. This progression of results mirrors the classical development of optimal transportation, and in a case relating to the Gromov-Wasserstein distance actually gives explicit insight into the structure of the optimal embeddings, which are parametrically determined and discontinuous. Finally, we illustrate that a standard computational implementation of this task does not learn deterministic embeddings, which means that it learns sub-optimal mappings, and that the embeddings learned in that context have highly misleading clustering structure, underscoring the delicate nature of solving this problem computationally.</description>

      <title>Stability of the expanding region of Kerr de Sitter spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the nonlinear stability of the cosmological region of Kerr de Sitter spacetimes. More precisely, we show that solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations with positive cosmological constant arising from data on a cylinder that is uniformly close to the Kerr de Sitter geometry (with possibly different mass and angular momentum parameters at either end) are future geodesically complete and display asymptotically de Sitter-like degrees of freedom. The proof uses an ADM formulation of the Einstein equations in parabolic gauge. Together with a well-known theorem of Hintz-Vasy [Acta Math. 220 (2018)], our result yields a global stability result for Kerr de Sitter from Cauchy data on a spacelike hypersurface bridging two black hole exteriors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03432v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the global existence of weak solutions of non-Newtonian incompressible fluids governed by (1.1). When $u_0 \in \dot B^{\alpha-\frac{2}{p}}_{p,q}({\mathbb R}^{n}_+) \, \cap \,\dot B^{ 1 -\frac4{n+2}}_{\frac{n+2}2,\frac{n+2}2}({\mathbb R}^{n}_+) \,\cap \, \dot B^{1 +\frac{n}p}_{p,1} (\mathbb{R}_+)$ is given, we will find the weak solutions for the equation (1.1) in the function space $C_b ([ 0, \infty; \dot B^{\alpha -\frac2p}_{p,q} ({\mathbb R}^n_+)) \cap C_b (0, \infty; \dot B^{1 -\frac4{n+2}}_{\frac{n+2}2} (\mathbb{R}_+)) \cap L^\infty(0, \infty; \dot W^1_\infty(\mathbb{R}_+))$, $ n+2 &lt; p &lt; \infty, \,\, 1 \leq q \leq \infty, \,\, 1 + \frac{n+2}p &lt; \alpha &lt; 2$. We show the existence of weak solutions in the anisotropic Besov spaces $\dot B^{\alpha, \frac{\alpha}2}_{p,q} (\mathbb{R}_+ \times (0, \infty))$ (see Theorem (1.2)) and we show the embedding $\dot B^{\alpha, \frac{\alpha}2}_{p,q} (\mathbb{R}_+ \times (0, \infty) \subset C_b ([ 0, \infty; \dot B^{\alpha -\frac2p}_{p,q} ({\mathbb R}^n_+))$ (see Lemma (2.8)).
  For the global existence of solutions, we assume that the extra stress tensor $S$ is represented by $S({\mathbb A}) = {\mathbb F} ( {\mathbb A}) {\mathbb A}$, where ${\mathbb F}(0) $ is a uniformly elliptic matrix and $ {\mathbb F} \in C^2(B(0,1))$, where $B(0,1)$ is open ball in ${\mathbb R}^{n\times n}$ whose center is origin and radius. is $1$. Note that $S_1$, $S_2$ and $S_3$ introduced in (1.2) satisfy our assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the solvability of singular Abreu equations which arise in the approximation of convex functionals subject to a convexity constraint. Previous works established the solvability of their second boundary value problems either in two dimensions, or in higher dimensions under either a smallness condition or a radial symmetry condition. Here, we solve the higher dimensional case by transforming singular Abreu equations into linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equations with drifts. We establish global H\"older estimates for the linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equation with drifts under suitable hypotheses, and then use them to the regularity and solvability of the second boundary value problem for singular Abreu equations in higher dimensions. Many cases with general right-hand side will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>The Hardy inequality and large time behaviour of the heat equation on $\mathbb{R}^{N-k}\times (0,\infty)^k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the large time asymptotic behaviour of the heat equation with Hardy inverse-square potential on corner spaces $\mathbb{R}^{N-k}\times (0,\infty)^k$, $k\geq 0$. We first show a new improved Hardy-Poincar\'{e} inequality for the quantum harmonic oscillator with Hardy potential. In view of that, we construct the appropriate functional setting in order to pose the Cauchy problem. Then we obtain optimal polynomial large time decay rates and subsequently the first term in the asymptotic expansion of the solutions in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^{N-k}\times (0,\infty)^k)$. Particularly, we extend and improve the results obtained by V\'{a}zquez and Zuazua (J. Funct. Anal. 2000), which correspond to the case $k=0$, to any $k\geq 0$. We emphasize that the higher the value of $k$ the better time decay rates are. We employ a different and simplified approach than V\'{a}zquez and Zuazua, managing to remove the usage of spherical harmonics decomposition in our analysis.</description>

Abstract: Mass-conserving reaction-diffusion systems with bistable nonlinearity are useful models for studying cell polarity formation, which is a key process in cell division and differentiation. We rigorously show the existence and stability of stationary solutions with a single internal transition layer in such reaction-diffusion systems under general assumptions by the singular perturbation theory. Moreover, we present a meaningful model for understanding the existence of an unstable transition layer solution; our numerical simulations show that the unstable solution is a separatrix of the dynamics of the model.</description>

      <title>BMO estimates for Hodge-Maxwell systems with discontinuous anisotropic coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove up to the boundary $\mathrm{BMO}$ estimates for linear Maxwell-Hodge type systems for $\mathbb{R}^{N}$-valued differential $k$-forms $u$ in $n$ dimensions
  \begin{align*}
  \left\lbrace \begin{aligned}
  d^\ast \left( A(x) du \right) &amp;= f &amp;&amp;\text{ in } \Omega,
  d^\ast \left( B(x) u\right) &amp;= g &amp;&amp;\text{ in } \Omega,
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
  \end{align*}
  with $ \nu\wedge u$ prescribed on $\partial\Omega,$ where the coefficient tensors $A,B$ are only required to be bounded measurable and in a class of `small multipliers of BMO'. This class neither contains nor is contained in $C^{0}.$ Since the coefficients are allowed to be discontinuous, the usual Korn's freezing trick can not be applied. As an application, we show BMO estimates hold for the time-harmonic Maxwell system in dimension three for a class of discontinuous anisotropic permeability and permittivity tensors. The regularity assumption on the coefficient is essentially sharp.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the following nonlocal Dirichlet equation of double phase type
  \begin{align*}
  -\psi \left [ \int_\Omega \left ( \frac{|\nabla u |^p}{p} + \mu(x) \frac{|\nabla u|^q}{q}\right)\,\mathrm{d} x\right] \mathcal{G}(u) = f(x,u)\quad \text{in } \Omega, \quad u = 0\quad \text{on } \partial\Omega,
  \end{align*}
  where $\mathcal{G}$ is the double phase operator given by
  \begin{align*}
  \mathcal{G}(u)=\operatorname{div} \left(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u + \mu(x) |\nabla u|^{q-2}\nabla u \right)\quad u\in W^{1,\mathcal{H}}_0(\Omega),
  \end{align*}
  $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^N$, $N\geq 2$, is a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary $\partial\Omega$, $1&lt;p&lt;N$, $p&lt;q&lt;p^*=\frac{Np}{N-p}$, $0 \leq \mu(\cdot)\in L^\infty(\Omega)$, $\psi(s) = a_0 + b_0 s^{\vartheta-1}$ for $s\in\mathbb{R}$, with $a_0 \geq 0$, $b_0&gt;0$ and $\vartheta \geq 1$, and $f\colon\Omega\times\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is a Carath\'{e}odory function that grows superlinearly and subcritically. We prove the existence of two constant sign solutions (one is positive, the other one negative) and of a sign-changing solution which turns out to be a least energy sign-changing solution of the problem above. Our proofs are based on variational tools in combination with the quantitative deformation lemma and the Poincar\'{e}-Miranda existence theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the self-adjointness of the two dimensional Dirac operator with infinite mass boundary conditions on an unbounded domain with an infinite number of corners. We prove that if the domain has no concave corners, then the operator is self-adjoint. On the other hand, when concave corners are present, the operator is no longer self-adjoint and self-adjoint extensions can be constructed. Among these, we characterize the distinguished extension as the unique one whose domain is included in the Sobolev space $H^{s}$, where $s&gt;1/2$ depends on the amplitude of the corners. Lastly, we study the spectrum of this distinguished self-adjoint extension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of NLS with cubic interactions arising in nonlinear optics without Galilean symmetry. The absence of Galilean symmetry can lead to many difficulties, such as global existence and blowup problems; see [Comm. Partial Differential Equations 46, 11 (2021), 2134-2170]. In this paper, we mainly focus on the influence of the absence of this symmetry on the traveling waves of the NLS system. Firstly, we obtain the existence of traveling solitary wave solutions that are non-radial and complex-valued. Secondly, using the asymptotic analysis method, when the frequency is sufficiently large, we establish the high frequency limit of the traveling solitary wave solution. Finally, for the mass critical case, we provide a novel condition for the existence of global solutions which is significantly different from the classical. In particular, this new condition breaks the traditional optimal assumption about initial data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analytic non-iterative approach for recovering a planar isotropic elastic inclusion embedded in an unbounded medium from the elastic moment tensors (EMTs), which are coefficients for the multipole expansion of field perturbation caused by the inclusion. EMTs contain information about the inclusion's material and geometric properties and, as is well known, the inclusion can be approximated by a disk from leading-order EMTs. We define the complex contracted EMTs as the linear combinations of EMTs where the expansion coefficients are given from complex-valued background polynomial solutions. By using the layer potential technique for the Lam\'{e} system and the theory of conformal mapping, we derive explicit asymptotic formulas in terms of the complex contracted EMTs for the shape of the inclusion, treating the inclusion as a perturbed disk. These formulas lead us to an analytic non-iterative algorithm for elastic inclusion reconstruction using EMTs. We perform numerical experiments to demonstrate the validity and limitations of our proposed method.</description>

Abstract: Nowadays a great attention has been focused on the discrete fractional Laplace operator as the natural counterpart of the continuous one. In this paper, we discretize the fractional Laplace operator $(-\Delta)^{s}$ for an arbitrary finite graph and any positive real number $s$. It is shown that $(-\Delta)^{s}$ can be explicitly represented by eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator $-\Delta$. Moreover, we study its important properties, such as $(-\Delta)^{s}$ converges to $-\Delta$ as $s$ tends to $1$; while $(-\Delta)^{s}$ converges to the identity map as $s$ tends to $0$ on a specific function space. For related problems involving the fractional Laplace operator, we consider the fractional Kazdan-Warner equation and obtain several existence results via variational principles and the method of upper and lower solutions.</description>

Abstract: Recently, a great attention has been focused on the study of fractional and nonlocal operators of elliptic type, both for the pure mathematical research and in view of concrete real-world applications. We consider the following nonlocal problem on $\mathbb{H}_0^s(\Omega) \subset L^{q_s}(\Omega)$, with $q_s :=\frac{2n}{n-2s}$, $s\in ]0, 1[$ and $n\geq 3$ \begin{equation} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n}p(x) \bigg(\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^2}{|x-y|^{n+2s}}dy\bigg)dx-\lambda \int_\Omega |u(x)|^q dx, \qquad (1.1) \end{equation} where $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^n, p :\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a given positive weight presenting a global minimum $p_0 &gt;0$ at $a \in \Omega$ and $\lambda$ is a real constant. In this work we show that for $q=2$ the infimum of (1.1) over the set $\{u\in \mathbb{H}_0^s(\Omega), ||u||_{L^{q_s}(\Omega)}=1\}$ does exist for some $k, s, \lambda$ and $n$ and for $q\geq 2$ we study non-ground state solutions using the mountain pass Theorem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence and spectral stability of periodic traveling wave solutions for the regularized Camassa-Holm equation. For the existence of periodic waves, we employ tools from bifurcation theory to construct waves with the zero mean property and prove that waves with the same property may not exist for the well known Camassa-Holm equation. Regarding the spectral stability, we analyze the difference between the number of negative eigenvalues of a convenient linear operator, restricted to the space constituted by zero-mean periodic functions, and the number of negative eigenvalues of the matrix formed by the tangent space associated with the low-order conserved quantities of the evolution model. We also discuss the problem of orbital stability in the energy space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, exact solutions are derived for an integer- and fractional-order time-delayed diffusion equation with arbitrary initial conditions. The solutions are obtained using Fourier transform methods in conjunction with the known properties of delay functions. It is observed that the solutions do not exhibit infinite speed of propagation for smooth initial conditions that are bounded and positive. Sufficient conditions on the initial condition are also established such that the finite time blowup of the solutions can be explicitly calculated. Examples are provided that highlight the contrasting behaviours of these exact solutions with the known dynamics of solutions to the standard diffusion equation.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation of Polarized Light and Temperature with a Refractive Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we propose a numerical algorithm to compute the intensity and polarization of a polychromatic electromagnetic radiation crossing a medium with graded refractive index and modeled by the Vector Radiative Refractive Transfer Equations (VRRTE). Special attention is given to the case where the refractive index has a discontinuity for which the Fresnel conditions are necessary. We assume that the only spatial variable of interest is the altitude (stratified medium). An algorithm based on iterations of the sources is shown to be monotone and convergent. Numerical examples are given with highly varying absorption coefficient kappa and Rayleigh scattering as in the Earth atmosphere. To study the effect of CO2 in the atmosphere kappa is changed in the frequency ranges where CO2 is absorbing.</description>

      <title>Finite time blow-up for the hypodissipative Navier Stokes equations with a force in $L^1_t C_x^{1,\epsilon}\cap L^{\infty}_{t}L_{x}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we establish the formation of singularities of classical solutions with finite energy of the forced fractional Navier Stokes equations where the dissipative term is given by $|\nabla|^{\alpha}$ for any $\alpha\in [0, \alpha_0)$ ($\alpha_0 = \frac{22-8\sqrt7}{9} &gt; 0$). We construct solutions in $\mathbb{R}^3\times [0,T]$ with a finite $T&gt;0$ and with an external forcing which is in $L^1_t([0, T]) C_x^{1,\epsilon}\cap L^{\infty}_{t}L_{x}^2$, such that on the time interval $0 \le t &lt; T$, the velocity $u$ is in the space $C^\infty\cap L^2$ and such that as the time $t$ approaches the blow-up moment $T$, the integral $\int_0^t |\nabla u| ds$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional inverse acoustic scattering problem by the BC-method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The forward acoustic scattering problem is to find $u=u^f(x,t)$ satisfying \begin{align*} &amp;u_{tt}-\Delta u+qu=0, &amp;&amp; (x,t) \in {\mathbb R}^3 \times (-\infty,\infty); \\ &amp;u \mid_{|x|&lt;-t} =0 , &amp;&amp; t&lt;0;\\ &amp;\lim_{s \to -\infty} s\,u((-s+\tau)\,\omega,s)=f(\tau,\omega), &amp;&amp; (\tau,\omega) \in \Sigma:=[0,\infty)\times S^2; \end{align*} for a real valued compactly supported potential $q=q(x)$ and a control $f \in L_2(\Sigma)$. The map $R: L_2(\Sigma)\to L_2(\Sigma)$, \begin{align*} &amp; (Rf)(\tau ,\omega )\,:= \lim_{s \to +\infty} s\, u^f((s+\tau )\,\omega ,s), \quad (\tau ,\omega ) \in \Sigma \end{align*} is a response operator.
  The inverse problem is to determine $q$ from $R$. It is solved by a relevant version of the boundary control method. The procedure that recovers the potential is local: for any fixed $\xi&gt;0$, given $R\upharpoonright\{f\in L_2(\Sigma)\,|\,\,f\mid_{0\leqslant \tau&lt;\xi}=0\}$ it determines $q\big|_{|x|\geqslant\xi}$.</description>

      <title>The well-posedness and scattering theory of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel first-order derivative for functions on a lattice graph, which extend the discrete Laplacian and generalize the theory of discrete PDE on the lattices. First, we establish the well-posedness of generalized quasilinear Schr\"odinger equations and give a new proof of global well-posedness of semilinear Schr\"odinger equations. Then we give explicit expressions of higher order derivatives of solution map and prove analytic dependence between solution and initial datum. In the end, we show the existence of wave operator and give a sufficient condition for asymptotic completeness.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on homogeneous fractional Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev constants via parabolic estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Common proofs of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev (GNS) do not provide explicit bounds on the involved constants, unless a sharp constant is being determined. GNS inequalities naturally occur in error estimates for numerical approximations. In particular, bounds on GNS constants allow us to provide explicit a priori estimates. We provide an algorithm that determines upper bounds on the non-endpoint homogeneous GNS inequalities in terms of explicit upper bounds for Young's convolution inequality and parabolic estimates. Our method is based on the heat-kernel representation of the inverse Laplacian, from which we deduce interpolation estimates.</description>

      <title>Weyl Law and convergence in the classical limit for min-max nonlocal minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [CFS], the author and collaborators construct infinitely many nonlocal $s$-minimal hypersurfaces (via min-max methods) on any closed $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$, obtaining an analogue of Yau's conjecture for $s\in(0,1)$. The present article proves a Weyl Law for the fractional perimeters of these hypersurfaces, and it shows their convergence as $s\to 1$ (for $n=3$) to smooth classical minimal surfaces. Our results are used in particular to give a novel proof of the density and equidistribution of classical minimal surfaces for generic metrics in three dimensions, showcasing nonlocal minimal surfaces also as a new approximation theory for the area functional.</description>
