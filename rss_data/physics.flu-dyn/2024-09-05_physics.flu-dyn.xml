      <title>A generalized three-dimensional hybrid contact method for smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the effects of relative motion at the solid object interfaces are not negligible, the contact method is required in the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method to prevent virtual shear and tensile stresses. However, there is still a lack of a three-dimensional (3D) contact method that can be well applied to various deformation situations, especially for extreme deformation. In this study, we propose a generalized 3D hybrid contact method for SPH. First, an improved high accuracy free-surface particle detection method is developed, including optimization of the detection process to reduce the detection time and consideration of the effect of material compressibility on the filtering parameters to extend the existing semi-geometric method from the incompressible (weakly-compressible) field to the compressible field. Then, a novel 3D local surface reconstruction method is developed based on the free-surface particles and region growing method, including the selection of the initial edge, the principle of triangle expansion, and the evaluation function, followed by the surface-surface contact detection and enforcement of normal penalty and tangential friction forces according to the penalty function method and Coulomb friction law. Finally, the particle-particle contact method is added to deal with cases where surface-surface contact fails, e.g., some particles are unable to reconstruct the local surface when the material undergoes extreme deformations. The proposed method is validated by several numerical tests, and the results show that the proposed method is capable of handling various contact problems with accuracy and stability, including small, large, and extreme deformation problems.</description>

      <title>Mean field lattice Boltzmann model for reactive mixtures in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new lattice Boltzmann model (LBM) is presented to describe chemically reacting multicomponent fluid flow in homogenised porous media. In this work, towards further generalizing the multicomponent reactive lattice Boltzmann model, we propose a formulation which is capable of performing reactive multicomponent flow computation in porous media at the representative elementary volume (REV) scale. To that end, the submodel responsible for interspecies diffusion has been upgraded to include Knudsen diffusion, whereas the kinetic equations for the species, the momentum and the energy have been rewritten to accommodate the effects of volume fraction of a porous media though careful choice of the equilibrium distribution functions. Verification of the mesoscale kinetic system of equations by a Chapman--Enskog analysis reveals that at the macroscopic scale, the homogenized Navier--Stokes equations for compressible multicomponent reactive flows are recovered. The Dusty Gas Model (DGM) capability hence formulated is validated over a wide pressure range by comparison of experimental flow rates of component species counter diffusing through capillary tubes. Next, for developing a capability to compute heterogeneous reactions, source terms for maintaining energy and mass balance across the fluid phase species and the surface adsorbed phase species are proposed. The complete model is then used to perform detailed chemistry simulations in porous electrodes of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), thereby predicting polarization curves which are of practical interest.</description>

      <title>Consistent multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method for the volume averaged Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel multi-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for solving the volume averaged Navier-Stokes equations (VANSE). Different from the approach given in [1], this method is rooted in the widely-adopted density equilibrium distribution, which provides possibility for simulating scenarios where fluid compressibility cannot be ignored, e.g., thermal and multiphase flows. The Chapman-Enskog analysis is presented to confirm the consistency of this scheme at macroscopic level. Some numerical experiments further demonstrate that it achieves second-order convergence and exhibits better numerical performance over previous schemes as reported [2-4].</description>

      <title>Parameter Analysis in Continuous Data Assimilation for Various Turbulence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we conduct parameter estimation analysis on a data assimilation algorithm for two turbulence models: the simplified Bardina model and the Navier-Stokes-{\alpha} model. Our approach involves creating an approximate solution for the turbulence models by employing an interpolant operator based on the observational data of the systems. The estimation depends on the parameter alpha in the models. Additionally, numerical simulations are presented to validate our theoretical results</description>

      <title>Field Theory of Non-Newtonian Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing a compelling derivation of Kolmogorov turbulence is a fascinating open challenge in field theory. Here, we pose a more modest question: if we had a field-theoretic description of Kolmogorov turbulence, could we use it to describe deviations caused, for example, by adding a polymer additive or by relativistic corrections? To investigate this issue, we assume a description of developed, homogeneous, and isotropic turbulence along the lines of Martin, Siggia, and Rose, and we work out the first corrections to the equal-time, two-point spectrum caused by adding non-Newtonian terms to the fluid stress tensor. While the results are not conclusive, they show a promising resemblance to turbulent spectra found in both experiments and large-scale numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Scalability and Accuracy of Variational Quantum Linear Solver for Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solution for non-linear, complex partial differential Equations (PDEs) is achieved through numerical approximations, which yield a linear system of equations. This approach is prevalent in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), but it restricts the mesh size since the solution of the linear system becomes computationally intractable when the mesh resolution increases. The reliance on the ability of High-Performance Computers (HPC) to scale up and meet these requirements is myopic; such very high-fidelity simulations require a paradigm shift in computing. This paper presents an exploration of quantum methodologies aimed at achieving high accuracy in solving such a large system of equations.
  Leveraging recent works in Quantum Linear Solver Algorithms (QLSA) and variational algorithms suitable for Quantum Simulation in HPC, we aspire to push the boundaries of CFD-relevant problems that can be solved on hybrid quantum-classical framework. To this end, we consider the 2D, transient, incompressible, viscous, non-linear coupled Burgers equation as a test problem and investigate the accuracy of our approach by comparing results with a classical linear system of equation solvers, such as the Generalized Minimal RESidual method (GMRES). Through rigorous testing, our findings demonstrate that our quantum methods yield results comparable in accuracy to traditional approaches. Additionally, we demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and consistency of our quantum method. Lastly, we present an insightful estimation of the resources our quantum algorithm needs to solve systems with nearly 2 billion mesh points.</description>

      <title>Configurable Vibrational Coupling in Laser-Induced Microsecond Oscillations of Multi-Microbubble System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the coupled vibrational dynamics of sub-MHz self-oscillating bubbles at separations of 14 to 92 {\mu}m. Two vapor-rich microbubbles are generated via photothermal heating; their interactions are captured in real space and time via a high-speed camera. By controlling the distance between bubbles with micrometer precision, we induce in- and anti-phase hybridized vibrations, with mode frequencies varying from 0.5 to 0.8 MHz. The observed coupled modes are reproduced by the extended Rayleigh-Plesset equation that takes pressure interactions between the bubbles into account. Our findings facilitate the optimization of bubble array positioning for spatio-temporal microfluidic control.</description>

      <title>Data-driven turbulent heat flux modeling with inputs of multiple fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven RANS modeling is emerging as a promising methodology to exploit the information provided by high-fidelity data. However, its widespread application is limited by challenges in generalization and robustness to inconsistencies between input data of varying fidelity levels. This is especially true for thermal turbulent closures, which inherently depend on momentum statistics provided by low or high fidelity turbulence momentum models. This work investigates the impact of momentum modeling inconsistencies on a data-driven thermal closure trained with a dataset with multiple fidelity (DNS and RANS). The analysis of the model inputs shows that the two fidelity levels correspond to separate regions in the input space. It is here shown that such separation can be exploited by a training with heterogeneous data, allowing the model to detect the level of fidelity in its inputs and adjust its prediction accordingly. In particular, a sensitivity analysis and verification shows that such a model can leverage the data inconsistencies to increase its robustness. Finally, the verification with a CFD simulation shows the potential of this multi-fidelity training approach for flows in which momentum statistics provided by traditional models are affected by model uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Improving agent performance in fluid environments by perceptual pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a pretraining framework for fluid environment perception, which includes an information compression model and the corresponding pretraining method. We test this framework in a two-cylinder problem through numerical simulation. The results show that after unsupervised pretraining with this framework, the intelligent agent can acquire key features of surrounding fluid environment, thereby adapting more quickly and effectively to subsequent multi-scenario tasks. In our research, these tasks include perceiving the position of the upstream obstacle and actively avoiding shedding vortices in the flow field to achieve drag reduction. Better performance of the pretrained agent is discussed in the sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>Maximum size and magnitude of injection-induced slow slip events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid injections can induce aseismic slip, resulting in stress changes that may propagate faster than pore pressure diffusion, potentially triggering seismicity at significant distances from injection wells. Constraining the maximum extent of these aseismic ruptures is thus important for better delineating the influence zone of injections concerning their seismic hazard. Here we derive a scaling relation based on rupture physics for the maximum size of aseismic ruptures, accounting for fluid injections with arbitrary flow rate histories. Moreover, based on mounting evidence that the moment release during these operations is often predominantly aseismic, we derive a scaling relation for the maximum magnitude of aseismic slip events. Our theoretical predictions are consistent with observations over a broad spectrum of event sizes, from laboratory to real-world cases, indicating that fault-zone storativity, background stress state, and injected fluid volume are key determinants of the maximum size and magnitude of injection-induced slow slip events.</description>

      <title>Grand-potential phase field simulations of droplet growth and sedimentation in a two-phase ternary fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A methodology is built to model and simulate the dynamics of domain coarsening of a two-phase ternary liquid with an arbitrary phase diagram. High numerical performance is obtained through the use of the phase field-method for interface capturing, a lattice Boltzmann method numerical scheme for all the model equations, and a portable, parallel simulation code running on multiple GPUs. The model is benchmarked against an analytic solution for a ternary diffusion couple. It also reproduces the well-known power law for droplet coarsening during Ostwald ripening without fluid flow. Large-scale simulations with flow illustrate the effects of momentum transport and buoyancy, as well as droplet coalescence and sedimentation.</description>

      <title>A Moving Surface Drag Model for LES of Wind over Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical prediction of the interactions between wind and ocean waves is essential for climate modeling and a wide range of offshore operations. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of the marine atmospheric boundary layer is a practical numerical predictive tool but requires parameterization of surface fluxes at the air-water interface. Current momentum flux parameterizations primarily use wave-phase adapting computational grids, incurring high computational costs, or use an equilibrium model based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory for rough surfaces that cannot resolve wave phase information. To include wave phase-resolving physics at a cost similar to the equilibrium model, the Moving Surface Drag (MOSD) model is introduced. It assumes ideal airflow over locally piece-wise planar representations of moving water wave surfaces. Horizontally unresolved interactions are still modeled using the equilibrium model. Validation against experimental and numerical datasets with known monochromatic waves demonstrates the robustness and accuracy of the model in representing wave-induced impacts on mean velocity and Reynolds stress profiles. The model is formulated to be applicable to a broad range of wave fields and its ability to represent cross-swell and multiple wavelength cases is illustrated. Additionally, the model is applied to LES of a laboratory-scale fixed-bottom offshore wind turbine model, and the results are compared with wind tunnel experimental data. The LES with the MOSD model shows good agreement in wind-wave-wake interactions and phase-dependent physics at a low computational cost. The model's simplicity and minimal computational needs make it valuable for studying turbulent atmospheric-scale flows over the sea, particularly in offshore wind energy research.</description>

      <title>Natural convection in a vertical channel. Part 1. Wavenumber interaction and Eckhaus instability in a narrow domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a vertical channel driven by an imposed horizontal temperature gradient, numerical simulations have previously shown steady, time-periodic and chaotic dynamics. We explore the observed dynamics by constructing invariant solutions of the three-dimensional Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations, characterizing the stability of these equilibria and periodic orbits, and following the bifurcation structure of the solution branches under parametric continuation in Rayleigh number. We find that in a narrow vertically-periodic domain of aspect ratio ten, the flow is dominated by the competition between three and four co-rotating rolls. We demonstrate that branches of three and four-roll equilibria are connected and can be understood in terms of their discrete symmetries. Specifically, the D4 symmetry of the four-roll branch dictates the existence of qualitatively different intermediate branches that themselves connect to the three-roll branch in a transcritical bifurcation due to D3 symmetry. The physical appearance, disappearance, merging and splitting of rolls along the connecting branch provide a physical and phenomenological illustration of the equivariant theory of D3-D4 mode interaction. We observe other manifestations of the competition between three and four rolls, in which the symmetry in time or in the transverse direction is broken, leading to limit cycles or wavy rolls, respectively. Our work highlights the interest of combining numerical simulations, bifurcation theory, and group theory, in order to understand the transitions between and origin of flow patterns.</description>

      <title>Physical Similarity of Fluid Flow in Bimodal Porous Media: Part 1 -- Basic Model and Solution Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid flow through bimodal porous media, characterized by a distinct separation in pore size distribution, is critical in various scientific and engineering applications, including groundwater management, oil and gas production, and carbon sequestration. This note delves into the physical similarity of fluid flow within such media, bridging the gap between microscale phenomena and macroscale observations. We present a representative mathematical model that conceptualizes bimodal porous media as a double-continuum system, distinguishing between macroporous and microporous regions. The model captures the complex interactions between these regions, particularly focusing on the challenges of modeling fluid flow when there is significant disparity in pore sizes. By employing a heuristic approach grounded in pore-scale tomography, we derive governing equations that describe fluid flow and analyze the solution characteristics. The results reveal unique features of the fluid flow in bimodal systems, such as the occurrence of boundary discontinuities and the delayed transient response, which are not observed in conventional porous media. This work provides ground for further studies in bimodal porous media, offering insights that could enhance predictive modeling and optimization in various applications concerning porous media with similar bimodal pore size distributions.</description>

      <title>Reducing Spatial Discretization Error on Coarse CFD Simulations Using an OpenFOAM-Embedded Deep Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for reducing the spatial discretization error of coarse computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems by enhancing the quality of low-resolution simulations using deep learning. We feed the model with fine-grid data after projecting it to the coarse-grid discretization. We substitute the default differencing scheme for the convection term by a feed-forward neural network that interpolates velocities from cell centers to face values to produce velocities that approximate the down-sampled fine-grid data well. The deep learning framework incorporates the open-source CFD code OpenFOAM, resulting in an end-to-end differentiable model. We automatically differentiate the CFD physics using a discrete adjoint code version. We present a fast communication method between TensorFlow (Python) and OpenFOAM (c++) that accelerates the training process. We applied the model to the flow past a square cylinder problem, reducing the error from 120% to 25% in the velocity for simulations inside the training distribution compared to the traditional solver using an x8 coarser mesh. For simulations outside the training distribution, the error reduction in the velocities was about 50%. The training is affordable in terms of time and data samples since the architecture exploits the local features of the physics.</description>
