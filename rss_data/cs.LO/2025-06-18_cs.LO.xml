      <title>Asymptotically Smaller Encodings for Graph Problems and Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how several graph problems (e.g., vertex-cover, independent-set, $k$-coloring) can be encoded into CNF using only $O(|V|^2 / \lg |V|)$ many clauses, as opposed to the $\Omega(|V|^2)$ constraints used by standard encodings. This somewhat surprising result is a simple consequence of a result of Erd\H{o}s, Chung, and Spencer (1983) about biclique coverings of graphs, and opens theoretical avenues to understand the success of "Bounded Variable Addition'' (Manthey, Heule, and Biere, 2012) as a preprocessing tool. Finally, we show a novel encoding for independent sets in some dense interval graphs using only $O(|V| \lg |V|)$ clauses (the direct encoding uses $\Omega(|V|^2)$), which we have successfully applied to a string-compression encoding posed by Bannai et al. (2022). As a direct byproduct, we obtain a reduction in the encoding size of a scheduling problem posed by Mayank and Modal (2020) from $O(NMT^2)$ to $O(NMT + M T^2 \lg T)$, where $N$ is the number of tasks, $T$ the total timespan, and $M$ the number of machines.</description>

      <title>Positive Sharing and Abstract Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wu's positive $\lambda$-calculus is a recent call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus with sharing coming from Miller and Wu's study of the proof-theoretical concept of focalization. Accattoli and Wu showed that it simplifies a technical aspect of the study of sharing; namely it rules out the recurrent issue of renaming chains, that often causes a quadratic time slowdown.
  In this paper, we define the natural abstract machine for the positive $\lambda$-calculus and show that it suffers from an inefficiency: the quadratic slowdown somehow reappears when analyzing the cost of the machine. We then design an optimized machine for the positive $\lambda$-calculus, which we prove efficient. The optimization is based on a new slicing technique which is dual to the standard structure of machine environments.</description>

      <title>A Non-Wellfounded and Labelled Sequent Calculus for Bimodal Provability Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a labelled and non-wellfounded calculus for the bimodal provability logic CS. The system is obtained by modelling the Kripke-like semantics of this logic. As in arXiv:2309.00532, we enforce the second-order property of converse wellfoundedness by using techniques from cyclic proof theory. We will prove soundness and completeness of this system with respect to the semantics and provide a primitive decision procedure together with a way to extract countermodels.</description>

      <title>A uniform cut-elimination theorem for linear logics with fixed points and super exponentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of light logics deriving from linear logic, a number of variants of exponential rules have been investigated. The profusion of such proof systems induces the need for cut-elimination theorems for each logic, the proof of which may be redundant. A number of approaches in proof theory have been adopted to cope with this need. In the present paper, we consider this issue from the point of view of enhancing linear logic with least and greatest fixed-points and considering such a variety of exponential connectives. Our main contribution is to provide a uniform cut-elimination theorem for a parametrized system with fixed-points by combining two approaches: cut-elimination proofs by reduction (or translation) to another system and the identification of sufficient conditions for cut-elimination. More precisely, we examine a broad range of systems, taking inspiration from Nigam and Miller's subexponentials and from Bauer and Laurent's super exponentials. Our work is motivated on the one hand by Baillot's work on light logics with recursive types and on the other hand by Bauer and Saurin's recent work on the proof theory of the modal {\mu}-calculus.</description>

      <title>OSTRICH2: Solver for Complex String Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present OSTRICH2, the latest evolution of the SMT solver OSTRICH for string constraints. OSTRICH2 supports a wide range of complex functions on strings and provides completeness guarantees for a substantial fragment of string constraints, including the straight-line fragment and the chain-free fragment. OSTRICH2 provides full support for the SMT-LIB theory of Unicode strings, extending the standard with several unique features not found in other solvers: among others, parsing of ECMAScript regular expressions (including look-around assertions and capture groups) and handling of user-defined string transducers. We empirically demonstrate that OSTRICH2 is competitive to other string solvers on SMT-COMP benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Varanus: Runtime Verification for CSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous systems are often used in changeable and unknown environments, where traditional verification may not be suitable. Runtime Verification (RV) checks events performed by a system against a formal specification of its intended behaviour, making it highly suitable for ensuring that an autonomous system is obeying its specification at runtime. Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) is a process algebra usually used in static verification, which captures behaviour as a trace of events, making it useful for RV as well. Further, CSP has more recently been used to specify autonomous and robotic systems. Though CSP is supported by two extant model checkers, so far it has no RV tool. This paper presents Varanus, an RV tool that monitors a system against an oracle built from a CSP specification. This approach enables the reuse without modifications of a specification that was built, e.g during the system's design. We describe the tool, apply it to a simulated autonomous robotic rover inspecting a nuclear waste store, empirically comparing its performance to two other RV tools using different languages, and demonstrate how it can detect violations of the specification. Varanus can synthesise a monitor from a CSP process in roughly linear time, with respect to the number of states and transitions in the model; and checks each event in roughly constant time.</description>

      <title>A Logic For Fresh Labelled Transition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Hennessy-Milner logic with recursion for Fresh Labelled Transition Systems (FLTSs). These are nominal labelled transition systems which keep track of the history, i.e. of data values seen so far, and can capture fresh data generation. In particular, FLTSs generalise the computations of Fresh-Register Automata, which in turn are one of the simplest classes of history-dependent automata operating on infinite input alphabets. Each automaton comes equipped with a finite set of registers where it can store data values and compare them with others from the input. In addition, the automaton can accept an input just if it be fresh: not seen in the computation before. The logic we introduce can express a variety of properties, such as the existence of an infinite path of distinct data values or the existence of a finite path where some taint property is violated. We study the model checking problem and its complexity via reduction to parity games and, using nominal sets techniques, provide an exponential upper bound for it.</description>

      <title>Logical Expressiveness of Graph Neural Networks with Hierarchical Node Individualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and study Hierarchical Ego Graph Neural Networks (HEGNNs), an expressive extension of graph neural networks (GNNs) with hierarchical node individualization, inspired by the Individualization-Refinement paradigm for graph isomorphism testing. HEGNNs generalize subgraph-GNNs and form a hierarchy of increasingly expressive models that, in the limit, can distinguish graphs up to isomorphism. We provide a logical characterization of HEGNN node classifiers, with and without subgraph restrictions, using graded hybrid logic. This characterization enables us to relate the separating power of HEGNNs to that of higher-order GNNs, GNNs enriched with local homomorphism count features, and color refinement algorithms based on Individualization-Refinement. Our experimental results confirm the practical feasibility of HEGNNs and show benefits in comparison with traditional GNN architectures, both with and without local homomorphism count features.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Symbolic Machine Learning by Subsymbolic Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of neuro-symbolic AI is to integrate symbolic and subsymbolic AI approaches, to overcome the limitations of either. Prominent systems include Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) or DeepProbLog, which offer neural predicates and end-to-end learning. The versatility of systems like LTNs and DeepProbLog, however, makes them less efficient in simpler settings, for instance, for discriminative machine learning, in particular in domains with many constants. Therefore, we follow a different approach: We propose to enhance symbolic machine learning schemes by giving them access to neural embeddings. In the present paper, we show this for TILDE and embeddings of constants used by TILDE in similarity predicates. The approach can be fine-tuned by further refining the embeddings depending on the symbolic theory. In experiments in three real-world domain, we show that this simple, yet effective, approach outperforms all other baseline methods in terms of the F1 score. The approach could be useful beyond this setting: Enhancing symbolic learners in this way could be extended to similarities between instances (effectively working like kernels within a logical language), for analogical reasoning, or for propositionalization.</description>

      <title>Distributed controller synthesis for deadlock avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12409v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the distributed control synthesis problem for systems with locks. The goal is to find local controllers so that the global system does not deadlock. With no restriction this problem is undecidable even for three processes each using a fixed number of locks. We propose two restrictions that make distributed control decidable. The first one is to allow each process to use at most two locks. The problem then becomes $\Sigma_2^P$-complete, and even in PTIME under some additional assumptions. The dining philosophers problem satisfies these assumptions. The second restriction is a nested usage of locks. In this case the synthesis problem is NEXPTIME-complete. The drinking philosophers problem falls in this case.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Temporal Causality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10912v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an automata-based algorithm to synthesize omega-regular causes for omega-regular effects on executions of a reactive system, such as counterexamples uncovered by a model checker. Our theory is a generalization of temporal causality, which has recently been proposed as a framework for drawing causal relationships between trace properties on a given trace. So far, algorithms exist only for verifying a single causal relationship and, as an extension, cause synthesis through enumeration, which is complete only for a small fragment of effect properties. This work presents the first complete cause-synthesis algorithm for the class of omega-regular effects. We show that in this case, causes are guaranteed to be omega-regular themselves and can be computed as, e.g., nondeterministic B\"uchi automata. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of this algorithm with a prototype tool and evaluate its performance for cause synthesis and cause checking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15647v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a logical framework that enables us to define a formal theory of computational trust in which this notion is analysed in terms of epistemic attitudes towards the possible objects of trust and in relation to existing evidence in favour of the trustworthiness of these objects. The framework is based on a quantified epistemic and justification logic featuring a non-standard handling of identities. Thus, the theory is able to account for the hyperintensional nature of computational trust. We present a proof system and a frame semantics for the logic, we prove soundness and completeness results and we introduce the syntactical machinery required to define a theory of trust.</description>

      <title>Positive Almost-Sure Termination of Polynomial Random Walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of steps until termination of a probabilistic program is a random variable. Probabilistic program termination therefore requires qualitative analysis via almost-sure termination (AST), while also providing quantitative answers via positive almost-sure termination (PAST) on the expected number of steps until termination. While every program which is PAST is AST, the converse is not true. The symmetric random walk with constant step size is a prominent example of a program that is AST but not PAST.
  In this paper we show that a more general class of polynomial random walks is PAST. Our random walks implement a step size that is polynomially increasing in the number of loop iterations and have a constant probability $p$ of choosing either branch. We decide that such programs are PAST when the degree of the polynomial is higher than both the degree of the drift and a threshold $d_\text{min}(p)$. Our approach does not use proof rules, nor auxiliary arithmetic expressions, such as martingales or invariants. Rather, we establish an inductive bound for the cumulative distribution function of the loop guard, based on which PAST is proven.
  We implemented the approximation of this threshold, by combining genetic programming, algebraic reasoning and linear programming.</description>

Abstract: This paper treats a new type of random walk referred to as an Antlion Random Walk (ARW), which is motivated by mathematical modeling of the decision-making process using chaotic semiconductor lasers with memory parameters. We discuss the dependency of the property of the probability distribution of ARWs on the memory parameter $\alpha$ and discuss uniqueness of them in contrast to the conventional, simple RWs through similarity to the normal distribution.</description>

      <title>REAL-Prover: Retrieval Augmented Lean Prover for Mathematical Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, formal theorem provers have made monumental progress on high-school and competition-level mathematics, but few of them generalize to more advanced mathematics. In this paper, we present REAL-Prover, a new open-source stepwise theorem prover for Lean 4 to push this boundary. This prover, based on our fine-tuned large language model (REAL-Prover-v1) and integrated with a retrieval system (Leansearch-PS), notably boosts performance on solving college-level mathematics problems. To train REAL-Prover-v1, we developed HERALD-AF, a data extraction pipeline that converts natural language math problems into formal statements, and a new open-source Lean 4 interactive environment (Jixia-interactive) to facilitate synthesis data collection. In our experiments, our prover using only supervised fine-tune achieves competitive results with a 23.7% success rate (Pass@64) on the ProofNet dataset-comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To further evaluate our approach, we introduce FATE-M, a new benchmark focused on algebraic problems, where our prover achieves a SOTA success rate of 56.7% (Pass@64).</description>
