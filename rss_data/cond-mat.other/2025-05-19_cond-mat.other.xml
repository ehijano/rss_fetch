      <title>Hybridization of Bogoliubov-quasiparticles between adjacent CuO$_2$ layers in the triple-layer cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ studied by ARPES</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.15373v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybridization of Bogoliubov quasiparticles (BQPs) between the CuO$_2$ layers in the triple-layer cuprate high-temperature superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ is studied by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). In the superconducting state, an anti-crossing gap opens between the outer- and inner-BQP bands, which we attribute primarily to interlayer single-particle hopping with possible contributions from interlayer Cooper pairing. We find that the $d$-wave superconducting gap of both BQP bands smoothly develops with momentum without abrupt jump in contrast to a previous ARPES study. Hybridization between the BQPs also gradually increases in going from the off-nodal to the anti-nodal region, which is explained by the momentum-dependence of the interlayer single-particle hopping. As possible mechanisms for the enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature, the hybridization between the BQPs, as well as the combination of phonon modes of the triple CuO$_2$ layers and spin fluctuations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Aharonov-Bohm caging of an electron in a quantum fractal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractal geometries exhibit complex structures with scale invariance self-similar pattern over various length scales. An artificially designed quantum fractal geometry embedded in a uniform magnetic flux has been explored in this study. It has been found that due to quantum mechanical effect, such quantum fractal display an exotic electronic property which is reflected in its transport characteristics. Owing to this uniform magnetic flux piercing through each closed-loop building block of the fractal structure, an electron traversing through such a fractal geometry will pick up a nontrivial Aharonov-Bohm phase factor, which will influence its transport through the system. It is shown that, one can completely block the transmission of an electron in this fractal geometry by setting the value of the uniform magnetic flux to half flux quantum. This phenomenon of Aharonov-Bohm caging of an electron in this quantum fractal geometry has been supported by the computation of the energy spectrum, two-terminal transport and persistent current in its various generations. This result is very robust against disorder and could be useful in designing efficient quantum algorithms using a quantum fractal network.</description>

      <title>Filtering Spin and Orbital Moment in Centrosymmetric Systems</title>

Abstract: The control of spin and orbital angular momentum without relying on magnetic materials is commonly accomplished by breaking of inversion symmetry, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and spin selectivity in electron transfer processes occurring in chiral media. In contrast to this perspective, we show that orbital moment filtering can be accomplished in centrosymmetric systems: the electron states can be selectively manipulated allowing for the preferential transfer of electrons with a particular orbital momentum orientation. We find that orbital moment filtering is indeed efficiently controlled through orbital couplings that break both mirror and rotational symmetries. We provide the symmetry conditions required for the electron transmission to achieve orbital filtering and relate them to the orientation of the orbital moment. The presence of atomic spin-orbit interaction in the centrosymmetric transmission medium leads to the selective filtering of spin and orbital moments. Our findings allow to identify optimal regimes for having highly efficient simultaneous spin and orbital moment filtering.</description>

      <title>Hall effects in Carroll dynamics</title>

Abstract: ``Do Carroll particles move?'' The answer depends on the characteristics of the particle such as its mass, spin, electric charge, and magnetic moment. A massive Carroll particle (closely related to fractons) does not move; its immobility follows from Carroll boost symmetry which implies dipole conservation, but not conversely. A massless Carroll particle may propagate by following the Hall law, consistently with the partial breaking of the Carroll boost symmetry. The framework is extended to Carroll field theory. In $d=2$ space dimensions, the Carroll group has a two-fold central extension which allows us to generalize the dynamics to massive and massless particles, including anyons. The anyonic spin and magnetic moment combine with the doubly-extended structure parameterized by two Casimir invariants interpreted as intrinsic magnetization and non-commutativity parameter. The extended Carroll particle subjected to an electromagnetic background field moves following a generalized Hall law which includes a Zeeman force. This theory is illustrated by massless, uncharged anyons with doubly-centrally extended structure we call exotic photons, which move on the horizon of a Black Hole, giving rise to an anyonic spin-Hall Effect.</description>

      <title>Investigations of optical aberration on quantum diamond microscopy toward high spatial resolution and sensitivity</title>

Abstract: Quantum diamond microscopy (QDM), which employs nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles, is a promising approach to quantitatively imaging magnetic fields with both high resolution that approaches the diffraction limit and a wide field of view. The commonly adopted setups of QDM capture the photoluminescence through transparent diamonds, which inevitably entail aberrations -- optical errors that degrade the optical resolution and contrast of the obtainable image. In this study, we delve into the impact of optical aberrations, focusing on their dependence on diamond thickness. We first introduce a rigorous model [Richards et al., Braat et al.] of diffraction that incorporates aberrations, producing the NV center optical image. We confirm that this model accurately reproduces the confocal images of single NV centers obtained at various depths in diamonds. Extending this model to a wide-field microscope, we find that the model also accurately reproduces the USAF 1951 resolution test chart obtained through diamonds of various thicknesses. Based on these investigations, we quantitatively assess the consequent resolution constraints and propose thinning the diamond as a viable solution. We present a robust method to quantitatively ascertain resolution in optical systems influenced by aberrations caused by ray transmission through diamonds. For instance, for a typical microscope with an objective lens of NA = 0.7, the diffraction limit is achievable through diamonds that are 30 $\mu$m thick, and a resolution of 1 $\mu$m is obtained through diamonds that are 100 $\mu$m thick. Those results opens up avenues for enhanced performance in QDM. The Julia package used to calculate the vectorial PSFs is available at ${\texttt VectorPSFs.jl}$.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent photovoltage in graphene/MoS2-based field-effect transistors</title>

Abstract: It has recently been shown that Terahertz sensors can effectively detect the spin resonances of Dirac fermions in graphene. The associated photovoltaic measurement technique allows for the investigation of the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in graphene as well as its topological properties from microwave to Terahertz frequencies. In this work, using graphene/MoS2-based Field-Effect Transistors, we observed a magnetic resonance photovoltage signal in the Gigahertz range that is independent of the gate bias. The dispersion of the associated spin-flip transitions remains intriguingly unaffected by the MoS2 layer. In parallel, the spin-related signal consistently appears as a drop in photovoltage, regardless of the signal's polarity or origin, whether it arises from plasma wave rectification or thermoelectric effects. This behavior is interpreted as a decrease in the system's spin polarization due to spin-dependent recombination or scattering of photocarriers. Understanding the various photovoltaic signals in highly sensitive Gigahertz/Terahertz sensors paves the way for exploring spin-dependent mechanisms in two-dimensional quantum materials, influenced by proximity effects such as spin-orbit coupling, topology, and magnetism.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Based Circuit Model for Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents an equivalent circuit model for Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) that accurately captures their magnetization dynamics and electrical behavior. Implemented in LTspice, the model is validated against direct numerical solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation. It effectively simulates essential spintronic phenomena, including ferromagnetic resonance, field- and spin-torque-induced switching, and spin-torque-induced oscillations. Simulation results demonstrate strong agreement between LTspice and LLGS solutions, confirming the model accuracy and utility for efficient circuit-level analysis of spintronic devices. The ability to incorporate time-dependent magnetic fields and voltage inputs makes the proposed model suitable for diverse applications such as neuromorphic computing, microwave signal processing, and spintronic memory technologies. By providing a computationally efficient yet physically accurate circuit representation, this work enables seamless integration of MTJs into larger electronic systems, potentially accelerating the development of advanced spintronic circuit architectures.</description>

      <title>Extended Tsallis-Cirto entropy for black and white holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05178v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the non-extensive entropy. This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides with the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes. The entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of macroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole entropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same mass, $S_{\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with respect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to extend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto formula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the same, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the entropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the entropy of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. This entropy is formed by the positive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner horizon. The model of the black hole formed by "black hole atoms" with Planck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white holes.</description>
