      <title>Temperature and Competition: Drivers in the Ecological Dynamics of Aedes Mosquitoes and Dengue Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease common in tropical areas, is spread by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Temperature changes driven by climate affect vector ecology and expand regions of species coexistence. The combined effect of temperature and larval competition on mosquito dynamics and dengue transmission is unclear. We built a deterministic model with temperature-dependent parameters to study larval-stage interactions, linked with a SEIR framework for human infection. We assessed invasion potential, coexistence, and infection peaks. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated using the Next Generation Matrix, and the effective reproduction number (Rt) came from simulations with larval competition. Aedes albopictus invades aegypti-dominated systems when the aegypti competition coefficient is below 0.47, with neutral equilibrium from 0.47 to 0.60 and exclusion above 0.60 in stable conditions. In temperature-dependent settings, invasion extends to a coefficient of 0.75. Coexistence analysis showed aegypti dominance (~87% abundance) in stable settings, while temperature-dependent conditions led to ~50% abundance for both species. Dengue cases peaked at 156-168 in stable conditions and 195-220 in temperature-dependent ones. Stronger albopictus competition lowered peaks in both cases. Temperature boosts albopictus invasion and coexistence, while aegypti drives higher infection peaks. Balanced species abundances raise transmission risks, emphasizing the need to factor temperature and competition into vector control.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary dynamics of memory-based strategies in repeated and structured social interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human social life is shaped by repeated interactions, where past experiences guide future behavior. In evolutionary game theory, a key challenge is to identify strategies that harness such memory to succeed in repeated encounters. Decades of research have identified influential one-step memory strategies (such as Tit-for-Tat, Generous Tit-for-Tat, and Win-Stay Lose-Shift) that promote cooperation in iterated pairwise games. However, these strategies occupy only a small corner of the vast strategy space, and performance in isolated pairwise contests does not guarantee evolutionary success. The most effective strategies are those that can spread through a population and stabilize cooperation. We propose a general framework for repeated-interaction strategies that encompasses arbitrary memory lengths, diverse informational inputs (including both one's own and the opponent's past actions), and deterministic or stochastic decision rules. We analyze their evolutionary dynamics and derive general mathematical results for the emergence of cooperation in any network structure. We then introduce a unifying indicator that quantifies the contribution of repeated-interaction strategies to population-level cooperation. Applying this indicator, we show that long-memory strategies evolve to promote cooperation more effectively than short-memory strategies, challenging the traditional view that extended memory offers no advantage. This work expands the study of repeated interactions beyond one-step memory strategies to the full spectrum of memory capacities. It provides a plausible explanation for the high levels of cooperation observed in human societies, which traditional one-step memory models cannot account for.</description>

      <title>A High-Order Cumulant Extension of Quasi-Linkage Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central question in evolutionary biology is how to quantitatively understand the dynamics of genetically diverse populations. Modeling the genotype distribution is challenging, as it ultimately requires tracking all correlations (or cumulants) among alleles at different loci. The quasi-linkage equilibrium (QLE) approximation simplifies this by assuming that correlations between alleles at different loci are weak -- i.e., low linkage disequilibrium -- allowing their dynamics to be modeled perturbatively. However, QLE breaks down under strong selection, significant epistatic interactions, or weak recombination. We extend the multilocus QLE framework to allow cumulants up to order $K$ to evolve dynamically, while higher-order cumulants ($&gt;K$) are assumed to equilibrate rapidly. This extended QLE (exQLE) framework yields a general equation of motion for cumulants up to order $K$, which parallels the standard QLE dynamics (recovered when $K = 1$). In this formulation, cumulant dynamics are driven by the gradient of average fitness, mediated by a geometrically interpretable matrix that stems from competition among genotypes. Our analysis shows that the exQLE with $K=2$ accurately captures cumulant dynamics even when the fitness function includes higher-order (e.g., third- or fourth-order) epistatic interactions, capabilities that standard QLE lacks. We also applied the exQLE framework to infer fitness parameters from temporal sequence data. Overall, exQLE provides a systematic and interpretable approximation scheme, leveraging analytical cumulant dynamics and reducing complexity by progressively truncating higher-order cumulants.</description>

      <title>Bistability and Noise-Induced Evasion in Tumor-Immune Dynamics with Antigen Accumulation and Immune Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tumor-immune interactions are shaped by both antigenic heterogeneity and stochastic perturbations in the tumor microenvironment, yet the mathematical mechanisms underlying immune phase transitions remain poorly understood. We propose a four-compartment dynamical model that incorporates antigen accumulation and immune escape mutations. Bifurcation analysis reveals bistability between immune surveillance and immune escape states, providing a mechanistic explanation for heterogeneous immune outcomes during tumor progression. In the multistable regime, the stable manifold of a saddle point partitions the state space into distinct basins of attraction, determining the long-term fate of the system. We further analyze how stochastic fluctuations in the tumor microenvironment perturb these separatrices, potentially triggering irreversible state transitions. By characterizing the critical noise intensity and estimating the tipping time, we establish a mathematical framework for assessing noise-induced transitions. The model further predicts that increasing tumor cell death can improve system resilience to stochastic perturbations, whereas stronger immune pressure may facilitate immune escape-highlighting the nonlinear and non-monotonic nature of tumor-immune dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limits on taming infectious disease epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epidemic control frequently relies on adjusting interventions based on prevalence. But designing such policies is a highly non-trivial problem due to uncertain intervention effects, costs and the difficulty of quantifying key transmission mechanisms and parameters. Here, using exact mathematical and computational methods, we reveal a fundamental limit in epidemic control in that prevalence feedback policies are outperformed by a single optimally chosen constant control level. Specifically, we find no incentive to use prevalence based control under a wide class of cost functions that depend arbitrarily on interventions and scale with infections. We also identify regimes where prevalence feedback is beneficial. Our results challenge the current understanding that prevalence based interventions are required for epidemic control and suggest that, for many classes of epidemics, interventions should not be varied unless the epidemic is near the herd immunity threshold.</description>

      <title>Implications of regional variations in climate change vulnerability and mitigation behaviour for social-climate dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How regional heterogeneity in social and cultural processes drive--and respond to--climate dynamics is little studied. Here we present a coupled social-climate model stratified across five world regions and parameterized with geophysical, economic and social survey data. We find that support for mitigation evolves in a highly variable fashion across regions, according to socio-economics, climate vulnerability, and feedback from changing temperatures. Social learning and social norms can amplify existing sentiment about mitigation, leading to better or worse global warming outcomes depending on the region. Moreover, mitigation in one region, as mediated by temperature dynamics, can influence other regions to act, or just sit back, thus driving cross-regional heterogeneity in mitigation opinions. The peak temperature anomaly varies by several degrees Celsius depending on how these interactions unfold. Our model exemplifies a framework for studying how global geophysical processes interact with population-scale concerns to determine future sustainability outcomes.</description>

      <title>Enhancing U.S. swine farm preparedness for infectious foreign animal diseases with rapid access to biosecurity information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The U.S. launched the Secure Pork Supply (SPS) Plan for Continuity of Business, a voluntary program providing foreign animal disease (FAD) guidance and setting biosecurity standards to maintain business continuity amid FAD outbreaks. The role of biosecurity in disease prevention is well recognized, yet the U.S. swine industry lacks knowledge of individual farm biosecurity plans and the efficacy of existing measures. We describe a multi-sector initiative that formed the Rapid Access Biosecurity (RAB) app consortium with the swine industry, government, and academia. We (i) summarized 7,625 farms using RABapp, (ii) mapped U.S. commercial swine coverage and areas of limited biosecurity, and (iii) examined associations between biosecurity and occurrences of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV).
  RABapp, used in 31 states, covers ~47% of U.S. commercial swine. Of 307 Agricultural Statistics Districts with swine, 78% (238) had &lt;50% of those animals in RABapp. We used a mixed-effects logistic regression model, accounting for production company and farm type (breeding vs. non-breeding). Requiring footwear/clothing changes, having multiple carcass disposal locations, hosting other businesses, and greater distance to swine farms reduced infection odds. Rendering carcasses, manure pit storage or land application, multiple perimeter buffer areas, and a larger animal housing area increased risk. This study leveraged RABapp to assess U.S. swine farm biosecurity, revealing gaps in SPS plan adoption that create vulnerable regions. Some biosecurity practices (e.g., footwear changes) lowered PRRSV/PEDV risk, while certain disposal and manure practices increased it. Targeted biosecurity measures and broader RABapp adoption can bolster industry resilience against foreign animal diseases.</description>

      <title>Binomial maps: stochastically evolving iterated integer maps for finite populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many models of population dynamics are formulated as deterministic iterated maps although real populations are stochastic. This is justifiable in the limit of large population sizes, as the stochastic fluctuations are negligible then. However, this also makes it challenging to use the same models for small populations where finite size effects like demographic noise and extinction cannot be ignored. Moreover, adding noise to the equations does not solve this problem as it can only represent the environmental stochasticity. An approach, sometimes used in ecological literature, but surprisingly uncommon in dynamical systems community, is \emph{Binomial maps}, which allow stochastic evolution of deterministic iterated map models of population. Here we present their formulation in a way so as to make their connection to the agent-based models explicit, and demonstrate it for the Logistic and Ricker maps. We also show that the Binomial maps are not completely equivalent to their deterministic counterparts, and derive sufficient conditions under which the equivalence holds. This approach enables rigorous finite-population analysis within familiar map-based models, bridging the deterministic map models and stochastic agent-based models.</description>

      <title>Polymerization and replication of primordial RNA induced by clay-water interface dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the study of life's origins, a key challenge is understanding how RNA could have polymerized and subsequently replicated in early Earth. We present a theoretical and computational framework to model the non-enzymatic polymerization of ribonucleotides and the template-dependent replication of primordial RNA molecules, at the interfaces between the aqueous solution and a clay mineral. Our results demonstrate that systematic polymerization and replication of single-stranded RNA polymers, sufficiently long to fold and acquire basic functions ($&gt;$15 nt), were feasible under these conditions. Crucially, this process required a physico-chemical environment characterized by large-amplitude oscillations with periodicity compatible with spring tide dynamics, suggesting that large moons may have played a role in the emergence of RNA-based life on planetary bodies. Interestingly, the theoretical analysis presents rigorous evidence that RNA replication efficiency increases in oscillating environments compared to constant ones. Moreover, the versatility of our framework enables comparisons between different genetic alphabets, showing that a four-letter alphabet -- particularly when allowing non-canonical base pairs, as in current RNA -- represents an optimal balance of replication speed and sequence diversity in the pathway to life.</description>

      <title>Vendi Information Gain for Active Learning and its Application to Ecology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While monitoring biodiversity through camera traps has become an important endeavor for ecological research, identifying species in the captured image data remains a major bottleneck due to limited labeling resources. Active learning -- a machine learning paradigm that selects the most informative data to label and train a predictive model -- offers a promising solution, but typically focuses on uncertainty in the individual predictions without considering uncertainty across the entire dataset. We introduce a new active learning policy, Vendi information gain (VIG), that selects images based on their impact on dataset-wide prediction uncertainty, capturing both informativeness and diversity. We applied VIG to the Snapshot Serengeti dataset and compared it against common active learning methods. VIG needs only 3% of the available data to reach 75% accuracy, a level that baselines require more than 10% of the data to achieve. With 10% of the data, VIG attains 88% predictive accuracy, 12% higher than the best of the baselines. This improvement in performance is consistent across metrics and batch sizes, and we show that VIG also collects more diverse data in the feature space. VIG has broad applicability beyond ecology, and our results highlight its value for biodiversity monitoring in data-limited environments.</description>
