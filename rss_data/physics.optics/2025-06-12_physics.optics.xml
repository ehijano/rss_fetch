      <title>Kerr nonlinearity, self-injection locking and correlation in a microresonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Production of entangled photon pairs is important in secure communication systems, quantum computing, and fundamental physics experiments. Achieving efficient generation of such photon pairs with low-loss parametric oscillators is a key objective in advancing integrated quantum technologies. However, spatially separating the generated photons while preserving their entanglement represents a significant technical challenge. In this work, we demonstrate nonlinear generation of correlated optical harmonics based on non-degenerate four-wave mixing with an optimally pumped optical microcavity with Kerr nonlinearity. The phase matching of the process is achieved with self-injection locked lasers producing parametric oscillation while locked to two different modes of the microresonator. This condition is reminiscent of slow-light technique developed for coherent atomic systems. The experimental design, utilizing counterpropagating light from two self-injection locked lasers, also effectively addresses the challenge of spatial separation of the generated harmonics. We validate the theoretical predictions using two self-injection locked semiconductor lasers integrated with a crystalline whispering gallery mode resonator with optimized spectral structure.</description>

      <title>Performance and uses of the Refimeve metrological signal, 1000 km from the source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the end-user performance of the metrological signal at 1542 nm disseminated by the French national fibre network Refimeve, about 1000 km from the source. By the mean of a local ultrastable laser at 729 nm and a frequency comb, we are able to carry out stability and phase noise measurements of the signal with respect to the local laser. With a focus on phase noise analysis we identify different timescales of interest for the use of this signal in optical frequency metrology.</description>

      <title>Apparatus for the measurement of birefringence maps of optical materials: the case of crystalline silicon for Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein Telescope (ET) is expected to achieve sensitivity improvements exceeding an order of magnitude compared to current gravitational-wave detectors. The rigorous characterization in optical birefringence of materials and coatings has become a critical task for next-generation detectors, especially since this birefringence is generally spatially non-uniform. A highly sensitive optical polarimeter has been developed at the Department of Physics and Earth Sciences of the University of Ferrara and INFN - Ferrara Section, Italy, aimed at performing two-dimensional birefringence mapping of substrates. In this paper we describe the design and working principle of the system and present results for crystalline silicon, a candidate material for substrates in the low-frequency (LF) interferometers of ET. We find that the birefringence is of order $10^{-7}$ for commercially available samples and is position dependent in the silicon (100)-oriented samples, with variations in both magnitude and axis orientation. We also measure the intrinsic birefringence of the (110) surface. Implications for the performance of gravitational-wave interferometers are discussed.</description>

      <title>Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering in telecommunications optical fiber at millikelvin temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering is a strong and readily accessible optical nonlinearity enabling a wide array of applications and research directions. For instance, the three-wave mixing process has been employed to great success for narrow-linewidth lasers, sensing applications, microscopy, and signal processing. While most of these avenues focus on room temperature operation, there is now increasing interest in cryogenic operation owing to the scattering mechanism's significant potential for applications and fundamental physics at low temperatures. Here, we measure the Brillouin scattering spectrum in standard single-mode telecommunications optical fiber at millikelvin temperatures using a closed-cycle dilution refrigerator and optical heterodyne detection. Our experiments are performed with a cryostat temperature from 50 mK to 27 K, extending previously reported measurements that utilized liquid helium-4 cryostats with temperatures greater than 1 K. At millikelvin temperatures, our experiment observes coherent acoustic interaction with microscopic defects of the amorphous material - two-level-systems (TLS) - which has not been previously observed in optical fiber. The measured behaviour of the linewidth with temperature is in agreement with well-established models of ultrasonic attenuation in amorphous materials comprising a background intrinsic scattering, thermally-activated scattering, and incoherent and coherent TLS interaction. This work provides a foundation for a wide range of applications and further research including sensing applications, new approaches to investigate TLS physics, and Brillouin-scattering-based quantum science and technology.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional programmable photonic circuits with structured media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic circuits provide a powerful platform for manipulating optical modes in both classical and quantum regimes. Here, we report a programmable free-space photonic architecture capable of implementing high-dimensional unitary transformations with translational symmetry. Information is encoded in structured light modes defined by circular polarisation and quantised transverse momenta, and processed using a cascade of three spatial light modulators interleaved with half-wave plates. We demonstrate the scalability and reconfigurability of this platform by simulating quantum walks for up to 30 time steps across one- and two-dimensional lattices, achieving unitary evolutions that distribute a single input mode over more than 7,000 output modes. The platform supports a wide variety of quantum walk dynamics, including time-dependent disorder, synthetic gauge fields, and electric-field-induced refocusing in 2D walks -- previously studied only in separate experimental settings. We further probe geometrical and topological features in chiral-symmetric processes by extracting bulk observables. Finally, using coincidence measurements from a time-tagging camera, we demonstrate compatibility with quantum optics protocols by reconstructing far-field distributions of heralded single photons. These results establish reconfigurable free-space photonics with structured media as a versatile tool for high-dimensional quantum simulations and scalable optical information processing.</description>

      <title>Optical force density and surface displacements in transparent dielectrics due to non-ionizing sub-picosecond laser excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical force density acting in transparent dielectric media due to short laser excitation is theoretically analyzed. For typical laser pulses with picosecond duration, the momentum component of the optical force becomes of the same order of magnitude as the stress component, enhancing the overall optomechanical effects. Simulations of the optically-induced surface displacements in fused silica glass are also presented. With careful choice of realistic simulation parameters, dispersive and nonlinear effects were shown to be suppressed and displacements of 50 pm were found for single-pulse excitation with 100 fs duration, where the momentum component of the force is dominant. A possibility of measuring these displacements with piezo-electric detection is also discussed, providing a way to attain spatiotemporal characterization of the optical momentum force in continuum media. Such a description would significantly advance our current knowledge on the behavior of optical forces, potentially contributing to more versatile optomechanical applications, while also clarifying the ongoing Abraham-Minkowski fundamental problem on the momentum transferred by light.</description>

      <title>Unification of Exceptional Points and Transmission Peak Degeneracies in a Highly Tunable Magnon-Photon Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), spectral singularities arising in non-Hermitian dynamical systems, have drawn widespread attention for their potential to enhance sensor capability by leveraging characteristic square-root frequency splitting. However, the advantages of EP sensors have remained highly contested, primarily due to their inherent hypersensitivity to model errors and loss of precision arising from eigenbasis collapse, quantified by the Petermann noise factor. Recently, it has been suggested that practical sensor implementations should instead utilize transmission peak degeneracies (TPDs), which exhibit square-root transmission splitting while maintaining a complete eigenbasis, potentially mitigating the Petermann noise around EPs. This work presents a microwave magnon-photon dimer with near-universal tunability across all relevant parameters, which we use to investigate various TPDs experimentally. We demonstrate that two-dimensional EP and TPD configurations based on coupled oscillators can be unified into a general theory and experimental framework utilizing synthetic gauge fields, which we present and validate through careful experiments on two representative TPDs. We also introduce practical metrics to quantify the performance and robustness of TPDs beyond just the Petermann noise factor. Our formalism and experimental methods unify previous EP and TPD configurations and may lead to the realization of robust TPD-enhanced sensors.</description>

      <title>Anomalous localization of light in one-dimensional L\'evy photonic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localization of coherent propagating waves has been extensively studied over the years, primarily in homogeneous random media. However, significantly less attention has been given to wave localization in inhomogeneous systems, where the standard picture of Anderson localization does not apply, as we demonstrate here. We fabricate photonic lattices with inhomogeneous disorder, modeled by heavy-tailed $\alpha$-stable distributions, and measure the output light intensity profiles. We demonstrate that the spatial localization of light is described by a stretched exponential function, with a stretching parameter $\alpha$, and an asymmetric localized profile with respect to the excitation site. We support our experimental and theoretical findings with extensive tight-binding simulations.</description>

      <title>Generation of frequency entanglement by rotating Doppler effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to generate the frequency entanglement, allowing a continuous generation of entangled two-photon states in a hybrid degree of freedom by post-manipulation. Our method is based on type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear crystal and the rotation Doppler effect by rotating the q-plates, without preset discrete frequency entanglement. This allows the arbitrary modification of frequency entangled photons in a wide frequency range at room temperature, offering enhanced flexibility for quantum information tasks and quantum metrology. We also analyze the entanglement state by a combined calculation for the joint spectrum and Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of the two photons, which can be used to reconstruct a restricted density matrix in the frequency space.</description>

      <title>Efficient broadband terahertz generation by above band-gap excitation of the pyroelectric ZnSnN2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) radiation is a powerful probe of low-energy excitations in all phases of matter. However, it remains a challenge to find materials that efficiently generate THz radiation in a broad range of frequencies following optical excitation. Here, we investigate a pyroelectric material, ZnSnN2, and find that above-band-gap excitation results in the efficient formation of an ultrafast photocurrent generating THz radiation. The resulting THz electric field spans a frequency range from below 1 to above 30 THz. Our results suggest that the photocurrent is primarily driven by an ultrafast pyroelectric effect where the photo-excited carriers screen the spontaneous electric polarization of ZnSnN2. Strong structural disorder reduces the photocarrier lifetime significantly and, thus, enables broadband operation. ZnSnN2 shows similar THz-emitter performance as the best spintronic THz emitters regarding bandwidth and amplitude. Our study unveils the large potential of pyroelectric materials as efficient and broadband THz emitters with built-in bias fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entangled two-mode Gaussian states constitute an important building block for continuous variable quantum computing and communication protocols and are thus of high demand for many experiments. In this work, we study such kind of states which are extracted from multimode light generated via type-II parametric down-conversion (PDC) in lossy waveguides. For such states, we demonstrate that the squeezing quantifies entanglement and we construct a measurement basis which results in the maximal bipartite entanglement. We illustrate our findings by numerically solving the spatial master equation for PDC in a Markovian environment. The optimal measurement modes are compared with two widely-used broadband bases: the Mercer-Wolf basis (the first-order coherence basis) and the Williamson-Euler basis.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution, we describe the status of our experiment aimed at measuring the gravitationally induced phase shift on path-entangled photons. We use a kilometer-scale fiber interferometer whose arms are vertically displaced in the Earth gravitational potential, allowing photons propagating at different heights to accumulate different phases. To date, this is the first experiment to measure this effect on massless particles, thereby experimentally combining general relativity and quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Current Crowding in a High-Efficiency Black Phosphorus Light-Emitting Diode Using a Reflective Back Contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a high-performance mid-infrared (MIR) light-emitting diode (LED) based on a black phosphorus (b-P)/n-MoS$_2$ heterojunction. A gold back contact combined with a rhenium-doped n-type MoS$_2$ layer is used to enhance light extraction. The device shows a MIR peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of (1.6 $\pm$ 0.2) % at room temperature and a record (7.0 $\pm$ 0.5) % EQE at 77 K, with a maximum radiant power density of (108 $\pm$ 8) W/cm2. Finite-element simulations highlight the importance of phonon-assisted band-to-band tunneling under reverse bias and the influence of carrier velocity saturation under forward bias. The simulations also reveal that the high ideality factors extracted from the current-voltage characteristic are due to current crowding at the heterojunction and a consequence of the device geometry. These findings establish a new high-performance b-P LED architecture and provide crucial insights into the physics of MIR sources based on 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Coherence Across the Brillouin Lasing Threshold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering is one of the most accessible nonlinear optical phenomena and has been widely studied since its theoretical discovery one hundred years ago. The scattering mechanism is a three-wave-mixing process between two optical fields and one acoustic field and has found a broad range of applications spanning microscopy to ultra-narrow-linewidth lasers. Building on the success of utilizing this nonlinearity at a classical level, a rich avenue is now being opened to explore Brillouin scattering within the paradigm of quantum optics. Here, we take a key step in this direction by employing quantum optical techniques yet to be utilized for Brillouin scattering to characterize the second-order coherence of Stokes scattering across the Brillouin lasing threshold. We use a silica microsphere resonator and single-photon counters to observe the expected transition from bunched statistics of thermal light below the lasing threshold to Poissonian statistics of coherent light above the threshold. Notably, at powers approaching the lasing threshold, we also observe super-thermal statistics, which arise due to instability and a "flickering" in and out of lasing as the pump field is transiently depleted. The statistics observed across the transition, including the "flickering", are a result of the full nonlinear three-wave-mixing process and cannot be captured by a linearized model. These measurements are in good agreement with numerical solutions of the three-wave Langevin equations and are well demarcated by analytical expressions for the instability and the lasing thresholds. These results demonstrate that applying second-order-coherence and photon-counting measurements to Brillouin scattering provides new methods to advance our understanding of Brillouin scattering itself and progress toward quantum-state preparation and characterization of acoustic modes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit computational methods to obtain an angular profile of optical scattering from a smooth surface, given a two-dimensional map of topographic height errors of the surface. Quick derivations of some traditional equations and relevant references are organized to shorten the search time. A practical data-processing flow of the methods is discussed. As a case study of this flow, the core mirrors of the KAGRA interferometer are examined, and we obtain a representative scattering profile that is easily applicable to ray-tracing simulations.</description>

      <title>Online training and pruning of multi-wavelength photonic neural networks</title>

Abstract: CMOS-compatible photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are emerging as a promising platform in artificial intelligence (AI) computing. Owing to the compact footprint of microring resonators (MRRs) and the enhanced interconnect efficiency enabled by wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), MRR-based photonic neural networks (PNNs) are particularly promising for large-scale integration. However, the scalability and energy efficiency of such systems are fundamentally limited by the MRR resonance wavelength variations induced by fabrication process variations (FPVs) and environmental fluctuations. Existing solutions use post-fabrication approaches or thermo-optic tuning, incurring high control power and additional process complexity. In this work, we introduce an online training and pruning method that addresses this challenge, adapting to FPV-induced and thermally induced shifts in MRR resonance wavelength. By incorporating a power-aware pruning term into the conventional loss function, our approach simultaneously optimizes the PNN accuracy and the total power consumption for MRR tuning. In proof-of-concept on-chip experiments on the Iris dataset, our system PNNs can adaptively train to maintain a 96% classification accuracy, while achieving a 44.7% reduction in tuning power via pruning. Additionally, our approach reduces the power consumption by orders-of-magnitude on larger datasets. By addressing chip-to-chip variation and minimizing power requirements, our approach significantly improves the scalability and energy efficiency of MRR-based integrated analog photonic processors, paving the way for large-scale PICs to enable versatile applications including neural networks, photonic switching, LiDAR, and radio-frequency beamforming.</description>

      <title>Limits of nonlinear and dispersive fiber propagation for an optical fiber-based extreme learning machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a generalized nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation simulation model of an extreme learning machine (ELM) based on optical fiber propagation. Using the MNIST handwritten digit dataset as a benchmark, we study how accuracy depends on propagation dynamics, as well as parameters governing spectral encoding, readout, and noise. For this dataset and with quantum noise limited input, test accuracies of : over 91% and 93% are found for propagation in the anomalous and normal dispersion regimes respectively. Our results also suggest that quantum noise on the input pulses introduces an intrinsic penalty to ELM performance.</description>

      <title>High-throughput polarization-independent spatial mode shaping with mode-selective photonic lanterns</title>

Abstract: Coherent interference in multimode photonic systems offers a transformative approach for scalable, high-fidelity optical control, enabling precise beam shaping, efficient power delivery, and advanced signal processing through single-mode performance. Current techniques are often constrained to a single polarization state of light, system complexity, and the fabrication challenges associated with precise waveguide structures. Here, we present a high-efficiency coherent combination scheme employing a commercial mode-selective photonic lantern supporting three spatial channels, achieving Gaussian mode interference at multiple locations along the multimode core with up to 100% mode conversion efficiencies. By integrating a Faraday reflecting fibre component and piezo-phase shifters with the photonic lantern channels, we demonstrate stable and adaptive mode manipulation without the need for complex adaptive optics. These findings highlight the potential of photonic lanterns as robust platforms for controlled mode interference, paving the way for their deployment in next-generation optical communication, beam shaping, and beam-forming systems.</description>

Abstract: In active imaging protocols, information about an object is encoded into the spatial mode of a scattered photon. Recently the quantum limits of active imaging have been explored with levitated nanoparticles, which experience a multimode radiation pressure backaction (the photon recoil force) due to radiative scattering of the probe field. Here we extend the analysis of multimode backaction to compliant surfaces, accessing a broad class of mechanical resonators and fruitful analogies to quantum imaging. As an example, we consider imaging of the flexural modes of a membrane by sorting the spatial modes of a laser reflected from its surface. We show that backaction in this setting can be understood to arise from spatiotemporal photon shot noise, an effect that cannot be observed in single-mode optomechanics. We also derive the imprecision-backaction product in the limit of purely spatial (intermodal) coupling, revealing it to be equivalent to the standard quantum limit for single-mode optomechanical coupling. Finally, we show that optomechanical correlations due to spatiotemporal backaction can give rise to two-mode entangled light, providing a mechanism for entangling desired pairs of spatial modes. In conjunction with high-Q nanomechanics, our findings point to new opportunities at the interface of quantum imaging and optomechanics, including sensors and networks enhanced by spatial mode entanglement.</description>

      <title>Learning the dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems from experimental data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian algorithm to identify generators of open quantum system dynamics, described by a Lindblad master equation, that are compatible with measured experimental data. The algorithm, based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, assumes the energy levels of the system are known and outputs a ranked list of interpretable master equation models that produce predicted measurement traces that closely match experimental data. We benchmark our algorithm on quantum optics experiments performed on single and pairs of quantum emitters. The latter case opens the possibility of cooperative emission effects and additional complexity due to the possible interplay between photon and phonon influences on the dynamics. Our algorithm retrieves various minimal models that are consistent with the experimental data, and which can provide a closer fit to measured data than previously suggested and physically expected approximate models. Our results represent an important step towards automated systems characterisation with an approach that is capable of working with diverse and tomographically incomplete input data. This may help with the development of theoretical models for unknown quantum systems as well as providing scientists with alternative interpretations of the data that they might not have originally envisioned and enabling them to challenge their original hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Dynamical thermalization, Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, vortexes and wave collapse in quantum chaos fibers and fluid of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06534</link>

Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the time evolution of a nonlinear field described by the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in a chaotic $D$-shape billiard. In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fr\"ohlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. The evolution to the thermal state is characterized by an unusual entropy time dependence with an increase on short times and later significant decrease when approaching to the steady-state. This behavior is opposite to the Boltzmann H-theorem and is attributed to the formation of Rayleigh-Jeans condensate and presence of two integrals of motion, energy and norm. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity.
  System parameters for optical fiber experimental studies of these effects are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Universality of Photonic Interlacing Architectures for Learning Discrete Linear Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations suggest that the discrete linear unitary group $U(N)$ can be represented by interlacing a finite sequence of diagonal phase operations with an intervening unitary operator. However, despite rigorous numerical justifications, no formal proof has been provided. Here, we show that elements of $U(N)$ can be decomposed into a sequence of $N$-parameter phases alternating with $1$-parameter propagators of a lattice Hamiltonian. The proof is based on building a Lie group by alternating these two operators and showing its completeness to represent $U(N)$ for a finite number of layers, which is numerically found to be exactly $N$. This architecture can be implemented using elementary optical components and can successfully reconstruct arbitrary unitary matrices. We propose example devices such as optical logic gates, which perform logic gate operations using a single-layer lossless and passive optical circuit design.</description>
