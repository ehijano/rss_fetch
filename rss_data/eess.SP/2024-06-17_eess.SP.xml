      <title>Machine learning-based Near-field Emitter Localization via Grouped Hybrid Analog and Digital Massive MIMO Receive Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fully-digital massive MIMO receive array is promising to meet the high-resolution requirement of near-field (NF) emitter localization, but it also results in the significantly increasing of hardware costs and algorithm complexity. In order to meet the future demand for green communication while maintaining high performance, the grouped hybrid analog and digital (HAD) structure is proposed for NF DOA estimation, which divides the large-scale receive array into small-scale groups and each group contains several subarrays. Thus the NF direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation problem is viewed as far-field (FF) within each group, and some existing methods such as MUSIC, Root-MUSIC, ESPRIT, etc., can be adopted. Then by angle calibration, a candidate position set is generated. To eliminate the phase ambiguity arising from the HAD structure and obtain the emitter position, two low-complexity clustering-based methods, minimum sample distance clustering (MSDC) and range scatter diagram (RSD) - angle scatter diagram (ASD)-based DBSCAN (RSD-ASD-DBSCAN), are proposed based on the distribution features of samples in the candidate position set. Then to further improve the localization accuracy, a model-driven regression network (RegNet) is designed, which consists of a multi-layer neural network (MLNN) for false solution elimination and a perceptron for angle fusion. Finally, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of NF emitter localization for the proposed grouped HAD structure is also derived. The simulation results show that the proposed methods can achieve CRLB at different SNR regions, the RegNet has great performance advantages at low SNR regions and the clustering-based methods have much lower complexity.</description>

      <title>Semi-Blind Multi-Tag Ambient Backscatter Communications Using Radar Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a backscatter communication system wherein multiple asynchronous sources (tags) exploit the reverberation generated by a nearby radar transmitter as an ambient carrier to deliver a message to a common destination (reader) through a number of available subchannels. We propose a new encoding strategy wherein each tag transmits both pilot and data symbols on each subchannel and repeats some of the data symbols on multiple subchannels. We then exploit this signal structure to derive two semi-blind iterative algorithms for joint estimation of the data symbols and the subchannel responses that are also able to handle some missing measurements. The proposed encoding/decoding strategies are scalable with the number of tags and their payload and can achieve different tradeoffs in terms of transmission and error rates. Some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the merits of the proposed solutions.</description>

      <title>Self-Sustainable Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for Anti-Jamming in Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless devices can be easily attacked by jammers during transmission, which is a potential security threat for wireless communications. Active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) attracts considerable attention and is expected to be employed in anti-jamming systems for secure transmission to significantly enhance the anti-jamming performance. However, active RIS introduces external power load, which increases the complexity of hardware and restricts the flexible deployment of active RIS. To overcome these drawbacks, we design a innovative self-sustainable structure in this paper, where the active RIS is energized by harvesting energy from base station (BS) signals through the time dividing based simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (TD-SWIPT) scheme. Based on the above structure, we develop the BS harvesting scheme based on joint transmit and reflecting beamforming with the aim of maximizing the achievable rate of active RIS-assisted system, where the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) tackles the nonconvex optimization problem in the scheme. Simulation results verified the effectiveness of our developed BS harvesting scheme, which can attain higher anti-jamming performance than other schemes when given the same maximum transmit power.</description>

      <title>Fair GLASSO: Estimating Fair Graphical Models with Unbiased Statistical Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose estimating Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) that are fair with respect to sensitive nodal attributes. Many real-world models exhibit unfair discriminatory behavior due to biases in data. Such discrimination is known to be exacerbated when data is equipped with pairwise relationships encoded in a graph. Additionally, the effect of biased data on graphical models is largely underexplored. We thus introduce fairness for graphical models in the form of two bias metrics to promote balance in statistical similarities across nodal groups with different sensitive attributes. Leveraging these metrics, we present Fair GLASSO, a regularized graphical lasso approach to obtain sparse Gaussian precision matrices with unbiased statistical dependencies across groups. We also propose an efficient proximal gradient algorithm to obtain the estimates. Theoretically, we express the tradeoff between fair and accurate estimated precision matrices. Critically, this includes demonstrating when accuracy can be preserved in the presence of a fairness regularizer. On top of this, we study the complexity of Fair GLASSO and demonstrate that our algorithm enjoys a fast convergence rate. Our empirical validation includes synthetic and real-world simulations that illustrate the value and effectiveness of our proposed optimization problem and iterative algorithm.</description>

      <title>Brief research of traditional and AI-based models for IMD2 cancellation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the limited isolation of duplexer's stopband transceivers operating in frequency division duplex (FDD) encounter a leakage of the transmitted signal onto the receiving path. Leakage signal with the combination of the second-order nonlinearity of the low noise amplifier (LNA) and receiver down-conversion mixer may lead to second-order intermodulation distortion (IMD2) generation thus greatly reducing the receiver sensitivity. Cancellation of undesirable interferences based on adaptation of traditional models such as memoryless and memory polynomials, spline polynomial based Hammerstein and Wiener-Hammerstein models proved its efficiency in case of well-known nonlinearity nature. On the other hand, currently there is an intensive research in the field of nonlinearity detection by means of neural network (NN) structures. NN-based IMD cancellers are effective in the case of unknown interference content due to their high generalization ability. Therefore, NN approach can provide universal model, which is capable of IMD suppression even in case it is hard to separate intermodulation products generated by LNA, down-conversion mixer or even power amplifier in transmitter path. Nevertheless, such structures suffer from high complexity and can`t be implemented in hardware. Current paper presents low-complexity feed-forward NN-based model, which successfully competes with traditional architectures in terms of computational complexity. The testbench results demonstrate the acceptable performance of provided model, which can be equal to the polynomial nonlinear canceler's performance at a reduced computational cost. Current paper provides performance and required resources comparison of traditional memory polynomial-based scheme and NN-based model for IMD2 cancellation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Personalization of Amplification in Hearing Aids via Multi-band Bayesian Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalization of the amplification function of hearing aids has been shown to be of benefit to hearing aid users in previous studies. Several machine learning-based personalization approaches have been introduced in the literature. This paper presents a machine learning personalization approach with the advantage of being efficient in its training based on paired comparisons which makes it practical and field deployable. The training efficiency of this approach is the result of treating frequency bands independent of one another and by simultaneously carrying out Bayesian machine learning in each band across all of the frequency bands. Simulation results indicate that this approach leads to an estimated hearing preference function close to the true hearing preference function in fewer number of paired comparisons relative to the previous machine learning approaches. In addition, a clinical experiment conducted on eight subjects with hearing impairment indicate that this training efficient personalization approach provides personalized gain settings which are on average six times more preferred over the standard prescriptive gain settings.</description>

      <title>RASPNet: A Benchmark Dataset for Radar Adaptive Signal Processing Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a large-scale dataset for radar adaptive signal processing (RASP) applications, aimed at supporting the development of data-driven models within the radar community. The dataset, called RASPNet, consists of 100 realistic scenarios compiled over a variety of topographies and land types from across the contiguous United States, designed to reflect a diverse array of real-world environments. Within each scenario, RASPNet consists of 10,000 clutter realizations from an airborne radar setting, which can be utilized for radar algorithm development and evaluation. RASPNet intends to fill a prominent gap in the availability of a large-scale, realistic dataset that standardizes the evaluation of adaptive radar processing techniques. We describe its construction, organization, and several potential applications, which includes a transfer learning example to demonstrate how RASPNet can be leveraged for realistic adaptive radar processing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Full-reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment Using Spectral Graph Wavelets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point clouds in 3D applications frequently experience quality degradation during processing, e.g., scanning and compression. Reliable point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) is important for developing compression algorithms with good bitrate-quality trade-offs and techniques for quality improvement (e.g., denoising). This paper introduces a full-reference (FR) PCQA method utilizing spectral graph wavelets (SGWs). First, we propose novel SGW-based PCQA metrics that compare SGW coefficients of coordinate and color signals between reference and distorted point clouds. Second, we achieve accurate PCQA by integrating several conventional FR metrics and our SGW-based metrics using support vector regression. To our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce SGWs for PCQA. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed PCQA metric is more accurately correlated with subjective quality scores compared to conventional PCQA metrics.</description>

      <title>An I2I Inpainting Approach for Efficient Channel Knowledge Map Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) has received widespread attention as an emerging enabling technology for environment-aware wireless communications. It involves the construction of databases containing location-specific channel knowledge, which are then leveraged to facilitate channel state information (CSI) acquisition and transceiver design. In this context, a fundamental challenge lies in efficiently constructing the CKM based on a given wireless propagation environment. Most existing methods are based on stochastic modeling and sequence prediction, which do not fully exploit the inherent physical characteristics of the propagation environment, resulting in low accuracy and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a Laplacian pyramid (LP)-based CKM construction scheme to predict the channel knowledge at arbitrary locations in a targeted area. Specifically, we first view the channel knowledge as a 2-D image and transform the CKM construction problem into an image-to-image (I2I) inpainting task, which predicts the channel knowledge at a specific location by recovering the corresponding pixel value in the image matrix. Then, inspired by the reversible and closed-form structure of the LP, we show its natural suitability for our task in designing a fast I2I mapping network. For different frequency components of LP decomposition, we design tailored networks accordingly. Besides, to encode the global structural information of the propagation environment, we introduce self-attention and cross-covariance attention mechanisms in different layers, respectively. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the benchmark, achieving higher reconstruction accuracy while with lower computational complexity. Moreover, the proposed approach has a strong generalization ability and can be implemented in different wireless communication scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multiple Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces Collaborative Wireless Localization System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09846v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) collaborative localization system where multiple semi-passive IRSs are deployed in the network to locate one or more targets based on time-of-arrival. It is assumed that each semi-passive IRS is equipped with reflective elements and sensors, which are used to establish the line-of-sight links from the base station (BS) to multiple targets and process echo signals, respectively. Based on the above model, we derive the Fisher information matrix of the echo signal with respect to the time delay. By employing the chain rule and exploiting the geometric relationship between time delay and position, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target's Cartesian coordinate position is derived. Then, we propose a two-stage algorithmic framework to minimize CRB in single- and multi-target localization systems by joint optimizing active beamforming at BS, passive beamforming at multiple IRSs and IRS selection. For the single-target case, we derive the optimal closed-form solution for multiple IRSs coefficients design and propose a lowcomplexity algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers to obtain the optimal solution for active beaming design. For the multi-target case, alternating optimization is used to transform the original problem into two subproblems where semi-definite relaxation and successive convex approximation are applied to tackle the quadraticity and indefiniteness in the CRB expression, respectively. Finally, numerical simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for multiple IRSs collaborative localization system compared to other benchmark schemes as well as the significant performance gains.</description>

      <title>Is it Truly Necessary for Bicycle Power Meters to Rapidly Sample Angular Velocity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bicycle Power Meters have become ubiquitous in professional and amateur cycling. These devices claim high levels of accuracy, and this accuracy is indeed essential if they are to serve their purpose as reliable training aids and indicators of improvements in fitness. Power is generally obtained via the independent estimation of torque and angular velocity. Designs vary in the way in which they estimate angular velocity. Some power meters estimate angular velocity many times a second, whereas other power meters compute an average value for each pedal stroke. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether it is necessary to rapidly sample angular velocity in order to obtain accurate power values under conditions of dynamic equilibrium. Countering previous research on the topic, this paper finds that average angular velocity alone is usually sufficient for the purposes of computing power, although there may be certain exceptional circumstances where consideration of harmonics may appreciably improve fidelity.</description>

      <title>Compressed Sensor Caching and Collaborative Sparse Data Recovery with Anchor Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work examines the compressed sensor caching problem in wireless sensor networks and devises efficient distributed sparse data recovery algorithms to enable collaboration among multiple caches. In this problem, each cache is only allowed to access measurements from a small subset of sensors within its vicinity to reduce both cache size and data acquisition overhead. To enable reliable data recovery with limited access to measurements, we propose a distributed sparse data recovery method, called the collaborative sparse recovery by anchor alignment (CoSR-AA) algorithm, where collaboration among caches is enabled by aligning their locally recovered data at a few anchor nodes. The proposed algorithm is based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm but with message exchange that is reduced by considering the proposed anchor alignment strategy. Then, by the deep unfolding of the ADMM iterations, we further propose the Deep CoSR-AA algorithm that can be used to significantly reduce the number of iterations. We obtain a graph neural network architecture where message exchange is done more efficiently by an embedded autoencoder. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed collaborative recovery algorithms in terms of the improved reconstruction quality and the reduced communication overhead due to anchor alignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel anti-interference technique, semantic interference cancellation (SemantIC), for enhancing information quality towards the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. SemantIC only requires the receiver to concatenate the channel decoder with a semantic auto-encoder. This constructs a turbo loop which iteratively and alternately eliminates noise in the signal domain and the semantic domain. From the viewpoint of network information theory, the neural network of the semantic auto-encoder stores side information by training, and provides side information in iterative decoding, as an implementation of the Wyner-Ziv theorem. Simulation results verify the performance improvement by SemantIC without extra channel resource cost.</description>

      <title>LPD-Aware Uplink CSI-based 5G NR Downlink Synchronization for Tactical Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 5G NR is touted to be an attractive candidate for tactical networks owing to its versatility, scalability, and low cost. However, tactical networks need to be stealthy, where an adversary is not able to detect or intercept the tactical communication. In this paper, we investigate the stealthiness of 5G NR by looking at the probability with which an adversary that monitors the downlink synchronization signals can detect the presence of the network. We simulate a single-cell single-eavesdropper scenario and evaluate the probability with which the eavesdropper can detect the synchronization signal block when using either a correlator or an energy detector. We show that this probability is close to $ 100\% $ suggesting that 5G out-of-the-box is not suitable for a tactical network. We then propose utilizing the uplink channel-state-information to beamform the downlink synchronization-signals towards the tactical user-equipment (UE) to lower the eavesdropper detection probability while not compromising the performance of the legitimate tactical UE.</description>

      <title>Downlink Power Control based UE-Sided Initial Access for Tactical 5G NR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Communication technologies play a crucial role in battlefields. They are an inalienable part of any tactical response, whether at the battlefront or inland. Such scenarios require that the communication technologies be versatile, scalable, cost-effective, and stealthy. While multiple studies and past products have tried to address these requirements, none of them have been able to solve all the four challenges simultaneously. Hence, in this paper, we propose a tactical solution that is based on the versatile, scalable, and cost effective 5G NR system. Our focus is on the initial-access phase which is subject to a high probability of detection by an eavesdropper. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that involves some modifications to the initial access procedure that lowers the probability of detection while not affecting standards compliance and not requiring any modifications to the user equipment chipset implementation. Further, we demonstrate that with a simple downlink power control algorithm, we reduce the probability of detection at an eavesdropper. The result is a 5G NR based initial-access method that improves stealthiness when compared with a vanilla 5G NR implementation.</description>

      <title>A Pixel-based Reconfigurable Antenna Design for Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid Antenna Systems (FASs) have recently been proposed for enhancing the performance of wireless communication. Previous antenna designs to meet the requirements of FAS have been based on mechanically movable or liquid antennas and therefore have limited reconfiguration speeds. In this paper, we propose a design for a pixel-based reconfigurable antenna (PRA) that meets the requirements of FAS and the required switching speed. It can provide 12 FAS ports across 1/2 wavelength and consists of an E-slot patch antenna and an upper reconfigurable pixel layer with 6 RF switches. Simulation and experimental results from a prototype operating at 2.5 GHz demonstrate that the design can meet the requirements of FAS including port correlation with matched impedance.</description>

      <title>Training from Zero: Radio Frequency Machine Learning Data Quantity Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.03703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The data used during training in any given application space is directly tied to the performance of the system once deployed. While there are many other factors that go into producing high performance models within machine learning, there is no doubt that the data used to train a system provides the foundation from which to build. One of the underlying rule of thumb heuristics used within the machine learning space is that more data leads to better models, but there is no easy answer for the question, "How much data is needed?" This work examines a modulation classification problem in the Radio Frequency domain space, attempting to answer the question of how much training data is required to achieve a desired level of performance, but the procedure readily applies to classification problems across modalities. The ultimate goal is determining an approach that requires the least amount of data collection to better inform a more thorough collection effort to achieve the desired performance metric. While this approach will require an initial dataset that is germane to the problem space to act as a \textit{target} dataset on which metrics are extracted, the goal is to allow for the initial data to be orders of magnitude smaller than what is required for delivering a system that achieves the desired performance. An additional benefit of the techniques presented here is that the quality of different datasets can be numerically evaluated and tied together with the quantity of data, and ultimately, the performance of the architecture in the problem domain.</description>

      <title>Harmonics of Learning: Universal Fourier Features Emerge in Invariant Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we formally prove that, under certain conditions, if a neural network is invariant to a finite group then its weights recover the Fourier transform on that group. This provides a mathematical explanation for the emergence of Fourier features -- a ubiquitous phenomenon in both biological and artificial learning systems. The results hold even for non-commutative groups, in which case the Fourier transform encodes all the irreducible unitary group representations. Our findings have consequences for the problem of symmetry discovery. Specifically, we demonstrate that the algebraic structure of an unknown group can be recovered from the weights of a network that is at least approximately invariant within certain bounds. Overall, this work contributes to a foundation for an algebraic learning theory of invariant neural network representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are rapidly gaining prominence in the realm of fifth generation (5G)-Advanced, and predominantly, sixth generation (6G) mobile networks, offering a revolutionary approach to optimizing wireless communications. This article delves into the intricate world of the RIS technology, exploring its diverse hardware architectures and the resulting versatile operating modes. These include RISs with signal reception and processing units, sensors, amplification units, transmissive capability, multiple stacked components, and dynamic metasurface antennas. Furthermore, we shed light on emerging RIS applications, such as index and reflection modulation, non-coherent modulation, next generation multiple access, integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), energy harvesting, as well as aerial and vehicular networks. These exciting applications are set to transform the way we will wirelessly connect in the upcoming era of 6G. Finally, we review recent experimental RIS setups and present various open problems of the overviewed RIS hardware architectures and their applications. From enhancing network coverage to enabling new communication paradigms, RIS-empowered connectivity is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of wireless networking. This article unveils the underlying principles and potential impacts of RISs, focusing on cutting-edge developments of this physical-layer smart connectivity technology.</description>

      <title>Gradient Coding in Decentralized Learning for Evading Stragglers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a decentralized learning problem in the presence of stragglers. Although gradient coding techniques have been developed for distributed learning to evade stragglers, where the devices send encoded gradients with redundant training data, it is difficult to apply those techniques directly to decentralized learning scenarios. To deal with this problem, we propose a new gossip-based decentralized learning method with gradient coding (GOCO). In the proposed method, to avoid the negative impact of stragglers, the parameter vectors are updated locally using encoded gradients based on the framework of stochastic gradient coding and then averaged in a gossip-based manner. We analyze the convergence performance of GOCO for strongly convex loss functions. And we also provide simulation results to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of learning performance compared with the baseline methods.</description>
