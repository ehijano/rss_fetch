      <title>Synergistic Effects of Spin-Orbit Coupling and Intercomponent Interactions in Two-Component (2+1)D Photonic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study investigates the formation, stability and dynamic advancement of two-dimensional vortex quantum droplets within binary Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), shaped by the interplay of photonic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and quantum fluctuation effects. SOC leads to significant droplet stretching, resulting in vortex clusters forming in each component. The competition between photonic SOC and Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) interactions introduces vortices into the condensate, described by the numerically solved Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). The results show that droplets like structures arise at low SOC strengths and interaction parameters. The transition to vortex takes place as the SOC increases. Enhanced interactions give rise to the emergence of quantum droplets as the vortices dissipate, demonstrating fascinating dynamics. These findings enhance understanding of the physical properties of photonic SOC coupled binary BECs in 2D with LHY correction, impacting cold-atom physics and condensed matter research. The study can also be expanded to explore quantum droplets with a small atom count, which is advantageous for experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Analytic Phase Solution and Point Vortex Model for Dipolar Quantum Vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an analytic expression for the phase of a quantum vortex in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate, capturing anisotropic effects from long-range dipole-dipole interactions. This solution provides a foundation for a dipolar point vortex model (DPVM), incorporating both phase-driven flow and dipolar forces. The DPVM reproduces key features of vortex pair dynamics seen in full simulations, including anisotropic velocities, deformed orbits, and directional motion, offering a minimal and accurate model for dipolar vortex dynamics. Our results open the door to analytic studies of vortices in dipolar quantum matter and establish a new platform for exploring vortex dynamics and turbulence in these systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In one dimension, in a closed system, the Tonks-Girardau gas is integrable even for finite temperatures and time-evolving systems. We address the question if it remains integrable once the system is no longer closed. We consider its lattice version under incoherent local pump and loss and show by using random matrix theory that the statistics of the complex spatial ratio indicates that the system is chaotic. Further, we show that the model belongs in the AI$^{\dagger}$ universality class of random matrices. In addition to this analysis, we investigate an emergent stripe-pattern in the spectrum and relate it to the dissipative parameters of the model.</description>

      <title>Early time hydrodynamic attractor in a nearly-unitary Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractors paradigm aims to explain fast applicability of hydrodynamics at ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC in terms of the emergence of a universal behaviour across different initial states. The attractors observed in theoretical models are first driven by a rapid expansion of matter, which later gives way to the decay of exponentially damped transient excitations into the viscous fluid regime. Recently a theoretical proposal was made how to realize hydrodynamic attractors in cold atomic gases focusing on the decay of transients and opening prospects for a future experimental realization in table top experiments. Motivated by this, in the present paper we show how the far-from-equilibrium, expansion-driven part of the hydrodynamic attractor emerges in a model of a nearly-unitary Fermi gas dynamics under full theoretical control.</description>

      <title>Emergent interaction-driven elliptic flow of few fermionic atoms</title>

Abstract: Hydrodynamics provides a successful framework to effectively describe the dynamics of complex many-body systems ranging from subnuclear to cosmological scales by introducing macroscopic quantities such as particle densities and fluid velocities. According to textbook knowledge, it requires coarse graining over microscopic constituents to define a macroscopic fluid cell, which is large compared to the interparticle spacing and the mean free path. In addition, the entire system must consist of many such fluid cells. In high energy heavy ion collisions, hydrodynamic behaviour is inferred from the observation of elliptic flow. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of elliptic flow in a system of few strongly interacting atoms. In our system a hydrodynamic description is a priori not applicable, as all relevant length scales, i.e. the system size, the inter-particle spacing, and the mean free path are comparable. The single particle resolution, deterministic control over particle number and interaction strength in our experiment allow us to explore the boundaries between a microscopic description and a hydrodynamic framework in unprecedented detail.</description>

      <title>Dissipative realization of Kondo models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Kondo effect can be induced through non-linear dissipative channels, without requiring any coherent interaction on the impurity site. Specifically, we consider a reservoir of noninteracting fermions that can hop on a few impurity sites that are subjected to strong two-body losses. In the simplest case of a single lossy site, we recover the Anderson impurity model in the regime of infinite repulsion, with a small residual dissipation as a perturbation. While the Anderson model gives rise to the Kondo effect, this residual dissipation competes with it, offering an instance of a nonlinear dissipative impurity where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics emerges from the same underlying physical process. We further outline how this dissipative engineering scheme can be extended to two or more lossy sites, realizing generalizations of the Kondo model with spin 1 or higher. Our results suggest alternative implementations of Kondo models using ultracold atoms in transport experiments, where localized dissipation can be naturally introduced, and the Kondo effect observed through conductance measurements.</description>

      <title>Stable singular fractional skyrmion spin texture from the quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability</title>

Abstract: Topology profoundly influences diverse fields of science, providing a powerful framework for classifying phases of matter and predicting nontrivial excitations, such as solitons, vortices, and skyrmions. These topological defects are typically characterized by integer numbers, called topological charges, representing the winding number in their order parameter field. The classification and prediction of topological defects, however, become challenging when singularities are included within the integration domain for calculating the topological charge. While such exotic nonlinear excitations have been proposed in the superfluid $^3$He-A phase and spinor Bose-Einstein condensate of atomic gases, experimental observation of these structures and studies of their stability have long been elusive. Here we report the observation of a singular skyrmion that goes beyond the framework of topology in a ferromagnetic superfluid. The exotic skyrmions are sustained by undergoing anomalous symmetry breaking associated with the eccentric spin singularity and carry half of the elementary charge, distinctive from conventional skyrmions or merons. By successfully realizing the universal regime of the quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, we identified the eccentric fractional skyrmions, produced by emission from a magnetic domain wall and a spontaneous splitting of an integer skyrmion with spin singularities. The singular skyrmions are stable and can be observed after 2~s of hold time. Our results confirm the universality between classical and quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities and broaden our understanding on complex nonlinear dynamics of nontrivial texture beyond skyrmion in topological quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Understanding many body systems is a key challenge in physics. Single atom resolved imaging techniques have unlocked access to microscopic correlations in ultracold quantum gases. However they cannot be used when the relevant length scales are obscured by the resolution of the detection technique. We present a matterwave magnification scheme, based on evolutions in optical potentials, tailored to magnify the wave function of atoms, such that all length scales can be resolved. To showcase this method, we image atoms in the strongly interacting regime, establishing a new way to characterize correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Condensation of Composite Bosonic Trions in Interacting Bose-Fermi Mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06854v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal a quantum coherent state characterized by composite bosonic trions, wherein paired fermions further bind with bosons, in one-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures.This phase emerges in two separate models, both featuring onsite boson-fermion attraction that induces negative binding energy for the composite trions. The first is the pair-hopping model, in which spinless fermions undergo pair hopping to form preformed pairs. The second is the extended Bose-Fermi Hubbard model, describing dipolar bosons and fermions with density-density interactions. Notably, the formation of composite trions is independent of the specific pairing interactions of fermions. Extensive density matrix renormalization group calculations demonstrate the quasi-condensation of the composite trions, evidenced by algebraically decaying correlations of trions, gapped single-particle excitations, and suppressed fermion pair correlations. Our findings provide valuable insights into the three-body pairing mechanism in mixed-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Variational approach to the dynamics of dissipative quantum impurity models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments with quantum simulators using ultracold atoms and superconducting qubits have demonstrated the potential of controlled dissipation as a versatile tool for realizing correlated many-body states. However, determining the dynamics of dissipative quantum many-body systems remains a significant analytical and numerical challenge. In this work, we focus on a dissipative impurity problem as a testbed for new methodological developments. We introduce an efficient non-perturbative framework that combines the superposition of Gaussian states (SGS) variational ansatz with the quantum trajectory approach to simulate open systems featuring a dissipative impurity. Applying this method to a spinful impurity subject to two-body losses and embedded in a bath of noninteracting fermions, we explore the full crossover from weak to strong dissipation regimes. The non-perturbative nature of the SGS ansatz allows us to thoroughly examine this crossover, providing comprehensive insights into the system's behavior. In the strong dissipation regime, our approach reproduces the finding that localized two-body losses can induce the Kondo effect [arXiv:2406.03527], characterized by a slowdown of spin relaxation and an enhancement of charge conductance. Furthermore, we reveal an exotic ``negative conductance" phenomenon at zero potential bias -- a counter-intuitive single-body effect resulting from intermediate dissipation and finite bandwidth. Finally, we investigate the formation of ferromagnetic domains and propose an extension to realize a higher-spin Kondo model using localized dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the study of the interplay between scaling symmetries and statistics to one-dimensional fluids by studying the Calogero model in a harmonic trap modulated through time. The latter harbors an interpretation in terms of free particles imbued with exclusion statistics and is an example of a scale invariant fluid in one-dimension displaying $\mathrm{SO(2,1)}$ dynamical symmetry preserved by harmonic traps. Taking advantage of the dynamical symmetry, two experimentally relevant drive protocols spanning both quasistatic and nonadiabatic regimes are investigated and universal signatures of the interactions and exclusion statistics are uncovered in the ground-state echo amplitude and closely related ground-state fidelity. In particular, under both periodic modulation and slow drive through the gapless point of the trap frequency, enhanced interactions and exclusion are shown to favor the proliferation of defects and to hinder their annihilation, which leads to a universal decrease of ground-state fidelities and echo amplitudes. We also show that increasing exclusion sparks a sharp suppression of the likelihood of intermediate echoes beyond those imposed by the commensurability of a periodic drive and the natural frequency of the trap.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of nonequilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter, fundamental high-energy processes, quantum metrology, and quantum algorithms. Here, we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)D Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (Higgs) mode. These observations offer a unique viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum processes.</description>

      <title>Geometric orthogonal metals: Hidden antiferromagnetism and pseudogap from fluctuating stripes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the key features of hole-doped cuprates is the presence of an extended pseudogap phase, whose microscopic origin has been the subject of intense investigation since its discovery and is believed to be crucial for understanding high-temperature superconductivity. Various explanations have been proposed for the pseudogap, including links to symmetry-breaking orders such as stripes or pairing, and the emergence of novel fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) and orthogonal metal (OM) phases. The topological nature of FL* and OM phases has been identified as scenarios compatible with a small Fermi surface without symmetry breaking, as suggested experimentally. With recent experimental and numerical studies supporting an intricate relationship between stripe order and the pseudogap phase, we here propose an alternative scenario: an orthogonal metal with a geometric origin (GOM) driven by fluctuating domain walls. The essential mechanism behind our proposal is hidden order, where the proliferation of domain walls stabilized by charge fluctuations obscures the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic order in real-space, but order is preserved in the reference frame of the background spins. As a result, well-defined fermionic quasiparticles in the form of magnetic polarons exist, which couple to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological excitations of the domain wall string-net condensate in the ground state and constitute a small Fermi surface. At a critical doping value, we argue that hidden order is lost, driving a transition to a regular Fermi liquid at a hidden quantum critical point (hQCP) featuring quantum critical transport properties. Our GOM framework establishes a deep connection between the antiferromagnetic, stripe, and pseudogap phases, and suggests a possible unification of superconductivity in (electron and hole) doped cuprates and heavy fermion compounds.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the reduction in transfer caused by static disorder, white noise, and finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusion, normal diffusion and chaos in semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chains</title>

Abstract: We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions IV: Coulomb corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formalism developed in Refs.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal,Guo:2024pvt} that relates the integrated correlation functions for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral is further extended to include Coulomb interaction between charged particles. The original formalism cannot be applied due to different divergent asymptotic behavior resulting from the long-range nature of the Coulomb force. We show that a modified formula in which the difference of integrated correlation functions between particles interacting with Coulomb plus short-range interaction and with Coulomb interaction alone is free of divergence, and has rapid approach to its infinite volume limit. Using an exactly solvable model, we demonstrate that the short-range potential scattering phase shifts can be reliably extracted from the formula in the presence of Coulomb interaction.</description>
