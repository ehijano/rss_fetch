      <title>Destructive Interference induced constraints in Floquet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the paradigm of destructive many-body interference between quantum trajectories as a means to systematically generate prethermal kinetically constrained dynamics in Floquet systems driven at special frequencies. Depending on the processes that are suppressed by interference, the constraint may or may not be associated with an emergent global conservation; the latter kind having no mechanism of generation in time-independent settings. As an example, we construct an one-dimensional interacting spin model exhibiting strong Hilbert space fragmentation with and without dipole moment conservation, depending on the drive frequency. By probing the spatiotemporal profile of the out-of-time-ordered correlator, we show that this model, in particular, has initial states in which quantum information can be spatially localized - a useful feature in the field of quantum technologies. Our paradigm unifies various types of Hilbert space fragmentation that can be realized in driven systems.</description>

      <title>Multiple Dirac Spin-Orbital Liquids in SU(4) Heisenberg Antiferromagnets on the Honeycomb Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the strong coupling model of $d^1$ transition metal tri-halides in the large spin-orbit coupled limit. By considering ab-initio-calculation-inspired hierarchy of hopping pathways of these compounds, SU(4) symmetry is found to emerge at multiple points in the parameter space of the hopping parameters. The resultant Dirac spin-orbital liquids, within the parton mean field description, are distinct. The calculated dynamical structure factor fingerprints this distinctive nature, giving rise to observable effects. This opens up a playground for SU(4) Dirac Spin-Orbital liquid in $d^1$ Honeycomb lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Higher-Dimensional Chirally Stabilized Fixed Points and Their Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Fermi liquids in $d&gt;2$ remain poorly understood, particularly when relevant perturbations destabilize them. In one spatial dimension, chirally stabilized fixed points provide a rare class of analytically tractable non-Fermi-liquid critical points, but their higher-dimensional analogues have been elusive. Here, we develop a Wilsonian operator-product-expansion renormalization group scheme that captures power-divergent terms and use it to construct finite-$N$ higher-dimensional analogues of chirally stabilized fixed points in arbitrary dimension $d\le4$. This exposes a conformal window at finite $N$. We further show that symmetry-breaking masses, far from being trivial, can collapse this window and drive the system to strong coupling, triggering dynamical mass generation.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Intersite Charge Transfer, Antiferromagnetism, and Strain in Barocaloric ACu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ Quadruple Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a minimal Landau theory for the concomitant intersite charge-transfer, antiferromagnetic, and isostructural phase transitions in ACu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ perovskites (A = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb). The model incorporates the difference in average ligand-hole occupancy between Cu and Fe, the staggered magnetization of the Fe sublattice, volume strain, and intrinsic thermal expansion, together with their couplings. It qualitatively reproduces key thermodynamic properties of the ACu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ family, including the staggered magnetization, lattice volume, magnetic susceptibility, and the nearly linear temperature-pressure phase boundary. The framework predicts a pronounced elastic softening near the phase boundary, consistent with experiments where the bulk modulus of the low-pressure, charge-transferred antiferromagnetic phase exceeds that of the high-pressure, non-transferred paramagnetic phase. It also yields pressure-driven isothermal entropy changes, revealing that the intrinsic thermal expansion of the high- and low-temperature phases significantly shapes the overall barocaloric response. These results contrast with previous analyses of NdCu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$, where thermal expansion was neglected in the entropy construction, and call for a reevaluation of barocaloric effects in quadruple perovskites.</description>

      <title>Itinerant and topological excitations in a honeycomb spiral spin liquid candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frustrated insulating magnet can stabilize a spiral spin liquid, arising from cooperative fluctuations among a subextensively degenerate manifold of spiral configurations, with ground-state wave vectors forming a continuous contour or surface in reciprocal space. The atomic-mixing-free honeycomb antiferromagnet GdZnPO has recently emerged as a promising spiral spin-liquid candidate, hosting nontrivial topological excitations. Despite growing interest, the transport and topological properties of spiral spin liquids remain largely unexplored experimentally. Here, we report transport measurements on high-quality, electrically insulating GdZnPO single crystals. We observe a giant low-temperature magnetic thermal conductivity down to $\sim$50 mK, described by $\kappa_{xx}^\mathrm{m}$ $\sim$ $\kappa_0+\kappa_1T$, where both $\kappa_0$ and $\kappa_1$ are positive constants associated with excitations along and off the spiral contour in reciprocal space, respectively. This behavior parallels the magnetic specific heat, underscoring the presence of mobile low-energy excitations intrinsic to the putative spiral spin liquid. Furthermore, the observed positive thermal Hall effect confirms the topological nature of at least some of these excitations. Our findings provide key insights into the itinerant and topological properties of low-lying spin excitations in the spiral spin-liquid candidate.</description>

      <title>Tunneling spectroscopy of the spinon-Kondo effect in one-dimensional Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the tunneling density of states (TDOS) in one-dimensional Mott insulators at energies below the charge gap. By employing nonlinear Luttinger liquid theory and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we predict that in the presence of a magnetic impurity at the boundary, characteristic Fermi-edge singularity features can appear at subgap energies in the TDOS near the boundary. In contrast to the Kondo effect in a metal, these resonances are strongly asymmetric and of power-law form. The power-law exponent is universal and determined by the spinon-Kondo effect.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric evidence of the electronic structure changes from the charge-density-wave transition in FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome metals provide a material platform for probing new correlated quantum phenomena due to the naturally incorporated linear dispersions, flat bands, and Van Hove singularities in their electronic structures. Among these quantum phenomena is the charge density wave (CDW), or the distortion of the lattice structure due to the motion of correlated electrons through the material. CDWs lower the energy of the compound, creating an energy gap that facilitates behaviors akin to superconductivity, nonlinear transport, or other quantum correlated phenomena. The kagome metal FeGe has been shown to host a CDW transition at approximately 100 K, and its occurrence is strongly influenced by the sample annealing conditions. However, a notable gap in the literature is the lack of clear thermoelectric transport evidence for electronic structure changes associated with this CDW transition. Here we present evidence of electron behavior modification due to annealing disorder via thermoelectric measurements on FeGe crystals presenting a CDW transition and those without a CDW. The observed Nernst effect and Seebeck effect under sufficient annealing demonstrate modified electrical transport properties resulting from induced disorder, including a change in carrier sign and an enhancement of the Nernst effect due to the CDW. Our results provide evidence of multiple phase transitions, which confirms the influence of CDW on the thermal properties of FeGe and demonstrates the suppression of CDW with sufficient disordering.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced proximate quantum spin ice phase in Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive bulk characterization and neutron scattering investigation of single-crystalline Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, a magnetic pyrochlore synthesized via a flux-growth method. Unpolarized neutron diffuse scattering reveals the emergence of spin-ice correlations below $T \sim 1$ K, evidenced by the development of anisotropic pinch-point features that are consistent with quantum-spin-ice (QSI) behavior. A.C. susceptibility measurements indicate a progressive slowing of spin dynamics in this regime, culminating in complete spin freezing below $T_f \approx 0.15$ K. Inelastic neutron scattering at $T = 0.5$ K reveals a broad spectrum of quasi-elastic magnetic excitations, with intensity in the low-energy range $[0, 0.2]$ meV significantly suppressed below $T_f$. Meanwhile, an incipient (100)-type magnetic order begins to nucleate, and a gapped excitation centered at $\hbar\omega = 0.23$ meV persists. We further identify two distinct dynamical timescales above $T_f$, a slow component $\tau_{\mathrm{slow}} \sim 10^{-5}$ s and a fast component $\tau_{\mathrm{fast}} \sim 10^{-10}$ s, in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions for QSI systems. Taken together, these results indicate that Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ enters a disorder-induced spin-frozen phase below $T_f$, lying in close proximity to a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid.</description>

      <title>Odd relaxation in three-dimensional Fermi liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical works predict a hierarchy of long-lived, non-hydrodynamic modes in two-dimensional Fermi liquids arising from the feature -- supposedly unique to two dimensions -- that relaxation by head-on scattering is not efficient in the presence of Pauli blocking. This leads to a parity-based separation of scattering rates, with odd-parity modes relaxing much more slowly than even-parity ones. In this work, we establish that a similar effect exists in isotropic three-dimensional Fermi liquids, even though relaxation does not proceed solely by head-on scattering. We show that while the relaxation rates of even and odd modes in 3D share the same leading-order $\sim T^2$ low-temperature scaling typical of Fermi liquids, their magnitudes differ, with odd-parity modes relaxing more slowly than even ones for a broad class of interactions. We find a relative difference between odd-and even-parity relaxation rates as large as $40\%$ just by Pauli blocking alone, with a strong additional dependence on the scattering potential, such that the odd-even staggering is further enhanced by interactions that favor large-angle scattering. We identify signatures of these odd-parity relaxation rates in the static transverse conductivity as well as the transverse collective mode structure. Our results establish the unexpected existence of a tomographic-like regime in higher-dimensional Fermi liquids and suggest experimental probes via transport measurements.</description>

      <title>3D microwave imaging of a van der Waals heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures offer a tunable platform for the realization of emergent phenomena in layered electron systems. While scanning probe microscopy techniques have proven useful for the characterization of surface states and 2D crystals, the subsurface imaging of quantum phenomena in multi-layer systems presents a significant challenge. In 3D heterostructures, states that occupy different planes can simultaneously contribute to the signal detected by the microscope probe, which complicates image analysis and interpretation. Here we present a quantum imaging technique that offers a glimpse into the third dimension by resolving states out of plane: it extracts the charge density landscape of individual atomic planes inside a vdW heterostructure, layer by layer. As a proof-of-concept, we perform layer-resolved imaging of quantum Hall states and charge disorder in double-layer graphene using milliKelvin microwave impedance microscopy. Here the discrete energy spectrum of the top layer enables transmission of microwaves through gapped states, thus opening direct access to quantum phases in the subsurface layer. Resolving how charge is distributed out-of-plane offers a direct probe of interlayer screening, revealing signatures of negative quantum capacitance driven by many-body correlations. At the same time, we extract key features of the band structure and thermodynamics, including gap sizes. Notably, by imaging the charge distribution on different atomic planes beneath the surface, we shed light on the roles of surface impurities and screening on the stability of fractional quantum Hall states. We also show that the uppermost graphene layer can serve as a top gate: This unlocks access to a wide range of phenomena that require displacement field control, from fractional Chern insulators in Moir\'e superlattices to correlated states in multilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Twisted light drives chiral excitations of interacting electrons in nanostructures with magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted light (TL), a special kind of light carrying orbital angular momentum, provides a powerful tool for driving symmetry resolved transitions in quantum confined nanostructures. We study a realistic model where a TL pulse excites two interacting electrons in a nanostructure under a perpendicular magnetic field. To include image charge effects in layered systems, we use an effective electron electron potential of the form 1/r^n. For n = 2, the system exhibits an underlying su(1,1) dynamical symmetry, enabling analytical solutions and a clear interpretation of selection rules, parity changes, and angular momentum resolved absorption. We show that the bare Coulomb 1/r interaction produces similar spectra, indicating that twisted light driven excitations are robust against the precise interaction form. The excitation spectrum reveals strong chiral properties: TL pulses, unlike conventional dipolar fields, directly access interaction-driven transitions otherwise symmetry-forbidden. In particular, TL breaks the generalized Kohn theorem, exposing internal excitations through multi quanta orbital processes. More broadly, our results establish TL as a sensitive probe of correlations, symmetry, and magneto-optical dynamics in strongly interacting quantum systems, uncovering features that remain invisible to standard infrared absorption.</description>

      <title>Extendibility of Fermionic Gaussian States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate $(k_1,k_2)$-extendibility of fermionic Gaussian states, a property central to quantum correlations and approximations of separability. We show that these states are $(k_1,k_2)$-extendible if and only if they admit a fermionic Gaussian extension, yielding a complete covariance-matrix characterization and a simple semidefinite program (SDP) whose size scales linearly with the number of modes. This provides necessary conditions for arbitrary fermionic states and is sufficient within the Gaussian setting. Our main result is a finite de Finetti--type theorem: we derive trace-norm bounds between $(k_1,k_2)$-extendible fermionic Gaussian states and separable states, improving previous exponential scaling to linear in the number of modes, with complementary relative entropy and squashed entanglement bounds. For two modes, upper and lower bounds match at order $1/\sqrt{k_1 k_2}$. Extendibility also provides operational support for one of the different notions of separability in fermionic systems. Finally, for fermionic Gaussian channels, we provide an SDP criterion for anti-degradability and show that entanglement-breaking channels coincide with replacement channels, implying no nontrivial entanglement-breaking fermionic Gaussian channels exist.</description>

      <title>Polarization dynamics of the spin-boson model in the shifted boson Hilbert space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Faithfully simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems requires efficiently addressing the challenge of an infinite Hilbert space. Inspired by the shifted boson operator technique used in ground-state studies of the spin-boson model (SBM), we develop a novel algorithm that integrates a shifted optimized boson basis with the time-evolving block decimation method. We validate our approach by accurately reproducing the polarization dynamics of the sub-Ohmic SBM at a significantly reduced computational cost. For the Ohmic SBM, we demonstrate that the time-evolved final state converges precisely to the variational prediction at both zero and finite temperatures. Furthermore, our method reveals a new aperiodic pseudocoherent phase in the super-Ohmic SBM with an initially polarized bath. This work establishes an efficient and powerful approach for simulating the real-time dynamics of open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Optical Control of Integer and Fractional Chern Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical control of topology, particularly in the presence of electron correlations, is a fascinating topic with broad scientific and technological impact. Twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayer (tMoTe$_2$) is a newly discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulator (FCI), exhibiting the fractionally quantized anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect. Since the chirality of the edge states and sign of the Chern number are determined by the underlying ferromagnetic polarization, manipulation of ferromagnetism would realize control of the CI/FCI states. Here, we demonstrate control and switching of ferromagnetic polarization, and thus the CI and FCI states by circularly polarized optical pumping in tMoTe$_2$. At low optical excitation power, we achieve on-demand preparation of ferromagnetic polarization by optical training, i.e., electrically tuning the system from non-ferromagnetic to desirable ferromagnetic states accompanied with helicity-selective optical pumping. With increased excitation power, we further realize direct optical switching of ferromagnetic polarization at a temperature far below the Curie temperature. Both optical training and direct switching of ferromagnetism are most effective near CI/FCI states, which we attribute to a gap enhanced valley polarization of photo-injected holes. We show that the magnetization can be dynamically switched by modulating the helicity of optical excitation. Spatially resolved measurements further demonstrate optical writing of a ferromagnetic, and thus a CI (or FCI) domain. Our work realizes precise optical control of a topological quantum many-body system with potential applications in topological spintronics, quantum memories, and creation of exotic edge states by programmable patterning of integer and fractional QAH domains.</description>

Abstract: Layered transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) HfTe2 is a topological semimetal candidate with increasing attentions recently. The map of the Fermi surface is of interest and importance to understand its properties. Here we present a study of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations and planar Hall effect (PHE) in HfTe2. The single crystals grown by flux method show the largest unsaturated magnetoresistance (MR) effect of 1.1*104 % at 14 T and 2 K. The angle-resolved SdH oscillations reveal that the Fermi surface consists of three pockets with different anisotropy. In addition, we observe PHE and anisotropic MR (AMR) effect in the material for a wide temperature range. The effective mass, carrier density and quantum transport mobility are quantified in the system, and the Berry phase is discussed. Our work provides crucial insights into the electronic structure and the Fermi surface of the semimetal.</description>

      <title>Optical control over topological Chern number in moir\'e materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling quantum matter with light offers a promising route to dynamically tune its many-body properties, ranging from band topology to superconductivity. However, achieving such optical control for strongly correlated electron systems in the steady-state has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate all-optical switching of the spin-valley degree of freedom of itinerant ferromagnets in twisted MoTe2 homobilayers. This system uniquely features flat valley-contrasting Chern bands and exhibits a range of strongly correlated phases at various moir\'e lattice fillings, including Chern insulators and ferromagnetic metals. We show that the spin-valley orientation of all of these phases can be dynamically reversed by resonantly exciting the attractive polaron transition with circularly-polarized light. These findings not only constitute the first direct evidence for non-thermal switching of a ferromagnetic spin state at zero magnetic field, but also demonstrate the possibility of dynamical control over topological order parameter, paving the way for all-optical generation of chiral edge modes and topological quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Universal Dynamics with Globally Controlled Analog Quantum Simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment - direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.</description>

      <title>Long-time divergences in the nonlinear response of gapped one-dimensional many-particle systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider one dimensional many-particle systems that exhibit kinematically protected single-particle excitations over their ground states. We show that momentum and time-resolved 4-point functions of operators that create such excitations diverge linearly in particular time differences. This behaviour can be understood by means of a simple semiclassical analysis based on the kinematics and scattering of wave packets of quasiparticles. We verify that our wave packet analysis correctly predicts the long-time limit of the four-point function in the transverse field Ising model through a form factor expansion. We present evidence in favour of the same behaviour in integrable quantum field theories. In addition, we extend our discussion to experimental protocols where two times of the four-point function coincide, e.g. 2D coherent spectroscopy and pump-probe experiments. Finally, focusing on the Ising model, we discuss subleading corrections that grow as the square root of time differences. We show that the subleading corrections can be correctly accounted for by the same semiclassical analysis, but also taking into account wave packet spreading.</description>

      <title>Exploring d-Wave Magnetism in Cuprates from Oxygen Moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic parent phase of high-T$_c$ cuprates has been established as a N\'eel state of copper moments, but early work pointed out the important role of ligand oxygen orbitals. Using the three-orbital Emery model, we explore how, and under which conditions, doping-induced antiferromagnetic ordering of weak magnetic moments on the oxygen sites can lead to unconventional d-wave magnetism with spin-split electronic bands. The mechanism for forming such altermagnetic (AM) states in cuprates does not rely on a lowering of the crystal symmetry but rather on interaction-induced formation of magnetic moments on directional oxygen orbitals within the crystallographic unit cell. Therefore, we obtain two different types of AM, namely a (0,0)-AM and a ($\pi$,$\pi$)-AM. We explore different regimes and challenges for realizing oxygen AM supported by Hartree-Fock calculations and complementary exact diagonalization of small clusters. While the region of interacting parameters needed to realize these states may be difficult to achieve in known high-T$_c$ cuprates, we propose a scenario to realize AM induced by oxygen magnetic moments in a cuprate-based candidate compound using density functional theory and discuss experimental implications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic critical exponents as an emergent property at interacting topological quantum critical points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In standard studies of quantum critical points (QCPs), the dynamic critical exponent $z$ is introduced as a fundamental parameter along with global symmetries to identify universality classes. Often, the dynamic critical exponent $z$ is set to be one as the most natural choice for quantum field theory representations, which further implies emergence of higher space-time symmetries near QCPs in many condensed matter systems. In this article, we study a family of topological quantum critical points (tQCPs) where the $z=1$ quantum field theory is prohibited in a fundamental representation by a protecting symmetry, resulting in tQCPs with $z=2$. We further illustrate that when strong interactions are properly taken into account, the stable weakly interacting gapless tQCPs with $z=2$ can further make a transition to another family of gapless tQCPs with dynamic critical exponent $z=1$, without breaking the protecting symmetry. Our studies suggest that dynamic critical exponents, as well as the degrees of freedom in fermion fields, can crucially depend on interactions in topological quantum phase transitions; in tQCPs, to a large extent, they are better thought of as emergent properties.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic response and emergent topological orders in transition metal dichalcogenide MoTe$_2$ bilayers</title>

Abstract: Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides, such as MoTe$_2$, provide a versatile platform for exploring correlated topological phases. This work investigates the interplay of perpendicular magnetic and electric fields in tuning the electronic structure and emergent topological orders of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (t-MoTe$_2$) across two distinct regimes: a low-twist-angle phase ($\theta\approx2.1^\circ$) hosting multiple Chern bands of identical Chern numbers per valley, and a higher-angle phase ($\theta\approx 3.89^\circ$) featuring Haldane-like bands with opposite Chern numbers. Using a continuum model incorporating moir\'e potentials up to second harmonics, we compute the Hofstadter fractal spectra under applied fields, revealing Landau fan structures and magnetic-flux-dependent band topology. These fractal spectra are useful in studying emergent topological orders in terms of the composite fermion picture, where the statistical Chern-Simons flux is approximated as a uniform gauge field. We demonstrate that the system hosts both Jain-sequence fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) and non-Jain "fractal FCIs" with higher Chern numbers. The electric field suppresses composite fermion gaps and induces topological quantum phase transitions. Furthermore, our analysis extends to valley-contrasting flux attachment, proposing pathways to describe fractional quantum spin Hall states.</description>

      <title>Dynamic correlations of frustrated quantum spins from high-temperature expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For quantum spin systems in equilibrium, the dynamic structure factor (DSF) is among the most feature-packed experimental observables. However, from a theory perspective it is often hard to simulate in an unbiased and accurate way, especially for frustrated and high-dimensional models at intermediate temperature. To address this challenge, we compute the DSF from a dynamic extension of the high-temperature expansion to frequency moments. We focus on nearest-neighbor Heisenberg models with spin-lengths S=1/2 and 1. We provide comprehensive benchmarks and consider a variety of frustrated two- and three-dimensional antiferromagnets as applications. In particular we shed new light on the anomalous intermediate temperature regime of the S=1/2 triangular lattice model and reproduce the DSF measured recently for the S=1 pyrochlore material NaCaNi2F7. An open-source numerical implementation for arbitrary lattice geometries is also provided.</description>

      <title>High-temperature series expansion of the dynamic Matsubara spin correlator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high-temperature series expansion for quantum spin models is a well-established tool to compute thermodynamic quantities and equal-time spin correlations, in particular for frustrated interactions. We extend the scope of this expansion to the dynamic Matsubara spin-spin correlator and develop an algorithm that yields exact expansion coefficients in the form of rational numbers. We focus on Heisenberg models with a single coupling constant J and spin lengths S=1/2 and 1. The expansion coefficients up to 12th order in J/T are precomputed on all possible ~10^6 graphs embeddable in arbitrary lattices and are provided under {https://github.com/bsbierski/Dyn-HTE}. This enables calculation of static momentum-resolved susceptibilities for arbitrary site-pairs or wavevectors. We test our results for the S=1/2 Heisenberg chain and on the triangular lattice model. An important application that we discuss in a companion letter is the calculation of real-frequency dynamic structure factors. This is achieved by identifying the high-frequency expansion coefficients of the Matsubara correlator with frequency moments of the spectral function.</description>

      <title>Weyl nodes in CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ studied by dynamical mean-field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The heavy fermion compound CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ was recently shown to exhibit a spontaneous nonlinear Hall effect, indicating its topological nature. This is consistent with the lack of inversion symmetry that allows for the existence of Weyl nodes. Here, we employ density functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory, which is state-of-the-art for strongly correlated materials, and study the topology of CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$. We find five inequivalent Weyl nodes of either type I or II, each having either eight or sixteen symmetry-related replicas. These Weyl nodes bridge the Kondo insulating gap, which is a direct but not an indirect gap. The Weyl points closest to the Fermi level are situated only 0.5 meV below it, and have a very flat dispersion. Our ab initio results establish CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ as a model system for investigating the interplay between strong electronic correlations and nontrivial topology. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for future studies of quantum transport and interaction-driven topological phases in heavy-fermion systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in bilayer nickelates: Impact of quasi-quantum metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently discovered high-$T_c$ superconductivity in thin-film bilayer nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient pressure has attracted great interest. Non-Fermi-liquid transport behaviors, such as $T$-linear resistivity and positive Hall coefficient increasing at low temperatures, have been reported in this system. In this study, we analyze the non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in the thin-film bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using a multiorbital tight-binding model. In La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the orbital-selective cold spots composed of Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital emerge since the spin fluctuations cause stronger quasi-particle damping $\gamma$ in the Ni $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Notably, in the present study, we derive a rigorous formula for the Hall coefficient $R_H$ incorporating the $\gamma$ in the quasi-quantum metric (qQM) term. We discover that the $T$-dependence of $\gamma$ in the qQM term is important in determining $R_H$, and that the qQM term is inevitably enhanced by the nearly degenerate bands at the orbital-selective cold spots located around $(\pi/4,\pi/4)$. Moreover, the qQM term plays an essential role in describing the Nernst coefficient and other transport phenomena involving the second derivative velocity $v^{\mu\nu}$. La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a novel platform for exploring the physics of the qQM.</description>

      <title>Fractal decompositions and tensor network representations of Bethe wavefunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of a generic $M$-particle Bethe wavefunction (not necessarily an eigenstate of an integrable model) on a 1d lattice by dividing the lattice into $L$ parts and decomposing the wavefunction into a sum of products of $L$ local wavefunctions. Using the fact that a Bethe wavefunction accepts a \textit{fractal} multipartite decomposition -- it can always be written as a linear combination of $L^M$ products of $L$ local wavefunctions, where each local wavefunction is in turn also a Bethe wavefunction -- we then build \textit{exact, analytical} tensor network representations with finite bond dimension $\chi=2^M$, for a generic planar tree tensor network (TTN), which includes a matrix product states (MPS) and a regular binary TTN as prominent particular cases. For a regular binary tree, the network has depth $\log_{2}(N/M)$ and can be transformed into an adaptive quantum circuit of the same depth, composed of unitary gates acting on $2^M$-dimensional qudits and mid-circuit measurements, that deterministically prepares the Bethe wavefunction. Finally, we put forward a much larger class of \textit{generalized} Bethe wavefunctions, for which the above decompositions, tensor network and quantum circuit representations are also possible.</description>

      <title>Integrals of motion as slow modes in dissipative many-body operator dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Lindbladian operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems with one or more integrals of motion (IOM), subject to weak local dissipation. We demonstrate that IOMs with small support become slow modes of these dynamics, in the sense that their Frobenius norm decays more slowly compared to generic operators. As a result, the eigenoperators of such Lindbladians with slowest decay rates have a large overlap with the IOMs of the underlying Hamiltonian. We demonstrate this correspondence between slow modes and IOMs numerically for a number of many-body models, and further corroborate it with perturbative arguments. These results open up a new method for the identification of IOMs, and provide insights into the dissipative many-body dynamics.</description>
