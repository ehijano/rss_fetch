      <title>AllShowers: One model for all calorimeter showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient detector simulation is essential for modern collider experiments. To reduce the high computational cost, various fast machine learning surrogate models have been proposed. Traditional surrogate models for calorimeter shower modeling train separate networks for each particle species, limiting scalability and reuse. We introduce AllShowers, a unified generative model that simulates calorimeter showers across multiple particle types using a single generative model. AllShowers is a continuous normalizing flow model with a Transformer architecture, enabling it to generate complex spatial and energy correlations in variable-length point cloud representations of showers. Trained on a diverse dataset of simulated showers in the highly granular ILD detector, the model demonstrates the ability to generate realistic showers for electrons, photons, and charged and neutral hadrons across a wide range of incident energies and angles without retraining. In addition to unifying shower generation for multiple particle types, AllShowers surpasses the fidelity of previous single-particle-type models for hadronic showers. Key innovations include the use of a layer embedding, allowing the model to learn all relevant calorimeter layer properties; a custom attention masking scheme to reduce computational demands and introduce a helpful inductive bias; and a shower- and layer-wise optimal transport mapping to improve training convergence and sample quality. AllShowers marks a significant step towards a universal model for calorimeter shower simulations in collider experiments.</description>

      <title>High-Voltage Performance Testing in LAr of the PMMA Cathode Connection for the DarkSide-20k Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DarkSide--20k (DS--20k) is a next--generation dual--phase liquid argon (LAr) time projection chamber (TPC) devoted to the direct--detection of dark matter. The detector is currently under construction in Hall--C at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy, at a depth of approximately 3500 m water equivalent. The detector will instrument 49.7~t of low--radioactivity underground LAr contained within an acrylic TPC and is designed to reach a WIMP--nucleon spin--independent cross--section sensitivity down to $10^{-48}\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ for a WIMP mass of $0.1\,\mathrm{TeV}/c^{2}$ in a 200~tonne--year run. In DS--20k a uniform electric drift field is established in the active volume to transport ionization electrons toward the electroluminescence region, with the required high voltage delivered to the TPC cathode through a custom cable and stress--cone assembly. At the University of California, Davis, a dedicated test setup was developed to reproduce the DS--20k cathode high--voltage connection in LAr, matching the local electric--field conditions. This work summarizes the results of a comprehensive test campaign validating the operation of the DS--20k cathode HV system in LAr up to $-100$~kV.</description>

      <title>Study of the energy calibration of the DEAP-3600 detector using Na-22 source data and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DEAP--3600 is a single--phase liquid argon (LAr) direct--detection dark matter experiment operating 2~km underground at SNOLAB (Sudbury, Canada). The detector consists of 3.3~tons of LAr contained in a spherical acrylic vessel. At a WIMP mass of 100~GeV, DEAP--3600 has a projected sensitivity of $10^{-46}\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ for the spin--independent elastic scattering cross section of WIMPs. Radioactive sources have been used for the energy calibration and to test the detector performance. One of the most effective calibration runs has been taken with a $^{22}\mathrm{Na}$ source deployed in a tube located around the DEAP--3600 steel shell. The simultaneous emission of three $\gamma$'s by the source provides an excellent tagging for the $^{22}\mathrm{Na}$ decay. The results concerning the energy response of the detector and the agreement between data and Monte Carlo simulations in DEAP--3600 are investigated in this study.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive study of cosmogenic neutron production in large liquid scintillator detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrons produced by cosmic ray muons constitute a significant background for underground experiments investigating neutron oscillations, neutrinoless double beta decay, dark matter, and other rare event signals. This work benchmarks measured neutron yields and neutron multiplicities--with a focus on data from the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment--against comprehensive simulations using three GEANT4 hadronic physics lists. These simulations are further refined via a TALYS-based adjustment of hadronic cross sections. For the BERT-based models, the adjustment reduces the discrepancy in the total neutron yield from about 20% to approximately 6%, while for the BIC-based models it improves the agreement from roughly 13% to the sub-percent level (~0.3%), indicating a markedly better consistency of the BIC-based models with the experimental data. Nevertheless, a clear tension persists: simulations systematically underproduce single-neutron events while overproducing multi-neutron events. The study establishes a reproducible benchmark for cosmogenic neutron modeling and proposes a targeted refinement strategy--including channel-specific reweighting and intranuclear cascade parameter tuning--to guide future model development.</description>

      <title>A prototype gas cell for the stopping, extraction and neutralization of radioactive nuclei from the SPIRAL2 Super Separator Spectrometer (S$^3$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and simulation of a prototype gas cell for in-gas-jet laser-ionization and spectroscopy studies using the low energy branch of the SPIRAL2-S$^3$ radioactive-ion-beam facility. The prototype aims to demonstrate the possibility to reduce the extraction time of radioactive ions from the gas cell, while implementing a controlled neutralization mechanism, necessary for laser-spectroscopy studies. Different simulation methods of ion processes in gas are comparatively discussed. Design considerations and detailed simulations of the ion extraction time and efficiency are presented. A study of the dynamics of electrons obtained in the gas cell by ionization is also performed to assess the achievable electron densities.</description>

      <title>Performance Test and Circuit Simulation for R12699-406-M4 Photomultiplier Tube Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next-generation liquid xenon experiments like PandaX-xT target an energy range from sub-keV to multi-MeV to address the requirement of multiple physics searches. The Hamamatsu R12699-406-M4 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) were developed and selected as photon sensors for PandaX-xT. Their voltage-divider base is optimized for a broad dynamic range, from single-photoelectron (SPE) sensitivity to 30~nC collected charge (matching the 2.5~MeV Q-value of $^{136}$Xe neutrinoless double beta decay~(NLDBD)). Using a dedicated test bench, we characterize the saturation and suppression responses of R12699-406-M4 PMTs with this base design. Based on measured PMT-base responses, we develop a circuit simulation model that accurately reproduces the physical mechanisms underlying these effects with key parameters tuned via experimental data. The combined simulation and bench-test approach guides base design and optimization, enabling improved detector dynamic range and supporting future saturation and suppression correction studies in data analysis.</description>

      <title>Development of a novel compact and fast SiPM-based RICH detector for the future ALICE 3 PID system at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dedicated R\&amp;D is ongoing for the charged particle identification system of the \mbox{ALICE 3} experiment proposed for the LHC Run 5 and beyond. One of the subsystems for the high-energy charged particle identification will be a Ring-Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector. The possibility of integrating Cherenkov-based charged particle timing measurements is currently under study. The proposed system is based on a proximity-focusing RICH configuration including an aerogel radiator separated from a SiPM array layer by an expansion gap. A thin high-refractive index window of transparent material, acting as a second Cherenkov radiator, is glued on the SiPM array to enable time-of-flight measurements of charged particles by exploiting the yield of Cherenkov photons in the thin window. We assembled a small-scale prototype instrumented with different Hamamatsu SiPM array sensors with pitches ranging from 1 to 3 mm, readout by custom boards equipped with the front-end Petiroc 2A ASICs to measure charges and times. The primary Cherenkov radiator consisted of a 2 cm thick aerogel tile, while various window materials, including SiO$_2$ and MgF$_2$, were used as secondary Cherenkov radiators. The prototype was successfully tested in a campaign at the CERN PS T10 beam line with pions and protons. This paper summarizes the results achieved in the 2023 test beam campaign.</description>

      <title>Test beam performance of a novel RICH detector with timing capabilities for the future ALICE~3 PID system at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALICE Collaboration is proposing a completely new apparatus, ALICE 3, for the LHC Run 5 and beyond. A key subsystem for charged particle identification will be a Ring-Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector consisting of an aerogel radiator and a photosensitive surface based on Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays in a proximity-focusing configuration. A thin high-refractive index slab of transparent material (window), acting as a second Cherenkov radiator, is glued on the entrance face of the SiPM arrays to achieve precise charged particle timing. Requiring time matching between aerogel Cherenkov photon and track hits leads to an improvement of pattern recognition by discarding the uncorrelated SiPM dark count hits. In this work we present the current status of the R\&amp;D performed for the ALICE 3 RICH detector prototype and the expected full scale system performance. A special focus will be given to the beam test results obtained with a small-scale prototype instrumented with various array of Hamamatsu SiPMs with pitches ranging from 1 to 3 mm. The Cherenkov radiator consisted of a 2 cm thick aerogel tile with a refractive index of 1.03 at 400 nm wavelength. For timing measurements SiPM arrays coupled with two different window materials (SiO$_2$ and MgF$_2$) were used. The prototype was successfully tested in beam test campaigns at the CERN PS T10 beam line. The data were collected with a complete chain of front-end and readout electronics based on the Petiroc 2A and Radioroc 2 together with a picoTDC to measure charges and times. We measured a charged particle detection efficiency above 99\% and a single photon angular resolution better than 4.2 mrad at the Cherenkov angle saturation with a time resolution better than 70 ps for charged particles.</description>

      <title>Beam test studies for a SiPM-based RICH detector prototype for the future ALICE~3 experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALICE Collaboration is proposing a completely new apparatus, ALICE~3, for the LHC Runs~5 and beyond. In this context, a key subsystem for high-energy charged particle identification will be a proximity-focusing ring-imaging Cherenkov detector using aerogel as radiator and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) as photon sensors. We assembled a small-scale prototype instrumented with Hamamatsu S13352 and S13361-3075AE-08 SiPM arrays, readout by custom boards equipped with front-end Petiroc 2A ASICs. The Cherenkov radiator consisted of a 2 cm thick hydrophobic aerogel tile with a refractive index of 1.03 separated from the SiPM plane by a 23 cm expansion gap. The prototype was successfully tested in a campaign at the CERN PS T10 beam line with the goal of validating the design bRICH specifications in terms to achieve the target separation power. We measured a single photon angular resolution of 3.8~mrad at the Cherenkov angle saturation value of 242~mrad, as well as the expected scaling of the angular resolution with the increasing number of detected photons. We also studied the contribution of uncorrelated and correlated background sources with respect to the signal and proved the effectiveness of time matching between charged tracks and photon hits to achieve efficient suppression of the SiPM dark count rate background. In this paper, the detector concept, the description of the tested prototype layout and the main beam test results are reported.</description>

      <title>Design Optimization of Triple Gas Electron Multiplier for Superior Gain and Reduced Ion Backflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGDs) are extensively employed in modern high-energy and nuclear Physics experiments because of their excellent spatial resolution, high rate capability, and operational stability. Among these, the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted MPGD technologies. Despite their widespread adoption, GEM detectors based on the conventional bi-conical hole geometry do not always achieve optimal performance, particularly in maximizing effective gain while suppressing ion backflow. One of the primary factors limiting a GEM's performance is ion backflow. The accumulation and gradual discharge of these ions might alter the local electric field, resulting in a temporary dead time and complicating responses to subsequent events. These limitations pose challenges for applications requiring high precision and stable long-term operation. In this work, we address these issues by investigating modified GEM geometries designed to enhance gain performance and reduce ion backflow, thereby improving overall detector performance. The current study investigates geometric optimization strategies for a triple-GEM detector to enhance performance, mitigate ion backflow, and augment gain. The detector structures were designed using the ANSYS Mechanical APDL, and the associated electrostatic field configurations were computed using the ANSYS Maxwell. A thorough investigation of gain and ion backflow calculations was carried out when the generated field maps were interfaced with Garfield$^{++}$. The potential enhancements in detector efficiency and stability that the proposed modifications to the GEM foil geometry offers a valuable insights for the design of next-generation gaseous detectors.</description>

      <title>Direct in-chamber radon-220 (thoron) emanation measurements for rare-event physics experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring radon emanation from detector materials is a key method for controlling radon, a significant background in rare-event physics experiments. Methods for measuring radon emanation are well-established but have predominantly focused on the 222Rn isotope, the dominant radon isotope for these backgrounds. However, measurements of 220Rn (thoron), the second most abundant radon isotope, remain relatively unexplored. 220Rn emanation measurements are challenging because the 220Rn must be transferred from the emanation chamber to the active detector within its short 55 s half-life. In this study, a direct in-chamber approach for measuring 220Rn emanation is presented in which the sample is placed directly within the active detector chamber, thereby minimising losses during transfer. The method was demonstrated with a DURRIDGE RAD8 electrostatic radon detector, which measured 220Rn emanation from low-activity thoriated rods with an activity of 76 +/- 20 mBq. Compared with a conventional flowthrough 220Rn emanation setup, the in-chamber method increased sensitivity by a factor of 3. Using helium as the carrier gas provided a further sensitivity increase, giving an overall sensitivity gain of ~5. These results indicate that in-chamber 220Rn emanation measurements provide an effective tool for low-background experiments and have the potential to accelerate radon studies by exploiting the shorter half-life of 220Rn.</description>

      <title>Radio-frequency pulse design in local rotating frame in magnetic resonance imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of spatially selective radio-frequency (RF) pulse design in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically stated in the form of determining, analytically or numerically, RF waveforms to be applied in synchrony with one or more predetermined gradient waveforms. In most cases, the dynamics of the nuclear spin magnetization under the RF and gradient fields is described in a global rotating frame that cancels the effect of the static (main) magnetic field B0. In this work, we consider an alternative frame of reference, which can be called a local rotating frame where total longitudinal magnetic field (B0 plus gradient) in every voxel is zero. In this frame, the effect of time-dependent gradient field is integrated out, and the remaining magnetization dynamics, governed by much weaker RF fields, becomes both simpler and slower. We show that recasting existing RF design methods in such a frame provides useful insights and techniques that are not obvious in the conventional description. The methods we consider include (i) two-dimensional spatial RF pulse design in the excitation k-space, (ii) Shinnar-Le Roux RF design, (iii) residual phase calculation in slice-selective excitation, and (iv) iterative and numerical solutions for multi-coil RF pulse design. In particular, we show that the new formalism can substantially reduce the Bloch simulation time which can greatly benefit iterative pulse designs in parallel transmit. In all, the proposed framework provides considerable theoretical insights and practical utility for RF pulse design in MRI.</description>

      <title>Validation of the COSINE-100U NaI(Tl) Encapsulation for Low-Temperature Operation in Liquid Scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COSINE-100U (upgrade) will enhance the sensitivity of the COSINE-100 dark matter search by operating the detector array immersed in liquid scintillator (LS) at $-30^oC$. To validate the detector design for these conditions, we constructed a module using the COSINE-100U encapsulation and performed a dedicated long-term stability study. The module was first monitored at room temperature for ~110 days in air, followed by a one-week immersion in LAB-based LS to verify initial compatibility. Upon confirming stable optical performance, the temperature was lowered to $-33^oC$. During approximately 150 days of continuous operation at low temperature, we observed no degradation in performance. These results demonstrate the chemical and mechanical robustness of the encapsulation, confirming its suitability for the COSINE-100U physics run.</description>

      <title>Accurate Simulation Pipeline for Passive Single-Photon Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) are new and promising imaging sensors. These sensors are sensitive enough to detect individual photons hitting each pixel, with extreme temporal resolution and without readout noise. Thus, SPADs stand out as an optimal choice for low-light imaging. Due to the high price and limited availability of SPAD sensors, the demand for an accurate data simulation pipeline is substantial. Indeed, the scarcity of SPAD datasets hinders the development of SPAD-specific processing algorithms and impedes the training of learning-based solutions.
  In this paper, we present a comprehensive SPAD simulation pipeline and validate it with multiple experiments using two recent commercial SPAD sensors. Our simulator is used to generate the SPAD-MNIST, a single-photon version of the seminal MNIST dataset, to investigate the effectiveness of convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers on reconstructed fluxes, even at extremely low light conditions, e.g., 5 mlux. We also assess the performance of classifiers exclusively trained on simulated data on real images acquired from SPAD sensors at different light conditions. The synthetic dataset encompasses different SPAD imaging modalities and is made available for download. Project page: https://boracchi.faculty.polimi.it/Projects/SPAD-MNIST.html.</description>

      <title>Depletion depth measurements of new large area silicon carbide detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ion beam induced charge technique with proton microprobe is used to characterise newly developed p-n junction large area silicon carbide detectors. They were recently produced as part of the ongoing program to develop a new particle identification wall for the focal plane detector of the MAGNEX magnetic spectrometer at INFN - Laboratori Nazionali del Sud in view of the NUMEN experimental campaigns. Four silicon carbide devices are studied. Proton beams over a 1.26 to 6.00 MeV incident energy range are used to probe the active area and the depletion depth of each device. The energy loss tables for the silicon carbide material are checked, finding an empirical correction that is then used to quantify the depletion depth at the full depletion voltage through energy loss measurements of 3.40 MeV proton beams irradiating the back side of the devices. It is possible to fully deplete the devices provided that the epitaxial layer is grown properly on the substrate.</description>

      <title>AAFIYA: Antenna Analysis in Frequency-domain for Impedance and Yield Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents AAFIYA (Antenna Analysis in Frequency-domain for Impedance and Yield Assessment), a modular Python toolkit for automated characterization of radio-frequency antennas using measurement and simulation data. The toolkit provides a unified workflow for processing S-parameters, impedance, realized gain, beam patterns, polarization metrics, and calibration-based yield estimation, with support for standard Touchstone files and beam pattern data. AAFIYA is validated using measurements from an electromagnetic anechoic chamber involving Log Periodic Dipole Array (LPDA) reference antennas and Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) Bottom Vertically Polarized antennas over 100-850 MHz. Extracted metrics, including impedance matching, realized gain patterns, vector effective lengths, and cross-polarization ratio, are compared against full-wave simulations from HFSS and WIPL-D, showing good agreement across frequency and angle. The results demonstrate that AAFIYA enables accurate, reproducible, and publication-ready antenna analysis, and provides a flexible foundation for future extensions, including automated optimization and data-driven antenna design.</description>

      <title>Projected sensitivity to light WIMP-like particles of the BULLKID-DM experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BULLKID-DM is an experiment designed for the direct searches of particle dark matter candidates with mass around 1 GeV, or below, and cross-section with nucleons smaller than $10^{-40}$ cm$^2$. The detector consists of a stack of diced silicon wafers, acting as arrays of particle absorbers, sensed by multiplexed Kinetic Inductance Detectors. The target will amount to 800 g subdivided in more than 2000 silicon dice, with the aim of controlling the background from natural radioactivity by creating a fully active structure and by applying fiducialization techniques. In this work we present the projected sensitivity of BULLKID-DM to light WIMP-like particles considering also the other future experiments in the field.</description>

      <title>The use of spectral indices in environmental monitoring of smouldering coal-waste dumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study aimed to evaluate the applicability of environmental indices in the monitoring of smouldering coal-waste dumps. A dump located in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin served as the research site for a multi-method analysis combining remote sensing and field-based data. Two UAV survey campaigns were conducted, capturing RGB, infrared, and multispectral imagery. These were supplemented with direct ground measurements of subsurface temperature and detailed vegetation mapping. Additionally, publicly available satellite data from the Landsat and Sentinel missions were analysed. A range of vegetation and fire-related indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI, BAI, among others) were calculated to identify thermally active zones and assess vegetation conditions within these degraded areas. The results revealed strong seasonal variability in vegetation indices on thermally active sites, with evidence of disrupted vegetation cycles, including winter greening in moderately heated root zones - a pattern indicative of stress and degradation processes. While satellite data proved useful in reconstructing the fire history of the dump, their spatial resolution was insufficient for detailed monitoring of small-scale thermal anomalies. The study highlights the diagnostic potential of UAV-based remote sensing in post-industrial environments undergoing land degradation but emphasises the importance of field validation for accurate environmental assessment.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Framework for Real Time Detection and Early Prediction of Control Valve Stiction in Industrial Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control valve stiction, a friction that prevents smooth valve movement, is a common fault in industrial process systems that causes instability, equipment wear, and higher maintenance costs. Many plants still operate with conventional valves that lack real time monitoring, making early predictions challenging. This study presents a machine learning (ML) framework for detecting and predicting stiction using only routinely collected process signals: the controller output (OP) from control systems and the process variable (PV), such as flow rate. Three deep learning models were developed and compared: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a hybrid CNN with a Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVM), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. To train these models, a data-driven labeling method based on slope ratio analysis was applied to a real oil and gas refinery dataset. The LSTM model achieved the highest accuracy and was able to predict stiction up to four hours in advance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate ML based early prediction of control valve stiction from real industry data. The proposed framework can be integrated into existing control systems to support predictive maintenance, reduce downtime, and avoid unnecessary hardware replacement.</description>

      <title>3D atomistic imaging of polymer nanocomposites with Atom Probe Tomography: experimental methodology, preliminary results and future outlook</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of polymer nanocomposites as gas barrier materials has seen increasing interest, including applications involving hydrogen transport and storage. Better understanding of gas transport through those polymeric systems requires 3D nanoscale detection of distributions and the possible trapping of gas molecules within nanoparticles and polymer/nanoparticle interfaces While atom probe tomography (APT) offers promising means for such nanoscale characterisation, its use for polymers has been mainly limited to thin organic layers deposited onto substrates or pre-fabricated metal needle shaped specimens. This work provides the very first application of APT to bulk polymer nanocomposites. Particularly, site specific atom probe sample preparation by Focused Ion Beam (FIB) liftout has been shown for the first time in a model system of hexagonal boron nanoparticles within a PVDF polymer matrix, using a variety of FIB workflows including Xe FIB, Ga FIB, cryogenic Ga FIB and deuterium charging. Mass spectra from the bulk polymer and the nanoparticle were collected using pulsed laser atom probe using standard conditions and compared. Several challenges encountered during this research including damage of the polymeric matrix during sample preparation were extensively discussed in this paper. Once those challenges have been resolved (e.g. by developing site specific sample preparation protocols), the application of APT to polymer nanocomposites can open new options for nanoscale characterisation of those systems.</description>

      <title>High Field Diamond Magnetometry Towards Tokamak Diagnostics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy centres (NVC) in diamond have been widely used for near-dc magnetometry. The intrinsic properties of diamonds make them potential candidates for tokamak fusion power diagnostics, where radiation-hard magnetometers will be essential for efficient control. An NVC magnetometer placed in a tokamak will need to operate within a $\geq$ 1 T magnetic field. In this work, we demonstrate fibre-coupled ensemble NVC optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and magnetometry measurements at magnetic fields up to 1.2 T. Sensitivities of approximately 240 to 600 nT/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ and 110 nT/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ are achieved in a (10-150) Hz frequency range, for non-degenerate and near-$\langle$111$\rangle$ field alignments respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $^{210}Po$ $\alpha$-decay driven neutron background is a concern for many rare event search experiments. It is a difficult to control background because its radiogenic component depends on the air exposure history of parts. In this study, we demonstrate that about half of the radon progeny $^{210}Po$ can be removed from copper and silicon surfaces relatively easily by wiping a copper sample with acetone wetted tissue and a silicon detector with acetone soaked cotton balls. For a copper sample we demonstrate that long-lived $^{210}Pb$ is removed with similar effectiveness. For copper, allocated the longest counting time, additional wiping was found to be largely ineffective. For silicon, the removal effectiveness has large uncertainties. Additional cleaning showed a small but statistically significant effect. Capitalizing on this trivial cleaning step will allow experiments to relax their requirements on the allowable air exposure time during construction, leading to cost and time savings.</description>

      <title>A Pathway to Sub-meV Detection of the Dark Universe: Robust Electron Avalanche in the PN junction at 10 mK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for light dark matter and cosmic primordial neutrinos necessitates detectors with sub-millielectronvolt (sub-meV) energy thresholds. While superconducting quantum sensors have approached this sensitivity, they often face significant challenges regarding readout complexity and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid Superconductor-Insulator-P-N (S-I-P-N) detector architecture. This concept combines the high sensitivity of superconducting Cooper pair breaking with the massive intrinsic gain of semiconductor electron avalanches. A critical prerequisite for this scheme is operation at millikelvin (mK) temperatures, raising the critical fundamental question of whether silicon PN junctions can sustain avalanche multiplication in a regime where carrier freeze-out is severe. Here, we experimentally validate the critical semiconductor amplification stage of the proposed detector. We demonstrate that Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) retain robust Geiger-mode avalanche capabilities at 10 mK. We report a single-photoelectron gain of order 10$^6$ and a dark count rate as low as 5~mHz/mm$^2$, 7 orders of magnitude lower than at room temperature. These results confirm the viability of high-gain semiconductor readout in the deep cryogenic regime, clearing the primary obstacle regarding the semiconductor component for the realization of scalable, sub-meV threshold S-I-P-N detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of novel instrumentation requires an iterative cycle with three stages: design, prototyping, and testing. Recent advancements in simulation and nanofabrication techniques have significantly accelerated the design and prototyping phases. Nonetheless, detector characterization continues to be a major bottleneck in device development. During the testing phase, a significant time investment is required to characterize the device in different operating conditions and find optimal operating parameters. The total effort spent on characterization and parameter optimization can occupy a year or more of an expert's time. In this work, we present a novel technique for automated sensor characterization that aims to accelerate the testing stage of the development cycle. This technique leverages closed-loop Bayesian optimization (BO), using real-time measurements to guide parameter selection and identify optimal operating states. We demonstrate the method with a novel low-noise CCD, showing that the machine learning-driven tool can efficiently characterize and optimize operation of the sensor in a couple of days without supervision of a device expert.</description>

      <title>The Use of O2 in Gas Mixtures for Drift Chambers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of Oxygen in gas mixtures for drift chambers is highly discouraged because Oxygen, being strongly electronegative, is generally believed to lead, even in very small quantities, to extremely reduced drift electron survival probability, thus preventing the detector's operation.The drift chamber of the MEG II experiment at PSI has been operating for several years with a gas mixture that mainly contains He:Isobutane in relative proportions of 90:10% by molar concentration, in addition to 1.5% Isopropanol and 0.5% Oxygen. Oxygen and Isopropanol are essential for the proper functioning of the chamber. The electron attachment in the mixture used has proven negligible for the proper operation of the chamber and agrees well with the Garfield++ simulation after correctly accounting for the three-body attachment simulation.</description>

      <title>Design and Performance of a 96-channel Resistive PICOSEC Micromegas Detector for ENUBET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The PICOSEC-Micromegas (PICOSEC-MM) detector is a fast gaseous detector that achieves picosecond-level timing by coupling a Cherenkov radiator, typically an MgF2 crystal, to a Micromegas-based photodetector with a photocathode. This configuration allows the fast photoelectron-induced signal to suppress the intrinsic time jitter of gaseous detectors, enabling sub-20 ps timing precision while preserving the robustness and scalability of micro-pattern gaseous detector technologies. The 96-pad PICOSEC-MM detector is a large-area demonstrator optimized for precision timing in high-energy physics, building on research and development insights from earlier 7-pad resistive prototypes to validate scalability, uniformity, and robustness for the ENUBET project. It employs a 2.5 nm diamond-like carbon photocathode and a Micromegas board with a surface resistivity of 10 megaohms per square, and was characterized using 150 GeV/c muons at the CERN SPS beamline, with one-third of the active area instrumented per run. A dedicated alignment procedure for multi-pad PICOSEC-MM systems was used to reconstruct pad centers and merge measurements across regions, yielding a timing resolution of 43 ps and uniform signal arrival time distributions over the tested area. Mechanical flatness was identified as a key factor, with planarity tolerances within 10 micrometers required to maintain good timing resolution, and the successful operation of the 96-pad demonstrator confirms the scalability of the PICOSEC-MM concept toward robust, high-granularity, picosecond-level gaseous timing detectors for monitored neutrino beam experiments such as ENUBET.</description>

      <title>DC response of an interferometer topology with an L-shaped cavity: a tabletop study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new interferometer topology for kilohertz gravitational-wave detection was recently proposed in [Zhang et al. Phys. Rev. X 13, 021019 (2023)]. The design is based on an L-shaped optical cavity pumped through a Sagnac-like vortex. We report a tabletop experiment that characterizes the interferometer's optical response near DC. When the laser frequency is locked to the resonance of the L-shaped cavity, we observe that the cavity input coupler becomes effectively transparent, yielding a simple Michelson-like response. Moreover, the Sagnac vortex separates into upper and lower paths, which behave as two independent pumping paths driving the cavity. These observations are in agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results provide an intuitive physical picture of this interferometer topology and offer insight into its lock acquisition strategy.</description>

      <title>A compact Optical Liquid Argon Facility at Roma Tre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a compact test facility for the measurement of optical properties of liquid argon as scintillation detector. The setup is under preparation at Roma Tre and it has a volume of 40 L liquid argon, which is liquefied from argon gas with a purity of $\ge 99.9999\%$ vol. To readout the scintillation photons from liquid argon with the highest intensity near 127 nm, we use the vacuum ultraviolet silicon photomultipliers from Hamamatsu. By submerging the photon detectors directly inside the liquid argon, we can eliminate the systematics from the wave length shifter and light guides which have been commonly used to detect the scintillation photons of liquid argon.</description>

      <title>A Neutron Microscope Using a Nested Wolter-I Condenser and a Bank of Diffractive-Refractive Achromatic Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a nested Wolter-I mirror design for a neutron condenser, which is based on established X-ray telescope technology. We demonstrate through simulations that it can increase the flux density at the ESS imaging instrument ODIN by up to two orders of magnitude. Experimental measurements of reflectivity and figure errors on a prototype mirror element confirm the technical feasibility of the approach. Then, we discuss design strategies for an imaging objective to fully exploit the condenser specifications while achieving spatial resolutions comparable to those of X-ray micro-CT instruments. Analytically, we show that for monochromatic beams suitable solutions exist employing arrays of hundreds of identical objectives, realized either as compound refractive lenses (CRLs) or Fresnel zone plates (FZPs). To mitigate the inherent chromatic aberration of these optics, each individual objective could be replaced by an achromatic FZP/CRL combination. Key optical properties of the resulting microscope are estimated. This novel full-field microscopy concept for highly divergent, polychromatic neutron beams has the potential to improve temporal and spatial resolution for large samples and sample environments and to enable the simultaneous acquisition of hundreds of projections in neutron tomography.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sensitivity to trace $^{238}$U impurity of sapphire via coincidence neutron activation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sapphire has mechanical and electrical properties that are advantageous for the construction of internal components of radiation detectors such as time projection chambers and bolometers. However, it has proved difficult to assess its $\rm ^{232}Th$ and $\rm ^{238}U$ content down to the picogram per gram level. This work reports an experimental verification of a computational study that demonstrates $\gamma\gamma$ coincidence counting, coupled with neutron activation analysis (NAA), can reach ppt sensitivities. Combining results from $\gamma\gamma$ coincidence counting with those of earlier single-$\gamma$ counting based NAA shows that a sample of Saint Gobain sapphire has $\rm ^{232}Th$ and $\rm ^{238}U$ concentrations of $&lt;0.26$ ppt and $&lt;2.3$ ppt, respectively; the best constraints on the radiopurity of sapphire.</description>
