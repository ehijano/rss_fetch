      <title>Rethinking Competition as a Non-Beneficial Mechanism in Economic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent economic competition is often justified as a mechanism of innovation, efficiency, and welfare maximization. Yet empirical evidence across disciplines reveals that competition systematically generates fragility, inequality, and ecological degradation, emergent outcomes not of isolated failures but of underlying systemic dynamics. This work reconceptualizes economic ecosystems as real complex adaptive systems, structurally isomorphic with biological and social ecosystems. Integrating complexity science, evolutionary biology, ecology, and economic and business theory, we classify economic interactions according to their systemic effects and propose a theoretical model of ecosystemic equilibrium based on the predominance of beneficial versus non-beneficial relationships. Recognizing economies as ecologically embedded and structurally interdependent systems provides a novel framework for analyzing systemic resilience, reframing competition as a non-beneficial mechanism.</description>

      <title>What Pareto-Efficiency Adjustments Cannot Fix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm is stable and strategy-proof, but can produce outcomes that are Pareto-inefficient for students, and thus several alternative mechanisms have been proposed to correct this inefficiency. However, we show that these mechanisms cannot correct DA's rank-inefficiency and inequality, because these shortcomings can arise even in cases where DA is Pareto-efficient.
  We also examine students' segregation in settings with advantaged and marginalized students. We prove that the demographic composition of every school is perfectly preserved under any Pareto-efficient mechanism that dominates DA, and consequently fully segregated schools under DA maintain their extreme homogeneity.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Games without Rational Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean Field Game (MFG) models implicitly assume "rational expectations", meaning that the heterogeneous agents being modeled correctly know all relevant transition probabilities for the complex system they inhabit. When there is common noise, this assumption results in the "Master equation" (a.k.a. "Monster equation"), a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in which the infinite-dimensional density of agents is a state variable. The rational expectations assumption and the implication that agents solve Master equations is unrealistic in many applications. We show how to instead formulate MFGs with non-rational expectations. Departing from rational expectations is particularly relevant in "MFGs with a low-dimensional coupling", i.e. MFGs in which agents' running reward function depends on the density only through low-dimensional functionals of this density. This happens, for example, in most macroeconomics MFGs in which these low-dimensional functionals have the interpretation of "equilibrium prices." In MFGs with a low-dimensional coupling, departing from rational expectations allows for completely sidestepping the Master equation and for instead solving much simpler finite-dimensional HJB equations. We introduce an adaptive learning model as a particular example of non-rational expectations and discuss its properties.</description>

      <title>Auctions with Tokens: Monetary Policy as a Mechanism Design Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13794v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study a repeated auction in which payments are made with a blockchain token created and initially owned by the auction designer. Unlike the ``virtual money'' previously examined in mechanism design, such tokens can be saved and traded outside the mechanism. I show that the present-discounted value of expected revenues equals that of a conventional dollar auction, but revenues accrue earlier and are less volatile. The optimal monetary policy burns the tokens used for payment, a practice common in blockchain-based protocols. I also show that the same outcome can be reproduced in a dollar auction if the auctioneer issues a suitable dollar-denominated security. This equivalence breaks down with moral hazard and contracting frictions: with severe contracting frictions the token auction dominates, whereas with mild contracting frictions the dollar auction combined with a dollar-denominated financial instrument is preferred.</description>

      <title>Revealed Social Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear-in-means model is the standard empirical model of peer effects. Using choice data and exogenous group variation, we first develop a revealed preference style test for the linear-in-means model. This test is formulated as a linear program and can be interpreted as a no money pump condition with an additional incentive compatibility constraint. We then study the identification properties of the linear-in-means model. A key takeaway from our analysis is that there is a close relationship between the dimension of the outcome variable and the identifiability of the model. Importantly, when the outcome variable is one-dimensional, failures of identification are generic. On the other hand, when the outcome variable is multi-dimensional, we provide natural conditions under which identification is generic.</description>

      <title>Delegation with Costly Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of delegated choice with inspection cost (DCIC), which is a variant of the delegated choice problem by Kleinberg and Kleinberg (EC'18) as well as an extension of the Pandora's box problem with nonobligatory inspection (PNOI) by Doval (JET'18). In our model, an agent may strategically misreport the proposed element's utility, unlike the standard delegated choice problem which assumes that the agent truthfully reports the utility for the proposed alternative. Thus, the principal needs to inspect the proposed element possibly along with other alternatives to maximize its own utility, given an exogenous cost of inspecting each element. Further, the delegation itself incurs a fixed cost, thus the principal can decide whether to delegate or not and inspect by herself.
  We show that DCIC indeed is a generalization of PNOI where the side information from a strategic agent is available at certain cost, implying its NP-hardness by Fu, Li, and Liu (STOC'23). We first consider a costless delegation setting in which the cost of delegation is free. We prove that the maximal mechanism over the pure delegation with a single inspection and an PNOI policy without delegation achieves a $3$-approximation for DCIC with costless delegation, which is further proven to be tight. These results hold even when the cost comes from an arbitrary monotone set function, and can be improved to a $2$-approximation if the cost of inspection is the same for every element. We extend these techniques by presenting a constant factor approximate mechanism for the general setting for rich class of instances.</description>
