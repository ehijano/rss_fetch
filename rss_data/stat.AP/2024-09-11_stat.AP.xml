      <title>Learning about Spatial and Temporal Proximity using Tree-Based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning about the relationship between distance to landmarks and events and phenomena of interest is a multi-faceted problem, as it may require taking into account multiple dimensions, including: spatial position of landmarks, timing of events taking place over time, and attributes of occurrences and locations. Here I show that tree-based methods are well suited for the study of these questions as they allow exploring the relationship between proximity metrics and outcomes of interest in a non-parametric and data-driven manner. I illustrate the usefulness of tree-based methods vis-\`a-vis conventional regression methods by examining the association between: (i) distance to border crossings along the US-Mexico border and support for immigration reform, and (ii) distance to mass shootings and support for gun control.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic geometry-inspired dependent toroidal distribution: Application to regression model for astigmatism data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a dependent toroidal distribution, to analyze astigmatism data following cataract surgery. Rather than utilizing the flat torus, we opt to represent the bivariate angular data on the surface of a curved torus, which naturally offers smooth edge identifiability and accommodates a variety of curvatures: positive, negative, and zero. Beginning with the area-uniform toroidal distribution on this curved surface, we develop a five-parameter-dependent toroidal distribution that harnesses its intrinsic geometry via the area element to model the distribution of two dependent circular random variables. We show that both marginal distributions are Cardioid, with one of the conditional variables also following a Cardioid distribution. This key feature enables us to propose a circular-circular regression model based on conditional expectations derived from circular moments. To address the high rejection rate (approximately 50%) in existing acceptance-rejection sampling methods for Cardioid distributions, we introduce an exact sampling method based on a probabilistic transformation. Additionally, we generate random samples from the proposed dependent toroidal distribution through suitable conditioning. This bivariate distribution and the regression model are applied to analyze astigmatism data arising in the follow-up of one and three months due to cataract surgery.</description>

      <title>Applications of machine learning to predict seasonal precipitation for East Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seasonal climate forecasts are commonly based on model runs from fully coupled forecasting systems that use Earth system models to represent interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, land and other Earth-system components. Recently, machine learning (ML) methods are increasingly being investigated for this task where large-scale climate variability is linked to local or regional temperature or precipitation in a linear or non-linear fashion. This paper investigates the use of interpretable ML methods to predict seasonal precipitation for East Africa in an operational setting. Dimension reduction is performed by decomposing the precipitation fields via empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), such that only the respective factor loadings need to the predicted. Indices of large-scale climate variability--including the rate of change in individual indices as well as interactions between different indices--are then used as potential features to obtain tercile forecasts from an interpretable ML algorithm. Several research questions regarding the use of data and the effect of model complexity are studied. The results are compared against the ECMWF seasonal forecasting system (SEAS5) for three seasons--MAM, JJAS and OND--over the period 1993-2020. Compared to climatology for the same period, the ECMWF forecasts have negative skill in MAM and JJAS and significant positive skill in OND. The ML approach is on par with climatology in MAM and JJAS and a significantly positive skill in OND, if not quite at the level of the OND ECMWF forecast.</description>

      <title>Robust semi-parametric signal detection in particle physics with classifiers decorrelated via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches of new signals in particle physics are usually done by training a supervised classifier to separate a signal model from the known Standard Model physics (also called the background model). However, even when the signal model is correct, systematic errors in the background model can influence supervised classifiers and might adversely affect the signal detection procedure. To tackle this problem, one approach is to use the (possibly misspecified) classifier only to perform a preliminary signal-enrichment step and then to carry out a bump hunt on the signal-rich sample using only the real experimental data. For this procedure to work, we need a classifier constrained to be decorrelated with one or more protected variables used for the signal detection step. We do this by considering an optimal transport map of the classifier output that makes it independent of the protected variable(s) for the background. We then fit a semi-parametric mixture model to the distribution of the protected variable after making cuts on the transformed classifier to detect the presence of a signal. We compare and contrast this decorrelation method with previous approaches, show that the decorrelation procedure is robust to moderate background misspecification, and analyse the power of the signal detection test as a function of the cut on the classifier.</description>

      <title>Monitoring road infrastructures from satellite images in Greater Maputo: an object-oriented classification approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The information about pavement surface type is rarely available in road network databases of developing countries although it represents a cornerstone of the design of efficient mobility systems. This research develops an automatic classification pipeline for road pavement which makes use of satellite images to recognize road segments as paved or unpaved. The proposed methodology is based on an object-oriented approach, so that each road is classified by looking at the distribution of its pixels in the RGB space. The proposed approach is proven to be accurate, inexpensive, and readily replicable in other cities.</description>

      <title>Some statistical aspects of the Covid-19 response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses some statistical aspects of the U.K. Covid-19 pandemic response, focussing particularly on cases where we believe that a statistically questionable approach or presentation has had a substantial impact on public perception, or government policy, or both. We discuss the presentation of statistics relating to Covid risk, and the risk of the response measures, arguing that biases tended to operate in opposite directions, overplaying Covid risk and underplaying the response risks. We also discuss some issues around presentation of life loss data, excess deaths and the use of case data. The consequences of neglect of most individual variability from epidemic models, alongside the consequences of some other statistically important omissions are also covered. Finally the evidence for full stay at home lockdowns having been necessary to reverse waves of infection is examined, with new analyses provided for a number of European countries.</description>

      <title>Teacher-student relationship and teaching styles in primary education. A model of analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The teacher role in the classroom can explain important aspects of the student's school experience. The teacher-student relationship, a central dimension of social capital, influences students' engagement, and the teaching style plays an important role in student outcomes. But there is scarce literature that links teaching styles to teacher-student relationship. This article aims to: 1) analyze whether there is a relationship between teaching styles and the type of relationship perceived by students; 2) test whether this relationship is equally strong for any teaching style; and 3) determine the extent to which students' perceptions vary according to their profile. Design/methodology/approach: A structural equation model with four latent variables is estimated: two for the teacher-student relationship (emotional vs. educational) and two for the teaching styles (directive vs. participative), with information for 21126 sixth-grade primary-students in 2019 in Spain. Findings: Teacher-student relationships and teaching styles are interconnected. The participative style implies a better relationship. The perceptions of the teacher are heterogeneous, depending on gender (girls perceive clearer than boys) and with the educational background (children from lower educational background perceive both types of teaching styles more clearly). Originality/value: The analysis is based on the point of view of the addressee of the teacher's work, i.e. the student. It provides a model that can be replicated in any other education system. The latent variables, based on a periodically administered questionnaire, could be estimated with data from diagnostic assessments in other countries, which in turn would allow the formulation of context-specific educational policy proposals that take into account student feedback.</description>

      <title>Nested Fusion: A Method for Learning High Resolution Latent Structure of Multi-Scale Measurement Data on Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mars Perseverance Rover represents a generational change in the scale of measurements that can be taken on Mars, however this increased resolution introduces new challenges for techniques in exploratory data analysis. The multiple different instruments on the rover each measures specific properties of interest to scientists, so analyzing how underlying phenomena affect multiple different instruments together is important to understand the full picture. However each instrument has a unique resolution, making the mapping between overlapping layers of data non-trivial. In this work, we introduce Nested Fusion, a method to combine arbitrarily layered datasets of different resolutions and produce a latent distribution at the highest possible resolution, encoding complex interrelationships between different measurements and scales. Our method is efficient for large datasets, can perform inference even on unseen data, and outperforms existing methods of dimensionality reduction and latent analysis on real-world Mars rover data. We have deployed our method Nested Fusion within a Mars science team at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and through multiple rounds of participatory design enabled greatly enhanced exploratory analysis workflows for real scientists. To ensure the reproducibility of our work we have open sourced our code on GitHub at https://github.com/pixlise/NestedFusion.</description>

      <title>Predicting Electricity Consumption with Random Walks on Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider time-series forecasting problems where data is scarce, difficult to gather, or induces a prohibitive computational cost. As a first attempt, we focus on short-term electricity consumption in France, which is of strategic importance for energy suppliers and public stakeholders. The complexity of this problem and the many levels of geospatial granularity motivate the use of an ensemble of Gaussian Processes (GPs). Whilst GPs are remarkable predictors, they are computationally expensive to train, which calls for a frugal few-shot learning approach. By taking into account performance on GPs trained on a dataset and designing a random walk on these, we mitigate the training cost of our entire Bayesian decision-making procedure. We introduce our algorithm called \textsc{Domino} (ranDOM walk on gaussIaN prOcesses) and present numerical experiments to support its merits.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Two Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies with Unusually Bright Globular Cluster Luminosity Functions via a Mark-Dependently Thinned Point Process (MATHPOP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present \textsc{Mathpop}, a novel method to infer the globular cluster (GC) counts in ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) and low-surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs). Many known UDGs have a surprisingly high ratio of GC number to surface brightness. However, standard methods to infer GC counts in UDGs face various challenges, such as photometric measurement uncertainties, GC membership uncertainties, and assumptions about the GC luminosity functions (GCLFs). \textsc{Mathpop} tackles these challenges using the mark-dependent thinned point process, enabling joint inference of the spatial and magnitude distributions of GCs. In doing so, \textsc{Mathpop} allows us to infer and quantify the uncertainties in both GC counts and GCLFs with minimal assumptions. As a precursor to \textsc{Mathpop}, we also address the data uncertainties coming from the selection process of GC candidates: we obtain probabilistic GC candidates instead of the traditional binary classification based on the color--magnitude diagram. We apply \textsc{Mathpop} to 40 LSBGs in the Perseus cluster using GC catalogs from a \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} imaging program. We then compare our results to those from an independent study using the standard method. We further calibrate and validate our approach through extensive simulations. Our approach reveals two LSBGs having GCLF turnover points much brighter than the canonical value with Bayes' factor being $\sim4.5$ and $\sim2.5$, respectively. An additional crude maximum-likelihood estimation shows that their GCLF TO points are approximately $0.9$~mag and $1.1$~mag brighter than the canonical value, with $p$-value $\sim 10^{-8}$ and $\sim 10^{-5}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic-statistical model for the expansion of ash dieback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hymenoscyphus fraxineus is an invasive forest fungal pathogen that induces severe dieback in European ash populations. The spread of the disease has been closely monitored in France by the forest health survey system. We have developed a mechanisticstatistical model that describes the spread of the disease. It takes into account climate (summer temperature and spring rainfall), pathogen population dynamics (foliar infection, Allee effect induced by limited sexual partner encounters) and host density. We fitted this model using available disease reports. We estimated the parameters of our model, first identifying the appropriate ranges for the parameters, which led to a model reduction, and then using an adaptive multiple importance sampling algorithm for fitting. The model reproduces well the propagation observed in France over the last 20 years. In particular, it predicts the absence of disease impact in the south-east of the country and its weak development in the Garonne valley in south-west France. Summer temperature is the factor with the highest overall effect on disease spread, and explains the limited impact in southern France. Among the different temperature indices tested, the number of summer days with temperatures above 28{\textdegree}C gave the best qualitative behavior and the best fit. In contrast, the Allee effect and the heterogeneity of spring precipitation did not strongly affect the overall expansion of H. fraxineus in France and could be neglected in the modeling process. The model can be used to infer the average annual dispersal of H. fraxineus in France.</description>

      <title>This is not normal! (Re-) Evaluating the lower $n$ guildelines for regression analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The commonly cited rule of thumb for regression analysis, which suggests that a sample size of $n \geq 30$ is sufficient to ensure valid inferences, is frequently referenced but rarely scrutinized. This research note evaluates the lower bound for the number of observations required for regression analysis by exploring how different distributional characteristics, such as skewness and kurtosis, influence the convergence of t-values to the t-distribution in linear regression models. Through an extensive simulation study involving over 22 billion regression models, this paper examines a range of symmetric, platykurtic, and skewed distributions, testing sample sizes from 4 to 10,000. The results reveal that it is sufficient that either the dependent or independent variable follow a symmetric distribution for the t-values to converge to the t-distribution at much smaller sample sizes than $n=30$. This is contrary to previous guidance which suggests that the error term needs to be normally distributed for this convergence to happen at low $n$. On the other hand, if both dependent and independent variables are highly skewed the required sample size is substantially higher. In cases of extreme skewness, even sample sizes of 10,000 do not ensure convergence. These findings suggest that the $n\geq30$ rule is too permissive in certain cases but overly conservative in others, depending on the underlying distributional characteristics. This study offers revised guidelines for determining the minimum sample size necessary for valid regression analysis.</description>

      <title>UAVDB: Trajectory-Guided Adaptable Bounding Boxes for UAV Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of drone technology, accurate detection of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has become essential for applications such as surveillance, security, and airspace management. In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory-guided method, the Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC) technique, which generates high-fidelity bounding boxes for UAV detection tasks and no need for the effort required for labeling. The PIC technique forms the foundation for developing UAVDB, a database explicitly created for UAV detection. Unlike existing datasets, which often use low-resolution footage or focus on UAVs in simple backgrounds, UAVDB employs high-resolution video to capture UAVs at various scales, ranging from hundreds of pixels to nearly single-digit sizes. This broad-scale variation enables comprehensive evaluation of detection algorithms across different UAV sizes and distances. Applying the PIC technique, we can also efficiently generate detection datasets from trajectory or positional data, even without size information. We extensively benchmark UAVDB using YOLOv8 series detectors, offering a detailed performance analysis. Our findings highlight UAVDB's potential as a vital database for advancing UAV detection, particularly in high-resolution and long-distance tracking scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Source enumeration, the task of estimating the number of sources from the signal received by the array of antennas, is a critical problem in array signal processing. Numerous methods have been proposed to estimate the number of sources under white or colored Gaussian noise. However, their performance degrades significantly in the presence of a limited number of observations and/or a large number of sources. In this work, we propose a method based on the distribution of angles that performs well in (a) independent Gaussian, (b) spatially colored Gaussian, and (c) heavy-tailed noise, even when the number of sources is large. We support the supremacy of our algorithm over state-of-the-art methods with extensive simulation results.</description>

      <title>Advancing Causal Inference: A Nonparametric Approach to ATE and CATE Estimation with Continuous Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a generalized ps-BART model for the estimation of Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) in continuous treatments, addressing limitations of the Bayesian Causal Forest (BCF) model. The ps-BART model's nonparametric nature allows for flexibility in capturing nonlinear relationships between treatment and outcome variables. Across three distinct sets of Data Generating Processes (DGPs), the ps-BART model consistently outperforms the BCF model, particularly in highly nonlinear settings. The ps-BART model's robustness in uncertainty estimation and accuracy in both point-wise and probabilistic estimation demonstrate its utility for real-world applications. This research fills a crucial gap in causal inference literature, providing a tool better suited for nonlinear treatment-outcome relationships and opening avenues for further exploration in the domain of continuous treatment effect estimation.</description>

      <title>Inferring Epidemics from Multiple Dependent Data via Pseudo-Marginal Methods</title>

Abstract: Health-policy planning requires evidence on the burden that epidemics place on healthcare systems. Multiple, often dependent, datasets provide a noisy and fragmented signal from the unobserved epidemic process including transmission and severity dynamics. This paper explores important challenges to the use of state-space models for epidemic inference when multiple dependent datasets are analysed. We propose a new semi-stochastic model that exploits deterministic approximations for large-scale transmission dynamics while retaining stochasticity in the occurrence and reporting of relatively rare severe events. This model is suitable for many real-time situations including large seasonal epidemics and pandemics. Within this context, we develop algorithms to provide exact parameter inference and test them via simulation. Finally, we apply our joint model and the proposed algorithm to several surveillance data on the 2017-18 influenza epidemic in England to reconstruct transmission dynamics and estimate the daily new influenza infections as well as severity indicators such as the case-hospitalisation risk and the hospital-intensive care risk.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Framework for Estimating Aircraft Fuel Consumption Based on Flight Trajectories</title>

Abstract: Accurate calculation of aircraft fuel consumption plays an irreplaceable role in flight operations, optimization, and pollutant accounting. Calculating aircraft fuel consumption accurately is tricky because it changes based on different flying conditions and physical factors. Utilizing flight surveillance data, this study developed a comprehensive mathematical framework and established a link between flight dynamics and fuel consumption, providing a set of high-precision, high-resolution fuel calculation methods. It also allows other practitioners to select data sources according to specific needs through this framework. The methodology begins by addressing the functional aspects of interval fuel consumption. We apply spectral transformation techniques to mine Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data, identifying key aspects of the flight profile and establishing their theoretical relationships with fuel consumption. Subsequently, a deep neural network with tunable parameters is used to fit this multivariate function, facilitating high-precision calculations of interval fuel consumption. Furthermore, a second-order smooth monotonic interpolation method was constructed along with a novel estimation method for instantaneous fuel consumption. Numerical results have validated the effectiveness of the model. Using ADS-B and Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) data from 2023 for testing, the average error of interval fuel consumption can be reduced to as low as $3.31\%$, and the error in the integral sense of instantaneous fuel consumption is $8.86\%$. These results establish this model as the state of the art, achieving the lowest estimation errors in aircraft fuel consumption calculations to date.</description>

      <title>Robust estimations from distribution structures: I. Mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12110v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the most fundamental problem in statistics, robust location estimation has many prominent solutions, such as the trimmed mean, Winsorized mean, Hodges Lehmann estimator, Huber M estimator, and median of means. Recent studies suggest that their maximum biases concerning the mean can be quite different, but the underlying mechanisms largely remain unclear. This study exploited a semiparametric method to classify distributions by the asymptotic orderliness of quantile combinations with varying breakdown points, showing their interrelations and connections to parametric distributions. Further deductions explain why the Winsorized mean typically has smaller biases compared to the trimmed mean; two sequences of semiparametric robust mean estimators emerge, particularly highlighting the superiority of the median Hodges Lehmann mean. This article sheds light on the understanding of the common nature of probability distributions.</description>

      <title>Process-based Inference for Spatial Energetics Using Bayesian Predictive Stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid developments in streaming data technologies have enabled real-time monitoring of human activity that can deliver high-resolution data on health variables over trajectories or paths carved out by subjects as they conduct their daily physical activities. Wearable devices, such as wrist-worn sensors that monitor gross motor activity, have become prevalent and have kindled the emerging field of "spatial energetics" in environmental health sciences. We devise a Bayesian inferential framework for analyzing such data while accounting for information available on specific spatial coordinates comprising a trajectory or path using a Global Positioning System (GPS) device embedded within the wearable device. We offer full probabilistic inference with uncertainty quantification using spatial-temporal process models adapted for data generated from "actigraph" units as the subject traverses a path or trajectory in their daily routine. Anticipating the need for fast inference for mobile health data, we pursue exact inference using conjugate Bayesian models and employ predictive stacking to assimilate inference across these individual models. This circumvents issues with iterative estimation algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. We devise Bayesian predictive stacking in this context for models that treat time as discrete epochs and that treat time as continuous. We illustrate our methods with simulation experiments and analysis of data from the Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches (PASTA-LA) study conducted by the Fielding School of Public Health at the University of California, Los Angeles.</description>
