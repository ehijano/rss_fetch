      <title>$ np \leftrightarrow d\gamma $ reactions calculated up to $E_{\gamma}=20$ MeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the electromagnetic dipole transition cross sections for the $np \rightarrow d\gamma$ and $ d\gamma \rightarrow np$ reactions over a broad range of energies. We use the LENPIC nucleon-nucleon interaction obtained from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) up to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N4LO) and effective electromagnetic dipole transition operators obtained from the same $\chi$EFT up to N2LO. Our results agree with existing experiments. We get results at energies for which experimental data and/or modern theoretical calculations have not been reported. In this study, we utilize a new approach, namely, our adaptation of the Efros [V. D. Efros, Phys. Rev. C 99, 034620 (2019)] method that is prospective for future many-body applications in calculations of bound and continuum state wave functions.</description>

      <title>Gorkov algebraic diagrammatic construction for infinite nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approximate many-body truncation for Gorkov self-consistent Green's function (SCGF) theory where pairing correlations are handled at first order, while the bulk of many-body correlations are described using the particle-number conserving Dyson-SCGF scheme up to third order in the algebraic diagrammatic construction, a method so far restricted to closed shell isotopes. The new method is enabled by the introduction of a scheme that allows to approximate the Gorkov propagator in terms of a particle-number-conserving optimized reference state. The approach provides state-of-the-art predictions of the equation of state and spectral properties of infinite nuclear matter at zero temperature and in the presence of pairing. We find satisfactory results using modern saturating Hamiltonians at next-to-next-to-leading order in chiral effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Improved microscopic nuclear level densities within the triaxial Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov plus combinatorial method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New developments have been brought to our energy-, spin- and parity-dependent nuclear level densities based on the microscopic combinatorial method. Our new calculation is based on the BSkG3 mean-field model which relies on a three-dimensional coordinate-space representation of the nucleus, allowing for the spontaneous breaking of ground state rotational, axial and reflection symmetry. In particular, we now account for the impact of possible triaxial deformation of nuclear ground states on the level density. This has two effects on our calculations: the additional freedom of the single-particle levels affects the intrinsic level density while the absence of a rotational symmetry axis results in a larger collective correction. The present model reproduces the experimental s- and p-wave neutron resonance spacings with a degree of accuracy comparable to that of the best global models available. It is also shown that the model gives a reliable extrapolation at low energies where experimental data on the cumulative number of levels can be extracted. The predictions are also in good agreement with the experimental data extracted from the Oslo method. Total level densities for more than 8500 nuclei are made available in a table format for practical applications. For the nuclei for which experimental s-wave spacings and enough low-lying states exist, renormalization factors are provided to reproduce simultaneously both observables. The same combinatorial method is used to estimate the nuclear level densities at the fission saddle points of actinides and at the shape isomer deformation. Finally, the new nuclear level densities are applied to the calculation of radiative neutron capture cross sections and compared with those obtained with our previous combinatorial model.</description>

      <title>Thermal Evolution of Shape Coexistence in Mo and Ru Isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temperature-driven shape dynamics of isotopic chains of Mo and Ru elements and their impact on decay modes have been investigated in a statistical theoretical framework with macroscopic-microscopic apporach. These isotopes located at the key points in r-process path are known for the rapid structural changes, shape instabilities and shape coexistence that impact the nuclear processes, decay modes and lifetimes. At high temperatures that may exist in stars or in various nuclear reaction processes, these nuclei undergo a variety of shape and deformation changes due to thermal shell quenching effects influencing the decay energies (Q value), and eventually life-time have been studied in detail. Our findings provide insight into the observed shift in the deformation, shapes and coexisting states due to the diminishing nuclear shell effects in hot nuclei, revealing that the structural changes influence the decay processes and significantly in the astrophysically relevant Mo-Ru region especially around A = 100.</description>

      <title>Role of $\Sigma(1660)$ in the $K^- p \to\pi^0\pi^0\Sigma^0$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The processes of $K^-p \to \pi^0 \pi^0 \Sigma^0$ and $K^- p \to \pi^0 \Lambda(1405)$ are studied within the effective Lagrangian approach. In addition to the ``background" contribution from the $u$-channel nucleon pole term, contribution from the $\Sigma(1660)$ resonance with spin-parity $J^P=1/2^+$ is also considered. For the $K^-p \to \pi^0 \pi^0 \Sigma^0$ reaction, we perform a calculation for the total and differential cross sections by considering the contribution from the $\Sigma(1660)$ intermediate resonance decaying into $\pi^0 \Lambda(1405)$ with $\Lambda(1405)$ decaying into $\pi^0 \Sigma^0$. With our model parameters, the available experimental data on both the $K^-p \to \pi^0 \pi^0 \Sigma^0$ and $K^- p \to \pi^0 \Lambda(1405)$ reactions can be fairly well reproduced. It is shown that we really need the contribution from the $\Sigma(1660)$ resonance, and that these experimental measurements could be used to determine some properties of the $\Sigma(1660)$ resonance.</description>

      <title>Extracting scattering phase shift in quantum mechanics on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of extracting infinite volume scattering phase shift on quantum computers in a simple one-dimensional quantum mechanical model, using the formalism established in Ref.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc} that relates the integrated correlation functions (ICF) for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral. The system is first discretized in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions, and the formalism in real time is verified by employing a contact interaction potential with exact solutions. Quantum circuits are then designed and constructed to implement the formalism on current quantum computing architectures. To overcome the fast oscillatory behavior of the integrated correlation functions in real-time simulation, different methods of post-data analysis are proposed and discussed. Test results on IBM hardware show that good agreement can be achieved with two qubits, but complete failure ensues with three qubits due to two-qubit gate operation errors and thermal relaxation errors.</description>

      <title>Complete NLO BFKL impact factors for quarkonium hadroproduction in NRQCD: the case of ${}^1S_0^{[1]}$, ${}^1S_0^{[8]}$, and ${}^3S_1^{[8]}$ states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first complete next-to-leading order calculation of the impact factors for hadroproduction of $S$-wave quarkonium states within the BFKL formalism. We present the computation of the real-emission contributions which completes the recent one of one-loop virtual corrections by one of us for the impact factors for the ${}^1S_0^{[1]}$, ${}^1S_0^{[8]}$, and ${}^3S_1^{[8]}$ NRQCD states. We prove the cancellation of soft divergences between real and virtual contributions, and that the surviving collinear singularities are compatible with factorisation up to one loop for a novel class of processes where BFKL resummation can be applied. Our work indeed represents the first complete NLO quarkonium impact factor in the BFKL framework and paves the way to first next-to-leading-logarithmic-precision studies for hadroproduction of forward-backward quarkonium associated production at hadron colliders.</description>

Abstract: I review recent progress in calculating scattering amplitudes and resonance properties involving three particles using results from lattice QCD. The necessary input is the finite-volume spectrum, and the outputs -- via solutions of integral equations -- are scattering amplitudes that can be continued into the complex plane to search for resonance poles. I describe the outlook for future extensions and applications of this work.</description>

      <title>Variational Theory and Parquet Diagrams for Nuclear Systems: A Comprehensive Study of Neutron Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To deal with the problem of realistic nuclear interactions we have combined techniques of the Jastrow-Feenberg variational method and the local parquet-diagram theory. In the language of diagrammatic perturbation theory, ``commutator diagrams'' can be identified with non-parquet diagrams. We examine the physical processes described by these terms and include the relevant diagrams in a way that is suggested by the Jastrow-Feenberg approach. We show that the corrections from non-parquet contributions are, at short distances, larger than all other many-body effects.
  We examine here neutron matter as a prototype of systems with state-dependent interactions. Calculations are carried out for neutrons interacting via the so-called $v_8$ version of four popular interactions. We determine the structure and effective interactions and apply the method to the calculation of the energetics, structure and dynamic properties such as the single-particle self-energy and the dynamic response functions as well as BCS pairing in both singlet and triplet states. We find that many-body correlations lead to a strong reduction of the spin-orbit interaction, and, therefore, to a suppression of the $^3P_2$ and $^3P_2$-$^3F_2$ gaps. We also find pairing in $^3P_0$ states; the strength of the pairing gap depends sensitively on the potential model employed.</description>

      <title>A Study on the Triggering of Nucleonic Direct Urca Processes in Neutron Stars of Specific Masses and Their Hyperon Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims to analyze how hyperons affect neutrino radiation properties in nucleonic direct URCA processes, expecting to provide useful references for finding evidence of the existence of hyperons in astronomical observations. This analysis is carried out using the GM1 and NL3 parameter sets under the SU(6) and SU(3) flavor symmetries in the relativistic mean field theory framework. Combined with the inferred mass and radius values of PSRs J1231-1411, J0030+0451, and J0740+6620, our results show that nucleonic direct Urca processes are absent in PSR J1231-1411 due to momentum conservation violation. In hyperon-containing PSR J0030+0451 (NL3 parameter set), the nucleonic direct Urca processes involving $e^{-}$/ $\mu^{-}$ would occur. A large inferred mass span induces hyperon fraction variations, affecting neutrino emissivity. If the inferred mass of PSR J0030+0451 exceeds approximately 1.8 $M_{\odot}$, the neutrino luminosity of the nucleonic direct Urca processes under the SU(3) flavor symmetry remains nearly the same as that in npe$\mu$ matter, without depending on hyperons. However, it exhibits an obvious hyperon dependence under the SU(6) spin-flavor symmetry. For hyperon-containing J0740+6620, the nucleonic direct Urca processes under the SU(3) flavor symmetry in GM1 parameter set predicts faster neutrino luminosity decline with hyperonic fraction than npe$\mu$ matter, and under the SU(6) spin-flavor symmetry in NL3 parameter set it shows monotonic decreasing trend. The research shows that hyperonic fraction significantly affect the neutrino radiation properties of the nucleonic direct URCA processes in neutron stars. Different-mass pulsars (e.g., PSRs J1231-1411, J0030+0451, J0740+6620) exhibit the distinct nucleonic direct URCA processes behaviors, dependent on inferred masses/radii, parameter sets, and theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Magnetized Proto-Neutron Stars: Structure and Stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of magnetized protoneutron stars (PNSs) through four schematic stages: neutrino trapped, deleptonization, neutrino transparent, and the final cold, catalyzed neutron star (NS). Using a quasi static approximation on the Kelvin Helmholtz timescale, we construct strongly magnetized configurations (magnetic field strengths up to 1e17 G) with the axisymmetric XNS 4.0 code, employing equations of state derived from relativistic mean field theory calibrated with the DDME2 parameter set. We analyze the evolution of the gravitational mass, equatorial radius, stellar deformation, magnetic flux, and the ratio of magnetic to gravitational binding energy as functions of thermodynamic and compositional changes. We find that increasing entropy per baryon and decreasing lepton fraction lead to higher core temperatures, which enhance magnetic deformation, flux confinement, and the magnetic to binding energy ratio. Magnetic field dissipation is most efficient during the deleptonization and neutrino transparent stages, and this process largely determines the observable magnetic field strength of the mature neutron star. This work provides the first general relativistic characterization of how the thermal and compositional evolution of protoneutron stars reshapes magnetic field deformation and energetics across poloidal, toroidal, and mixed field configurations at fixed baryonic mass.</description>

      <title>Roles of $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects in cold and dense two-color QCD with $2+2$ flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore phase structures and hadron mass spectra in cold and dense two-color QCD with $2+2$ flavors where the sign problem disappears. We particularly focus on $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects. We employ an $N_f=2+2$ linear sigma model based on the $SU(8)$ Pauli-G\"{u}rsey symmetry to describe negative-parity as well as positive-parity hadrons, for which low-energy excitations are appropriately described particularly in the baryon superfluid phase with light diquark condensates. As a result, the strange chiral condensate is found to be enhanced in the superfluid phase owing to the flavor-mixing structure of $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects. We also confirm this enhancement by means of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. Besides, our present analysis predicts the existence of a novel superfluid phase where heavy diquarks condense in dense regime. The topological susceptibility with $2+2$ flavors from the viewpoints of the anomaly effects and chiral-symmetry restoration is investigated. Furthermore, we derive a complete inverse mass hierarchy for negative-parity diquarks with sufficient anomaly effects. Our findings are expected to provide future lattice simulations with useful information on flavor-symmetry violation from the $U(1)$ axial anomaly aspects in cold and dense two-color QCD medium.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Hadronic Matter on Parton Energy Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modified thermal distributions (dispersion relations) are introduced within both the MATTER and LBT event generators used to describe jet modification in a heavy-ion collision, within the JETSCAPE framework. Hard partons, propagating through dense matter, scatter off the partonic substructure of the medium, leading to stimulated emission, accompanied by recoiling medium partons. We introduce a simple modification, a multiplicative $(1 + a/T)$ correction to the dispersion relation of quarks and gluons (equivalent to an effective fugacity). This leads to calculated transport coefficients (e.g. $\hat{q}/T^3$) showing the expected behavior of depreciating at lower temperatures, including within the hot hadronic gas. This simple modification recovers the light-like dispersion relations at high temperatures, and introduces an excess depreciation factor for parton populations at lower temperatures, allowing partonic energy loss and recoil calculations to be extended into the hadronic phase. This modified distribution, in combination with initial state cold nuclear matter effects (shadowing), is used to simultaneously describe the nuclear modification factor and elliptic anisotropy of jets and leading hadrons, over multiple centralities and collision energies.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase of exceptional point as quantum resonance in complex scaling method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian operators and exceptional points (EPs) are now routinely realized in few-mode systems such as optical resonators and superconducting qubits. However, their foundations in genuine scattering problems with unbounded Hamiltonians remain much less clear. In this work, we address how the geometric phase associated with encircling an EP should be formulated when the underlying eigenstates are quantum resonances within a one-dimensional scattering model. To do this, we employ the complex scaling method, where resonance poles of the S-matrix are realized as discrete eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian dilated Hamiltonian, to construct situations in which resonant and scattering states coalesce into an EP in the complex energy plane, that is, the resonance pole is embedded into the continuum spectrum. We analyze the self-orthogonality in the vicinity of an EP, the Berry phase, and the Chern characteristic. Our results provide a bridge between non-Hermitian spectral theory and the traditional theory of quantum resonances.</description>
