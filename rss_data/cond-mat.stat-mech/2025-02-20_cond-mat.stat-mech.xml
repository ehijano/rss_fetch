      <title>Entropy of spatial network with applications to non-extensive statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method is proposed for analyzing complexity and studying the information in random geometric networks using Tsallis entropy tool. Tsallis entropy of the ensemble of random geometric networks is calculated based on the components of the random connection model on the point process which is obtained by connecting the points with a probability that depends on their relative positions (10.1016/j.indag.2022.05.002, 2022). According to information theory and conditional discussion, the bounds for Shannon and Tsallis entropies of the ensemble of this random graph are presented. Using this function and Lagrange's formula, the connection function that provides the maximum Tsallis entropy based on general constraints is obtained. Then, a simulation-based example is presented to clarify the application of the proposed method in the study of ad hoc wireless networks. By observing the obtained results, it can be stated that the wireless networks that adhere to the model studied here are almost maximally complex. Also, Tsallis conditional entropy maximizing function is compared with other connection functions using numerical calculations and the optimal value for the maximization of conditional entropies is obtained.</description>

      <title>Heating of a semi-infinite Hooke chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider unsteady ballistic heat transport in a semi-infinite Hooke chain with a free end and an arbitrary heat source. An analytical description of the evolution of the kinetic temperature is proposed in both discrete (exact) and continuum (approximate) formulations. The continualization of the discrete solution for kinetic temperature is performed through a large-time asymptotic estimate of the fundamental solution of the dynamical problem for the instantly perturbed conservative semi-infinite chain at the fronts of the incident and reflected thermal waves. By analyzing the continuum solution, we observe that any instantaneous heat supply (i.e., a heat pulse) results in the anti-localization of the reflected thermal wave. We demonstrate that sudden point heat supply leads to a transition to a non-equilibrium steady state, which, unexpectedly, may exist even in the non-dissipative case. The results of this paper are expected to provide insight into the continuum description of nanoscale heat transport.</description>

      <title>Time-delayed Newton's law of cooling with a finite-rate thermal quench. Impact on the Mpemba and Kovacs effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mpemba and Kovacs effects are two notable memory phenomena observed in nonequilibrium relaxation processes. In a recent study [Phys.~Rev.~E \textbf{109}, 044149 (2024)], these effects were analyzed within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling under the assumption of instantaneous temperature quenches. Here, the analysis is extended to incorporate finite-rate quenches, characterized by a nonzero quench duration $\sigma$. The results indicate that a genuine Mpemba effect is absent under finite-rate quenches if both samples experience the same thermal environment during the quenching process. However, if $\sigma$ remains sufficiently small, the deviations in the thermal environment stay within an acceptable range, allowing the Mpemba effect to persist with a slightly enhanced magnitude. In contrast, the Kovacs effect is significantly amplified, with the transient hump in the temperature evolution becoming more pronounced as both the waiting time and $\sigma$ increase. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating finite-time effects in nonequilibrium thermal relaxation models and offer a more realistic perspective for experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Neural Density Functional Theory in Higher Dimensions with Convolutional Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on recent advancements in using machine learning for classical density functional theory for systems with one-dimensional, planar inhomogeneities, we propose a machine learning model for application in two dimensions (2D) akin to density functionals in weighted density forms, as e. g. in fundamental measure theory (FMT). We implement the model with fast convolutional layers only and apply it to a system of hard disks in fully 2D inhomogeneous situations. The model is trained on a combination of smooth and steplike external potentials in the fluid phase. Pair correlation functions from test particle geometry show very satisfactory agreement with simulations although these types of external potentials have not been included in the training. The method should be fully applicable to 3D problems, where the bottleneck at the moment appears to be in obtaining smooth enough 3D histograms as training data from simulations.</description>

      <title>Quorum sensing and absorbing phase transitions in colloidal active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike biological active matter that constantly adapt to their environment, the motors of synthetic active particles are typically agnostic to their surroundings and merely operate at constant force. Here, we design colloidal active rods capable of modulating their inner activity in response to crowding, thereby enforcing a primitive form of quorum sensing interactions. Through experiments, simulations and theory we elucidate the impact of these interactions on the phase behavior of isotropic active matter. We demonstrate that, when conditioned to density, motility regulation can either lead to an absorbing phase transition, where all particles freeze their dynamics, or to atypical phase separation, where flat interfaces supporting a net pressure drop are in mechanical equilibrium. Fully active and fully arrested particles can then form heterogeneous patterns ruled by the competition between quorum sensing and mechanical interactions. Beyond the specifics of motile colloids, we expect our findings to apply broadly to adaptive active matter assembled from living or synthetic units.</description>

      <title>A mechanism for ice growth on the surface of a spherical water droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation and growth of ice particles, particularly on the surfaces of spherical water droplets, bear profound implications for localized weather systems and global climate. Herein, we develop a theoretical framework for ice nucleation on minuscule water droplets, establishing that $10\sim5000\rm\ nm$ droplets can considerably increase in volume, making a substantial contribution to ice formation within mist, fog, or even cloud systems. We reveal that the Casimir-Lifshitz (van der Waals) interaction within these systems is robust enough to stimulate both water and ice growth on the surfaces of ice-cold spherical water droplets. The significant impacts and possible detectable phenomena from the curvature are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Conditional Mutual Information and Information-Theoretic Phases of Decohered Gibbs States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical and quantum Markov networks -- including Gibbs states of commuting local Hamiltonians -- are characterized by the vanishing of conditional mutual information (CMI) between spatially separated subsystems. Adding local dissipation to a Markov network turns it into a \emph{hidden Markov network}, in which CMI is not guaranteed to vanish even at long distances. The onset of long-range CMI corresponds to an information-theoretic mixed-state phase transition, with far-ranging implications for teleportation, decoding, and state compressions. Little is known, however, about the conditions under which dissipation can generate long-range CMI. In this work we provide the first rigorous results in this direction. We establish that CMI in high-temperature Gibbs states subject to local dissipation decays exponentially, (i) for classical Hamiltonians subject to arbitrary local transition matrices, and (ii) for commuting local Hamiltonians subject to unital channels that obey certain mild restrictions. Conversely, we show that low-temperature hidden Markov networks can sustain long-range CMI. Our results establish the existence of finite-temperature information-theoretic phase transitions even in models that have no finite-temperature thermodynamic phase transitions. We also show several applications in quantum information and many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and private information in many-body thermal states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using concepts from quantum cryptography, we show how entanglement in many-body mixed states is reflected in standard correlation functions. Focusing on systems in thermal equilibrium with an environment, we ask whether the entanglement in the system can be used as a resource for distilling private keys -- random classical bits that are shared by spatially separated observers but hidden from an eavesdropper having access to the environment. Since private keys cannot be generated using separable states, we can infer the presence of entanglement from the success of such protocols. We derive a simple relation between the information accessible to the eavesdropper and the linear response of the system. This relation allows us to determine which spatial correlations can be used to detect entanglement across wide varieties of physical systems, and provides a new experimental probe of entanglement. We also show that strong symmetries of a density matrix imply the existence of correlations that are always hidden from the environment. This result implies that, although grand canonical ensembles are separable above a finite temperature, canonical ensembles are generically entangled at all finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Replica Symmetry Breaking under the Nishimori conditions in epidemic inference on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Bayesian inference, computing the posterior distribution from the data is typically a non-trivial problem, which usually requires approximations such as mean-field approaches or numerical methods, like the Monte Carlo Markov Chain. Being a high-dimensional distribution over a set of correlated variables, the posterior distribution can undergo the notorious replica symmetry breaking transition. When it happens, several mean-field methods and virtually every Monte Carlo scheme can not provide a reasonable approximation to the posterior and its marginals. Replica symmetry is believed to be guaranteed whenever the data is generated with known prior and likelihood distributions, namely under the so-called Nishimori conditions. In this paper, we break this belief, by providing a counter-example showing that, under the Nishimori conditions, replica symmetry breaking arises. Introducing a simple, geometrical model that can be thought of as a patient zero retrieval problem in a highly infectious regime of the epidemic Susceptible-Infectious model, we show that under the Nishimori conditions, there is evidence of replica symmetry breaking. We achieve this result by computing the instability of the replica symmetric cavity method toward the one step replica symmetry broken phase. The origin of this phenomenon -- replica symmetry breaking under the Nishimori conditions -- is likely due to the correlated disorder appearing in the epidemic models.</description>

      <title>Breaking the bonds of generative artificial intelligence by minimizing the maximum entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), comprising large language models, text-to-image generators, and AI algorithms for medical drug and material design, had a transformative impact on society. However, despite an initial exponential growth surpassing Moore's law, progress is now plateauing, suggesting we are approaching the limits of current technology. Indeed, these models are notoriously data-hungry, prone to overfitting, and challenging to direct during the generative process, hampering their effective professional employment. To cope with these limitations, we propose a paradigm shift in GenAI by introducing an ab initio method based on the minimal maximum entropy principle. Our approach does not fit the data. Instead, it compresses information in the training set by finding a latent representation parameterized by arbitrary nonlinear functions, such as neural networks. The result is a general physics-driven model, which is data-efficient, resistant to overfitting, and flexible, permitting to control and influence the generative process. Benchmarking shows that our method outperforms variational autoencoders (VAEs) with similar neural architectures, particularly on undersampled datasets. We demonstrate the methods effectiveness in generating images, even with limited training data, and its unprecedented capability to customize the generation process a posteriori without the need of any fine-tuning or retraining.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Critical Dynamics in Measurement-induced Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) describes the nonanalytical change of the entanglement entropy resulting from the interplay between measurement and unitary evolution. In this paper, we investigate the relaxation critical dynamics near the MIPT for different initial states in a one-dimensional quantum circuit. Specifically, when the initial state is in the volume-law phase with vanishing measurement probability, we find that the half-chain entanglement entropy $S$ decays as $S\propto t^{-1}$ with the coefficients proportional to the size of the system in the short-time stage; In contrast, when the initial state is the product state, $S$ increases with time as $S\propto \ln{t}$, consistent with previous studies. Despite these contrasting behaviors, we develop a unified scaling form to describe these scaling behaviors for different initial states where the off-critical-point effects can also be incorporated. This framework offers significant advantages for experimental MIPT detection. Our novel scheme, leveraging relaxation dynamical scaling, drastically reduces post-selection overhead, and can eliminate it completely with trackable classical simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate normal diffusion in a two-dimensional athermal suspension of active particles undergoing motility-induced phase separation. The particles are modeled as achiral Janus disks with fixed self-propulsion speed and weakly fluctuating orientation. When plotted versus the overall suspension packing fraction, the relevant diffusion constant traces a hysteresis loop with sharp jumps in correspondence with the binodal and spinodal of the gaseous phase. No hysteresis loop is observed between the spinodal and binodal of the dense phase, as they appear to overlap. Moreover, even under steady-state phase separation, the particle displacement distributions exhibit non-Gaussian normal diffusion with transient fat (thin) tails in the presence (absence) of phase separation.</description>

      <title>Emergence of ecological structure and species rarity from fluctuating metabolic strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ecosystems often demonstrate the coexistence of numerous species competing for limited resources, with pronounced rarity and abundance patterns. A potential driver of such coexistence is environmental fluctuations that favor different species over time. However, how to include and treat such temporal variability in existing consumer-resource models is still an open problem. In this study, we examine the role of correlated temporal fluctuations in metabolic strategies within a stochastic consumer-resource framework, reflecting change of species behavior in response to the environment. In some conditions, we are able to solve analytically the species abundance distributions, through path integral formalism. Our results reveal that stochastic dynamic metabolic strategies induce community structures that align more closely with empirical ecological observations and contribute to the violation of the Competitive Exclusion Principle (CEP). The degree of CEP violation is maximized under intermediate competition strength, leading to an intermediate competition hypothesis. Furthermore, when non-neutral effects are present, maximal biodiversity is achieved for intermediate values of the amplitude of fluctuations. This work not only challenges traditional ecological paradigms, but also establishes a robust theoretical framework for exploring how temporal dynamics and stochasticity drive biodiversity and community.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing chaos with projected ensembles of process tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process tensor provides a general representation of a quantum system evolving under repeated interventions and is fundamental for numerical simulations of local many-body dynamics. In this work, we introduce the projected process ensemble, an ensemble of pure output states of a process tensor in a given basis of local interventions, and use it to define increasingly more fine-grained probes of quantum chaos. The first moment of this ensemble encapsulates numerous previously studied chaos quantifiers, including the Alicki-Fannes quantum dynamical entropy, butterfly flutter fidelity, and spatiotemporal entanglement. We discover characteristic entanglement structures within the ensemble's higher moments that can sharply distinguish chaotic from integrable dynamics, overcoming deficiencies of the quantum dynamical and spatiotemporal entropies. These conclusions are supported by extensive numerical simulations of many-body dynamics for a range of spin-chain models, including non-interacting, interacting-integrable, chaotic, and many-body localized regimes. Our work elucidates the fingerprints of chaos on spatiotemporal correlations in quantum stochastic processes, and provides a unified framework for analyzing the complexity of unitary and monitored many-body dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a planted vertex cover problem on regular random graphs and study it by the cavity method of statistical mechanics. Different from conventional Ising models, the equilibrium ferromagnetic phase transition of this binary-spin two-body interaction system is discontinuous, as the paramagnetic phase is separated from the ferromagnetic phase by an extensive free energy barrier. The free energy landscape can be distinguished into three different types depending on the two degree parameters of the planted graph. The critical inverse temperatures at which the paramagnetic phase becomes locally unstable towards the ferromagnetic phase ($\beta_{\textrm{pf}}$) and towards spin glass phases ($\beta_{\textrm{pg}}$) satisfy $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} &gt; \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$, $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} &lt; \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$ and $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} = \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$, respectively, in these three landscapes. A locally stable anti-ferromagnetic phase emerges in the free energy landscape if $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} &lt; \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$. When exploring the free energy landscape by stochastic local search dynamics, we find that in agreement with our theoretical prediction, the first-passage time from the paramagnetic phase to the ferromagnetic phase is nonmonotonic with the inverse temperature. The potential relevance of the planted vertex cover model to supercooled glass-forming liquids is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Residual entropy from temperature incremental Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Residual entropy, which reflects the degrees of freedom in a system at absolute zero temperature, is crucial for understanding quantum and classical ground states. Despite its key role in explaining low-temperature phenomena and ground state degeneracy, accurately measuring residual entropy remains a difficult task owing to computational limitations. In this Letter, we introduce the temperature incremental Monte Carlo (TIMC) method, our approach to overcoming these challenges. The TIMC method incrementally calculates the partition function ratio of neighboring temperatures within Monte Carlo simulations, enabling precise entropy calculations and revealing other temperature-dependent properties in a single computational sweep of temperatures. We have rogorously tested TIMC on several complex systems, including the frustrated antiferromagnetic Ising model on both C60 and 2D triangular lattices, the Newman-Moore glassy model, and a 2D quantum transverse field Ising model. Notably, our method overcomes the difficulties encountered in partition function measurements when mapping $d$-dimensional quantum models to $d+1$-dimensional classical counterparts. These challenges arise from singular interactions that emerge in the small $\Delta_\tau$ limit during the quantum-to-classical mapping procedure. The TIMC method enables precise entropy calculations across the entire temperature range, as demonstrated in our studies of frustrated spin models, glassy phases, and phases exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking. This method's capability to calculate residual entropy could provide insights when applied to systems lacking analytical solutions.</description>

      <title>Cattaneo--type subdiffusion equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ordinary subdiffusion equation, with fractional time derivatives of at most first order, describes a process in which the propagation velocity of diffusing molecules is unlimited. To avoid this non-physical property the Cattaneo diffusion equation has been proposed. Compared to the ordinary subdiffusion equation, the Cattaneo equation contains an additional time derivative of order greater than one and less than or equal to two. The fractional order of the additional derivative depends on the subdiffusion exponent. We study a Cattaneo-type subdiffusion equation (CTSE) that differs from the ordinary subdiffusion equation by an additional integro--differential operator (AO) which may be independent of subdiffusion parameters. The AO describes processes affecting ordinary subdiffusion. The equation is derived combining the modified diffusive flux equation with the continuity equation. It can also be obtained within the continuous time random walk model with the waiting time distribution for the molecule to jump controlled by the kernel of AO. We discuss whether the ordinary subdiffusion equation and CTSE provide qualitative differences in the description of subdiffusion. For example, we consider two types of CTSE: the CTSE with AO which is the Caputo fractional time derivative of the order independent of the subdiffusion exponent and with the AO with a kernel that is a slowly varying function. In the first case the effect generated by AO disappears relatively quickly over time. In the second one the effect may be visible for a long time.</description>

      <title>Effective Affinity for Generic Currents in Markov Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08926v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In nonequilibrium systems with uncoupled currents, the thermodynamic affinity determines the direction of currents, quantifies dissipation, and constrains current fluctuations. However, these properties of the thermodynamic affinity do not hold in complex systems with multiple coupled currents. For this reason, there has been an ongoing search in nonequilibrium thermodynamics for an affinity-like quantity, known as the effective affinity, which applies to a single current in a system with multiple coupled currents. Here, we introduce an effective affinity that applies to generic currents in time-homogeneous Markov processes. We show that the effective affinity is a single number encapsulating several dissipative and fluctuation properties of fluctuating currents: the effective affinity determines the direction of flow of the current; the effective affinity multiplied by the current is a lower bound for the rate of dissipation; for systems with uncoupled currents the effective affinity equals the standard thermodynamic affinity; and the effective affinity constrains negative fluctuations of currents, namely, it is the exponential decay constant of the distribution of current infima. We derive the above properties with large deviation theory and martingale theory, and one particular interesting finding is a class of martingales associated with generic currents. Furthermore, we make a study of the relation between effective affinities and stalling forces in a biomechanical model of motor proteins, and we find that both quantities are approximately equal when this particular model is thermodynamically consistent. This brings interesting perspectives on the use of stalling forces for the estimation of dissipation.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of degenerate stationary states in a boundary-driven dipole-conserving spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetically constrained spin chains serve as a prototype for structured ergodicity breaking in isolated quantum systems. We show that such a system exhibits a hierarchy of degenerate steady states when driven by incoherent pump and loss at the boundary. By tuning the relative pump and loss and how local the constraints are, one can stabilize mixed steady states, noiseless subsystems, and various decoherence-free subspaces, all of which preserve large amounts of information. We also find that a dipole-conserving bulk suppresses current in steady state. These exact results based on the flow in Hilbert space hold regardless of the specific Hamiltonian or drive mechanism. Our findings show that a competition of kinetic constraints and local drives can induce different forms of ergodicity breaking in open systems, which should be accessible in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic entropic uncertainty relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations reveal a fundamental trade-off between the precision of a trajectory observable and entropy production, where the uncertainty in the observable is quantified by its variance. In the context of information theory, uncertainty is often evaluated in terms of Shannon entropy, but it remains unclear whether there is a quantitative relation between Shannon entropy of the observable and entropy production in stochastic thermodynamics. In this Letter, we show that an uncertainty relation can be formulated with observable Shannon entropy and entropy production. We introduce symmetry entropy, an entropy measure that quantifies the symmetry of the observable distribution, and demonstrate that a greater asymmetry in the observable distribution demands higher entropy production. Specifically, we establish that the combined total of the entropy production and the symmetry entropy cannot be less than $\ln 2$. As a corollary, we also prove that the sum of the entropy production and the Shannon entropy of the observable is no less than $\ln 2$. This Letter elucidates the role of Shannon entropy of observables within stochastic thermodynamics, thereby establishing a foundation for deriving uncertainty relations.</description>

      <title>Acceleration as a circular motion along an imaginary circle: Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition for accelerating field theories in imaginary-time formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the imaginary-time formalism for field theories in thermal equilibrium in uniformly accelerating frames. We show that under a Wick rotation of Minkowski spacetime, the Rindler event horizon shrinks to a point in a two-dimensional subspace tangential to the acceleration direction and the imaginary time. We demonstrate that the accelerated version of the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition implies an identification of all spacetime points related by integer-multiple rotations in the tangential subspace about this Euclidean Rindler event-horizon point, with the rotational quanta defined by the thermal acceleration, $\alpha = a/T$. In the Wick-rotated Rindler hyperbolic coordinates, the KMS relations reduce to standard (anti-)periodic boundary conditions in terms of the imaginary proper time (rapidity) coordinate. Our findings pave the way to study, using first-principle lattice simulations, the Hawking-Unruh radiation in geometries with event horizons, phase transitions in accelerating Early Universe and early stages of quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: We frame Newton's Law of Cooling as a gradient flow within the context of information geometry. This connects it to a thermodynamic uncertainty relation and the Horse-Carrot Theorem, and reveals novel instances of asymmetric relaxations in endoreversible processes. We present a general criterion for predicting asymmetries using the Amari-Chentsov tensor, applicable to classical and quantum thermodynamics. Examples include faster cooling of quantum ideal gases and relaxations that resemble the Mpemba effect in classical ideal gases.</description>

      <title>Freezing, melting and the onset of glassiness in binary mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We clarify the relationship between freezing, melting, and the onset of glassy dynamics in a prototypical glass-forming mixture model. Our starting point is a precise operational definition of the onset of glassiness, as expressed by the emergence of inflections in time-dependent correlation functions. By scanning the temperature-composition phase diagram of the mixture, we find a disconnect between the onset of glassiness and freezing. Surprisingly, however, the onset temperature closely tracks the melting line, along which the excess entropy is approximately constant. At fixed composition, all characteristic temperatures display nonetheless similar pressure dependencies, which are very well predicted by the isomorph theory. While our results rule out a general connection between thermodynamic metastability and glassiness, they call for a reassessment of the role of crystalline precursors in glass-forming liquids.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cooperation with Q-learning: the impact of information perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inherent complexity of human beings manifests in a remarkable diversity of responses to intricate environments, enabling us to approach problems from varied perspectives. However, in the study of cooperation, existing research within the reinforcement learning framework often assumes that individuals have access to identical information when making decisions, which contrasts with the reality that individuals frequently perceive information differently. In this study, we employ the Q-learning algorithm to explore the impact of information perception on the evolution of cooperation in a two-person Prisoner's Dilemma game. We demonstrate that the evolutionary processes differ significantly across three distinct information perception scenarios, highlighting the critical role of information structure in the emergence of cooperation. Notably, the asymmetric information scenario reveals a complex dynamical process, including the emergence, breakdown, and reconstruction of cooperation, mirroring psychological shifts observed in human behavior. Our findings underscore the importance of information structure in fostering cooperation, offering new insights into the establishment of stable cooperative relationships among humans.</description>

      <title>Ocneanu Algebra of Seams: Critical Unitary $E_6$ RSOS Lattice Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the $A$ series and exceptional $E_6$ Restricted Solid-On-Solid lattice models as prototypical examples of the critical Yang-Baxter integrable two-dimensional $A$-$D$-$E$ lattice models. We focus on type I theories which are characterized by the existence of an extended chiral symmetry in the continuum scaling limit. Starting with the commuting family of column transfer matrices on the torus, we build matrix representations of the Ocneanu graph fusion algebra as integrable seams for arbitrary finite-size lattices with the structure constants specified by Petkova and Zuber. This commutative seam algebra contains the Verlinde, fused adjacency and graph fusion algebras as subalgebras. Our matrix representation of the Ocneanu algebra encapsulates the quantum symmetry of the commuting family of transfer matrices. In the continuum scaling limit, the integrable seams realize the topological defects of the associated conformal field theory and the known toric matrices encode the twisted conformal partition functions.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric tensor determines the i.i.d. conversion rate in the resource theory of asymmetry for any compact Lie group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most significant foundational principles underlying nature. The resource theory of asymmetry (RTA) is a resource-theoretic framework for investigating asymmetry as a resource to break constraints imposed by symmetries. It has recently undergone significant developments, resulting in applications in a variety of research areas since symmetry and its breaking are ubiquitous in physics. Nevertheless, the resource conversion theory at the core of RTA remains incomplete. In the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) setup, where identical copies of a state are converted to identical copies of another state, conversion theory among pure states has been completed only for $U(1)$ group and finite groups. Here, we establish an i.i.d. conversion theory among any pure states in RTA for any continuous symmetry described by a compact Lie group, which includes the cases where multiple conserved quantities are involved. We show that the quantum geometric tensor is an asymmetry monotone for pure states that determines the optimal approximate asymptotic conversion rate. Our formulation achieves a unified understanding of conversion rates in prior studies for different symmetries. As a corollary of the formula, we also affirmatively prove the Marvian-Spekkens conjecture on reversible asymptotic convertibility in RTA, which has remained unproven for a decade.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the physics of 2 and 3 mutually intersecting conformal defects forming wedges and corners in general dimension. For 2 defects we derive the beta function of the edge interactions for infinite and semi-infinite wedges and study them in the tricritical model in $d=3-\epsilon$ as an example. We discuss the dependency of the edge anomalous dimension on the intersection angle, connecting to an old issue known in the literature. Additionally, we study trihedral corners formed by 3 planes and compute the corner anomalous dimension, which can be considered as a higher-dimensional analog of the cusp anomalous dimension. We also study 3-line corners related to the three-body potential of point-like impurities.</description>
