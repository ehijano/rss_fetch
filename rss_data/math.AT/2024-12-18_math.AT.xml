      <title>An algebraic model for rational excisive functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of the rational splitting of excisive endofunctors of spectra as a product of their homogeneous layers independent of rational Tate vanishing. We utilise the analogy between endofunctors of spectra and equivariant stable homotopy theory and as a consequence, we obtain an algebraic model for rational excisive functors.</description>

      <title>Equivariant and Invariant Parametrized Topological Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a $G$-equivariant fibration $p \colon E\to B$, we introduce and study the invariant analogue of Cohen, Farber and Weinberger's parametrized topological complexity, called the invariant parametrized topological complexity. This notion generalizes the invariant topological complexity introduced by Labawski and Marzantowicz's. We establish the fibrewise homotopy invariance of this notion and derive several bounds, including a cohomological lower bound and a dimensional upper bound. Additionally, we compare invariant parametrized topological complexity with other well-known invariants. When $G$ acts freely on both $E$ and $B$, we show that the invariant parametrized topological complexity of the $G$-fibration $p \colon E\to B$ coincides with the parametrized topological complexity of the orbit fibration $\bar{p} \colon \bar{E} \to \bar{B}$. Finally, we provide sharp estimates for the invariant parametrized topological complexity of equivariant Fadell-Neuwirth fibrations.
  Apart from this, we establish a cohomological lower bound and an equivariant dimension-connectivity upper bound for the equivariant sectional category and explore several of its properties. Additionally, we prove that the equivariant parametrized topological complexity of a $G$-fibration $p\colon E\to B$ coincides with the equivariant $\Delta(E)$-LS category of the fibre product $E\times_B E$ and establish several product inequalities.</description>

      <title>Presentations of the braid group of the complex reflection group $G(d,d,n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the braid group associated to the complex reflection group $G(d,d,n)$ is an index $d$ subgroup of the braid group of the orbifold quotient of the complex numbers by a cyclic group of order $d$. We also give a compatible presentation of $G(d,d,n)$ and its braid group for each tagged triangulation of the disk with $n$ marked points on its boundary and an interior marked point (interpreted as a cone point of degree $d$) in such a way that the presentations of Brou\'{e}-Malle-Rouquier correspond to a special tagged triangulation.</description>

      <title>Steenrod operations via higher Bruhat orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16481v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish a correspondence between the higher Bruhat orders of Yu. I. Manin and V. Schechtman, and the cup-$i$ coproducts defining Steenrod squares in cohomology. To any element of the higher Bruhat orders we associate a coproduct, recovering Steenrod's original ones from extremal elements in these orders. Defining this correspondence involves interpreting the coproducts geometrically in terms of zonotopal tilings, which allows us to give conceptual proofs of their properties and show that all reasonable coproducts arise from our construction.</description>

      <title>Knapsacks, Max-Flow and Circular Mapper Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the challenge of analyzing data sets with periodic boundary conditions to investigate transportation properties, we introduce a concept of circular max-flow for graphs mapped onto the circle. Unlike classical max-flow formulations, circular max-flow does not require the specification of a source and a target. Instead, it is defined by considering the flow through the slices of graph obtained via the fibers of its associated map onto the circle. Circular max-flow can be formulated as a minimum-cost circulation problem, allowing for an Integer Flow Theorem to be derived directly from classical results concerning negative cost cycles. While we hypothesize that all minimum-cost circulation problems with integer costs can be reformulated as circular flow problems, this broader equivalence is left for future exploration. In the core section of this work, we investigate the relationship between circular max-flow and the flow obtained by stacking infinite copies of the considered graph. We establish an equivalence between these two flows, which also provides an alternative proof of the Integer Flow Theorem. Additionally, we demonstrate connections between circular max-flow and a specific family of multidimensional knapsack problems. This connection shows that for this class of knapsack problems, solving the relaxed version is sufficient, avoiding the need for integer optimization. Finally, we test our definitions in some simulated scenarios related to the initial data analysis problem, extending a pipeline appeared previous works in materials science.</description>

      <title>On the hit problem for the polynomial algebra and the algebraic transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates Singer's conjecture by examining the cohit module $\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathcal A}P^{\otimes h}$ for specific degrees and values of $h$. Utilizing hit problem techniques, we extend previous work by Mothebe et al. and establish key dimensional results. Notably, for $h\geq 6$, we prove that the cohit module's dimension in certain degrees matches the order of a specific factor group. Our contributions include demonstrating that certain non-zero elements do not belong to the image of the Singer algebraic transfer.</description>

      <title>Lefschetz duality for local cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the 1974 paper by Peskine and Szpiro, liaison theory via complete intersections, and more generally via Gorenstein varieties, has become a standard tool kit in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, allowing to compare algebraic features of linked varieties. In this paper we develop a liaison theory via quasi-Gorenstein varieties, a much broader class than Gorenstein varieties: it is not misleading to think that quasi-Gorenstein rings are to Gorenstein rings as manifolds are to spheres. As applications, we derive a connectedness property of quasi-Gorenstein subspace arrangements generalizing previous results by Benedetti and the second author, and we deduce the classical topological Lefschetz duality via the Stanley-Reisner correspondence.</description>

      <title>$G$-Mapper: Learning a Cover in the Mapper Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mapper algorithm is a visualization technique in topological data analysis (TDA) that outputs a graph reflecting the structure of a given dataset. However, the Mapper algorithm requires tuning several parameters in order to generate a ``nice" Mapper graph. This paper focuses on selecting the cover parameter. We present an algorithm that optimizes the cover of a Mapper graph by splitting a cover repeatedly according to a statistical test for normality. Our algorithm is based on $G$-means clustering which searches for the optimal number of clusters in $k$-means by iteratively applying the Anderson-Darling test. Our splitting procedure employs a Gaussian mixture model to carefully choose the cover according to the distribution of the given data. Experiments for synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm generates covers so that the Mapper graphs retain the essence of the datasets, while also running significantly fast.</description>
