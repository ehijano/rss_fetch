      <title>Discrete $Z_4$ symmetry in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00718v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the discrete $Z_4$ symmetry ${\hat {\bf i}}$, which takes place in the scenario of quantum gravity where the gravitational tetrads emerge as the order parameter. Under this symmetry operation $\hat {\bf i}$, the emerging tetrads are multiplied by the imaginary unit, $\hat {\bf i}\,e^a_\mu = - i e^a_\mu$. The existence of such symmetry and the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry are also supported by the consideration of the symmetry breaking scheme in the topological superfluid $^3$He-B. The order parameter $^3$He-B is the analogue of the tetrad field, but it has complex values. The $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry operation changes the phase of the complex order parameter by $\pi/2$, which corresponds to the $Z_4$ discrete symmetry in quantum gravity. We also considered the alternative scenario of the breaking of this $Z_4$ symmetry, in which the $\hat {\bf i}$-operation changes sign of the scalar curvature, $\hat {\bf i} \,{\cal R} = - {\cal R}$, and thus the Einstein-Hilbert action violates the $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry. In the alternative scenario of symmetry breaking, the gravitational coupling $K=1/16\pi G$ plays the role of the order parameter, which changes sign under $\hat {\bf i}$-transformation.</description>

      <title>Atomistic simulations of out-of-equilibrium quantum nuclear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in ultrafast laser technology have paved the way for pumping and probing the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of nuclei in crystals. However, interpreting these experiments is extremely challenging due to the complex nonlinear responses in systems where lattice excitations interact, particularly in crystals composed of light atoms or at low temperatures where the quantum nature of ions becomes significant. In this work, we address the nonequilibrium quantum ionic dynamics from first principles. Our approach is general and can be applied to simulate any crystal, in combination with a first-principles treatment of electrons or external machine-learning potentials. It is implemented by leveraging the nonequilibrium time-dependent self-consistent harmonic approximation (TD-SCHA), with a stable, energy-conserving, correlated stochastic integration scheme that achieves an accuracy of $\mathcal{O}(dt^3)$. We benchmark the method with both a simple one-dimensional model to test its accuracy and a realistic 40-atom cell of SrTiO3 under THz laser pump, paving the way for simulations of ultrafast THz-Xray pump-probe spectroscopy like those performed in synchrotron facilities.</description>

      <title>GdAlSi: An antiferromagnetic topological Weyl semimetal with non-relativistic spin splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spintronics has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional electronics based technologies in the past few decades. While on one hand, the discovery of topological phases of matter with protected spin-polarized states has opened up exciting prospects, recent revelation of intriguing non-relativistic spin splitting in collinear antiferromagnetic materials with unique symmetries facilitate a wide possibility of realizing both these features simultaneously. In this work, we report the co-existence of these two intriguing properties within a single material: GdAlSi. It crystallizes in a body-centered tetragonal structure with a non-centrosymmetric space group $I4_{1}md$ ($109$), which is confirmed using detailed structural analysis through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and optical second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements. The magnetization data indicates AFM ordering with an ordering temperature ($T_N$) $\sim$ 32 K. Ab-initio calculations reveal GdAlSi to be a collinear antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal with an unconventional, momentum-dependent spin splitting, also referred to as altermagnet. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on GdAlSi single crystals subsequently confirm the presence of Fermi arcs, a distinctive hallmark of Weyl semimetals. Electric and magnetic multipole analysis provides a deeper understanding of the symmetry-mediated, momentum-dependent spin splitting, which has strictly non-relativistic origin. To the best of our knowledge, such co-existence of unconventional antiferromagnetic order and non-trivial topology is unprecedented and has never been observed before in a single material, rendering GdAlSi a special and promising candidate material. We propose a device harnessing these features, poised to enable practical and efficient topotronic applications.</description>
