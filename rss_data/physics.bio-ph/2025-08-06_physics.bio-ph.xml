      <title>High-performance neuromorphic computing architecture of brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence can outperform humans in specific tasks but consumes substantial energy. How the human brain can work at just 20 watts with complex cognitive intelligence? Here we decode the fundamental information strategy unit of brain, neural sphere, which agglomerates neurons into sphere to achieve energy-efficient and exhibits many ultra-long period or random electrophysiological activities. Chaos dynamics and fractal theory demonstrated the mathematical principle of neural spheres to memorize and process through different electrophysiological activities which depend on strange attractors. A high-performance neuromorphic computing architecture of brain was then constructed which predicts a storage capacity of $7.48\times 10^{18}$ Bytes and a computational power of $6.24\times 10^{18}$ FLOPS for human brain. At this capacity, the energy efficiency of the human brain after long-term evolution can be up to 79% via Landauer's principle, 8-order higher than that of the latest computer chips, supporting the rationality of the proposed architecture.</description>

      <title>Delay-facilitated self-assembly in compartmentalized systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-assembly processes in biological and synthetic biomolecular systems are often governed by the spatial separation of biochemical processes. While previous work has focused on optimizing self-assembly through fine-tuned reaction parameters or using phase-separated liquid compartments with fast particle exchange, the role of slow inter-compartmental exchange remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that slow particle exchange between reaction domains can enhance self-assembly efficiency through a cooperative mechanism: delay-facilitated assembly. Using a minimal model of irreversible self-assembly in two compartments with distinct reaction and exchange dynamics, we identify scenarios that maximize yield and minimize assembly time, even under conditions where isolated compartments would fail to facilitate any self-assembly. The mechanism relies on a separation of timescales between intra-compartmental reactions and inter-compartmental exchange and is robust across a wide range of geometries, including spatially extended domains with diffusive transport. We demonstrate that this effect enables geometric control of self-assembly processes through compartment volumes and exchange rates, eliminating the need for fine-tuning local reaction rates. These results offer a conceptual framework for leveraging spatial separation in synthetic self-assembly design and suggest that biological systems may use slow particle exchange to improve assembly efficiency.</description>

      <title>Observation of Rayleigh optical activity for chiral molecules: a new chiroptical tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By measuring a small circularly polarized component in the scattered light, we report the first observation of Rayleigh optical activity (RayOA) for typical chiral molecules, namely the two enantiomers of $\alpha$-pinene. Our work validates fundamental theoretical predictions made over fifty years ago and expands the chiroptical toolkit.</description>

      <title>The generic temperature response of large biochemical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological systems are remarkably susceptible to relatively small temperature changes. The most obvious example is fever, when a modest rise in body temperature of only few Kelvin has strong effects on our immune system and how it fights pathogens. Another very important example is climate change, when even smaller temperature changes lead to dramatic shifts in ecosystems. Although it is generally accepted that the main effect of an increase in temperature is the acceleration of biochemical reactions according to the Arrhenius equation, it is not clear how it affects large biochemical networks with complicated architectures. For developmental systems like fly and frog, it has been shown that the system response to temperature deviates in a characteristic manner from the linear Arrhenius plot of single reactions, but a rigorous explanation has not been given yet. Here we use a graph-theoretical interpretation of the mean first-passage times of a biochemical master equation to give a statistical description. We find that in the limit of large system size and if the network has a bias towards a target state, then the Arrhenius plot is generically quadratic, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations for large networks as well as with experimental data for developmental times in fly and frog. We also discuss under which conditions this generic response can be violated, for example for linear chains, which have only one spanning tree.</description>

      <title>Exogeneous PpIX model for brain tumour assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable in-vitro models are used for optoelectronic device development such as fluorescence detection devices for fluorescence-guided surgery of gliomas. A common approach is based on inducing gliomas in animal models. This is followed by a dosage of 5-ALA to induce Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the glioma and which fluoresces. Although these approaches excel in capturing key biomolecular and physiological features of the tumour, they are inherently indeterministic. This limits the scope of their use for preclinical device development, where consistent and controllable tumour reproduction across multiple animals is needed. Approaches using fluorescence markers in gelatine provide a simple replication but fail to capture the complexities of in-vivo models. In this study, we introduce an exogenous brain tumour model for assessing PpIX fluorescence detection. The model was developed by injecting a PpIX solution into the cortical region of a resected adult rat brain, the injection site simulated a tumoral region with elevated PpIX concentration. The tumoral region had a gradient of concentrations, with a peak at the centre and a decrease towards the margins, akin to in-vivo gliomas. The fluorescence profile was compared to in-vivo conditions using 5-ALA and correlated well with other reported works, achieving a correlation of R2&gt;0.93. The model's validity was tested by examining the effect of the solvent, DMSO, on the Autofluorescence (AF) of the brain sample and the short-term effect of storage on AF was analysed. Examinations confirmed the solvent did not alter AF, and the brain sample should be stored in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution and refrigerated to maintain moisture and preserve AF. The model accurately replicated surgical fluorescence conditions and offers a suitable alternative to glioma induction, benefiting the development of fluorescence detection devices across design iterations.</description>

      <title>Spin-Waves without Spin-Waves: A Case for Soliton Propagation in Starling Flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective turns in starling flocks propagate linearly with negligible attenuation, indicating the existence of an underdamped sector in the dispersion relation. Beside granting linear propagation of the phase perturbations, the real part of the frequency should also yield a spin-wave form of the unperturbed correlation function. However, new high-resolution experiments on real flocks show that underdamped traveling waves coexist with an overdamped Lorentzian correlation. Theory and experiments are reconciled once we add to the dynamics a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou term.</description>
