      <title>Real structures. An introduction to a general approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we attempt to present a very general approach to the study of structures (somehow) defined on a set $X$ by a family of maps $d: X \times X \mapsto \mathbb{R}^+$. It will be shown how the assignment of a preorder $\prec_{\Pi}$ on a set $\Pi$ of families of maps from $X \times X$ into $\mathbb{R}^+$ defines a structure on $X$. The structures obtained in this way will be called \emph{real structures}. For real structures on two different sets we study when they are \emph{of the same type}. An answer to this question will allow to introduce the notion of \emph{morphism}, and then to give the definition of the initial real structure with respect to a family of maps, and so also the definition of product real structure. Various examples of preorders, and hence of real structures, will be exhibited and discussed. A few examples of morphisms will be proposed.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Ramanujan Famous Nested Radicals to the nth Root and their Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Srinivasa Ramanujan posed a problem on infinite nested radical of the square root in the Journal of Indian Mathematical Society in 1911. He had generated the problem years before in the form of an example illustrating a more general theorem. Of course, how we would figure the solution out without Ramanujan theorem was scarcely obvious. Generation of infinite nested radicals, the roots being of higher order i.e. proceeding from the cube roots to the nth root as well as their evaluation may seem to be somewhat complex. For this purpose a general solution in the form of a theorem needs to be provided whereby symmetric patterns of infinite nested radicals of any order of roots may be evaluated including that of Ramanujan involving square root. In our work, we have rendered the required solution.</description>

      <title>A Table of Generating Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04434v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a compendium of generating functions involving single, double sums and definite integrals. These generating functions also involve special functions in both the summand function and closed form solution.</description>
