      <title>Some study of the approximate orthogonality connected with integral orthogonalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a novel form of approximate orthogonality that is based on integral orthogonality. Additionally, we establish the fundamental properties of this new approximate orthogonality and examine its capability to preserve mappings of orthogonality. Moreover, we explore the relationship between this new approximate orthogonality and other forms of approximate orthogonality.</description>

      <title>A necessary condition for the boundedness of the maximal operator on $L^{p(\cdot)}$ over reverse doubling spaces of homogeneous type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,d,\mu)$ be a space of homogeneous type and $p(\cdot):X\to[1,\infty]$ be a variable exponent. We show that if the measure $\mu$ is Borel-semiregular and reverse doubling, then the condition ${\rm ess\,inf}_{x\in X}p(x)&gt;1$ is necessary for the boundedness of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator $M$ on the variable Lebesgue space $L^{p(\cdot)}(X,d,\mu)$.</description>

      <title>On the continuity of intertwining operators over generalized convolution algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\sf G}$ be a locally compact group, $\mathscr C\overset{q}{\to}{\sf G}$ a Fell bundle and $\mathfrak B=L^1({\sf G}\,\vert\,\mathscr C)$ the algebra of integrable cross-sections associated to the bundle. We give conditions that guarantee the automatic continuity of intertwining operators $\theta:\mathcal X_1\to\mathcal X_2$, where $\mathcal X_1$ is a Banach $\mathfrak B$-bimodule and $\mathcal X_2$ is a weak Banach $\mathfrak B$-bimodule, in terms of the continuity ideal of $\theta$. We provide examples of algebras where this conditions are met, both in the case of derivations and algebra morphisms. In particular, we show that, if ${\sf G}$ is infinite, finitely-generated, has polynomial growth and $\alpha$ is a topologically free (partial) action of ${\sf G}$ on the compact space $X$, then every homomorphism of $\ell^1_\alpha({\sf G},C(X))$ into a Banach algebra is automatically continuous.</description>

Abstract: Let $f = f(z,t)$ be a function holomorphic in $z \in O \subseteq {\mathbb C}^d$ for fixed $t\in \Omega$ and measurable in $t$ for fixed $z$ and such that$z \mapsto f(z,\cdot)$ is bounded with values in$E := L_{p}(\Omega)$, $1\le p \le \infty$. It is proved (among other things) that \[ \langle t\mapsto \varphi( f(\cdot,t) ), \mu \rangle= \varphi(z \mapsto \langle f(z, \cdot) , \mu\rangle )\] whenever $\mu \in E'$ and $\varphi$ is a linear functional on $H^\infty(O)$ that is sequentially continuous with respect to bounded pointwise convergence in $H^\infty(O)$.</description>

      <title>Schatten Properties of Calder\'{o}n--Zygmund Singular Integral Commutator on stratified Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide full characterisation of the Schatten properties of $[M_b,T]$, the commutator of Calder\'{o}n--Zygmund singular integral $T$ with symbol $b$ $(M_bf(x):=b(x)f(x))$ on stratified Lie groups $\mathbb{G}$. We show that, when $p$ is larger than the homogeneous dimension $\mathbb{Q}$ of $\mathbb{G}$, the Schatten $\mathcal{L}_p$ norm of the commutator is equivalent to the Besov semi-norm $B_{p}^{\frac{\mathbb{Q}}{p}}$ of the function $b$; but when $p\leq \mathbb{Q}$, the commutator belongs to $\mathcal{L}_p$ if and only if $b$ is a constant. For the endpoint case at the critical index $p=\mathbb{Q}$, we further show that the Schatten $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbb{Q},\infty}$ norm of the commutator is equivalent to the Sobolev norm $W^{1,\mathbb{Q}}$ of $b$. Our method at the endpoint case differs from existing methods of Fourier transforms or trace formula for Euclidean spaces or Heisenberg groups, respectively, and hence can be applied to various settings beyond.</description>

      <title>On a complex-analytic approach to classifying stationary measures on $S^1$ with respect to the countably supported measures on $PSU(1,1)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a complex-analytic approach to the classification of positive stationary measures on $S^1$ with respect to complex finite Borel measures on $PSU(1,1)$ satisfying the finite first moment condition by studying their Poisson-like and Cauchy-like transforms from the perspective of generalized analytic continuation. This approach allows us to establish a functional-analytic criterion for singularity of a hitting measure for random walks on lattices in $PSU(1,1)$. In addition, this approach suggests alternative proofs to the several well-known related results by Furstenberg, Kaimanovich, Guivarc'h-le Jan and Bourgain, among several others.</description>

      <title>Redefining fractals by Suzuki contraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a significant effort in recent years to generalize the traditional concept of iterated function systems (IFS).In this article, we proposed Suzuki contraction in hyperspace and finding out the fixed point for Hutchinson mapping, which is called a deterministic fractal. The deterministic fractal for such a Suzuki contraction mapping is shown to exist and to be unique. We propose the Suzuki IFS (SIFS) in the literature for fractal creation based on this conclusion. Keywords: Fixed point, iterated function system, Suzuki contraction, Suzuki iterated function system, Attractor (Deterministic Fractal).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the well-posedness of transmission problems on classes of two-sided Sobolevextension domains to give variational definitions for (boundary) layer potential oper-ators and Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators. These classes of domains contain Lipschitzdomains, but also domains with fractal boundaries. Our formulation does not involveany measures on the boundary. We discuss basic properties of these operators and usethem to generalize basic results in imaging beyond the Lipschitz case.</description>

      <title>Improved eigenvalue inequalities via two major subclasses of superquadratic functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There exist two major subclasses in the class of superquadratic functions, one comprises concave and decreasing functions, while the other consists of convex and monotone increasing functions. Leveraging this distinction, we introduce eigenvalue inequalities for each case. The characteristics of these functions allow us to advance our findings in two ways: firstly, by refining existing results related to eigenvalues for convex functions, and secondly, by deriving complementary inequalities for other function types. To bolster our claims, we will provide illustrative examples.</description>

Abstract: We examine how the square-integrable function subspaces are transformed using the holomorphic Fourier transform. On account of this, the extended Paley-Wiener theorem over the Hardy-Sobolev spaces is produced. The theorem also asserts that the reproducing kernel of the Hardy-Sobolev spaces can be found. We discuss the relationship between the disc and the upper half-plane.</description>

Abstract: We generalize a fundamental theorem on positive matrix semigroups stating that each component is either strictly positive for all times or identically zero ("L\'evy's Theorem"). Our proof of this fact that does not require the matrices to be Markovian nor to be continuous at time zero. We also provide a formulation of this theorem in the terminology of one-parameter operator semigroups on sequence spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with log-majorization for matrices in connection with the multivariate Golden--Thompson trace inequality and the Karcher mean (i.e., a multivariate extension of the weighted geometric mean). We show an extension of Araki's log-majorization and apply it to the $\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergence in quantum information. We discuss the equality cases in the multivariate trace inequality of Golden--Thompson type and in the norm inequality for the Karcher mean. The paper includes an appendix to correct the proof of the author's old result on the equality case in the norm inequality for the weighted geometric mean.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ be a set of equi-contractive similitudes on $\mathbb{R}^1$ satisfying the finite-type condition. We study the asymptotic quantization error for self-similar measures $\mu$ associated with $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ and a positive probability vector. With a verifiable assumption, we prove that the upper and lower quantization coefficient for $\mu$ are both bounded away from zero and infinity. This can be regarded as an extension of Graf and Luschgy's result on self-similar measures with the open set condition. Our result is applicable to a significant class of self-similar measures with overlaps, including Erd\"{o}s measure, the $3$-fold convolution of the classical Cantor measure and the self-similar measures on some $\lambda$-Cantor sets.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a Banach algebra and $B(X)$ be the set of all bounded linear operators on $X$. Suppose that $\alpha: B(X) \rightarrow B(X)$ is an automorphism. We say that a mapping $\delta$ from $B(X)$ into itself is derivable at $G \in B(X)$ if $\delta(G) = \alpha(A)\delta(B) + \delta(A)\alpha(B)$ for all $A, B \in B(X)$ with $AB = G$. We say that an element $G \in B(X)$ is an $(\alpha,\alpha)$-all derivable point of $B(X)$ if every $(\alpha,\alpha)$-derivable mapping $\delta$ at G is an $(\alpha,\alpha)$-derivation. In this paper, we show that every $(\alpha,\alpha)$-derivable mapping at a nonzero element in $B(X)$ is an $(\alpha,\alpha)$-derivation.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimal transport for approximately finite-dimensional $C^{*}$-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:1910.03312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce quantum optimal transport of states on tracial AF-$C^{*}$-algebras to study non-spatial transport of quantum information, and view it as the pointwise case of a general parametrised one. We define quantum optimal transport distances as dynamic transport distances in a tracial but non-ergodic and infinite-dimensional quantum setting, called AF-$C^{*}$-setting. We further extend foundational results of Carlen and Maas to the AF-$C^{*}$-setting and develop a theory of quantum optimal transport yielding non-spatial lower Ricci bounds suitable for meaningful geometric analysis. Essential for our discussion is a coarse graining process arising from the underlying metric geometry as encoding scheme of the given tracial AF-$C^{*}$-algebra. In the logarithmic mean setting, we apply the coarse graining process to show equivalence of the EVI$_{\lambda}$-gradient flow property for quantum relative entropy, its strong geodesic $\lambda$-convexity, a, possibly infinite-dimensional, Bakry-\'Emery condition, and a Hessian lower bound condition. We then define lower Ricci bounds of our quantum gradients using any one of said equivalent conditions, give sufficient conditions for lower Ricci bounds of direct sum quantum gradients and, assuming lower Ricci bounds, derive functional inequalities HWI$_{\lambda}$, MLSI$_{\lambda}$ and TW$_{\lambda}$ in the AF-$C^{*}$-setting alongside their chain of implications. Fundamental example classes give quantum optimal transport of normal states on hyperfinite factors of type I and II with both non-negative and strictly positive lower Ricci bounds. An application is given by first and second quantisation of spectral triples.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control Liouville Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.02620v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper builds the theoretical foundations for dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) of control-affine dynamical systems by leveraging the theory of vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). Specifically, control Liouville operators and control occupation kernels are introduced to separate the drift dynamics from the input dynamics. A given feedback controller is represented through a multiplication operator and a composition of the control Liouville operator and the multiplication operator is used to express the nonlinear closed-loop system as a linear total derivative operator on RKHSs. A spectral decomposition of a finite-rank representation of the total derivative operator yields a DMD of the closed-loop system. The DMD generates a model that can be used to predict the trajectories of the closed-loop system. For a large class of systems, the total derivative operator is shown to be compact provided the domain and the range RKHSs are selected appropriately. The sequence of models, resulting from increasing-rank finite-rank representations of the compact total derivative operator, are shown to converge to the true system dynamics, provided sufficiently rich data are available. Numerical experiments are included to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed technique.</description>

Abstract: Every positive multilinear map between $C^*$-algebras is separately weak$^*$-continuous. We show that the joint weak$^*$-continuity is equivalent to the joint weak$^*$-continuity of the multiplications of $C^*$-algebras under consideration. We study the behavior of general tracial positive maps on properly infinite von Neumann algebras and by applying the Aron--Berner extension of multilinear maps, we establish that under some mild conditions every tracial positive multilinear map between general $C^*$-algebras enjoys a decomposition $\Phi=\varphi_2 \circ \varphi_1$, in which $\varphi_1$ is a tracial positive linear map with the commutative range and $\varphi_2$ is a tracial completely positive map with the commutative domain. As an immediate consequence, tracial positive multilinear maps are completely positive. Furthermore, we prove that if the domain of a general tracial completely positive map $\Phi$ between $C^*$-algebra is a von Neumann algebra, then $\Phi$ has a similar decomposition. As an application, we investigate the generalized variance and covariance in quantum mechanics via arbitrary positive maps. Among others, an uncertainty relation inequality for commuting observables in a composite physical system is presented.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we introduce a general approach for deriving zero-free half-planes for the Riemann zeta function $\zeta$ by identifying topological vector spaces of analytic functions with specific properties. This approach is applied to weighted $\ell^2$ spaces and classical Hardy spaces $ H^p $ ($ 0&lt;p\leq2 $). As a consequence precise conditions are obtained for the existence of zero-free half planes for the $\zeta$-function.</description>

      <title>Koopman-based generalization bound: New aspect for full-rank weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new bound for generalization of neural networks using Koopman operators. Whereas most of existing works focus on low-rank weight matrices, we focus on full-rank weight matrices. Our bound is tighter than existing norm-based bounds when the condition numbers of weight matrices are small. Especially, it is completely independent of the width of the network if the weight matrices are orthogonal. Our bound does not contradict to the existing bounds but is a complement to the existing bounds. As supported by several existing empirical results, low-rankness is not the only reason for generalization. Furthermore, our bound can be combined with the existing bounds to obtain a tighter bound. Our result sheds new light on understanding generalization of neural networks with full-rank weight matrices, and it provides a connection between operator-theoretic analysis and generalization of neural networks.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of Powers--St{\o}rmer's inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relating to finding possible upper bounds for the probability of error for discriminating between two quantum states, it is well-known that \begin{align*}
  \mathrm{tr}(A+B) - \mathrm{tr}|A-B|\leq 2\, \mathrm{tr}\big(f(A)g(B)\big) \end{align*} holds for every positive-valued matrix monotone function $f$, where $g(x)=x/f(x)$, and all positive definite matrices $A$ and $B$. This study demonstrates that the set of functions satisfying this inequality includes additional elements and provides illustrative examples to support this claim. Furthermore, we present a characterization of matrix decreasing functions based on a matrix version of the above inequality.</description>

      <title>Factoring determinants and applications to number theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Products of shifted characteristic polynomials, and ratios of such products, averaged over the classical compact groups are of great interest to number theorists as they model similar averages of L-functions in families with the same symmetry type as the compact group. We use Toeplitz and Toeplitz plus Hankel operators and the identities of Borodin - Okounkov, Case - Geronimo, and Basor - Erhardt to prove that, in certain cases, these unitary averages factor as polynomials in the matrix size into averages over the symplectic group and the orthogonal group. Building on these identities we present new proofs of the exact formulas for these averages where the ``swap'' terms that are characteristic of the number theoretic averages occur from the Fredholm expansions of the determinants of the appropriate Hankel operator. This is the fourth different proof of the formula for the averages of ratios of products of shifted characteristic polynomials; the other proofs are based on supersymmetry; symmetric function theory, and orthogonal polynomial methods from Random Matrix Theory.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric Inequalities on Slabs with applications to Cubes and Gaussian Slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study isoperimetric inequalities on "slabs", namely weighted Riemannian manifolds obtained as the product of the uniform measure on a finite length interval with a codimension-one base. As our two main applications, we consider the case when the base is the flat torus $\mathbb{R}^2 / 2 \mathbb{Z}^2$ and the standard Gaussian measure in $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$.
  The isoperimetric conjecture on the three-dimensional cube predicts that minimizers are enclosed by spheres about a corner, cylinders about an edge and coordinate planes. This has only been established for relative volumes close to $0$, $1/2$ and $1$ by compactness arguments. Our analysis confirms the isoperimetric conjecture on the three-dimensional cube with side lengths $(\beta,1,1)$ in a new range of relatives volumes $\bar v \in [0,1/2]$. In particular, we confirm the conjecture for the standard cube ($\beta=1$) for all $\bar v \leq 0.120582$, when $\beta \leq 0.919431$ for the entire range where spheres are conjectured to be minimizing, and also for all $\bar v \in [0,1/2] \setminus (\frac{1}{\pi} - \frac{\beta}{4},\frac{1}{\pi} + \frac{\beta}{4})$. When $\beta \leq 0.919431$ we reduce the validity of the full conjecture to establishing that the half-plane $\{ x \in [0,\beta] \times [0,1]^2 \; ; \; x_3 \leq \frac{1}{\pi} \}$ is an isoperimetric minimizer. We also show that the analogous conjecture on a high-dimensional cube $[0,1]^n$ is false for $n \geq 10$.
  In the case of a slab with a Gaussian base of width $T&gt;0$, we identify a phase transition when $T = \sqrt{2 \pi}$ and when $T = \pi$. In particular, while products of half-planes with $[0,T]$ are always minimizing when $T \leq \sqrt{2 \pi}$, when $T &gt; \pi$ they are never minimizing, being beaten by Gaussian unduloids. In the range $T \in (\sqrt{2 \pi},\pi]$, a potential trichotomy occurs.</description>
