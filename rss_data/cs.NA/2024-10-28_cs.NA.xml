      <title>Greedy Algorithm for Neural Networks for Indefinite Elliptic Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a priori error analysis of the shallow neural network approximation to the solution to the indefinite elliptic equation and and cutting-edge implementation of the Orthogonal Greedy Algorithm (OGA) tailored to overcome the challenges of indefinite elliptic problems, which is a domain where conventional approaches often struggle due to nontraditional difficulties due to the lack of coerciveness. A rigorous a priori error analysis that shows the neural networks ability to approximate indefinite problems is confirmed numerically by OGA methods. We also present a discretization error analysis of the relevant numerical quadrature. In particular, massive numerical implementations are conducted to justify the theory, some of which showcase the OGAs superior performance in comparison to the traditional finite element method. This advancement illustrates the potential of neural networks enhanced by OGA to solve intricate computational problems more efficiently, thereby marking a significant leap forward in the application of machine learning techniques to mathematical problem-solving.</description>

      <title>An optimization-based positivity-preserving limiter in semi-implicit discontinuous Galerkin schemes solving Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For high-order accurate schemes such as discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods solving Fokker-Planck equations, it is desired to efficiently enforce positivity without losing conservation and high-order accuracy, especially for implicit time discretizations. We consider an optimization-based positivity-preserving limiter for enforcing positivity of cell averages of DG solutions in a semi-implicit time discretization scheme, so that the point values can be easily enforced to be positive by a simple scaling limiter on the DG polynomial in each cell. The optimization can be efficiently solved by a first-order splitting method with nearly optimal parameters, which has an $\mathcal{O}(N)$ computational complexity and is flexible for parallel computation. Numerical tests are shown on some representative examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Analyticity and Stable Computation of Dirichlet-Neumann Operators for Laplace's Equation under Quasiperiodic Boundary Conditions in Two and Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirichlet-Neumann Operators (DNOs) are important to the formulation, analysis, and simulation of many crucial models found in engineering and the sciences. For instance, these operators permit moving-boundary problems, such as the classical water wave problem (free-surface ideal fluid flow under the influence of gravity and capillarity), to be restated in terms of interfacial quantities, which not only eliminates the boundary tracking problem, but also reduces the problem dimension. While these DNOs have been the object of much recent study regarding their numerical simulation and rigorous analysis, they have yet to be examined in the setting of laterally quasiperiodic boundary conditions. The purpose of this contribution is to begin this investigation with a particular eye towards the problem of more realistically simulating two and three dimensional surface water waves. Here we not only carefully define the DNO with respect to these boundary conditions for Laplace's equation, but we also show the rigorous analyticity of these operators with respect to sufficiently smooth boundary perturbations. These theoretical developments suggest a novel algorithm for the stable and high-order simulation of the DNO, which we implement and extensively test.</description>

      <title>A collocation heat polynomials method for one-dimensional inverse Stefan problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse one-phase Stefan problem in one dimension, aimed at identifying the unknown time-dependent heat flux P(t) with a known moving boundary position s(t), is investigated. A previous study [16] attempted to reconstruct the unknown heat flux P(t) using the Variational Heat Polynomials Method (VHPM). In this paper, we develop the Collocation Heat Polynomials Method (CHPM) for the reconstruction of the time-dependent heat flux P(t). This method constructs an approximate solution as a linear combination of heat polynomials, which satisfies the heat equation, with the coefficients determined using the collocation method. To address the resulting ill-posed problem, Tikhonov regularization is applied. As an application, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on benchmark problems. Numerical results show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs the time-dependent heat flux P(t), even in the presence of significant noise. The results are also compared with those obtained in [16] using the VHPM.</description>

      <title>SFEM for the Lagrangian formulation of the surface Stokes problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the surface Stokes equation with Lagrange multiplier and approach it numerically. Using a Taylor-Hood surface finite element method, along with an appropriate estimation for the additional Lagrange multiplier, we establish optimal convergence results for the velocity in $H^1$ and $L^2$, and in $L^2$ for the two pressures. Furthermore, we present a new inf-sup condition to help with the stability and convergence results. This formulation offers the advantage of simplified implementation without approximating geometric quantities, although it requires a higher approximation of the parameterized surface. In addition, we provide numerical simulations that confirm the established error bounds and perform a comparative analysis against the penalty approach.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Data Assimilation for Particle-based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to applying data assimilation techniques for particle-based simulations using the Ensemble Kalman Filter. While data assimilation methods have been effectively applied to Eulerian simulations, their application in Lagrangian solution discretizations has not been properly explored. We introduce two specific methodologies to address this gap. The first methodology employs an intermediary Eulerian transformation that combines a projection with a remeshing process. The second is a purely Lagrangian scheme designed for situations where remeshing is not appropriate. The second is a purely Lagrangian scheme that is applicable when remeshing is not adapted. These methods are evaluated using a one-dimensional advection-diffusion model with periodic boundaries. Performance benchmarks for the one-dimensional scenario are conducted against a grid-based assimilation filter Subsequently, assimilation schemes are applied to a non-linear two-dimensional incompressible flow problem, solved via the Vortex-In-Cell method. The results demonstrate the feasibility of applying these methods in more complex scenarios, highlighting their effectiveness in both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional contexts.</description>

      <title>On the computation of accurate initial conditions for linear higher-index differential-algebraic equations and its application in initial value solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to regular ordinary differential equations, the problem of accurately setting initial conditions just emerges in the context of differential-algebraic equations where the dynamic degree of freedom of the system is smaller than the absolute dimension of the described process, and the actual lower-dimensional configuration space of the system is deeply implicit. For linear higher-index differential-algebraic equations, we develop an appropriate numerical method based on properties of canonical subspaces and on the so-called geometric reduction. Taking into account the fact that higher-index differential-algebraic equations lead to ill-posed problems in naturally given norms, we modify this approach to serve as transfer conditions from one time-window to the next in a time stepping procedure and combine it with window-wise overdetermined least-squares collocation to construct the first fully numerical solvers for higher-index initial-value problems.</description>

      <title>Sylvester-Preconditioned Adaptive-Rank Implicit Time Integrators for Advection-Diffusion Equations with Inhomogeneous Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the adaptive-rank integration of general time-dependent advection-diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs) with spatially variable coefficients. We employ a standard finite-difference method for spatial discretization coupled with diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta schemes for temporal discretization. The fully discretized scheme can be written as a generalized Sylvester equation, which we solve with an adaptive-rank algorithm structured around three key strategies: (i) constructing dimension-wise subspaces based on an extended Krylov strategy, (ii) developing an effective Averaged-Coefficient Sylvester (ACS) preconditioner to invert the reduced system for the coefficient matrix efficiently, and (iii) efficiently computing the residual of the equation without explicitly reverting to the full-rank form. The proposed approach features a computational complexity of O(Nr2 + r3), where r represents the rank during the Krylov iteration and N is the resolution in one dimension, commensurate with the constant-coefficient case [El Kahza et al, J. Comput. Phys., 518 (2024)]. We present numerical examples that illustrate the computational efficacy and complexity of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>An entropy-stable and fully well-balanced scheme for the Euler equations with gravity. II: General equations of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work concerns the derivation of a fully well-balanced Godunov-type finite volume scheme for the Euler equations with a gravitational potential based on an approximate Riemann solver. It is an extension to general equations of states of the entropy-stable and fully well-balanced scheme for ideal gases recently forwarded in [Berthon et al., 2024]. When the system is equipped with a convex entropy and associated entropy inequality, it is also entropy-stable and positivity-preserving for all thermodynamic variables. An extension to high order accuracy is presented. Numerical test cases illustrate the performance of the new scheme, using six different equations of state as examples, four analytic and two tabulated ones.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Fokker-Planck Transport -- With Applications to Sampling, Variational Inference, Kernel Mean Embeddings &amp; Sequential Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fokker-Planck equation can be reformulated as a continuity equation, which naturally suggests using the associated velocity field in particle flow methods. While the resulting probability flow ODE offers appealing properties - such as defining a gradient flow of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the current and target densities with respect to the 2-Wasserstein distance - it relies on evaluating the current probability density, which is intractable in most practical applications. By closely examining the drawbacks of approximating this density via kernel density estimation, we uncover opportunities to turn these limitations into advantages in contexts such as variational inference, kernel mean embeddings, and sequential Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Approximate Projections onto the Positive Semidefinite Cone Using Randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents two novel algorithms for approximately projecting symmetric matrices onto the Positive Semidefinite (PSD) cone using Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RNLA). Classical PSD projection methods rely on full-rank deterministic eigen-decomposition, which can be computationally prohibitive for large-scale problems. Our approach leverages RNLA to construct low-rank matrix approximations before projection, significantly reducing the required numerical resources. The first algorithm utilizes random sampling to generate a low-rank approximation, followed by a standard eigen-decomposition on this smaller matrix. The second algorithm enhances this process by introducing a scaling approach that aligns the leading-order singular values with the positive eigenvalues, ensuring that the low-rank approximation captures the essential information about the positive eigenvalues for PSD projection. Both methods offer a trade-off between accuracy and computational speed, supported by probabilistic error bounds. To further demonstrate the practical benefits of our approach, we integrate the randomized projection methods into a first-order Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) solver. Numerical experiments, including those on SDPs derived from Sum-of-Squares (SOS) programming problems, validate the effectiveness of our method, especially for problems that are infeasible with traditional deterministic methods.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of the Crandall--Pazy Class of $C_0$-semigroups on Hilbert Spaces and Their Application to Decay Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate immediately differentiable $C_0$-semigroups $(e^{-tA})_{t \geq 0}$ satisfying $\sup_{0 &lt; t &lt;1} t^{1/\beta}\|Ae^{-tA}\| &lt; \infty$ for some $0 &lt; \beta \leq 1$. Such $C_0$-semigroups are referred to as the Crandall--Pazy class of $C_0$-semigroups. In the Hilbert space setting, we present two characterizations of the Crandall--Pazy class. We then apply these characterizations to estimate decay rates for Crank--Nicolson schemes with smooth initial data when the associated abstract Cauchy problem is governed by an exponentially stable $C_0$-semigroup in the Crandall--Pazy class. The first approach is based on a functional calculus called the $\mathcal{B}$-calculus. The second approach builds upon estimates derived from Lyapunov equations and improves the decay estimate obtained in the first approach, under the additional assumption that $-A^{-1}$ generates a bounded $C_0$-semigroup.</description>

Abstract: We remove the dependence on the `hot-spots' conjecture in two of the main theorems of the recent paper of Nickl (2024, Annals of Statistics). Specifically, we characterise the minimax convergence rates for estimation of the transition operator $P_{f}$ arising from the Neumann Laplacian with diffusion coefficient $f$ on arbitrary convex domains with smooth boundary, and further show that a general Lipschitz stability estimate holds for the inverse map $P_f\mapsto f$ from $H^2\to H^2$ to $L^1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for accelerating AI performance by leveraging Anderson extrapolation, a vector-to-vector mapping technique based on a window of historical iterations. By identifying the crossover point where a mixing penalty is incurred, the method focuses on reducing iterations to convergence, with fewer more compute-intensive but generally cacheable iterations, balancing speed and memory usage with accuracy and algorithmic stability, respectively. We demonstrate significant improvements, in both training and inference, motivated by scalability and efficiency extensions to the realm of high-performance computing (HPC).</description>

      <title>A Trust Region Proximal Gradient Method for Nonlinear Multi-objective Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a globally convergent trust region proximal gradient method is developed for composite multi-objective optimization problems where each objective function can be represented as the sum of a smooth function and a nonsmooth function. The proposed method is free from any kind of priori chosen parameters or ordering information of objective functions. At every iteration of the proposed method, a sub problem is solved to find a suitable direction. This sub problem uses a quadratic approximation of each smooth function and a trust region constraint. An update formula for trust region radius is introduce in this paper. A sequence is generated using descent directions. It is justified that under some mild assumptions every accumulation point of this sequence is a critical point. The proposed method is verified and compared with some existing methods using a set of problems.</description>

      <title>Isotropic Q-fractional Brownian motion on the sphere: regularity and fast simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an extension of isotropic Gaussian random fields and Q-Wiener processes on d-dimensional spheres, isotropic Q-fractional Brownian motion is introduced and sample H\"older regularity in space-time is shown depending on the regularity of the spatial covariance operator Q and the Hurst parameter H. The processes are approximated by a spectral method in space for which strong and almost sure convergence are shown. The underlying sample paths of fractional Brownian motion are simulated by circulant embedding or conditionalized random midpoint displacement. Temporal convergence and computational complexity are numerically tested, the latter matching the complexity of simulating a Q-Wiener process if allowing for a temporal error.</description>

      <title>Super Gradient Descent: Global Optimization requires Global Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global minimization is a fundamental challenge in optimization, especially in machine learning, where finding the global minimum of a function directly impacts model performance and convergence. This report introduces a novel optimization method that we called Super Gradient Descent, designed specifically for one-dimensional functions, guaranteeing convergence to the global minimum for any k-Lipschitz function defined on a closed interval [a, b]. Our approach addresses the limitations of traditional optimization algorithms, which often get trapped in local minima. In particular, we introduce the concept of global gradient which offers a robust solution for precise and well-guided global optimization. By focusing on the global minimization problem, this work bridges a critical gap in optimization theory, offering new insights and practical advancements in different optimization problems in particular Machine Learning problems like line search.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates for systems of nonlocal balance laws modeling dense multilane vehicular traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a class of coupled system of nonlocal nonlinear balance laws modeling multilane traffic, with the nonlocality present in both convective and source terms. The uniqueness and existence of the entropy solution is proven via doubling of the variables arguments and convergent finite volume approximations, respectively. The primary goal is to establish that the finite volume numerical approximations of the system converge to the unique entropy solution at a rate of $\sqrt{\Delta t}$, even when using relatively less regular one-sided kernels, as opposed to the globally smooth kernels analyzed in [Num. Math., 156(1):237-271, 2024] and [IMA J. Numer. Anal., drad101, 2024]. The applicability of the proven theory to a general class of systems of nonlocal balance laws coupled strongly through the convective part and weakly through the source part, is also indicated. Numerical simulations illustrating the theory and the behavior of the entropy solution as the support of the kernel goes to zero (nonlocal to local limit), are shown.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev Subdivision and Reduction Methods for Solving Multivariable Systems of Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for finding isolated zeros of a system of real-valued functions in a bounded interval in $\mathbb{R}^n$. It uses the Chebyshev proxy method combined with a mixture of subdivision, reduction methods, and elimination checks that leverage special properties of Chebyshev polynomials. We prove the method has R-quadratic convergence locally near simple zeros of the system. We also analyze the temporal complexity and the numerical stability of the algorithm and provide numerical evidence in dimensions up to three that the method is both fast and accurate on a wide range of problems. The algorithm should also work well in higher dimensions. Our tests show that the algorithm outperforms other standard methods on this problem of finding all real zeros in a bounded domain. Our Python implementation of the algorithm is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation via vortex tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the numerical simulation of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation, for which a well-known feature is the appearance of quantized vortices with core size of the order of a small parameter $\varepsilon$. Without a magnetic field and with suitable initial conditions, these vortices interact, in the singular limit $\varepsilon\to0$, through an explicit Hamiltonian dynamics. Using this analytical framework, we develop and analyze a numerical strategy based on the reduced-order Hamiltonian system to efficiently simulate the infinite-dimensional GP equation for small, but finite, $\varepsilon$. This method allows us to avoid numerical stability issues in solving the GP equation, where small values of $\varepsilon$ typically require very fine meshes and time steps. We also provide a mathematical justification of our method in terms of rigorous error estimates of the error in the supercurrent, together with numerical illustrations.</description>

      <title>Sketched Lanczos uncertainty score: a low-memory summary of the Fisher information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current uncertainty quantification is memory and compute expensive, which hinders practical uptake. To counter, we develop Sketched Lanczos Uncertainty (SLU): an architecture-agnostic uncertainty score that can be applied to pre-trained neural networks with minimal overhead. Importantly, the memory use of SLU only grows logarithmically with the number of model parameters. We combine Lanczos' algorithm with dimensionality reduction techniques to compute a sketch of the leading eigenvectors of a matrix. Applying this novel algorithm to the Fisher information matrix yields a cheap and reliable uncertainty score. Empirically, SLU yields well-calibrated uncertainties, reliably detects out-of-distribution examples, and consistently outperforms existing methods in the low-memory regime.</description>

      <title>SUPG-stabilized time-DG finite and virtual elements for the time-dependent advection-diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out a stability and convergence analysis for the fully discrete scheme obtained by combining a finite or virtual element spatial discretization with the upwind-discontinuous Galerkin time-stepping applied to the time-dependent advection-diffusion equation. A space-time streamline-upwind Petrov-Galerkin term is used to stabilize the method. More precisely, we show that the method is inf-sup stable with constant independent of the diffusion coefficient, which ensures the robustness of the method in the convection- and diffusion-dominated regimes. Moreover, we prove optimal convergence rates in both regimes for the error in the energy norm. An important feature of the presented analysis is the control in the full $L^2(0,T;L^2(\Omega))$ norm without the need of introducing an artificial reaction term in the model. We finally present some numerical experiments in $(3 + 1)$-dimensions that validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>An acceleration technique for methods for finding the nearest point in a polytope and computing the distance between two polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04553v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple and efficient acceleration technique for an arbitrary method for computing the Euclidean projection of a point onto a convex polytope, defined as the convex hull of a finite number of points, in the case when the number of points in the polytope is much greater than the dimension of the space. The technique consists in applying any given method to a "small" subpolytope of the original polytope and gradually shifting it, till the projection of the given point onto the subpolytope coincides with its projection onto the original polytope. The results of numerical experiments demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed acceleration technique. In particular, they show that the reduction of computation time increases with an increase of the number of points in the polytope and is proportional to this number for some methods. In the second part of the paper, we also discuss a straightforward extension of the proposed acceleration technique to the case of arbitrary methods for computing the distance between two convex polytopes, defined as the convex hulls of finite sets of points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many problems in linear algebra -- such as those arising from non-Hermitian physics and differential equations -- can be solved on a quantum computer by processing eigenvalues of the non-normal input matrices. However, the existing Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) framework is ill-suited to this task, as eigenvalues and singular values are different in general. We present a Quantum EigenValue Transformation (QEVT) framework for applying arbitrary polynomial transformations on eigenvalues of block-encoded non-normal operators, and a related Quantum EigenValue Estimation (QEVE) algorithm for operators with real spectra. QEVT has query complexity to the block encoding nearly recovering that of the QSVT for a Hermitian input, and QEVE achieves the Heisenberg-limited scaling for diagonalizable input matrices. As applications, we develop a linear differential equation solver with strictly linear time query complexity for average-case diagonalizable operators, as well as a ground state preparation algorithm that upgrades previous nearly optimal results for Hermitian Hamiltonians to diagonalizable matrices with real spectra. Underpinning our algorithms is an efficient method to prepare a quantum superposition of Faber polynomials, which generalize the nearly-best uniform approximation properties of Chebyshev polynomials to the complex plane. Of independent interest, we also develop techniques to generate $n$ Fourier coefficients with $\mathbf{O}(\mathrm{polylog}(n))$ gates compared to prior approaches with linear cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tuning scientific and probabilistic machine learning models $-$ for example, partial differential equations, Gaussian processes, or Bayesian neural networks $-$ often relies on evaluating functions of matrices whose size grows with the data set or the number of parameters. While the state-of-the-art for evaluating these quantities is almost always based on Lanczos and Arnoldi iterations, the present work is the first to explain how to differentiate these workhorses of numerical linear algebra efficiently. To get there, we derive previously unknown adjoint systems for Lanczos and Arnoldi iterations, implement them in JAX, and show that the resulting code can compete with Diffrax when it comes to differentiating PDEs, GPyTorch for selecting Gaussian process models and beats standard factorisation methods for calibrating Bayesian neural networks. All this is achieved without any problem-specific code optimisation. Find the code at https://github.com/pnkraemer/experiments-lanczos-adjoints and install the library with pip install matfree.</description>

      <title>Parametric model reduction of mean-field and stochastic systems via higher-order action matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to learn models of population dynamics of physical systems that feature stochastic and mean-field effects and that depend on physics parameters. The learned models can act as surrogates of classical numerical models to efficiently predict the system behavior over the physics parameters. Building on the Benamou-Brenier formula from optimal transport and action matching, we use a variational problem to infer parameter- and time-dependent gradient fields that represent approximations of the population dynamics. The inferred gradient fields can then be used to rapidly generate sample trajectories that mimic the dynamics of the physical system on a population level over varying physics parameters. We show that combining Monte Carlo sampling with higher-order quadrature rules is critical for accurately estimating the training objective from sample data and for stabilizing the training process. We demonstrate on Vlasov-Poisson instabilities as well as on high-dimensional particle and chaotic systems that our approach accurately predicts population dynamics over a wide range of parameters and outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based and flow-based modeling that simply condition on time and physics parameters.</description>
