      <title>Adiabatic Flame Temperatures for Oxy-Methane, Oxy-Hydrogen, Air-Methane, and Air-Hydrogen Stoichiometric Combustion using the NASA CEARUN Tool, GRI-Mech 3.0 Reaction Mechanism, and Cantera Python Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Adiabatic Flame Temperature (AFT) in combustion represents the maximum attainable temperature at which the chemical energy in the reactant fuel is converted into sensible heat in combustion products without heat loss. AFT depends on the fuel, oxidizer, and chemical composition of the products. Computing AFT requires solving either a nonlinear equation or a larger minimization problem. This study obtained the AFTs for oxy-methane (methane and oxygen), oxy-hydrogen (hydrogen and oxygen), air-methane (methane and air), and air-hydrogen (hydrogen and air) for stoichiometric conditions. The reactant temperature was 298.15 K (25{\deg}C), and the pressure was kept constant at 1 atm. Two reaction mechanisms were attempted: a global single-step irreversible reaction for complete combustion and the GRI-Mech 3.0 elementary mechanism (53 species, 325 steps) for chemical equilibrium with its associated thermodynamic data. NASA CEARUN was the main modeling tool used. Two other tools were used for benchmarking: an Excel and a Cantera-Python implementation of GRI-Mech 3.0. The results showed that the AFTs for oxy-methane were 5,166.47 K (complete combustion) and 3,050.12 K (chemical equilibrium), and dropped to 2,326.35 K and 2,224.25 K for air-methane, respectively. The AFTs for oxy-hydrogen were 4,930.56 K (complete combustion) and 3,074.51 K (chemical equilibrium), and dropped to 2,520.33 K and 2,378.62 K for air-hydrogen, respectively. For eight combustion modeling cases, the relative deviation between the AFTs predicted by CEARUN and GRI-Mech 3.0 ranged from 0.064% to 3.503%.</description>

      <title>Development of a Cost-Effective Simulation Tool for Loss of Flow Accident Transients in High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to further expand the capability of the coarse-grid Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach, SubChCFD, to effectively simulate transient and buoyancy-influenced flows, which are critical in accident analyses of High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs). It has been demonstrated in our previous work that SubChCFD is highly adaptable to HTGR fuel designs and performs exceptionally well in modelling steady-state processes. In this study, the approach is extended to simulate a Loss of Flow Accident (LOFA) transient, where coolant circulation is disrupted, causing the transition from forced convection to buoyancy-driven natural circulation within the reactor core. To enable SubChCFD to capture the complex physics involved, corrections were introduced to the empirical correlations to account for the effects of flow unsteadiness, property variation and buoyancy.
  A 1/12th sector of the reactor core, representing the smallest symmetric unit, was modelled using a coarse mesh of approximately 60 million cells. This mesh size is about 6% of that required for a Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) model, where mesh sizes can typically reach the order of 1 billion cells for such configurations. Simulation results show that SubChCFD effectively captures the thermal hydraulic behaviours of the reactor during a LOFA transient, producing predictions in good agreement with RANS simulations while significantly reducing computational cost.</description>

      <title>Modeling ice cliff stability using a new Mohr-Coulomb-based phase field fracture model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iceberg calving at glacier termini results in mass loss from ice sheets, but the associated fracture mechanics is often poorly represented using simplistic (empirical or elementary mechanics-based) failure criteria. Here, we propose an advanced Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion that drives cracking based on the visco-elastic stress state in ice. This criterion is implemented in a phase field fracture framework, and finite element simulations are conducted to determine the critical conditions that can trigger ice cliff collapse. Results demonstrate that fast-moving glaciers with negligible basal friction are prone to tensile failure causing crevasse propagation far away from the ice front; whilst slow-moving glaciers with significant basal friction are likely to exhibit shear failure near the ice front. Results also indicate that seawater pressure plays a major role in modulating cliff failure. For land terminating glaciers, full thickness cliff failure is observed if the glacier exceeds a critical height, dependent on cohesive strength $\tau_\mathrm{c}$ ($H \approx 120\;\text{m}$ for $\tau_\mathrm{c}=0.5\;\text{MPa}$). For marine-terminating glaciers, ice cliff failure occurs if a critical glacier free-board ($H-h_\mathrm{w}$) is exceeded, with ice slumping only observed above the ocean-water height; for $\tau_\mathrm{c} = 0.5\;\text{MPa}$, the model-predicted critical free-board is $H-h_\mathrm{w} \approx 215\;\text{m}$, which is in good agreement with field observations. While the critical free-board height is larger than that predicted by some previous models, we cannot conclude that marine ice cliff instability is less likely because we do not include other failure processes such as hydrofracture of basal crevasses and plastic necking.</description>

      <title>Discovering uncertainty: Gaussian constitutive neural networks with correlated weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When characterizing materials, it can be important to not only predict their mechanical properties, but also to estimate the probability distribution of these properties across a set of samples. Constitutive neural networks allow for the automated discovery of constitutive models that exactly satisfy physical laws given experimental testing data, but are only capable of predicting the mean stress response. Stochastic methods treat each weight as a random variable and are capable of learning their probability distributions. Bayesian constitutive neural networks combine both methods, but their weights lack physical interpretability and we must sample each weight from a probability distribution to train or evaluate the model. Here we introduce a more interpretable network with fewer parameters, simpler training, and the potential to discover correlated weights: Gaussian constitutive neural networks. We demonstrate the performance of our new Gaussian network on biaxial testing data, and discover a sparse and interpretable four-term model with correlated weights. Importantly, the discovered distributions of material parameters across a set of samples can serve as priors to discover better constitutive models for new samples with limited data. We anticipate that Gaussian constitutive neural networks are a natural first step towards generative constitutive models informed by physical laws and parameter uncertainty.</description>

      <title>AUTV: Creating Underwater Video Datasets with Pixel-wise Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater video analysis, hampered by the dynamic marine environment and camera motion, remains a challenging task in computer vision. Existing training-free video generation techniques, learning motion dynamics on the frame-by-frame basis, often produce poor results with noticeable motion interruptions and misaligments. To address these issues, we propose AUTV, a framework for synthesizing marine video data with pixel-wise annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework by constructing two video datasets, namely UTV, a real-world dataset comprising 2,000 video-text pairs, and SUTV, a synthetic video dataset including 10,000 videos with segmentation masks for marine objects. UTV provides diverse underwater videos with comprehensive annotations including appearance, texture, camera intrinsics, lighting, and animal behavior. SUTV can be used to improve underwater downstream tasks, which are demonstrated in video inpainting and video object segmentation.</description>

      <title>Magneto-thermally Coupled Field Simulation of Homogenized Foil Winding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foil windings have, due to their layered structure, different properties than conventional wire windings, which make them advantageous for high frequency applications. Both electromagnetic and thermal analyses are relevant for foil windings. These two physical areas are coupled through Joule losses and temperature dependent material properties. For an efficient simulation of foil windings, homogenization techniques are used to avoid resolving the single turns. Therefore, this paper comprises a coupled magneto-thermal simulation that uses a homogenization method in the electromagnetic and thermal part. A weak coupling with different time step sizes for both parts is presented. The method is validated on a simple geometry and showcased for a pot transformer that uses a foil and a wire winding.</description>

      <title>Cohort-attention Evaluation Metric against Tied Data: Studying Performance of Classification Models in Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly improved medical screening accuracy, particularly in cancer detection and risk assessment. However, traditional classification metrics often fail to account for imbalanced data, varying performance across cohorts, and patient-level inconsistencies, leading to biased evaluations. We propose the Cohort-Attention Evaluation Metrics (CAT) framework to address these challenges. CAT introduces patient-level assessment, entropy-based distribution weighting, and cohort-weighted sensitivity and specificity. Key metrics like CATSensitivity (CATSen), CATSpecificity (CATSpe), and CATMean ensure balanced and fair evaluation across diverse populations. This approach enhances predictive reliability, fairness, and interpretability, providing a robust evaluation method for AI-driven medical screening models.</description>

      <title>PERC: a suite of software tools for the curation of cryoEM data with application to simulation, modelling and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ease of access to data, tools and models expedites scientific research. In structural biology there are now numerous open repositories of experimental and simulated datasets. Being able to easily access and utilise these is crucial for allowing researchers to make optimal use of their research effort. The tools presented here are useful for collating existing public cryoEM datasets and/or creating new synthetic cryoEM datasets to aid the development of novel data processing and interpretation algorithms. In recent years, structural biology has seen the development of a multitude of machine-learning based algorithms for aiding numerous steps in the processing and reconstruction of experimental datasets and the use of these approaches has become widespread. Developing such techniques in structural biology requires access to large datasets which can be cumbersome to curate and unwieldy to make use of. In this paper we present a suite of Python software packages which we collectively refer to as PERC (profet, EMPIARreader and CAKED). These are designed to reduce the burden which data curation places upon structural biology research. The protein structure fetcher (profet) package allows users to conveniently download and cleave sequences or structures from the Protein Data Bank or Alphafold databases. EMPIARreader allows lazy loading of Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive datasets in a machine-learning compatible structure. The Class Aggregator for Key Electron-microscopy Data (CAKED) package is designed to seamlessly facilitate the training of machine learning models on electron microscopy data, including electron-cryo-microscopy-specific data augmentation and labelling. These packages may be utilised independently or as building blocks in workflows. All are available in open source repositories and designed to be easily extensible to facilitate more advanced workflows if required.</description>

      <title>Real-time design of architectural structures with differentiable mechanics and neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing mechanically efficient geometry for architectural structures like shells, towers, and bridges, is an expensive iterative process. Existing techniques for solving such inverse problems rely on traditional optimization methods, which are slow and computationally expensive, limiting iteration speed and design exploration. Neural networks would seem to offer a solution via data-driven amortized optimization, but they often require extensive fine-tuning and cannot ensure that important design criteria, such as mechanical integrity, are met. In this work, we combine neural networks with a differentiable mechanics simulator to develop a model that accelerates the solution of shape approximation problems for architectural structures represented as bar systems. This model explicitly guarantees compliance with mechanical constraints while generating designs that closely match target geometries. We validate our approach in two tasks, the design of masonry shells and cable-net towers. Our model achieves better accuracy and generalization than fully neural alternatives, and comparable accuracy to direct optimization but in real time, enabling fast and reliable design exploration. We further demonstrate its advantages by integrating it into 3D modeling software and fabricating a physical prototype. Our work opens up new opportunities for accelerated mechanical design enhanced by neural networks for the built environment.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Modeling and Analysis of Transport Phenomena for Continuous Lyophilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lyophilization (aka freeze drying) is a typical process in pharmaceutical manufacturing used for improving the stability of various drug products, including its recent applications to mRNA vaccines. While extensive efforts have been dedicated to shifting the pharmaceutical industry toward continuous manufacturing, the majority of industrial-scale lyophilization is still being operated in a batch mode. This article presents the first mechanistic model for a complete continuous lyophilization process, which comprehensively incorporates and describes key transport phenomena in all three steps of lyophilization, namely freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying. The proposed model considers the state-of-the-art lyophilization technology, in which vials are suspended and move continuously through the process. The validated model can accurately predict the evolution of critical process parameters, including the product temperature, ice/water fraction, sublimation front position, and concentration of bound water, for the entire process. Several applications related to model-based process design and optimization of continuous lyophilization are also demonstrated. The final model is made available in MATLAB and Julia as an open-source software package called ContLyo, which can ultimately be leveraged for guiding the design and development of future continuous lyophilization processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating experimental data into simulations is crucial for predicting material behaviour, especially in fracture mechanics. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) provides precise displacement measurements, essential for evaluating strain energy release rates and stress intensity factors (SIF) around cracks. Translating DIC data into CAE software like ABAQUS has been challenging. DIC2CAE, a MATLAB-based tool, automates this conversion, enabling accurate simulations. It uses the J-integral method to calculate SIFs and handles complex scenarios without needing specimen geometry or applied loads. DIC2CAE enhances fracture mechanics simulations' reliability, accelerating materials research and development.</description>

      <title>Reliable Uncertainty Quantification for Fiber Orientation in Composite Molding Processes using Multilevel Polynomial Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fiber orientation is decisive for the mechanical performance of composite materials. During manufacturing, variations in material and process parameters can influence fiber orientation. We employ multilevel polynomial surrogates to model the propagation of uncertain material properties in the injection molding process. To ensure reliable uncertainty quantification, a key focus is deriving novel error bounds for statistical measures of a quantity of interest. Numerical experiments employ the Cross-WLF viscosity model and Hagen-Poiseuille flow to investigate the impact of uncertainties in fiber length and matrix temperature on the fractional anisotropy of fiber orientation. The Folgar-Tucker equation and the improved anisotropic rotary diffusion model, incorporating analytical solutions, are used for verification. Results show that the method improves significantly upon standard Monte Carlo estimation, while also providing error guarantees. These findings offer the first step toward a reliable and practical tool for optimizing fiber-reinforced polymer manufacturing processes in the future.</description>

      <title>Interpolation Neural Network-Tensor Decomposition (INN-TD): a scalable and interpretable approach for large-scale physics-based problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning has been extensively employed as a powerful function approximator for modeling physics-based problems described by partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite their popularity, standard deep learning models often demand prohibitively large computational resources and yield limited accuracy when scaling to large-scale, high-dimensional physical problems. Their black-box nature further hinders the application in industrial problems where interpretability and high precision are critical. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Interpolation Neural Network-Tensor Decomposition (INN-TD), a scalable and interpretable framework that has the merits of both machine learning and finite element methods for modeling large-scale physical systems. By integrating locally supported interpolation functions from finite element into the network architecture, INN-TD achieves a sparse learning structure with enhanced accuracy, faster training/solving speed, and reduced memory footprint. This makes it particularly effective for tackling large-scale high-dimensional parametric PDEs in training, solving, and inverse optimization tasks in physical problems where high precision is required.</description>

      <title>Chasing the Timber Trail: Machine Learning to Reveal Harvest Location Misrepresentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Illegal logging poses a significant threat to global biodiversity, climate stability, and depresses international prices for legal wood harvesting and responsible forest products trade, affecting livelihoods and communities across the globe. Stable isotope ratio analysis (SIRA) is rapidly becoming an important tool for determining the harvest location of traded, organic, products. The spatial pattern in stable isotope ratio values depends on factors such as atmospheric and environmental conditions and can thus be used for geographic origin identification. We present here the results of a deployed machine learning pipeline where we leverage both isotope values and atmospheric variables to determine timber harvest location. Additionally, the pipeline incorporates uncertainty estimation to facilitate the interpretation of harvest location determination for analysts. We present our experiments on a collection of oak (Quercus spp.) tree samples from its global range. Our pipeline outperforms comparable state-of-the-art models determining geographic harvest origin of commercially traded wood products, and has been used by European enforcement agencies to identify harvest location misrepresentation.
