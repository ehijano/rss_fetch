      <title>Existence of $K$-multimagic squares and magic squares of $k$th powers with distinct entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of $K$-multimagic squares of order $N$ consisting of distinct integers whenever $N&gt;2 K(K+1)$. This improves upon our earlier result in which we only required $N+1$ distinct integers.
  Additionally, we present a direct method by which our analysis of the magic square system may be used to show the existence of magic squares consisting of distinct $k$ th powers when
  $$ N&gt; \begin{cases}2^{k+1} &amp; \text { if } 2 \leqslant k \leqslant 4, \\ 2\lceil k(\log k+4.20032)\rceil &amp; \text { if } k \geqslant 5,\end{cases} $$

      <title>An automorphic description of the zeta function of the basic stratum of certain Kottwitz varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive formulas for the number of points on the basic stratum of certain Kottwitz varieties in terms of automorphic representations and certain explicit polynomials, for which we present efficient algorithms for computation. We obtain our results using the trace formula, base change, representations of general linear groups over p-adic fields, and a truncation of the formula of Kottwitz for the number of points on Shimura varieties over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Effectivity in the Subspace Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Subspace Theorem due to Schmidt (1972) is a broad generalisation of Roth's Theorem in Diophantine Approximation (1955) which, in the same way as the latter, suffers a notorious lack of effectivity. This problem is tackled from a probabilistic standpoint by determining the proportion of algebraic linear forms of bounded heights and degrees for which there exists a solution to the Subspace Inequality lying in a subspace of large height. The estimates are established for a class of height functions emerging from an analytic parametrisation of the projective space. They are pertinent in the regime where the heights of the algebraic quantities are larger than those of the rational solutions to the inequality under consideration, and are valid for approximation functions more general than the power functions intervening in the original Subspace Theorem. These estimates are further refined in the case of Roth's Theorem so as to yield a Khintchin-type density version of the so-called Waldschmidt conjecture (which is known to fail pointwise). This answers a question raised by Beresnevich, Bernik and Dodson (2009).</description>

      <title>A Density Theorem for Higher Order Sums of Prime Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a subset of the primes of lower density strictly larger than $\frac12$. Then, every sufficiently large even integer is a sum of four primes from the set $P$. We establish similar results for $k$-summands, with $k\geq 4$, and for $k \geq 4$ distinct subsets of primes. This extends the work of H.~Li, H.~Pan, as well as X.~Shao on sums of three primes, and A.~Alsteri and X.~Shao on sums of two primes. The primary new contributions come from elementary combinatorial lemmas.</description>

      <title>Landau's constant related to the classical zero free region of Riemann zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zero-free regions of the Riemann zeta function play a pivotal role in understanding the distribution of prime numbers. These regions are often established using specific trigonometric polynomials and associated functionals. In this paper, we revisit the exact values of the infimum $V_n$ of a particular functional $v(f)$ over the set $C_n$ of cosine polynomials with nonnegative coefficients satisfying certain conditions, for $n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$. By refining previous methods and classifying the polynomials based on the location of their roots, we provide improved calculations of $V_n$ for these values of $n$. Additionally, we extend our techniques to determine the exact values of $V_n$ for $n = 7, 8$, which were previously unknown. Our findings yield tighter bounds for the constant $R$ in the classical zero-free region $\sigma &gt; 1 - \frac{1}{R \log |t|}$, thereby enhancing our comprehension of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function and contributing to advancements in analytic number theory and prime number theory.</description>

      <title>Successive Minima, Determinant and Automorphism Groups of Hyperelliptic Function Field Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we contribute to previously known results on lattices constructed by algebraic function fields, or function field lattices in short. First, motivated by the non-well-roundedness property of certain hyperelliptic function field lattices (Ates and Stichtenoth, 2016), we explore the successive minima of these lattices in detail. We also study the determinant of hyperelliptic function field lattices. Finally, we show a connection between the automorphism groups of algebraic function fields and function field lattices, based on ideas from B\"ottcher et al., 2016.</description>

      <title>The standard $L$-function attached to a vector valued modular form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define two $L$-functions associated to a common vector valued eigenform $f$ transforming with the ``finite'' Weil representation. The first one can be seen as a standard zeta function defined by the eigenvalues of $f$. The second one can be interpreted as standard $L$-function defined as an Euler product where each $p$-factor is a rational function in terms of two unramified characters of the $p$-adic field $\Q_p$. We show that both $L$-functions are related and prove further that they both can be continued meromorphically to the whole complex $s$-plane.</description>

      <title>Novel performant primality test on a Pell's cubic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primality testing is an especially useful topic for public-key cryptography. In this paper, a novel primality test algorithm based on the Pell's cubic will be introduced, and its necessary primality conditions will be proved using three integer sequences connected to operations applied in the projectivization of the Pell's cubic. The number of operations involved in the test grows linearly with respect to the bit-length $\log_2(n)$ of the input integer $n$. The algorithm is deterministic for integers less than $2^{32}$.</description>

      <title>Isomorphic gcd-graphs over polynomial rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gcd-graphs over the ring of integers modulo $n$ are a simple and elegant class of integral graphs. The study of these graphs connects multiple areas of mathematics, including graph theory, number theory, and ring theory. In a recent work, inspired by the analogy between number fields and function fields, we define and study gcd-graphs over polynomial rings with coefficients in finite fields. We discover that, in both cases, gcd-graphs share many similar and analogous properties. In this article, we extend this line of research further. Among other topics, we explore an analog of a conjecture of So and a weaker version of Sander-Sander, concerning the conditions under which two gcd-graphs are isomorphic or isospectral. We also provide several constructions showing that, unlike the case over $\mathbb{Z}$, it is not uncommon for two gcd-graphs over polynomial rings to be isomorphic.</description>

      <title>A note on zero-density approaches for the difference between consecutive primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we generalise two results on prime numbers in short intervals. The first result is Ingham's theorem which connects the zero-density estimates with short intervals where the prime number theorem holds, and the second result is due to Heath-Brown and Iwaniec, which derives the weighted zero-density estimates used for obtaining the lower bound for the number of primes in short intervals. The generalised versions of these results make the connections between the zero-free regions, zero-density estimates, and the primes in short intervals more transparent. As an example, the generalisation of Ingham's theorem implies that, under the Density Hypothesis, the prime number theorem holds in $[x - \sqrt{x}\exp(\log^{2/3+\varepsilon}x), x]$, which refines upon the classic interval $[x - x^{1/2+ \varepsilon}, x]$.</description>

      <title>On the Sum of Squarefree Integers and a Power of Two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erdos conjectured that every odd number greater than one can be expressed as the sum of a squarefree number and a power of two. Subsequently, Odlyzko and McCranie provided numerical verification of this conjecture up to $10^7$ and $1.4\cdot 10^9$. In this paper, we extend the verification to all odd integers up to $2^{50}$, thereby improving the previous bound by a factor of more than $8\cdot 10^5$. Our approach employs a highly parallelized algorithm implemented on a GPU, which significantly accelerates the process. We provide details of the algorithm and present novel heuristic computations and numerical findings, including the smallest odd numbers $&lt;2^{50}$ that require a higher power of two as all smaller ones in their representation.</description>

      <title>On Torsion Subgroups of Elliptic Curves over Quartic, Quintic and Sextic Number Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The list of all groups that can appear as torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields of degree $d$, $d=4,5,6$, is not completely determined. However, the list of groups $\Phi^{\infty}(d)$, $d=4,5,6$, that can be realized as torsion subgroups for infinitely many non-isomorphic elliptic curves over these fields are known. We address the question of which torsion subgroups can arise over a given number field of degree $d$. In fact, given $G\in\Phi^{\infty}(d)$ and a number field $K$ of degree $d$, we give explicit criteria telling whether $G$ is realized finitely or infinitely often over $K$. We also give results on the field with the smallest absolute value of its discriminant such that there exists an elliptic curve with torsion $G$. Finally, we give examples of number fields $K$ of degree $d$, $d=4,5,6$, over which the Mordell-Weil rank of elliptic curves with prescribed torsion is bounded from above.</description>

      <title>Modularity of d-elliptic loci with level structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the generating series of special cycles on $\mathcal{A}_1(N)\times \mathcal{A}_g(N)$, with full level $N$ structure, valued in the cohomology of degree $2g$. The modularity theorem of Kudla-Millson for locally symmetric spaces implies that these series are modular. When $N=1$, the images of these loci in $\mathcal{A}_g$ are the $d$-elliptic Noether-Lefschetz loci, which are conjectured to be modular. In the appendix, it is shown that the resulting modular forms are nonzero for $g=2$ when $N\geq 11$ and $N\neq 12$.</description>

      <title>Family of curves, first slope, p-adic weight of support</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper uncovers a new link between the p-adic weight of the support \Supp(f) of f(x)=\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i x^i and the first slope of Artin-Schreier curve X_f: y^p-y=f. We prove that the family X_f has its first slope \ge 1/\max_{i\in\Supp(f)}s_p(i), where s_p(i) is the sum of p-adic digits of i. If the maximum is achieved at a unique i, we show that the lower bound is achieved if and only if \nu satisfies a combinatorial $p$-symmetric condition. As an application, we construct explicit families of curves in every characteristic p with first slope equal to 1/n for every n\ge 2.</description>

      <title>The stable wave front set of theta representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the stable wave front set of theta representations for certain tame Brylinski-Deligne covers of a connected reductive $p$-adic group. The computation involves two main inputs. First we use a theorem of Okada, adapted to covering groups, to reduce the computation of the wave front set to computing the Kawanaka wave front set of certain representations of finite groups of Lie type. Second, to compute the Kawanaka wave front sets we use Lusztig's formula. This requires a careful analysis of the action of the pro-$p$ Iwahori-Hecke algebra on the theta representation, using the structural results about Hecke algebras developed by Gao-Gurevich-Karasiewicz and Wang.</description>

      <title>Counting conjugacy classes of subgroups of ${\rm PSL}_2(p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain formulae for the numbers of isomorphism and conjugacy classes of non-identity proper subgroups of the groups $G={\rm PSL}_2(p)$, $p$ prime, and for the numbers of those conjugacy classes which do or do not consist of self-normalising subgroups. The formulae are used to prove lower bounds $17$, $18$, $6$ and $12$ respectively satisfied by these invariants for all $p&gt;37$. A computer search carried out for a different problem shows that these bounds are attained for over a million primes $p$; we show that if the Bateman--Horn Conjecture is true, they are attained for infinitely many primes. Also, assuming no unproved conjectures, we use a result of Heath-Brown to obtain upper bounds for these invariants, valid for an infinite set of primes $p$.</description>

      <title>CM points on Shimura curves via QM-equivariant isogeny volcanoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study CM points on the Shimura curves $X_0^D(N)_{/\mathbb{Q}}$ and $X_1^D(N)_{/\mathbb{Q}}$, parametrizing abelian surfaces with quaternionic multiplication and extra level structure. A description of the locus of points with CM by a specified order is obtained for general level, via an isogeny-volcano approach in analogy to work of Clark and Clark--Saia in the $D=1$ case of modular curves. This allows for a count of all points with CM by a specified order on such a curve, and a determination of all primitive residue fields and primitive degrees of such points on $X_0^D(N)_{/\mathbb{Q}}$. We leverage computations of least degrees towards the existence of sporadic CM points on $X_0^D(N)_{/\mathbb{Q}}$.</description>

      <title>On Equal Consecutive Values of Multiplicative Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09929v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{C}$ be a multiplicative function for which $$ \sum_{p : \, |f(p)| \neq 1} \frac{1}{p} = \infty. $$ We show under this condition alone that for any integer $h \neq 0$ the set $$ \{n \in \mathbb{N} : f(n) = f(n+h) \neq 0\} $$ has logarithmic density 0. We also prove a converse result, along with an application to the Fourier coefficients of holomorphic cusp forms.
  The proof involves analysing the value distribution of $f$ using the compositions $|f|^{it}$, relying crucially on various applications of Tao's theorem on logarithmically-averaged correlations of non-pretentious multiplicative functions. Further key inputs arise from the inverse theory of sumsets in continuous additive combinatorics.</description>

      <title>The Cohomological Sarnak-Xue Density Hypothesis for $SO_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the cohomological version of the Sarnak-Xue Density Hypothesis for $SO_5$ over a totally real field and for inner forms split at all finite places. The proof relies on recent lines of work in the Langlands program: (i) Arthur's Endoscopic Classification of Representations of classical groups, and (ii) the Generalized Ramanujan-Petersson Theorem, proved for cohomological self-dual cuspidal representations of general linear groups. We give applications for the growth of cohomology of arithmetic manifolds, density-Ramanujan complexes, cutoff phenomena and optimal strong approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral zeta functions have been found many application in several branches of modern physics, including the quantum field theory, the string theory and the cosmology. In this paper, we shall consider the spectral zeta functions and their functional determinants in the $p$-adic field. Our approach for the constructions of $p$-adic spectral zeta functions is to apply the $p$-adic Mellin transforms with respect to locally analytic functions $f$, where $f$ interpolates the spectrum for the Hamiltonian of a quantum model.</description>

Abstract: Let $F$ be a number field and $p\geq7$ a rational prime. We obtain a simple descent criterion characterising those projective Galois representations $\overline\rho:G_F\to\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ for which the corresponding twist $X_{\overline\rho}(p)$ of the principal modular curve of level $p$ is defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. We also give a more concrete version of this result for representations which arise from elliptic curves over cyclic number fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a special family of Gaussian hypergeometric functions whose entries are cubic and trivial characters over finite fields. The special values of these functions are known to give the Frobenius traces of families of Hessian elliptic curves. Using the theory of harmonic Maass forms and mock modular forms, we prove that the limiting distribution of these values is semi-circular (i.e. $SU(2)$), confirming the usual Sato-Tate distribution in this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of which triangular numbers have a decimal representation containing a single repeated digit seamed to be settled since at least the 1970s: Ballew and Weger provided a complete list and a proof that these are the only numbers of this kind. This assertion is referenced by other authors in the field. However, their proof is flawed. We present a new and elementary proof of the statement, which corrects the error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moments for hypergeometric functions over finite fields were studied in the work of Ono, Pujahari, Saad, and Saikia for several $_{2}F_{1}$ and $_{3}F_{2}$ cases. We generalize their work to prove results for new cases where the hypergeometric data is defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ and primitive. These new moments are established using Hecke trace formulas of hypergeometric origin recently established by Hoffman, Li, Long, and Tu. We also obtain several algebraic formulas in the finite field setting and present conjectures for additional $_{2}F_{1}$ and $_{3}F_{2}$ moments.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we establish modular parameterizations for two general formulas for $\frac{1}{\pi}$ that subsume conjectural Ramanujan type formulas due to Z.-W. Sun, which have remained open since 2011. As an application of this, in a conceptual way we interpret how Sun's conjectural formulas arise and can be verified, as well as recover other cases that were proved by Cooper, Wan and Zudilin.</description>

      <title>Cryptarithmically unique terms in integer sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A cryptarithm (or alphametic) is a mathematical puzzle in which numbers are represented with words in such a way that identical letters stand for equal digits and distinct letters for unequal digits. An alphametic puzzle is usually given in the form of an equation that needs to be solved, such as SEND + MORE = MONEY. Alternatively, here we will consider cryptarithms constrained not by an equation but by a particular subsequence of natural numbers, for example perfect squares or primes. Such a cryptarithm has a unique solution if there is exactly one term in the sequence that has the corresponding pattern of digits. We will call such terms cryptarithmically unique. Here we estimate the density of such terms in an arbitrary sequence for which the overall density of terms among integers is known. In particular, among all perfect squares below 10^12, slightly less than one half are cryptarithmically unique, their density increasing toward larger numbers. Cryptarithmically unique prime numbers, however, are initially very scarce. Combinatorial estimates suggest that their density should drop below 10^-300 for decimal lengths of approximately 1829 digits, but then it recovers and is asymptotic to unity for very large primes. Finally, we introduce and discuss primonumerophobic digit patterns that no prime number happens to have.</description>

      <title>Endomorphisms of quasi-projective varieties -- towards Zariski dense orbit and Kawaguchi-Silverman conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.05339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a quasi-projective variety and $f\colon X\to X$ a finite surjective endomorphism. We consider Zariski Dense Orbit Conjecture (ZDO), and Adelic Zariski Dense Orbit Conjecture (AZO). We consider also Kawaguchi-Silverman Conjecture (KSC) asserting that the (first) dynamical degree $d_1(f)$ of $f$ equals the arithmetic degree $\alpha_f(P)$ at a point $P$ having Zariski dense $f$-forward orbit. Assuming $X$ is a smooth affine surface, such that the log Kodaira dimension $\bar{\kappa}(X)$ is non-negative (resp. the \'etale fundamental group $\pi_1^{\text{\'et}}(X)$ is infinite), we confirm AZO, (hence) ZDO, and KSC (when $\operatorname{deg}(f)\geq 2$) (resp. AZO and hence ZDO). We also prove ZDO (resp. AZO and hence ZDO) for every surjective endomorphism on any projective variety with ''larger'' first dynamical degree (resp. every dominant endomorphism of any semiabelian variety).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a smooth affine group scheme $G$ over the ring of $p$-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and a cocharacter $\mu$ of $G$, we study $G$-$\mu$-displays over the prismatic site of Bhatt-Scholze. In particular, we obtain several descent results for them. If $G=\mathrm{GL}_n$, then our $G$-$\mu$-displays can be thought of as Breuil-Kisin modules with some additional conditions. The relation between our $G$-$\mu$-displays and prismatic $F$-gauges introduced by Drinfeld and Bhatt-Lurie is also discussed. In fact, our results are formulated and proved for smooth affine group schemes over the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_E$ of any finite extension $E$ of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ by using $\mathcal{O}_E$-prisms, which are $\mathcal{O}_E$-analogues of prisms.</description>

      <title>Geometry of PCF parameters in spaces of quadratic polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study algebraic relations among postcritically finite (PCF) parameters in the family $f_c(z) = z^2 + c$. Ghioca, Krieger, Nguyen and Ye proved that an algebraic curve in $\mathbb{C}^2$ contains infinitely many PCF pairs $(c_1, c_2)$ if and only if the curve is special (i.e., the curve is a vertical or horizontal line through a PCF parameter, or the curve is the diagonal). Here we extend this result to subvarieties of $\mathbb{C}^n$ for any $n\geq 2$. Consequently, we obtain uniform bounds on the number of PCF pairs on non-special curves in $\mathbb{C}^2$ and the number of PCF parameters in real algebraic curves in $\mathbb{C}$, depending only on the degree of the curve. We also compute the optimal bound for the general curve of degree $d$.</description>

      <title>Bounded geometry for PCF-special subvarieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For each integer $d\geq 2$, let $M_d$ denote the moduli space of maps $f: \mathbb{P}^1\to \mathbb{P}^1$ of degree $d$. We study the geometric configurations of subsets of postcritically finite (or PCF) maps in $M_d$. A complex-algebraic subvariety $Y \subset M_d$ is said to be PCF-special if it contains a Zariski-dense set of PCF maps. Here we prove that there are only finitely many positive-dimensional irreducible PCF-special subvarieties in $M_d$ with degree $\leq D$. In addition, there exist constants $N = N(D,d)$ and $B = B(D,d)$ so that for any complex algebraic subvariety $X \subset M_d$ of degree $\leq D$, the Zariski closure $\overline{X\cap\mathrm{PCF}}~$ has at most $N$ irreducible components, each with degree $\leq B$. We also prove generalizations of these results for points with small critical height in $M_d(\bar{\mathbb{Q}})$.</description>
