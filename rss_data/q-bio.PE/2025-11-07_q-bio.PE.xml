      <title>Simulating the impact of perception bias on social contact surveys for infectious disease modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social contact patterns are a key input to many infectious disease models. Contact surveys, where participants are asked to provide information on their recent close and casual contacts with others, are one of the standard methods to measure contact patterns in a population. Surveys that require detailed sociodemographic descriptions of contacts allow for the specification of fine-grained contact rates between subpopulations in models. However, perception biases affecting a surveyed person's ability to estimate sociodemographic attributes (e.g., age, race, socioeconomic status) of others could affect contact rates derived from survey data. Here, we simulate contact surveys using a synthetic contact network of New Mexico to investigate the impact of these biases on survey accuracy and infectious disease model projections. We found that perception biases affecting the estimation of another individual's age and race substantially decreased the accuracy of the derived contact patterns. Using these biased patterns in a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered compartmental model lead to an underestimation of cumulative incidence among older people (65+ years) and individuals identifying as races other than White. Our study shows that perception biases can impact contact patterns estimated from surveys in ways that systematically underestimate disease burden in minority populations when used in transmission models.</description>

      <title>Habitat fragmentation promotes spatial scale separation under resource competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Habitat fragmentation, often driven by human activities, alters ecological landscapes by disrupting connectivity and reshaping species interactions. In such fragmented environments, habitats can be modeled as networks, where individuals disperse across interconnected patches. We consider an intraspecific competition model, where individuals compete for space while dispersing according to a nonlinear random walk, capturing the heterogeneity of the network. The interplay between asymmetric competition, dispersal dynamics, and spatial heterogeneity leads to nonuniform species distribution: individuals with stronger competitive traits accumulate in central (hub) habitat patches, while those with weaker traits are displaced toward the periphery. We provide analytical insights into this mechanism, supported by numerical simulations, demonstrating how competition and spatial structure jointly influence species segregation. In the large-network limit, this effect becomes extreme, with dominant individuals disappearing from peripheral patches and subordinate ones from central regions, establishing spatial segregation. This pattern may create favorable conditions for speciation, as physical separation can reinforce divergence within the population over time.</description>

      <title>Vector Traits Shape Disease Persistence: A Predator Prey Approach to Dengue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dengue continues to pose a major global threat, infecting nearly 390 million people annually. Recognizing the pivotal role of vector competence (vc), recent research focuses on mosquito parameters to inform transmission modeling and vector control strategies.This study models interactions between Aedes vectors and dengue pathogens, highlighting vc as a key driver of within vector infection dynamics and endemic persistence. Using a predator prey framework, we show that endemic conditions emerge naturally from the biological interplay between the vectors strategies to pathogen pressure and we prove global stability of such conditions. Our results reveal that under tropical and subtropical environmental pressures, the innate immune system of vectors cannot offset high vc during endemic outbreaks, highlighting a fundamental biological trade off, vectors can evolve increased transmission potential but cannot enhance immune capacity. This constraint defines the limits of their evolutionary response to pathogen driven selection and drives instability in disease transmission dynamics.</description>

      <title>Feasibility and Single Parameter Scaling of Extinctions in Multispecies Lotka-Volterra Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multispecies ecosystems modelled by generalized Lotka-Volterra equations exhibit stationary population abundances, where large number of species often coexist. Understanding the precise conditions under which this is at all feasible and what triggers species extinctions is a key, outstanding problem in theoretical ecology. Using standard methods of random matrix theory, I show that distributions of species abundances are Gaussian at equilibrium, in the weakly interacting regime. One consequence is that feasibility is generically broken before stability, for large enough number of species. I further derive an analytic expression for the probability that $n=0,1,2,...$ species go extinct and conjecture that a single-parameter scaling law governs species extinctions. These results are corroborated by numerical simulations in a wide range of system parameters.</description>

      <title>The selective advantage of neighborhood-aware mutants in Moran process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolution occurs in populations of reproducing individuals. In stochastic descriptions of evolutionary dynamics, such as the Moran process, individuals are chosen randomly for birth and for death. If the same type is chosen for both steps, then the reproductive event is wasted, because the composition of the population remains unchanged. Here we introduce a new phenotype, which we call a \textit{replacer}. Replacers are efficient competitors. When a replacer is chosen for reproduction, the offspring will always replace an individual of another type (if available). We determine the selective advantage of replacers in well-mixed populations and on one-dimensional lattices. We find that being a replacer substantially boosts the fixation probability of neutral and deleterious mutants. In particular, fixation probability of a single neutral replacer who invades a well-mixed population of size $N$ is of the order of $1/\sqrt N$ rather than the standard $1/N$. Even more importantly, replacers are much better protected against invasions once they have reached fixation. Therefore, replacers dominate the mutation selection equilibrium even if the phenotype of being a replacer comes at a substantial cost: curiously, for large population size and small mutation rate the relative fitness of a successful replacer can be as low as $1/e$.</description>

      <title>Reproduction Numbers R_0, R_t for COVID-19 Infections with Gaussian Distribution of Generation Times, and of Serial Intervals including Presymptomatic Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Basic and instantaneous reproduction numbers, "R" _"0" and "R" _"t" , are important metrics to assess progress of an epidemic and effectiveness of preventative interventions undertaken, and also to estimate coverage needed for vaccination. Reproduction numbers are related to the daily number of positive cases recorded by the national public health authorities, via the renewal equation. During periods of exponential growth or decay they are linked also to the rate constants by the Lotka-Euler equation. For either application, we need the distribution of generation times between primary and secondary infections. In practice, we use instead the directly observable serial interval between symptoms onset of infector and infectee. Pre-symptomatic transmission that occurs in COVID infection causes serial intervals to extend to negative values, which can be described with a Gaussian distribution. Consistent application of the two approaches requires careful attention to lower limits imposed on the distribution. Allowing Gaussian-distributed serial intervals to extend to minus infinity with the Lotka-Euler equation, as commonly is done, results in lower reproduction numbers than predicted from the discretized renewal equation. Here, we formulate the Lotka-Euler equation for Gaussian distributions including an explicit lower cut-off, and use this to explore the consequences of presymptomatic transmission for COVID-19 infections.</description>

      <title>Which Similarity-Sensitive Entropy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A canonical step in quantifying a system is to measure its entropy. Shannon entropy and other traditional entropy measures capture only the information encoded in the frequencies of a system's elements. Recently, Leinster, Cobbold, and Reeve (LCR) introduced a method that also captures the rich information encoded in the similarities and differences among elements, yielding similarity-sensitive entropy. More recently, the Vendi score (VS) was introduced as an alternative, raising the question of how LCR and VS compare, and which is preferable. Here we address these questions conceptually, analytically, and experimentally, using 53 machine-learning datasets. We show that LCR and VS can differ by orders of magnitude and can capture complementary information about a system, except in limiting cases. We demonstrate that both LCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of ``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an upper bound on LCR for several values of the R\'enyi-Hill order parameter and conjecture that this bound holds for all values. We conclude that VS is preferable only when interpreting elements as linear combinations of a more fundamental set of ``ur-elements'' or when the system or dataset possesses a quantum-mechanical character. In the broader circumstance where one seeks simply to capture the rich information encoded by similarity, LCR is favored; nevertheless, for certain half-distances the two methods can complement each other.</description>

      <title>Convergence-divergence models: Generalizations of phylogenetic trees modeling gene flow over time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees are simple models of evolutionary processes. They describe conditionally independent divergent evolution from common ancestors. However, they often lack the flexibility to represent processes like introgressive hybridization, which leads to gene flow between taxa. Phylogenetic networks generalize trees but typically assume that ancestral taxa merge instantaneously to form ``hybrid'' descendants. In contrast, convergence-divergence models retain a single underlying ``principal tree'' and permit gene flow over arbitrary time frames. They can also model other biological processes leading to taxa becoming more similar, such as replicated evolution. We present novel maximum likelihood algorithms to infer most aspects of $N$-taxon convergence-divergence models - many consistently - using a quartet-based approach. All algorithms use $4$-taxon convergence-divergence models, inferred from subsets of the $N$ taxa using a model selection criterion. The first algorithm infers an $N$-taxon principal tree; the second infers sets of converging taxa; and the third infers model parameters - root probabilities, edge lengths and convergence parameters. The algorithms can be applied to multiple sequence alignments restricted to genes or genomic windows or to gene presence/absence datasets. We demonstrate that convergence-divergence models can be accurately recovered from simulated data.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Inferring Metacommunity Dynamics with Maximum Caliber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major challenge for community ecology is using spatio-temporal data to infer parameters of dynamical models without conducting laborious experiments. We present a novel framework from statistical physics -- Maximum Caliber -- to characterize the temporal dynamics of complex ecological systems in spatially extended landscapes and infer parameters from empirical data. As an extension of Maximum Entropy modeling, Maximum Caliber aims at modeling the probability of possible trajectories of a stochastic system, rather than focusing on system states. We demonstrate the ability of the Maximum Caliber framework to capture ecological processes ranging from near- to far from- equilibrium, using an array of species interaction motifs including random interactions, apparent competition, intraguild predation, and non-transitive competition, along with dispersal among multiple patches. For spatio-temporal data of species occupancy in a metacommunity, the parameters of a Maximum Caliber model can be estimated through a simple logistic regression to reveal migration rates between patches, interactions between species, and local environmental suitabilities. We test the accuracy of the method over a range of system sizes and time periods, and find that these parameters can be estimated without bias. We introduce ``entropy production'' as a measure of irreversibility in system dynamics, and use ``pseudo-$R^2$'' to characterize predictability of future states. We show that our model can predict the dynamics of metacommunities that are far from equilibrium. The capacity to estimate basic parameters of dynamical metacommunity models from spatio-temporal data represents an important breakthrough for the study of metacommunities with application to practical problems in conservation and restoration ecology.</description>
