      <title>Injection process of pickup ion acceleration at an oblique heliospheric termination shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Injection process of pickup ion acceleration at a heliospheric termination shock is investigated. Using two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulation, accelerated pickup ions are self-consistently reproduced by tracking long time evolution of shock with unprecedentedly large system size in the shock normal direction. Reflected pickup ions drive upstream large amplitude waves through resonant instabilities. Convection of the large amplitude waves causes shock surface reformation and alters the downstream electromagnetic structure. A part of pickup ions are accelerated to tens of upstream flow energy in the time scale of $\sim 100$ times inverse ion gyro frequency. The initial acceleration occurs through shock surfing acceleration mechanism followed by shock drift acceleration mechanism. Large electrostatic potential accompanied by the upstream waves enables the shock surfing acceleration to occur.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of generating collisionless shock in magnetized gas plasma driven by laser-ablated target plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanism of generating collisionless shock in magnetized gas plasma driven by laser-ablated target plasma is investigated by using one-dimensional full particle-in-cell simulation. The effect of finite injection time of target plasma, mimicking finite width of laser pulse, is taken into account. It was found that the formation of a seed-shock requires a recursor. The precursor is driven by gyrating ions, and its origin varies depending on the injection time of the target plasma. When the injection time is short, the target plasma entering the gas plasma creates a precursor, otherwise, gas ions reflected by the strong piston effect of the target plasma create a precursor. The precursor compresses the background gas plasma, and subsequently, a compressed seed-shock forms in the gas plasma. The parameter dependence on the formation process and propagation characteristics of the seed-shock was discussed. It was confirmed that the seed-shock propagates through the gas plasma exhibiting behavior similar to the shock front of supercritical shocks.</description>

      <title>Spectrally Accelerated Edge and Scrape-Off Layer Gyrokinetic Turbulence Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first gyrokinetic (GK) simulations of edge and scrape-off layer (SOL) turbulence accelerated by a velocity-space spectral approach in the full-f GK code GENE-X. Building upon the original grid velocity-space discretization, we derive and implement a new spectral formulation and verify the numerical implementation using the method of manufactured solution. We conduct a series of spectral turbulence simulations focusing on the TCV-X21 reference case [Oliveira D. S. et al., Nucl. Fusion 62, 096001 (2022)] and compare these results with previously validated grid simulations [Ulbl P. et al., Phys. Plasmas 30, 107986 (2023)]. The spectral approach reproduces the outboard midplane (OMP) profiles (density, temperature, and radial electric field), dominated by trapped electron mode (TEM) turbulence, with excellent agreement and significantly lower velocity-space resolution. Thus, the spectral approach reduces the computational cost by at least an order of magnitude, achieving a speed-up of approximately 50 for the TCV-X21 case. This enables high-fidelity GK simulations to be performed within a few days on modern CPU-based supercomputers for medium-sized devices and establishes GENE-X as a powerful tool for studying edge and SOL turbulence, moving towards reactor-relevant devices like ITER.</description>

      <title>Integrated Data Analysis and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in nuclear fusion research is the coherent combination of data from heterogeneous diagnostics and modelling codes for machine control and safety as well as physics studies. Measured data from different diagnostics often provide information about the same subset of physical parameters. Additionally, information provided by some diagnostics might be needed for the analysis of other diagnostics. A joint analysis of complementary and redundant data allows, e.g., to improve the reliability of parameter estimation, to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of profiles, to obtain synergistic effects, to consider diagnostics interdependencies and to find and resolve data inconsistencies. Physics-based modelling and parameter relationships provide additional information improving the treatment of ill-posed inversion problems. A coherent combination of all kind of available information within a probabilistic framework allows for improved data analysis results.
  The concept of Integrated Data Analysis (IDA) in the framework of Bayesian probability theory is outlined and contrasted with conventional data analysis. Components of the probabilistic approach are summarized and specific ingredients beneficial for data analysis at fusion devices are discussed.</description>

      <title>Vibrational excitation cross sections for non-equilibrium nitric oxide-containing plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A full set of vibrationally-resolved cross sections for electron impact excitation of NO(X2{\Pi}, v) molecules is calculated from ab initio molecular dynamics, in the framework of the local-complex-potential approach. Electron-vibration energy exchanges in non-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions are studied from a state-to-state model accounting for all electron impact excitation and de-excitation processes of the nitric oxide vibration manifold, and it is shown that the calculated vibration relaxation times are in good agreement with the experimental data. The new vibrational excitation cross sections are used in a complete electron impact cross section set in order to obtain non-equilibrium electron energy distributions functions and to calculate electron transport parameters in NO. It is verified that the new cross sections bring a significant improvement between simulations and experimental swarm data, providing an additional validation of the calculations, when used within the complete set of cross sections investigated in this work.</description>

Abstract: A theoretical investigation of electron-D2 resonant collisions - via the low lying and the Rydberg states of D2- - is presented for vibrational excitation, dissociative electron attachment and dissociative excitation processes by using the local-complex-potential approach. Full sets of vibrationally resolved cross sections, involving the ground electronic state - X 1{\Sigma}+g - and the first two electronic excited states - b 3{\Sigma}+u and B 1{\Sigma}+ u - of the D2 molecule, are given for fusion plasma applications in their technologically relevant partially dissociated, detached divertor regimes. In particular, transitions between electronic excited states are also considered. Comparisons are made with cross sections present in the literature, where available</description>

      <title>Acceleration rate enhancement by negative plasma density gradient in multi-bunch driven plasma wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a plasma wakefield accelerator driven by a train of short particle bunches, it is possible to locally increase the acceleration rate by introducing a small negative gradient of the plasma density. A regime is possible in which the gradient affects only the relative phasing of the driver bunches and the wave, keeping the wave phase behind the driver stable. With this technique, it is possible to increase the energy gain of the accelerated witness bunch in a plasma section of limited length.</description>

      <title>An explicit, energy-conserving particle-in-cell scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an explicit temporal discretization of particle-in-cell schemes for the Vlasov equation that results in exact energy conservation when combined with an appropriate spatial discretization. The scheme is inspired by a simple, second-order explicit scheme that conserves energy exactly in the Eulerian context. We show that direct translation to particle-in-cell does not result in strict conservation, but derive a simple correction based on an analytically solvable optimization problem that recovers conservation. While this optimization problem is not guaranteed to have a real solution for every particle, we provide a correction that makes imaginary values extremely rare and still admits $\mathcal{O}(10^{-12})$ fractional errors in energy for practical simulation parameters. We present the scheme in both electrostatic -- where we use the Amp\`{e}re formulation -- and electromagnetic contexts. With an electromagnetic field solve, the field update is most naturally linearly implicit, but the more computationally intensive particle update remains fully explicit. We also show how the scheme can be extended to use the fully explicit leapfrog and pseudospectral analytic time-domain (PSATD) field solvers. The scheme is tested on standard kinetic plasma problems, confirming its conservation properties.</description>

      <title>Analytical and numerical study of plane-progressive thermoacoustic shock waves in complex plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.00896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of thermoacoustic shocks is studied in a fluid complex plasma. The thermoacoustic wave mode can be damped (or anti-damped) when the contribution from the thermoacoustic interaction is lower (or higher) than that due to the particle collision and/or the kinematic viscosity. In the nonlinear regime, the thermoacoustic wave, propagating with the acoustic speed, can evolve into small amplitude shocks whose dynamics are governed by the Bateman-Burgers equation with an additional nonlinear term that appears due to the particle collision and nonreciprocal interactions of charged particles providing the thermal feedback. The appearance of such nonlinearity can cause the shock fronts to be stable (or unstable) depending on the collision frequency remains below (or above) a critical value and the thermal feedback is positive. The existence of different kinds of shocks and their characteristics are analyzed analytically and numerically with the system parameters that characterize the thermal feedback, thermal diffusion, heat capacity per fluid particle, the particle collision and the fluid viscosity. A good agreement between analytical and numerical results is also noticed.</description>

      <title>Preservation of $^3\mkern-2mu$He ion polarization after laser-plasma acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The preservation of nuclear spin alignment in plasmas is a prerequisite for important applications, such as energy production through polarized fusion or the acceleration of polarized particle beams. Although this conservation property has been the basis of numerous theoretical papers, it has never been experimentally confirmed. Here, we report on first experimental data from a polarized $^3\mkern-2mu$He target heated by a PW laser pulse, showing evidence for persistence of the nuclear polarization after acceleration to MeV energies. The finding also validates the concept of using pre-polarized targets for experiments at high-power laser facilities.</description>

      <title>Plasma screening in mid-charged ions observed by K-shell line emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense plasma environment affects the electronic structure of ions via variations of the microscopic electrical fields, also known as plasma screening. This effect can be either estimated by simplified analytical models, or by computationally expensive and to date unverified numerical calculations. We have experimentally quantified plasma screening from the energy shifts of the bound-bound transitions in matter driven by the x-ray free electron laser (XFEL). This was enabled by identification of detailed electronic configurations of the observed K{\alpha}, K\b{eta} and K{\gamma} lines. This work paves the way for improving plasma screening models including connected effects like ionization potential depression and continuum lowering, which will advance the understanding of atomic physics in Warm Dense Matter regime.</description>
