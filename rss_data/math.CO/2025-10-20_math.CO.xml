      <title>Evaluating Six Ap\'ery-like Series of Weight $5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to evaluate six new Ap\'ery-like series of weight $5$ in closed form. These series involve harmonic numbers and exhibit the characteristic reciprocal central binomial coefficient structure. Generating functions for the inverse sine and identities related to harmonic numbers are used to link each series to a variety of integrals containing $\ln \left(\sin \left(x\right)\right)$ and $\ln \left(\cos \left(x\right)\right)$, which are evaluated using a range of methods and identities.</description>

      <title>(Treewidth, Clique)-Boundedness and Poly-logarithmic Tree-Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An {\em independent set} in a graph $G$ is a set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices. A {\em tree decomposition} of $G$ is a pair $(T, \chi)$ where $T$ is a tree and $\chi : V(T) \rightarrow 2^{V(G)}$ is a function satisfying the following two axioms: for every edge $uv \in V(G)$ there is a $x \in V(T)$ such that $\{u,v\} \subseteq \chi(x)$, and for every vertex $u \in V(G)$ the set $\{x \in V(T) ~:~ u \in \chi(X)\}$ induces a non-empty and connected subtree of $T$. The sets $\chi(x)$ for $x \in V(T)$ are called the {\em bags} of the tree decomposition. The {\em tree-independence} number of $G$ is the minimum taken over all tree decompositions of $G$ of the size of the maximum independent set of the graph induced by a bag of the tree decomposition.
  The study of graph classes with bounded tree-independence number has attracted much attention in recent years, in part due its improtant algorithmic implications. A conjecture of Dallard, Milani\v{c} and Storgel, connecting tree-independence number to the classical notion of treewidth, was one of the motivating problems in the area. This conjecture was recently disproved, but here we prove a slight variant of it, that retains much of the algorithmic significance. As part of the proof we introduce the notion of {\em independence-containers}, which can be viewed as a generalization of the set of all maximal cliques of a graph, and is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Stem-Symmetry, Comb Products, and their Relation to Amoeba Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local and global amoebas are families of labeled graphs that satisfy interpolation properties on a fixed vertex set. A labeled graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is a local amoeba (resp. global amoeba) if there exists a sequence of feasible edge-replacements between any two labelled embeddings of $G$ into $K_n$ (resp. $K_{n+1}$). Here, a feasible edge-replacement removes an edge and reinserts it so that the resulting graph is isomorphic to $G$; the induced relabeling yields a class of permutations of the label set. Motivated by classical group theoretic ideas, we introduce the hang group, a new invariant that can encode how local amoebas embed into larger ones. Using this framework, we identify necessary and sufficient conditions connecting stem-symmetric and hang-symmetric graphs with local and global amoebas. In particular, we show how hang-symmetry and stem-symmetry conditions propagate under the addition of leaves and isolated vertices, in turn yielding constructive criteria for both local and global amoebas. Finally, via wreath products, we provide four sets of sufficient conditions, one for each property, guaranteeing when the comb product is a local amoeba, a global amoeba, stem-symmetric, or hang-symmetric. These results strengthen and generalize existing constructions of local and global amoebas.</description>

      <title>On Grundy indices for complete geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pseudo-Grundy index of a graph is the largest number of colors that can be assigned to its edges, such that for every pair of colors $i,j$, if $i &lt; j$ then every edge colored with color $j$ is adjacent to at least one edge colored with color $i$. This index has been widely studied. A geometric graph is a graph drawn in the plane such that its vertices are points in general position, and its edges are straight-line segments. In this paper, we extend the notion of pseudo-Grundy index for geometric graphs, and present results for complete geometric graphs.</description>

      <title>Residue Formulae for the Trace on Affine Hecke Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in Catalan combinatorics, we study special values of the standard trace on affine Hecke algebras. Starting from a generating function for this trace calculated by Opdam, we use the theory of Szenes and Vergne to obtain residue formulae for the trace. This allows us to derive a product formula for the trace of translation elements corresponding to weights in certain ``Big Chambers'' of the positive root cone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a module-theoretic approach and a linear-programming method to compute the matricial dimension of numerical semigroups. We use these to compute the matricial dimension of every numerical semigroup with Frobenius number at most $10$ or genus at most $6$. Many of these evaluations were beyond the scope of previous techniques.</description>

      <title>A quasi-polynomial bound for the minimal excluded minors for a surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of their graph minor project, Robertson and Seymour showed in 1990 that the class of graphs that can be embedded in a given surface can be characterized by a finite set of minimal excluded minors. However, their proof, because existential, does not provide any information on these excluded minors. Seymour proved in 1993 the first and, until now, only known upper bound on the order of the minimal excluded minors for a given surface. This bound is double exponential in the Euler genus $g$ of the surface and, therefore, very far from the $\Omega(g)$ lower bound on the maximal order of minimal excluded minors for a surface and most likely far from the best possible bound. More than thirty years later, this paper finally makes progress in lowering this bound to a quasi-polynomial in the Euler genus of the surface.
  The main catalyzer to reach a quasi-polynomial bound is a breakthrough on the characteristic size of a forbidden structure for a minimal excluded minor $G$ for a surface of Euler genus $g$: although it is not hard to show that $G$ does not contain $O(g)$ disjoint cycles that are contractible and nested in some embedding of $G$ as demonstrated by Seymour, this bound can be lowered to $O(\log g)$ which is essential to obtain the quasi-polynomial bound in this paper.
  As subsidiary results, we also improve the current bound on the treewidth of a minimal excluded minor $G$ for a surface by improving the first and, until now, only known bound provided by Seymour.</description>

      <title>Orbits and self-twuality in set systems and delta-matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new group action on set systems, constructed as a semidirect product of a permutation group and a group generated by twist and loop complementation operations on a single element. This action extends the ribbon group framework of Abrams and Ellis-Monaghan from ribbon graphs to set systems, facilitating a systematic investigation of self-twuality. We prove that different forms of self-twuality propagate through orbits under the group action and establish a characterization of the orbit of a vf-safe delta-matroid via multimatroids. As an application, we analyze orbits of ribbon-graphic delta-matroids. Our work answers a question posed by Abrams and Ellis-Monaghan and provides a unified algebraic framework for studying self-twuality in combinatorial structures.</description>

      <title>5-Coloring Planar Graphs with a Color Class of Order at Most $|V|/6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any planar graph $G=(V,E)$ has a 5-coloring such that one color class contains at most $|V|/6$ vertices. In other words, there exists a partition of $V$ into five independent sets $\{V_1, \cdots, V_5\}$ such that $|V_5| \leq |V| / 6$. Our proof yields an $O(|V|^2)$-time algorithm to find such a partition, and unlike the Four Color Theorem, our proof is fully verifiable without computer assistance.</description>

      <title>A note on lower bounds for arithmetic regularity partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes lower bounds for two kinds of arithmetic regularity partitions, building on constructions of Green [arXiv:math/0310476v2] and Hosseini, Lovett, Moshkovitz, and Shapira [arXiv:1405.4409]. The first kind occurs in the so-called strong arithmetic regularity lemma due to Bhattcharrya, Fischer, and Lovett [arXiv:1201.0330v2, Theorem 4.9], which is an arithmetic analogue of the strong regularity lemma for graphs developed by Alon, Fischer, Krivelevich, and Szegedy. Conlon and Fox [arXiv:1107.4829], as well as Kalyanasundaram and Shapira [arXiv:1107.4896v2], demonstrated that there are graphs for which any strong regularity partition must have size at least a wowzer-type function in the pseudorandomness parameter, and the primary aim of this paper is to match this bound in the setting of vector spaces over finite fields. The second kind of arithmetic regularity partition originates from higher-order arithmetic regularity lemmas. The upper bounds on the size of these partitions are known to be of tower-type growth. Previous work [arXiv:math/0310476v2, arXiv:1405.4409] demonstrated that this is unavoidable for the `linear' arithmetic regularity lemma of Green [arXiv:math/0310476v2], and the second contribution of this paper confirms that this continues to be necessary in the higher-order setting.</description>

      <title>Vu's conjecture holds for claw-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, let $\Delta_2(G)$ denote the maximum number of neighbors any two distinct vertices of $G$ have in common. Vu (2002) proposed that, provided $\Delta_2(G)$ is not too small as a proportion of the maximum degree $\Delta(G)$ of $G$, the chromatic number of $G$ should never be too much larger than $\Delta_2(G)$. We make a first approach towards Vu's conjecture from a structural graph theoretic point of view. We prove that, in the case where $G$ is claw-free, indeed the chromatic number of $G$ is at most $\Delta_2(G)+3$. This is tight, as our bound is met with equality for the line graph of the Petersen graph. Moreover, we can prove this in terms of the more specific parameter that bounds the maximum number of neighbors any two endpoints of some edge of $G$ have in common. Our result may be viewed as a generalization of the classic bound of Vizing (1964) for edge-coloring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15677v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite set $X$ in a Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ is called Ramsey if for every $k$ there exists an integer $n$ such that whenever $\mathbb{R}^n$ is coloured with $k$ colours, there is a monochromatic copy of $X$. Graham conjectured that all spherical sets are Ramsey, but progress on this conjecture has been slow. A key result of K\v{r}\'{i}\v{z} is that all sets that embed in sets that are acted on transitively by a soluble group are Ramsey. We show that for nearly all known examples of Ramsey sets the converse is true, with only two possible exceptions.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem for the sine-$\beta$ point process at $\beta \le 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish the analogue of the Soshnikov Central Limit Theorem for the sine-$\beta$ process at $\beta \le 2$. We consider regularized additive functionals, which correspond to 1-Sobolev regular functions $f(x/R)$, in the limit $R\to\infty$. Their convergence to the Gaussian distribution with respect to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric at the rate $(\ln R)^{-1/2}$ is established.
  The proof is based on the convergence of the circular $\beta$-ensemble to the sine-$\beta$ process, which was shown by Killip and Stoiciu. We find a convenient bound for the Laplace transforms of additive functionals under the circular $\beta$-ensemble, which holds under the scaling limit, suggested by Killip and Stoiciu. Further, we show that the additive functionals under the circular $\beta$-ensemble with $n$ particles converge to the gaussian distribution as $n\to\infty$ for all $1/2$-Sobolev regular functions for $\beta\le 2$, as was conjectured by Lambert.
  Finally, in order to prove the limit theorem for the circular $\beta$-ensemble we derive the connection between expectations of multiplicative functionals and the Jack measures, which generalizes the connection between the circular unitary ensemble and the Schur measures given by Gessel's theorem.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of Graphs of Limit Functions Generated by Quasi-Linear Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The limit functions generated by quasi-linear functions or sequences (including the sum of the Rudin-Shapiro sequence as an example) are continuous but almost everywhere non-differentiable functions. Their graphs are fractal curves. In 2017 and 2020, Chen, L\"u, Wen and the first author studied the box dimension of the graphs of the limit functions.
  In this paper, we focus on the Hausdorff dimension of the graphs of such limit functions. We first prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of the limit function generated by the abelian complexity of the Rudin-Shapiro sequence is $\frac{3}{2}$. Then we extend the result to the graphs of limit functions generated by quasi-linear functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a question of Erd\H{o}s on blocking sets in a projective plane that intersect every line only a few times, several authors have used unions of algebraic curves to construct such sets in $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{F}_q)$. In this paper, we provide new constructions of blocking sets in $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ from a union of geometrically irreducible curves of a fixed degree $d$. We also establish lower bounds on the number of such curves required to form a blocking set. Our proofs combine tools from arithmetic geometry and combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Hodge Laplacians on Weighted Simplicial Complexes: Forms, Closures, and Essential Self-Adjointness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish explicit operator norm bounds and essential self-adjointness criteria for discrete Hodge Laplacians on weighted graphs and simplicial complexes. For unweighted $d$-regular graphs we prove the universal estimate $\|\widetilde{\Delta}_{1,*}\|\le 4(d-1)$, and we provide weighted extensions with a sharp comparability constant. These bounds apply without geometric completeness or curvature assumptions and ensure essential self-adjointness on natural cores. The approach extends to higher degrees via dual up/down degrees, and we show a unitary equivalence between skew and symmetric models on colorable complexes. For periodic lattices we complement the universal bounds with exact Floquet--Bloch constants, typically of order $2d$, illustrating both the sharpness in growth and the generality of our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we will be studying the parameter space for the quantum multiplication for hypertoric varieties. The operation of quantum multiplication for hypertoric varieties has an explicit formulation which is given by McBreen and Shenfeld. In particular, this multiplication depends on a parameter which lives in the complement of a toric arrangement. Following a paper of deConcini and Gaiffi, I will define a compactification of this parameter space and show how the quantum multiplication can be extended to this compactification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $T$ be the triangle in the plane with vertices $(0, 0)$, $(0,1)$ and $(0, 1)$. The convex hull $T_n$ of points $(0, 1)$, $(1, 0)$ and $n$ independent random points uniformly distributed in $T$ is the random convex chain. In this paper we study the moments of the volume of random polytope $T_n$ and derive exact formulas for $k$-th moments for any integer $k\ge 0$. As an intermediate result, we find an explicit representation for the probability generating function of the number of vertices of $T_n$, from which an alternative formula for the probability that $T_n$ has $k$ vertices follows.</description>

Abstract: We prove that there is a function $f$ such that every graph with no $K$-fat $K_4$ minor is $f(K)$-quasi-isometric to a graph with no $K_4$ minor. This solves the $K_4$-case of a general conjecture of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu. Our proof technique also yields a new short proof of the respective $K_4^-$-case, which was first established by Fujiwara and Papasoglu.</description>

      <title>Partitions of Graphs into Special Bipartite Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of partitioning the edge set of the complete graph into bipartite subgraphs under certain constraints defined by forbidden subgraphs. These constraints lead to both classical problems, such as partitioning into independent matchings or complete bipartite subgraphs, and novel variants motivated by structural restrictions. Our theoretical framework is inspired by clustering problems in real-world transaction graphs, which can be formulated naturally as edge partitioning problems under bipartite graph constraints.
  The main result of this paper is the proof of the bounds for $\chi'_{2K_2}(n)$, which corresponds to the minimum number of induced $2K_2$-free bipartite subgraphs needed to partition the edges of $K_n$. In addition to this central result, we also present several similar bounds for other forbidden subgraphs on three or four vertices. Some are included primarily for the sake of completeness, to demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach, and some lead to other novel or well-known graph theoretical problems.</description>

      <title>Introducing irrational enumeration: analytic combinatorics for objects of irrational size</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the scope of analytic combinatorics to classes containing objects that have irrational sizes. The generating function for such a class is a power series that admits irrational exponents (which we call a Ribenboim series). A transformation then yields a generalised Dirichlet series from which the asymptotics of the coefficients can be extracted by singularity analysis using an appropriate Tauberian theorem. In practice, the asymptotics can often be determined directly from the original generating function. We illustrate the technique with a variety of applications, including tilings with tiles of irrational area, ordered integer factorizations, lattice walks enumerated by Euclidean length, and plane trees with vertices of irrational size. We also explore phase transitions in the asymptotics of families of irrational combinatorial classes.</description>

Abstract: Let $f(m,n)$ be the number of primitive lattice triangulations of an $m \times n$ rectangle. We express the limits $\lim_n f(m,n)^{1/n}$ for $m = 4$ and $m=5$ in terms of certain systems of Fredholm integral equations on generating functions (the case $m\le3$ was treated in a previous paper). Solving these equations numerically, we compute approximate values of these limits with a rather high precision.</description>

Abstract: A subset of vertices is called a dissociation set if it induces a subgraph with vertex degree at most one. Recently, Yuan et al. established the upper bound of the maximum number of dissociation sets among all connected graphs of order n and characterized the corresponding extremal graphs.They also proposed a question regarding the second-largest number of dissociation sets among all connected graphs of order n and the corresponding extremal graphs. In this paper, we give a positive answer to this question.</description>

Shallit and Shur, as well as Ollinger and Shallit, showed that there are Rote words that avoid $(5/2)^+$-powers and that this is best possible. In this note we give a structure theorem for the Rote words that avoid $(5/2)^+$-powers, confirming a conjecture of Ollinger and Shallit.</description>

      <title>Newton numbers, vanishing polytopes and algebraic degrees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a polynomial $f$ with a convenient Newton polytope $P$ and generic complex coefficients. By the global version of the Kouchnirenko formula, the hypersurface $\{f = 0\} \subset \mathbb{C}^n$ has the homotopy type of a bouquet of $(n-1)$-spheres, and the number of spheres is given by a certain alternating sum of volumes, called the Newton number $\nu(P)$. Using the Furukawa-Ito classification of dual defective sets, we classify convenient Newton polytopes with vanishing Newton numbers as certain Cayley sums called $B_k$-polytopes. These $B_k$-polytopes generalize the $B_1$- and $B_2$-facets appearing in the local monodromy conjecture in the Newton non-degenerate case. Our classification provides a partial solution to Arnold's monotonicity problem.
  The local $h^*$-polynomial (or $\ell^*$-polynomial) is a natural invariant of lattice polytopes that refines the $h^*$-polynomial coming from Ehrhart theory. We obtain decomposition formulas for the Newton number, for instance, prove the inequality $\nu(P) \ge \ell^*(P;1)$. The $B_k$-polytopes are non-trivial examples of thin polytopes.
  We generalize the Newton number in two independent ways: the $\ell$-Newton number and the $e$-Newton number. The $\ell$-Newton number comes from Ehrhart theory, namely, from certain generalizations of Katz-Stapledon decomposition formulas, and its properties are central to our proof that the $B_k$-polytopes are thin. The $e$-Newton number is the number of points of zero-dimensional critical complete intersections. Vanishing of the $e$-Newton number characterizes dual defective sets. Furthermore, the $e$-Newton number calculates algebraic degrees (such as Maximum Likelihood, Euclidean Distance and Polar degrees). For instance, we show that all known formulas for these algebraic degrees in the Newton non-degenerate case are implied by basic properties of the $e$-Newton number.</description>

      <title>The Szemer\'edi-Trotter theorem over arbitrary field of characteristic zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a set of $m$ points and $\mathcal{L}$ a set of $n$ lines in $K^2$, where $K$ is a field with char$(K)=0$. We prove the incidence bound $$\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{L})=O(m^{2/3}n^{2/3}+m+n).$$ Moreover, this bound is sharp and cannot be improved. This resolves the Szemer\'edi-Trotter incidence problem for arbitrary field of characteristic zero.
  The key tool of our proof is the Baby Lefschetz principle, which allows us to reduce the problem to the complex case. Based on this observation, we further derive several related results over $K$, including Beck's theorem, the Erd\H{o}s-Szemer\'edi sum-product estimate, and incidence theorems involving more general algebraic objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper we compute Alexander polynomials for certain classes of conic-line arrangements in the complex projective plane which are related to pencils. We prove two general results for curve arrangements coming from Halphen pencils of index $k\geq 2$. Then we apply them to the Hesse arrangement of conics and to some of its degenerations. The results are completed by computations using computer algebra. In particular, we construct conic-line arrangements which are non-reduced pencil-type arrangements and have as roots of their Alexander polynomials roots of unity of order 7. Such roots are not known and are conjectured not to exist in the class of line arrangements.</description>

      <title>Random regular graph states are complex at almost any depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph states are fundamental objects in the theory of quantum information due to their simple classical description and rich entanglement structure. They are also intimately related to IQP circuits, which have applications in quantum pseudorandomness and quantum advantage. For us, they are a toy model to understand the relation between circuit connectivity, entanglement structure and computational complexity. In the worst case, a strict dichotomy in the computational universality of such graph states appears as a function of the degree $d$ of a regular graph state [GDH+23]. In this paper, we study the average-case complexity of simulating random graph states of varying degree when measured in random product bases and give distinct evidence that a similar complexity-theoretic dichotomy exists in the average case. Specifically, we consider random $d$-regular graph states and prove three distinct results: First, we exhibit two families of IQP circuits of depth $d$ and show that they anticoncentrate for any $2 &lt; d = o(n^{1/2})$ when measured in a random $X$-$Y$-plane product basis. This implies anticoncentration for random constant-regular graph states. Second, in the regime $d = \Theta(n^c)$ with $c \in (0,1)$, we prove that random $d$-regular graph states contain polynomially large grid graphs as induced subgraphs with high probability. This implies that they are universal resource states for measurement-based computation. Third, in the regime of high degree ($d\sim n/2$), we show that random graph states are not sufficiently entangled to be trivially classically simulable, unlike Haar random states. Proving the three results requires different techniques -- the analysis of a classical statistical-mechanics model using Krawtchouck polynomials, graph theoretic analysis using the switching method, and analysis of the ranks of submatrices of random adjacency matrices, respectively.</description>

      <title>Complexity of the Zero Set of a Matrix Schubert Ideal</title>

Abstract: $T$-varieties are normal varieties equipped with an action of an algebraic torus $T$. When the action is effective, the complexity of a $T$-variety $X$ is $\dim(X)-\dim(T)$. Matrix Schubert varieties, introduced by Fulton in 1992, are $T$-varieties consisting of $n \times n$ matrices satisfying certain constraints on the ranks of their submatrices. In this paper, we focus on the complexity of certain torus-fixed affine subvarieties of matrix Schubert varieties. Concretely, given a matrix Schubert variety $\overline{X_{w}}$ where $w\in S_n$, we study the complexity of $Y_w$ obtained by the decomposition $\overline{X_{w}} = Y_{w} \times \mathbb{C}^{k}$ with $k$ as large as possible. Building up from results by Escobar and M\'{e}sz\'{a}ros and Donten-Bury, Escobar, and Portakal, we show that for a fixed $n$, the complexity of $Y_{w}$ with respect to this action can be any integer between $0$ and $(n-1)(n-3)$, except $1$.</description>

      <title>An efficient algorithm for $\mathcal{F}$-subgraph-free Edge Deletion on graphs having a product structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a family $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs, a graph is \emph{$\mathcal{F}$-subgraph-free} if it has no subgraph isomorphic to a member of $\mathcal{F}$. We present a fixed-parameter linear-time algorithm that decides whether a planar graph can be made $\mathcal{F}$-subgraph-free by deleting at most $k$ vertices or $k$ edges, where the parameters are $k$, $\lvert \mathcal{F} \rvert$, and the maximum number of vertices in a member of $\mathcal{F}$. The running time of our algorithm is double-exponential in the parameters, which is faster than the algorithm obtained by applying the first-order model checking result for graphs of bounded twin-width.
  To obtain this result, we develop a unified framework for designing algorithms for this problem on graphs with a ``product structure.'' Using this framework, we also design algorithms for other graph classes that generalize planar graphs. Specifically, the problem admits a fixed-parameter linear time algorithm on disk graphs of bounded local radius, and a fixed-parameter almost-linear time algorithm on graphs of bounded genus.
  Finally, we show that our result gives a tight fixed-parameter algorithm in the following sense: Even when $\mathcal{F}$ consists of a single graph $F$ and the input is restricted to planar graphs, it is unlikely to drop any parameters $k$ and $\lvert V(F) \rvert$ while preserving fixed-parameter tractability, unless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis fails.</description>
