      <title>When the conformal dimension of a self-affine sponge of Lalley-Gatzouras type is zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that if a metric space is uniformly disconnected, then its conformal dimension is zero. First, we characterize when a self-affine sponge of Lalley-Gatzouras type is uniformly disconnected. Thanks to this characterization, we show that a self-affine sponge of Lalley-Gatzouras type has conformal dimension zero if and only if it is uniformly disconnected.</description>

      <title>Minimizing point configurations for tensor product energies on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study point configurations on the torus $\mathbb T^d$ that minimize interaction energies with tensor product structure which arise naturally in the context of discrepancy theory and quasi-Monte Carlo integration. Permutation sets on $\mathbb T^2$ and Latin hypercube sets in higher dimensions (i.e. sets whose projections onto coordinate axes are equispaced points) are natural candidates to be energy minimizers. We show that such point configurations that have only one distance in the vector sense minimize the energy for a wide range of potentials, in other words, such sets satisfy a tensor product version of universal optimality. This applies, in particular, to three- and five-point Fibonacci lattices. We also characterize all lattices with this property and exhibit some non-lattice sets of this type. In addition, we obtain several further structural results about global and local minimizers of tensor product energies.</description>

      <title>Localization of valuations and Alesker's irreducibility theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of Alesker's Irreducibility Theorem. We first introduce a new localization technique for polynomial valuations on convex bodies, which we use to independently prove that smooth and translation invariant valuations are representable by integration with respect to the normal cycle. This allows us to reduce the statement to a corresponding result for the representation of $\mathfrak{sl}(n)$ on the space of these differential forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We completely classify the bijections of the Thurston geometries that preserve geodesics as sets. For Riemannian manifolds that satisfy a certain technical condition, we prove that a totally geodesic subset is a submanifold. We also classify the geodesic-preserving bijections of the Euclidean cylinder $\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{R}$ and the bijections of the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$ that preserve constant curvature curves.</description>

      <title>Covering large-dimensional Euclidean spaces by random translates of a given convex body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the minimum density of a covering of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by Euclidean unit balls as $n\to\infty$ is a major open problem, with the best known results being the lower bound of $\left(\mathrm{e}^{-3/2}+o(1)\right)n$ by Coxeter, Few and Rogers [Mathematika 6, 1959] and the upper bound of $\left(1/2+o(1) \right)n \ln n$ by Dumer [Discrete Comput. Geom. 38, 2007].
  We prove that there are ball coverings of $\mathbb{R}^n$ attaining the asymptotically best known density $\left(1/2+o(1) \right)n \ln n$ such that, additionally, every point of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is covered at most $\left(1.79556... + o(1)\right) n \ln n$ times. This strengthens the result of Erd\H{o}s and Rogers [Acta Arith. 7, 1961/62] who had the maximum multiplicity at most $\left(\mathrm{e} + o(1)\right) n \ln n$.
  On the other hand, we show that the method that was used for the best known ball coverings (when one takes a random subset of centres in a fundamental domain of a suitable lattice in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and extends this periodically) fails to work if the density is less than $(1/2+o(1))n\ln n$; in fact, this result remains true if we replace the ball by any convex body $K$. Also, we observe that a ``worst'' convex body $K$ here is a cube, for which the packing density coming from random constructions is only $(1+o(1))n\ln n$.</description>

      <title>Shortcut Laakso spaces, pure PI unrectifiability and differentiability of Lipschitz functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of purely PI unrectifiable Lipschitz differentiability spaces and investigate the possible of Banach spaces targets for which Lipschitz differentiability holds. We provide a general investigation into the geometry of \emph{shortcut} metric spaces and characterise when such spaces are PI rectifiable, and when they are $Y$-LDS, for a given $Y$. The family of spaces arises as an example of our characterisations. Indeed, we show that Laakso spaces satisfy the required hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Recognition of near-duplicate periodic patterns by continuous metrics with approximation guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15298v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper rigorously solves the challenging problem of recognizing periodic patterns under rigid motion in Euclidean geometry. The 3-dimensional case is practically important for justifying the novelty of solid crystalline materials (periodic crystals) and for patenting medical drugs in a solid tablet form. Past descriptors based on finite subsets fail when a unit cell of a periodic pattern discontinuously changes under almost any perturbation of atoms, which is inevitable due to noise and atomic vibrations. The major problem is not only to find complete invariants (descriptors with no false negatives and no false positives for all periodic patterns) but to design efficient algorithms for distance metrics on these invariants that should continuously behave under noise. The proposed continuous metrics solve this problem in any Euclidean dimension and are algorithmically approximated with small error factors in times that are explicitly bounded in the size and complexity of a given pattern. The proved Lipschitz continuity allows us to confirm all near-duplicates filtered by simpler invariants in major databases of experimental and simulated crystals. This practical detection of noisy duplicates will stop the artificial generation of `new' materials from slight perturbations of known crystals. Several such duplicates are under investigation by five journals for data integrity.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Reverse Isoperimetric Inequalities for Log-concave Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05712v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rogers-Shephard and Zhang's projection inequalities are two reverse, affine isoperimetric-type inequalities for convex bodies. Following a classical work by Schneider, both inequalities have been extended to the so-called $m$th-order setting. In this work, we establish the $m$th-order analogues for these inequalities in the setting of log-concave functions. Our proof of the functional Zhang's projection inequality employs properties of the asymmetric LYZ body, significantly streamlining the argument and producing a novel approach for the case $m=1$. Furthermore, we introduce and analyze the radial mean bodies of a log-concave function, thereby providing a functional generalization of Gardner and Zhang's radial mean bodies. These are new even in the case $m=1$. Our development leverages an extension of Ball bodies, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Large Set Threshold for Oertel's Conjecture on the Mixed-Integer Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1960, Gr\"{u}nbaum proved that for any convex body $C\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ and every halfspace $H$ containing the centroid of $C$, one has that the volume of $H\cap C$ is at least a $\frac{1}{e}$-fraction of the volume of $C$. Recently, in 2014, Oertel conjectured that a similar result holds for mixed-integer convex sets. Concretely, he proposed that for any convex body $C\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+d}$, there should exist a point $\mathbf{x} \in S=C\cap(\mathbb{Z}^{n}\times\mathbb{R}^d)$ such that for every halfspace $H$ containing $\mathbf{x}$, one has that
  \[
  \mathcal{H}_d(H\cap S) \geq \frac{1}{2^n}\frac{1}{e}\mathcal{H}_d(S),
  \]
  where $\mathcal{H}_d$ denotes the $d$-dimensional Hausdorff measure. While the conjecture remains open, Basu and Oertel proved in 2017 that the above inequality holds true for sufficiently large sets, in terms of a measure known as the \emph{lattice width} of a set. In this work, by following a geometric approach, we improve this result by substantially reducing the threshold at which a set can be considered large. We reduce this threshold from an exponential to a polynomial dependency on the dimension, therefore significantly enlarging the family of mixed-integer convex sets over which Oertel's conjecture holds true.</description>

      <title>On a generalization of Godbersen's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-standing Godbersen's conjecture asserts that the Rogers-Shephard inequality for the volume of the difference body is refined by an inequality for the mixed volume of a convex body and its reflection about the origin. The conjecture is known in several special cases, notably for anti-blocking convex bodies. In this note, we propose a generalization of Godbersen's conjecture that refines Schneider's generalization of the Rogers-Shephard inequality to higher-order difference bodies and prove our conjecture for anti-blocking convex bodies. Moreover, we relate the conjectured inequality to the higher-rank mixed volume defined by the author and Wannerer which leads to an equivalent formulation in terms of the Alesker product of smooth, translation invariant valuations.</description>

Abstract: We prove matching asymptotic lower and upper bounds on the variances of the intrinsic volumes and the number of $k$-faces of $d$-dimensional random beta-polytopes. Using Stein's methods, we establish central limit theorems for the intrinsic volumes. We also prove asymptotic upper bounds on the variances of the volume and vertex number of spherical random polytopes in spherical convex bodies, and hyperbolic random polytopes in convex bodies in hyperbolic space. Moreover, we consider a circumscribed model on the sphere.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a nonempty finite subset of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^k$ $(k\ge 2)$. We prove that if a function $f\colon \mathbb{R}^k\to \mathbb{C}$ is such that the sum of $f$ on every congruent copy of $K$ is zero, then $f$ vanishes everywhere. In fact, a stronger, weighted version is proved. As a corollary we find that every finite subset $K$ of $\mathbb{R}^k$ having at least two elements is a Jackson set; that is, no subset of $\mathbb{R}^k$ intersects every congruent copy of $K$ in exactly one point.</description>

      <title>Applications of the Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence: Lipschitz functions with converging Clarke subdifferentials and convergence of sets defined by converging equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we investigate some applications of the Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of closed sets in analysis that are motivated also by questions from singularity theory. First, we generalise to Lipschitz functions the classical theorem stating that given a sequence of smooth functions with locally uniformly convergent derivatives, we obtain the local uniform convergence of the functions themselves (provided they were convergent at one point). We use Clarke subdifferentials instead of derivative and Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of their graphs instead of local uniform convergence. Next we focus on reverse theorem. We show that Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of closed nonempty sets implies convergence of distance functions and Clark subdifferentials of squared distance functions, but does not imply convergence of Clark subdifferentials of distance functions. Finally we turn to the study of the behaviour of the fibres of a given function. We prove some general real counterparts of the Hurwitz theorem from complex analysis stating that the local uniform convergence of holomorphic functions implies the convergence of their sets of zeros. From the point of view of singularity theory our two theorems concern the convergence of the sets when their descriptions are convergent. They are also of interest in approximation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01047v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct infinitely many examples of macroscopically large manifolds of dimension $m \geq 4$ equipped with circle bundles whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature and have macroscopic dimension at most $\lceil m/2 \rceil + 1$. In particular, we answer a question of Gromov on the existence of circle bundles over enlargeable manifolds whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature, in all dimensions. Our constructions are based on techniques from symplectic geometry.</description>
