      <title>Refractive Index Engineering: Insights from Biological Systems for Advanced Optical Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review explores the innovative design to achieve advanced optical functions in natural materials and intricate optical systems inspired by the unique refractive index profiles found in nature. By understanding the physical principles behind biological structures, we can develop materials with tailored optical properties that mimic these natural systems. One key area discussed is biomimetic materials design, where biological systems such as apple skin and the vision system inspire new materials. Another focus is on intricate optical systems based on refractive index contrast. These principles can be extended to design devices like waveguides, photonic crystals, and metamaterials, which manipulate light in novel ways. Additionally, the review covers optical scattering engineering, which is crucial for biomedical imaging. By adjusting the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index, we can control how much light is scattered and absorbed by tissues. This is particularly important for techniques like optical coherence tomography and multiphoton microscopy, where tailored scattering properties can improve imaging depth and resolution. The review also discusses various techniques for measuring the refractive index of biological tissues which provide comprehensive insights into the optical properties of biological materials, facilitating the development of advanced biomimetic designs. In conclusion, the manipulation of refractive index profiles in biological systems offers exciting opportunities for technological advancements. By drawing inspiration from nature and understanding the underlying physical principles, we can create materials and devices with enhanced performance and new functionalities. Future research should focus on further exploring these principles and translating them into practical applications to address real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>Invention, Innovation, and Commercialisation in British Biophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: British biophysics has a rich tradition of scientific invention and innovation, on several occasions resulting in new technologies which have transformed biological insight, such as rapid DNA sequencing, high-precision super-resolution and label-free microscopy hardware, new approaches for high-throughput and single-molecule bio-sensing, and the development of a range of de novo bio-inspired synthetic materials. Some of these advances have been established through democratised, open-source platforms and many have biomedical success, a key example involving the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, three UK labs made crucial contributions in revealing how the spike protein targets human cells, and how therapies such as vaccines and neutralizing nanobodies likely work, enabled in large part through the biophysical technological innovations of cryo-electron microscopy. In this review, we discuss leading-edge technological and methodological innovations which resulted from initial outcomes of discovery-led 'Physics of Life' (PoL) research (capturing biophysics, biological physics and multiple blends of physical-life sciences interdisciplinary research in the UK) and which have matured into wider-reaching sustainable commercial ventures enabling significant translational impact. We describe the fundamental biophysical science which led to a diverse range of academic spinouts, presenting the scientific questions that were first asked and addressed through innovating new techniques and approaches, and highlighting the key publications which ultimately led to commercialisation. We consider these example companies through the lens of opportunities and challenges for academic biophysics research in partnership with British industry. Finally, we propose recommendations concerning future resourcing and structuring of UK biophysics research and the training and support of...</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Non-reciprocally Interacting Particles and Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions that violate Newton's law 'actio=reactio' are ubiquitous in nature and are currently intensively investigated in active matter, chemical reaction networks, population dynamics, and many other fields. An outstanding challenge is the thermodynamically consistent formulation of the underlying stochastic dynamics that obeys local detailed balance and allows for a rigorous analysis of the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting particles. Here, we present such a framework for a broad class of active systems and derive by systematic coarse-graining exact expressions for the macroscopic entropy production. Four independent contributions to the thermodynamic dissipation can be identified, among which the energy flux sustaining vorticity currents manifests the presence of non-reciprocal interactions. Then, Onsager's non-reciprocal relations, the fluctuation-response relation, the fluctuation relation and the thermodynamic uncertainty relations for non-reciprocal systems are derived. Finally, we demonstrate that our general framework is applicable to a plethora of active matter systems and chemical reaction networks and opens new paths to understand the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Hemodynamic Markers: CFD-Based Prediction of Cerebral Aneurysm Rupture Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of aneurysm evolution on hemodynamic characteristics within the sac region. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), blood flow through the parent vessel and aneurysm sac was analyzed to assess the impact on wall shear stress (WSS), time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS), and the oscillatory shear index (OSI), key indicators of rupture risk. Additionally, Relative Residence Time (RRT) and Endothelial Cell Activation Potential (ECAP) were examined to provide a broader understanding of the aneurysm's hemodynamic environment. Six distinct cerebral aneurysm (CA) models, all from individuals of the same gender, were selected to minimize gender-related variability.
  Results showed that unruptured cases exhibited higher WSS and TAWSS, along with lower OSI and RRT values patterns consistent with stable flow conditions supporting vascular integrity. In contrast, ruptured cases had lower WSS and TAWSS, coupled with elevated OSI and RRT, suggesting disturbed and oscillatory flow commonly linked to aneurysm wall weakening. ECAP was also higher in ruptured cases, indicating increased endothelial activation under unstable flow. Notably, areas with the highest OSI and RRT often aligned with vortex centers, reinforcing the association between disturbed flow and aneurysm instability.
  These findings highlight the value of combining multiple hemodynamic parameters for rupture risk assessment. Including RRT and ECAP provides deeper insight into flow endothelium-interactions, offering a stronger basis for evaluating aneurysm stability and guiding treatment decisions.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Modeling of Lipid Nanoparticle (LNP) Precipitation via Population Balance Equations (PBEs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are precisely engineered drug delivery carriers commonly produced through controlled mixing processes, such as nanoprecipitation. Since their delivery efficacy greatly depends on particle size, numerous studies have proposed experimental and theoretical approaches for tuning LNP size. However, the mechanistic model for LNP fabrication has rarely been established alongside experiments, limiting a profound understanding of the kinetic processes governing LNP self-assembly. Thus, we present a population balance equation (PBE)-based model that captures the evolution of the particle size distribution (PSD) during LNP fabrication, to provide mechanistic insight into how kinetic processes control LNP size. The model showed strong agreement with experimentally observed trends in the PSD. In addition to identifying the role of each kinetic process in shaping the PSD, we analyzed the underlying mechanisms of three key operational strategies: manipulation of (1) lipid concentration, (2) flow rate ratio (FRR), and (3) mixing rate. We identified that the key to producing precisely controlled particle size lies in controlling super-saturation and lipid dilution to regulate the balance between nucleation and growth. Our findings provide mechanistic understanding that is essential in further developing strategies for tuning LNP size.</description>

      <title>Hunting for Maxwell's Demon in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The apparent paradox of Maxwell's demon motivated the development of information thermodynamics and, more recently, engineering advances enabling the creation of nanoscale information engines. From these advances, it is now understood that nanoscale machines like the molecular motors within cells can in principle operate as Maxwell demons. This motivates the question: does information help power molecular motors? Answering this would seemingly require simultaneous measurement of all system degrees of freedom, which is generally intractable in single-molecule experiments. To overcome this limitation, we derive a statistical estimator to infer both the direction and magnitude of subsystem heat flows, and thus to determine whether -- and how strongly -- a motor operates as a Maxwell demon. The estimator uses only trajectory measurements for a single degree of freedom. We demonstrate the estimator by applying it to simulations of an experimental realization of an information engine and a kinesin molecular motor. Our results show that kinesin transitions to a Maxwell-demon mechanism in the presence of nonequilibrium noise, with a corresponding increase in velocity consistent with experiments. These findings suggest that molecular motors may have evolved to leverage active fluctuations within cells.</description>

      <title>Organisation and dynamics of individual DNA segments in topologically complex genomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capturing the physical organisation and dynamics of genomic regions is one of the major open challenges in biology. The kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) is a topologically complex genome, made by thousands of DNA (mini and maxi) circles interlinked into a two-dimensional Olympic network. The organisation and dynamics of these DNA circles are poorly understood. In this paper, we show that dCas9 linked to Quantum Dots can efficiently label different classes of DNA minicircles in kDNA. We use this method to study the distribution and dynamics of different classes of DNA minicircles within the network. We discover that maxicircles display a preference to localise at the periphery of the network and that they undergo subdiffusive dynamics. From the latter, we can also quantify the effective network stiffness, confirming previous indirect estimations via AFM. Our method could be used more generally, to quantify the location, dynamics and material properties of genomic regions in other complex genomes, such as that of bacteria, and to study their behaviour in the presence of DNA-binding proteins.</description>

      <title>Theory of active self-organization of dense nematic structures in the actin cytoskeleton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15352v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The actin cytoskeleton is remarkably adaptable and multifunctional. It often organizes into nematic bundles such as contractile rings or stress fibers. However, how a uniform and isotropic actin gel self-organizes into dense nematic bundles is not fully understood. Here, using an active gel model accounting for nematic order and density variations, we identify an active patterning mechanism leading to localized dense nematic structures. Linear stability analysis and nonlinear finite element simulations establish the conditions for nematic bundle self-assembly and how active gel parameters control the architecture, orientation, connectivity and dynamics of self-organized patterns. Finally, we substantiate with discrete network simulations the main requirements for nematic bundle formation according to our theory, namely increased active tension perpendicular to the nematic direction and generalized active forces conjugate to nematic order. Our work portrays actin gels a reconfigurable active materials with a spontaneous tendency to develop patterns of dense nematic bundles.</description>
