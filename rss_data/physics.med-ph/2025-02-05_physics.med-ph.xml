      <title>Censor-Aware Semi-Supervised Lung Cancer Survival Time Prediction Using Clinical and Radiomics Feature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Lung cancer poses a significant global health challenge, necessitating improved prognostic methods for personalized treatment. This study introduces a censor-aware semi-supervised learning (SSL) that integrates clinical and imaging data, addressing biases in traditional models handling censored data. Methods: We analyzed clinical, PET, and CT data from 199 lung cancer patients from TCIA and BC Cancer Agency, focusing on overall survival (OS) time as the primary outcome. Handcrafted (HRF) and Deep Radiomics features (DRF) were extracted after preprocessing using ViSERA software and were combined with clinical features (CF). Feature dimensions were optimized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), followed by the application of supervised learning (SL) and SSL. SSL incorporated pseudo-labeling of censored data to improve performance. Seven regressors and three hazard ratio survival analysis (HRSA) algorithms were optimized using five-fold cross-validation, grid search and external test bootstrapping. Results: For PET HRFs, SSL reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) by 26.54%, achieving 1.55 years with PCA+decision tree regression, compared to SL's 2.11 years with PCA+KNNR (p&lt;0.05). Combining HRFs (CT_HRF) and DRFs from CT images using SSL+PCA+KNNR achieved an MAE of 2.08.45 years, outperforming SL's 2.26 years by 7.96% (p&lt;0.05). In HRSA, CT_HRF applied to PCA+Component Wise Gradient Boosting Survival Analysis achieved an external c-index of 0.65, effectively differentiating high- and low-risk groups. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the SSL strategy significantly outperformed SL across PET, CT, and CF. Thereby, censor-aware SSL applied to HRFs from PET images significantly improved survival prediction performance by 26.54% compared to the SL approach.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Cyclic Group Equivariance into Deep Learning for Reliable Reconstruction of Rotationally Symmetric Tomography Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotational symmetry is a defining feature of many tomography systems, including computed tomography (CT) and emission computed tomography (ECT), where detectors are arranged in a circular or periodically rotating configuration. This study revisits the image reconstruction process from the perspective of hardware-induced rotational symmetry and introduces a cyclic group equivariance framework for deep learning-based reconstruction. Specifically, we derive a mathematical correspondence that couples cyclic rotations in the projection domain to discrete rotations in the image domain, both arising from the same cyclic group inherent in the hardware design. This insight also reveals the uniformly distributed circular structure of the projection space. Building on this principle, we provide a cyclic rotation equivariant convolution design method to preserve projection domain symmetry and a cyclic group equivariance regularization approach that enforces consistent rotational transformations across the entire network. We further integrate these modules into a domain transform reconstruction framework and validate them using digital brain phantoms, training on discrete models and testing on more complex and realistic fuzzy variants. Results indicate markedly improved generalization and stability, with fewer artifacts and better detail preservation, especially under data distribution deviation. These findings highlight the potential of cyclic group equivariance as a unifying principle for tomographic reconstruction in rotationally symmetric systems, offering a flexible and interpretable solution for scenarios with limited data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spectral approach based on the Fourier diffraction theorem is combined with a pair of U-NETs to perform quantitative microwave imaging of an anthropomorphic breast phantom. The U-NET pair is trained on a spectral database constructed from combinations of different realistic parts of the breast. Some preliminary numerical results are presented to show the major improvement brought by the U-NET.</description>

      <title>Sparse Measurement Medical CT Reconstruction using Multi-Fused Block Matching Denoising Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge for medical X-ray CT imaging is reducing the number of X-ray projections to lower radiation dosage and reduce scan times without compromising image quality. However these under-determined inverse imaging problems rely on the formulation of an expressive prior model to constrain the solution space while remaining computationally tractable. Traditional analytical reconstruction methods like Filtered Back Projection (FBP) often fail with sparse measurements, producing artifacts due to their reliance on the Shannon-Nyquist Sampling Theorem. Consensus Equilibrium, which is a generalization of Plug and Play, is a recent advancement in Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR), has facilitated the use of multiple denoisers are prior models in an optimization free framework to capture complex, non-linear prior information. However, 3D prior modelling in a Plug and Play approach for volumetric image reconstruction requires long processing time due to high computing requirement.
  Instead of directly using a 3D prior, this work proposes a BM3D Multi Slice Fusion (BM3D-MSF) prior that uses multiple 2D image denoisers fused to act as a fully 3D prior model in Plug and Play reconstruction approach. Our approach does not require training and are thus able to circumvent ethical issues related with patient training data and are readily deployable in varying noise and measurement sparsity levels. In addition, reconstruction with the BM3D-MSF prior achieves similar reconstruction image quality as fully 3D image priors, but with significantly reduced computational complexity. We test our method on clinical CT data and demonstrate that our approach improves reconstructed image quality.</description>

      <title>Aerosol deposition in mucus-lined ciliated airways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the transport and deposition of inhaled aerosols in a mid-generation, mucus-lined lung airway, with the aim of understanding if and how airborne particles can avoid the mucus and deposit on the airway wall -- an outcome that is harmful in case of allergens and pathogens but beneficial in case of aerosolized drugs. We adopt the weighted-residual integral boundary-layer model of Dietze and Ruyer-Quil (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 762, 2015, pp. 68-109) to describe the dynamics of the mucus-air interface, as well as the flow in both phases. The transport of mucus induced by wall-attached cilia is also considered, via a coarse-grained boundary condition at the base of the mucus. We show that the capillary-driven Rayleigh-Plateau instability plays an important role in particle deposition by drawing the mucus into large annular humps and leaving substantial areas of the wall exposed to particles. We find, counter-intuitively, that these mucus-depleted zones enlarge on increasing the mucus volume fraction. Particles spanning a range of sizes (0.1 to 50 microns) are modelled using the Maxey-Riley equation, augmented with Brownian forces. We find a non-monotonic dependence of deposition on size. Small particles diffuse across streamlines due to Brownian motion, while large particles are thrown off streamlines by inertial forces -- particularly when air flows past mucus humps. Intermediate-sized particles are tracer-like and deposit the least. Remarkably, increasing the mucus volume need not increase entrapment: the effect depends on particle-size, because more mucus produces not only deeper humps that intercept inertial particles, but also larger depleted-zones that enable diffusive particles to deposit on the wall.</description>

      <title>ReMiDi: Reconstruction of Microstructure Using a Differentiable Diffusion MRI Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose ReMiDi, a novel method for inferring neuronal microstructure as arbitrary 3D meshes using a differentiable diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) simulator. We first implemented in PyTorch a differentiable dMRI simulator that simulates the forward diffusion process using a finite-element method on an input 3D microstructure mesh. To achieve significantly faster simulations, we solve the differential equation semi-analytically using a matrix formalism approach. Given a reference dMRI signal $S_{ref}$, we use the differentiable simulator to iteratively update the input mesh such that it matches $S_{ref}$ using gradient-based learning. Since directly optimizing the 3D coordinates of the vertices is challenging, particularly due to ill-posedness of the inverse problem, we instead optimize a lower-dimensional latent space representation of the mesh. The mesh is first encoded into spectral coefficients, which are further encoded into a latent $\textbf{z}$ using an auto-encoder, and are then decoded back into the true mesh. We present an end-to-end differentiable pipeline that simulates signals that can be tuned to match a reference signal by iteratively updating the latent representation $\textbf{z}$. We demonstrate the ability to reconstruct microstructures of arbitrary shapes represented by finite-element meshes, with a focus on axonal geometries found in the brain white matter, including bending, fanning and beading fibers. Our source code will be made available online.</description>

      <title>Accurate Pocket Identification for Binding-Site-Agnostic Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate identification of druggable pockets is essential for structure-based drug design. However, most pocket-identification algorithms prioritize their geometric properties over downstream docking performance. To address this limitation, we developed RAPID-Net, a pocket-finding algorithm for seamless integration with docking workflows. When guiding AutoDock Vina, RAPID-Net outperforms DiffBindFR on the PoseBusters benchmark and enables blind docking on large proteins that AlphaFold 3 cannot process as a whole. Furthermore, RAPID-Net surpasses PUResNet and Kalasanty in docking accuracy and pocket-ligand intersection rates across diverse datasets, including PoseBusters, Astex Diverse Set, BU48, and Coach420. When accuracy is evaluated as ``at least one correct pose in the ensemble'', RAPID-Net outperforms AlphaFold 3 on the PoseBusters benchmark, suggesting that our approach can be further improved with a suitable pose reweighting tool offering a cost-effective and competitive alternative to AlphaFold 3 for docking. Finally, using several therapeutically relevant examples, we demonstrate the ability of RAPID-Net to identify remote functional sites, highlighting its potential to facilitate the development of innovative therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Style transfer as data augmentation: evaluating unpaired image-to-image translation models in mammography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several studies indicate that deep learning models can learn to detect breast cancer from mammograms (X-ray images of the breasts). However, challenges with overfitting and poor generalisability prevent their routine use in the clinic. Models trained on data from one patient population may not perform well on another due to differences in their data domains, emerging due to variations in scanning technology or patient characteristics. Data augmentation techniques can be used to improve generalisability by expanding the diversity of feature representations in the training data by altering existing examples. Image-to-image translation models are one approach capable of imposing the characteristic feature representations (i.e. style) of images from one dataset onto another. However, evaluating model performance is non-trivial, particularly in the absence of ground truths (a common reality in medical imaging). Here, we describe some key aspects that should be considered when evaluating style transfer algorithms, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of popular metrics, and important factors to be mindful of when implementing them in practice. We consider two types of generative models: a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) and a diffusion-based SynDiff model. We learn unpaired image-to-image translation across three mammography datasets. We highlight that undesirable aspects of model performance may determine the suitability of some metrics, and also provide some analysis indicating the extent to which various metrics assess unique aspects of model performance. We emphasise the need to use several metrics for a comprehensive assessment of model performance.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Dosimetric Study of Proton and Photon Therapy in Stereotactic Arrhythmia Radioablation for Ventricular Tachycardia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: VT is a life-threatening arrhythmia commonly treated with catheter ablation; however, some cases remain refractory to conventional treatment. STAR has emerged as a non-invasive option for such patients. While photon-based STAR has shown efficacy, proton therapy offers potential advantages due to its superior dose conformity and sparing of critical OARs, including the heart itself. This study aims to investigate and compare the dosimetry between proton and photon therapy for VT, focusing on target coverage and OAR sparing. Methods: We performed a retrospective study on a cohort of 34 VT patients who received photon STAR. Proton STAR plans were generated using robust optimization in RayStation to deliver the same prescription dose of 25 Gy in a single fraction while minimizing dose to OARs. Dosimetric metrics, including D99, D95, Dmean, and D0.03cc, were extracted for critical OARs and VAS. Shapiro-Wilk tests were used to assess normality, followed by paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for statistical comparisons between modalities, with Bonferroni correction applied for multiple comparisons. Results: Proton and photon plans achieved comparable target coverage, with VAS D95 of 24.1 +/- 1.2 Gy vs. 24.7 +/- 1.0 Gy (p=0.294). Proton therapy significantly reduced OAR doses, including heart Dmean (3.6 +/- 1.5 Gy vs. 5.5 +/- 2.0 Gy, p&lt;0.001), lungs Dmean (1.6 +/- 1.5 Gy vs. 2.1 +/- 1.4 Gy, p&lt;0.001), and esophagus Dmean (0.3 +/- 0.6 Gy vs. 1.6 +/- 1.3 Gy, p&lt;0.001), while maintaining optimal target coverage. Conclusion: Proton therapy for STAR demonstrates significant dosimetric advantages in sparing the heart and other critical OARs compared to photon therapy for VT, while maintaining equivalent target coverage. These findings highlight the potential of proton therapy to reduce treatment-related toxicity and improve outcomes for VT patients.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy of superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are promising probes for biomedical imaging, but the heterogeneity of their magnetic properties is difficult to characterize with existing methods. Here, we perform widefield imaging of the stray magnetic fields produced by hundreds of isolated ~30-nm SPIONs using a magnetic microscope based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. By analyzing the SPION magnetic field patterns as a function of applied magnetic field, we observe substantial field-dependent transverse magnetization components that are typically obscured with ensemble characterization methods. We find negligible hysteresis in each of the three magnetization components for nearly all SPIONs in our sample. Most SPIONs exhibit a sharp Langevin saturation curve, enumerated by a characteristic polarizing applied field, B_c. The B_c distribution is highly asymmetric, with a standard deviation (1.4 mT) that is larger than the median (0.6 mT). Using time-resolved magnetic microscopy, we directly record SPION N\'eel relaxation, after switching off a 31 mT applied field, with a temporal resolution of ~60 ms that is limited by the ring-down time of the electromagnet coils. For small bias fields B_{hold}=1.5-3.5 mT, we observe a broad range of SPION N\'eel relaxation times--from milliseconds to seconds--that are consistent with an exponential dependence on B_{hold}. Our time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy study reveals rich SPION sample heterogeneity and may be extended to other fundamental studies of nanomagnetism.</description>
