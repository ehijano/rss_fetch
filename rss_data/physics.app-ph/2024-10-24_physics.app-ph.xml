      <title>Elastic hyperbolic strip lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic properties of elastic lattices defined by tessellations of a hyperbolic strip domain. These strip lattices are generated by a conformal map of tessellations of the hyperbolic disk. Their vibrational modes are organized into three distinct classes: boundary-localized, interior-localized, and global. This mode classification is governed by a localization index quantifying the spatial localization of each mode along the strip's width. We show that, like hyperbolic lattices in the disk, hyperbolic strip lattices exhibit dynamic spectra populated primarily by localized modes. This finding is supported by numerical studies of the dynamics of a strip lattice whose hyperbolically distributed sites are coupled by structural beams. The integrated density of states computation for boundary, interior, and global modes reveals the predominance of localized modes and allows for the identification of spectral bands dominated by particular mode classes. This analysis informs time domain simulations of the lattice response to bandlimited inputs dominated by each mode class. The results illustrate distinctive wave propagation behavior when the excited frequency band is dominated by boundary-localized, interior-localized, or global modes. We experimentally confirm these observations in the frequency and time domains. In the frequency domain, the measured response confirms that the spectral neighborhoods of each excitation are indeed populated by the numerically predicted mode class. We further show that the time-averaged responses are consistent with simulations. Through this work, elastic hyperbolic strips emerge as a new class of lattices with characteristic truss-core architectures and novel nodal arrangements. The considered configuration shows promising capabilities to confine and guide elastic waves along varying spatial regions depending on the excited frequency content.</description>

      <title>Enhanced laser-induced single-cycle terahertz generation in a spintronic emitter with a gradient interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of spintronic emitters of broadband THz pulses relies on designing heterostructures where processes of laser-driven spin current generation and subsequent spin-to-charge current conversion are the most efficient. An interface between ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers in the emitter is one of the critical elements. Here, we study experimentally single-cycle THz pulse generation from a laser-pulse excited Pt/Co emitter with a composition gradient interface between Pt and Co and compare it with the emission from a conventional Pt/Co structure with an abrupt interface. We find that the gradient interface enhances the efficiency of optics-to-THz conversion by a factor of two in a wide range of optical fluences up to 3 mJ cm$^{-2}$. We reveal that this enhancement is caused by a pronounced increase in transmittance of the laser-driven spin-polarized current through the gradient interface compared to the abrupt one. Furthermore, we find that such a transmission deteriorates with laser fluence due to the spin accumulation effect.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e-regulated composition evolution kinetics of bicomponent nanoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple model and computation of Moir\'e-regulated composition evolution kinetics of bicomponent nanoclusters is presented. Assuming continuous adsorbate coverage on top of 2D bilayer and Moir\'e potential-driven nanocluster formation at fcc sites of Moir\'e landscape, these sites experience the influx of one component of a bicomponent adsorbate and the outflux of another component. Kinetics of this process is characterized for several combinations of adsorption potentials and their relative strengths.</description>

      <title>Separating edges from microstructure in X-ray dark-field imaging: Evolving and devolving perspectives via the X-ray Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key contribution to X-ray dark-field (XDF) is X-ray diffusion by sample structures smaller than the imaging system's spatial resolution. However, some XDF techniques report that resolvable sample edges also generate XDF. Speckle-based X-ray imaging (SBXI) extracts XDF by analyzing sample-imposed changes to a reference speckle pattern's visibility. We present an algorithm for SBXI (a variant of our Multimodal Intrinsic Speckle-Tracking (MIST) algorithm) capable of separating these two distinct XDF contrast mechanisms. The algorithm uses the 'devolving' X-ray Imaging Fokker-Planck equation as its forward model and then solves the associated multimodal inverse problem, to retrieve sample attenuation, phase, and XDF. Previous MIST variants were based on the evolving Fokker-Planck equation, which considers how a reference-speckle image is modified by introducing a sample. The devolving perspective instead considers how the image collected in the presence of the sample and speckle membrane optically flows in reverse, to generate the reference-speckle image when the sample is removed from the system. We compare single- and multiple-exposure multimodal retrieval algorithms from the two Fokker-Planck perspectives. We demonstrate that the devolving perspective can distinguish between two physically different XDF contrast mechanisms; unresolved microstructure- and sharp-edge-induced XDF. This was verified by applying the retrieval algorithms to two experimental data sets. We anticipate that this work will be useful in: Yielding a pair of complementary XDF images that separate sharp-edge diffuse scatter from unresolved microstructure diffuse scatter. XDF computed tomography, where the strong edge XDF can lead to tainting streaking artefacts. Sample preparation, as samples will not need to be embedded since the strong XDF edge signal seen between the sample and air can be separated out.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Optical-to-Microwave Conversion Using Si Photonic Integrated Circuit Ge Photodiodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated circuit technology enables the scaling of circuit complexity and functionality while maintaining manufacturability and reliability. Integration is expected to play an important role in quantum information technologies, including in the highly demanding task of producing the classical signals to control and measure quantum circuits at scales needed for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we experimentally characterize the cryogenic performance of a miniaturized photonic integrated circuit fabricated by a commercial foundry that down-converts classical optical signals to microwave signals. The circuit consists of waveguide-integrated germanium PIN photodiodes packaged using a scalable photonic wire bonding approach to a multi-channel optical fiber array that provides the optical excitation. We find the peak optical-to-microwave conversion response to be $\sim 150 \pm 13$ mA/W in the O-band at 4.2 K, well below the temperature the circuit was designed for and tested at in the past, for two different diode designs. The second diode design operates to over 6 GHz of 3 dB bandwidth making it suitable for controlling quantum circuits, with improvements in bandwidth and response expected from improved packaging. The demonstrated miniaturization and integration offers new perspectives for wavelength-division multiplexed control of microwave quantum circuits and scalable processors using light delivered by optical fiber arrays.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Cladding Elasticity to Enhance Sensitivity in Silicon Photonic Ultrasound Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound is widely used in medical imaging, and emerging photo-acoustic imaging is crucial for disease diagnosis. Currently, high-end photo-acoustic imaging systems rely on piezo-electric materials for detecting ultrasound waves, which come with sensitivity, noise, and bandwidth limitations. Advanced applications demand a large matrix of broadband, high-resolution, and scalable ultrasound sensors. Silicon photonic circuits have been introduced to meet these requirements by detecting ultrasound-induced deformation and stress in silicon waveguides. Although higher sensitivities could facilitate the exploration of new applications, the high stiffness of the waveguide materials constrains the intrinsic sensitivity of the silicon photonic circuits to ultrasound signals. Here, we explore the impact of the mechanical properties of a polymer cladding on the sensitivity of silicon photonic ultrasound sensors. Our model and experiments reveal that optimizing the polymer cladding's stiffness enhances the resonance wavelength sensitivity. Experimentally, we show a fourfold increase in the sensitivity compared to the sensors without a cladding polymer and, a twofold sensitivity increase compared to the sensors with a cladding polymer of saturated cross-linking density. Interestingly, comparing experiments with the optomechanical model suggests that the change in Young's Modulus alone cannot explain the sensitivity increase. In conclusion, polymer-coated silicon photonic ultrasound sensors exhibit potential for advanced photo-acoustic imaging applications. It offers the prospect of increasing the ultrasound detection sensitivity of silicon photonic ultrasound sensors while using CMOS-compatible processes. This paves the way to integrate the polymer-coated silicon photonic ultrasound sensors with electronics to utilize the sensors in advanced medical imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Lead-free Hybrid Perovskite: An Efficient Room Temperature Spin Generator via Large Interfacial Rashba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite (HOIP) demonstates great potential for developing flexible and wearable spintronic devices, by serving as spin sources via the bulk Rashba effect (BRE). However, the practical application of BRE in 2D HOIP faces huge challenges, particularly due to the toxicity of lead, which is crucial for achieving large spin-orbit coupling, and the restrictions in 2D HOIP candidates to meet specific symmetry-breaking requirements. To overcome these obstacles, we design a strategy to exploit the interfacial Rashba effect (IRE) of lead-free 2D HOIP (C6H5CH2CH2NH3)2CuCl4 (PEA-CuCl), manifesting as an efficient spin generator at room temperature. IRE of PEA-CuCl originates from the large orbital hybridization at the interface between PEA-CuCl and adjacent ferromagnetic layers. Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements further quantify a large Rashba effective field of 14.04 Oe per 10^11 A m-2, surpassing those of lead-based HOIP and traditional all-inorganic heterojunctions with noble metals. Our lead-free 2D HOIP PEA-CuCl, which harnesses large IRE for spin generation, is efficient, nontoxic, and economic, offering huge promise for future flexible and wearable spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive TCAD Simulation Study of High Voltage (&gt;650V) Common Drain Bidirectional AlGaN/GaN HEMTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A broad TCAD simulation analysis of a monolithic common drain bidirectional GaN HEMT was performed. We used gate-to-gate distances of 4 microns and 6 microns for the devices optimized with two field plates. The breakdown voltages were 675V and 915V respectively. Inclusion of field plates near both the gates produced electric field peaks at the opposite ends of the transistor simultaneously. This resulted in better electric field management or higher blocking voltage per unit length. Consequently, the 675V monolithic bidirectional HEMT had an impressive 40% improvement in on-resistance than its 650V typical series/parallel counterpart.</description>

      <title>Green's functions, propagation invariants, reciprocity theorems, wave-field representations and propagator matrices in 2D time-dependent materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of wave propagation and scattering in time-dependent materials is a rapidly growing field of research. Whereas for 1D applications there is a simple relation between the wave equations for space-dependent and time-dependent materials, this relation is less straightforward for multi-dimensional materials.
  This paper discusses fundamental aspects of 2D electromagnetic and acoustic wave propagation and scattering in homogeneous, time-dependent materials. This encompasses a review of transmission and reflection at a single time boundary, a discussion of the Green's function and its symmetry properties in a piecewise continuous time-dependent material, a discussion of propagation invariants (including the net field-momentum density), general reciprocity theorems, and wave field representations.
  Analogous to the well-known expression for Green's function retrieval by time-correlation of passive measurements in a space-dependent material, an expression is derived for Green's function retrieval by space-correlation of passive measurements in a time-dependent material.
  The paper concludes with the discussion of the propagator matrix for a piecewise continuous time-dependent material, its symmetry properties and its relation with the Green's function.</description>

      <title>An integrated photonic engine for programmable atomic control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solutions for scalable, high-performance optical control are important for the development of scaled atom-based quantum technologies. Modulation of many individual optical beams is central to the application of arbitrary gate and control sequences on arrays of atoms or atom-like systems. At telecom wavelengths, miniaturization of optical components via photonic integration has pushed the scale and performance of classical and quantum optics far beyond the limitations of bulk devices. However, these material platforms for high-speed telecom integrated photonics are not transparent at the short wavelengths required by leading atomic systems. Here, we propose and implement a scalable and reconfigurable photonic architecture for multi-channel quantum control using integrated, visible-light modulators based on thin-film lithium niobate. Our approach combines techniques in free-space optics, holography, and control theory together with a sixteen-channel integrated photonic device to stabilize temporal and cross-channel power deviations and enable precise and uniform control. Applying this device to a homogeneous constellation of silicon-vacancy artificial atoms in diamond, we present techniques to spatially and spectrally address a dynamically-selectable set of these stochastically-positioned point emitters. We anticipate that this scalable and reconfigurable optical architecture will lead to systems that could enable parallel individual programmability of large many-body atomic systems, which is a critical step towards universal quantum computation on such hardware.</description>
