      <title>Novel discretization method to calculate g-functions of vertical geothermal boreholes with improved accuracy and efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of g-functions is essential for the design and simulation of geothermal boreholes. However, existing methods, such as the stacked finite line source (SFLS) model, face challenges regarding computational efficiency and accuracy, particularly with fine-grained discretization. This paper introduces a novel discretization method to address these limitations. We reformulate the g-function calculation under the uniform borehole wall temperature boundary condition as the solution to spatio-temporal integral equations. The SFLS model is identified as a special case using stepwise approximation of the heat extraction rate. Our proposed method employs the Gauss-Legendre quadrature to approximate the spatial integrals with a weighted sum of function values at strategically chosen points. This transforms the time-consuming segment-to-segment integral calculations in SFLS model into simpler and analytical point-to-point response factors. Furthermore, we identify that the governing integral equations are of the Fredholm first kind, leading to ill-conditioned linear systems that can cause g-function to diverge at high discretization orders. To address this, a regularization technique is implemented to ensure stable and convergent solutions. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly more efficient, achieving comparable or improved accuracy at speeds 20 to 200 times faster than the SFLS model with optimized nonuniform discretization schemes.</description>

      <title>An efficient and robust high-order compact ALE gas-kinetic scheme for unstructured meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) calculations, the geometric information needs to be calculated at each time step due to the movement of mesh. To achieve the high-order spatial accuracy, a large number of matrix inversions are needed, which affect the efficiency of computation dramatically. In this paper, an efficient and robust high-order compact ALE gas-kinetic scheme is developed for the compressible moving grids and moving boundary problems. The memory-reduction reconstruction is used to construct a quadratic polynomial on the target cell, where both structured and unstructured meshes can be used. Taking derivatives of the candidate polynomial, the quadratic terms can be obtained by the least square method using the average gradient values of the cell itself and its adjacent cells. Moving the quadratic terms to right-hand side of the constrains for cell averaged value, the linear terms of the polynomial can be determined by the least square method as well. The gradient compression factor is adopted to suppress the spurious oscillations near discontinuities. Combined with the two-stage fourth-order time discretization, a high-order compact gas-kinetic scheme is developed for ALE computation. In the process of mesh movement, the inversions of lower order matrix are needed for the least square method, which makes a 7x speedup and improves the efficiency greatly. In the computation, the grid velocity can be given by the mesh adaptation method and the cell centered Lagrangian nodal solver. Numerical examples are presented to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, robustness and the preservation of geometric conservation law of the current scheme.</description>

      <title>DPI-SPR: A Differentiable Physical Inversion for Shadow Profile Reconstruction Framework in Forward Scatter Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forward scatter radar (FSR) has emerged as an effective imaging modality for target detection, utilizing forward scattering (FS) signals to reconstruct two-dimensional shadow profile images of objects. However, real-world FS signals are inevitably corrupted by noise. Due to the ill-posed nature of electromagnetic inversion and its high sensitivity to noise, existing imaging methods often suffer from degraded performance or even complete failure under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To address this challenge, we propose DPI-SPR (Differentiable Physical Inversion for Shadow Profile Reconstruction), an end-to-end imaging paradigm built upon the Secondary Wave-Source Response Field (SWRF). The core concept of this paradigm is to reformulate the imaging problem as an optimization problem of continuous and learnable SWRF parameters. To this end, we develop a fully Differentiable Forward Scattering model (DFSM). Leveraging this model, the proposed inversion framework integrates a robust logarithmic loss with physics-based regularization constraints, enabling accurate gradient propagation from observation errors to the SWRF parameters associated with the shadow profile. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the inversion proposed framework. The results show that our method achieves high-precision profile reconstruction directly from limited and noisy reference signals, even at an SNR as low as 8dB, setting a new benchmark for robust imaging in FSR scenarios.</description>

      <title>Full-Wave Modeling of Transcranial Ultrasound using Volume-Surface Integral Equations and CT-Derived Heterogeneous Skull Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound therapy uses focused acoustic energy to induce therapeutic bioeffects in the brain. Ultrasound is transmitted through the skull, which is highly attenuating and heterogeneous, causing beam distortion, reducing focal pressure, and shifting the target location. Computational models are frequently used for predicting beam aberration, assessing cranial heating, and correcting the phase of ultrasound transducers. These models often rely on computed tomography (CT) images to build patient-specific geometries and estimate skull acoustic properties. However, the coarse voxel resolution of CT limits accuracy for differential equation solvers. This paper presents an efficient numerical method based on volume-surface integral equations to model full-wave acoustic propagation through heterogeneous skull tissue. We have shown that this approach is highly accurate on relatively coarse meshes compared to the minimum wavelength, enabling direct use of CT voxel data. The method is validated against a high-resolution boundary element model using an averaged skull representation. Simulations with a CT-based skull model and a bowl transducer show significant beam distortion and attenuation, with a focal shift of several millimeters from the homogeneous case.</description>

      <title>Sharp Collocated Projection Method for Immiscible Two-Phase Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a sharp collocated projection method for solving the immiscible, two-phase Navier-Stokes equations in two- and three-dimensions. Our method is built using non-graded adaptive quadtree and octree grids, where all of the fluid variables are defined on the nodes, and we leverage this framework to design novel spatial and temporal discretizations for the two-phase problem. The benefits of the nodal collocation framework are best exemplified through our novel discretizations, which employ a hybrid finite difference-finite volume methodology to treat the boundary and interfacial jump conditions in an entirely sharp manner. We demonstrate the capabilities of our novel approach using a variety of canonical two- and three-dimensional examples and outline how our framework can be extended to address more complicated physics. The overall algorithm achieves high accuracy with simplified data structures, making this solver ideal for scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>The DeepFMKit Python package: A toolbox for simulating and analyzing deep frequency modulation interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Frequency Modulation Interferometry (DFMI) is an emerging laser interferometry technique for high-precision metrology, offering picometer-level displacement measurements and the potential for absolute length determination with sub-wavelength accuracy. However, the design and optimization of DFMI systems involve a complex interplay between interferometer physics, laser technology, multiple noise sources, and the choice of data processing algorithm. To address this, we present DeepFMKit, a new open-source Python library for the end-to-end simulation and analysis of DFMI systems. The framework features a high-fidelity physics engine that rigorously models key physical effects such as time-of-flight delays in dynamic interferometers, arbitrary laser modulation waveforms, and colored noise from user-defined $1/f^\alpha$ spectral densities. This engine is coupled with a suite of interchangeable parameter estimation algorithms, including a highly-optimized, parallelized frequency-domain Non-linear Least Squares (NLS) for high-throughput offline analysis, and multiple time-domain Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) implementations for real-time state tracking, featuring both random walk and integrated random walk (constant velocity) process models. Furthermore, DeepFMKit includes a high-throughput experimentation framework for automating large-scale parameter sweeps and Monte Carlo analyses, enabling systematic characterization of system performance. DeepFMKit's modular, object-oriented architecture facilitates the rapid configuration of virtual experiments, providing a powerful computational tool for researchers to prototype designs, investigate systematic errors, and accelerate the development of precision interferometry.</description>

      <title>Solid-Angle Nearest-Neighbor Method for Size-Disperse Systems of Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying nearest neighbors accurately is essential in particle-based simulations, from analyzing local structure to detecting phase transitions. While parameter-free methods such as Voronoi tessellation and the solid-angle nearest-neighbor (SANN) algorithm are effective in monodisperse systems, they become less reliable in mixtures with large size disparities. We introduce SANNR, a generalization of SANN that incorporates particle radii into the solid-angle criterion for robust, size-sensitive neighbor detection. We compare SANNR against Voronoi, Laguerre, and SANN in binary and size-disperse sphere mixtures. Using Wasserstein distance metrics, we show that SANNR closely matches size-aware Laguerre tessellation while preserving the geometric continuity of SANN. Applied to the crystallization of the complex AB$_{13}$ phase, SANNR improves detection of local bond-orientational order and better captures the emergence of global symmetry. SANNR thus offers a smooth, parameter-free, and extensible framework for neighbor detection in polydisperse and multicomponent systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-QIDA method for VQE state preparation in molecular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of quantum algorithms and their application to quantum chemistry has introduced new opportunities for solving complex molecular problems that are computationally infeasible for classical methods. In quantum chemistry, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed to estimate ground-state energies of molecular systems. Despite its promise, VQE faces challenges such as scalability issues, high circuit depths, and barren plateaus that make the optimization of the variational wavefunction. To mitigate these challenges, the Quantum Information Driven Ansatz (QIDA) leverages Quantum Mutual Information (QMI) to construct compact, correlation-driven circuits. In this work, we go back to the original field of application of QIDA, by applying the already defined Multi-Threshold Quantum Information Driven Ansatz (Multi-QIDA) methodology on Molecular Systems. to systematically construct shallow, layered quantum circuits starting from approximate QMI matrices obtained by Quantum Chemistry calculations. The Multi-QIDA approach combines efficient creation of the QMI map, reduction of the number of correlators required by exploiting Minimum/Maximum spanning tress, and an iterative layer-wise VQE optimization routine. These enhancements allow the method to recover missing correlations in molecular systems while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, the approach incorporates alternative gate constructions, such as SO(4) correlators, to enhance the circuit expressibility without significantly increasing the circuit complexity. We benchmark Multi-QIDA on systems ranging from small molecules like H2O, BeH2, and NH3 in Iterative Natural Orbitals (INOs) basis set, to active-space models such as H2O-6-31G-CAS(4,4) and N2-cc-pVTZ-CAS(6,6), comparing it to traditional hardware-efficient ansatze.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Flow Parameters and Wall Models on Gas-Surface Interactions: A Numerical Investigation of dsmcFoam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmosphere-breathing electric propulsion systems harness atmospheric particles as propellant, enabling efficient operation across diverse environmental conditions. To accurately simulate the captured gas flow through the modules, particle-surface interactions must be carefully modelled. To initiate this research, a parametric study is conducted using an extensive simulation matrix to investigate the effects of flow parameters, such as velocity, temperature, species, and angle of attack, and wall model parameters (diffuse fraction/accommodation coefficient) on gas-surface interactions. A simplified test geometry was created to run 2D simulations, where the flow interacts with an adjacent wall positioned perpendicular to one of the inlet patches. In this study, changes in reflection patterns, force density on the surface, and flow properties in the vicinity of the wall are investigated under varying flow and wall conditions using the current boundary conditions of the dsmcFoam solver. Furthermore, the capabilities of dsmcFoam's default boundary conditions in predicting gas-surface interaction physics are evaluated using the results of the simulation matrix. The findings highlight the need for new boundary conditions to accurately replicate interaction physics across various aspects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Python package pylimer-tools is a comprehensive toolkit for computational studies of polymer networks, particularly bead-spring networks. The package provides functionality to generate polymer networks using Monte Carlo (MC) procedures and analyze their structural and mechanical properties. Key features include detection of loops, reduction of the network to its ground state energy both with and without entanglements by the Force Balance procedure, and thereafter computing the soluble and dangling fractions of network strands, as well as the equilibrium shear modulus. The toolkit supports analysis of structures generated both internally and by external simulation software such as LAMMPS. The package implements theoretical frameworks including Miller-Macosko theory and provides a dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulator with slip-spring entanglement modeling. Built with C++ for performance and exposed through Python bindings, pylimer-tools addresses the need for specialized tools in computational polymer science.</description>

      <title>Efficient computation of thermal radiation from biperiodic layered systems using the T-matrix method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are becoming important tools for the control of thermal radiation. Understanding their functional possibilities on computational grounds requires evaluating the response of the biperiodic layered system for many degrees of freedom, including several radiation directions and polarisations, while varying lattice spacing, thicknesses, and/or materials of homogeneous layers, over a range of frequencies. The diverse set of cases that need to be considered in simulations prompts for efficient numerical tools to handle them. To respond to this need, we present a method for computing the thermal radiation from metasurfaces that combines the directional Kirchhoff law with efficient T-matrix based calculations. We show that such a method can accurately reproduce experimental data from a metasurface made of platinum square plates. Additionally, we predict highly circularly polarised emissivity from a chiral metasurface. When comparing CPU-times, the method outperforms other approaches such as rigorous coupled wave analysis already at the modest number of 61 cases per frequency.</description>

      <title>It's not a FAD: first results in using Flows for unsupervised Anomaly Detection at 40 MHz at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first implementation of a Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF) model for unsupervised anomaly detection within the realistic, high-rate environment of the Large Hadron Collider's L1 trigger systems. While CNFs typically define an anomaly score via a probabilistic likelihood, calculating this score requires solving an Ordinary Differential Equation, a procedure too complex for FPGA deployment. To overcome this, we propose a novel, hardware-friendly anomaly score defined as the squared norm of the model's vector field output. This score is based on the intuition that anomalous events require a larger transformation by the flow. Our model, trained via Flow Matching on Standard Model-like data, is synthesized for an FPGA using the hls4ml library. We demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies a variety of beyond-the-Standard-Model signatures with performance comparable to existing machine learning-based triggers. The algorithm achieves a latency of a few hundred nanoseconds and requires minimal FPGA resources, establishing CNFs as a viable new tool for real-time, data-driven discovery at 40 MHz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The wide application of machine learning (ML) techniques in statistics physics has presented new avenues for research in this field. In this paper, we introduce a semi-supervised learning method based on Siamese Neural Networks (SNN), trying to explore the potential of neural network (NN) in the study of critical behaviors beyond the approaches of supervised and unsupervised learning. By focusing on the (1+1) dimensional bond directed percolation (DP) model of nonequilibrium phase transition and the 2 dimensional Ising model of equilibrium phase transition, we use the SNN to predict the critical values and critical exponents of the systems. Different from traditional ML methods, the input of SNN is a set of configuration data pairs and the output prediction is similarity, which prompts to find an anchor point of data for pair comparison during the test. In our study, during test we set different bond probability $p$ or temperature $T$ as anchors, and discuss the impact of the configurations at this anchors on predictions. In addition, we use an iterative method to find the optimal training interval to make the algorithm more efficient, and the prediction results are comparable to other ML methods.</description>

Abstract: A novel method for monochromatic scalar 3D radiative transfer, designed primarily for modeling remote sensing imaging, is presented. For simulating an observation of an imaging satellite instrument, the method uses a heuristic scattering coupling function to model the inter-pixel scattering of radiation, which is represented with a graph. The GPU-capable code implementation of the method, TURSCA, was validated against two established 3D RT models, Siro and SHDOM with relative agreement at 3% and 6%, respectively. The capabilities of TURSCA in modeling a satellite observation of an emission plume are examined. The presented method opens up new avenues of research, especially in satellite-based remote sensing of atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians: Reduced Memory Cost and Complexity Scaling via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12708v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that is simultaneously memory-efficient and low-scaling for applying ab initio molecular Hamiltonians to matrix-product states (MPS) via the tensor-hypercontraction (THC) format. These gains carry over to Krylov subspace methods, which can find low-lying eigenstates and simulate quantum time evolution while avoiding local minima and maintaining high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only 2. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in MPS form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method using a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. Our algorithm is highly parallelizable and thus lends itself to large-scale HPC simulations.</description>

      <title>infomeasure: A Comprehensive Python Package for Information Theory Measures and Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information theory, i.e. the mathematical analysis of information and of its processing, has become a tenet of modern science; yet, its use in real-world studies is usually hindered by its computational complexity, the lack of coherent software frameworks, and, as a consequence, low reproducibility. We here introduce infomeasure, an open-source Python package designed to provide robust tools for calculating a wide variety of information-theoretic measures, including entropies, mutual information, transfer entropy and divergences. It is designed for both discrete and continuous variables; implements state-of-the-art estimation techniques; and allows the calculation of local measure values, $p$-values and $t$-scores. By unifying these approaches under one consistent framework, infomeasure aims to mitigate common pitfalls, ensure reproducibility, and simplify the practical implementation of information-theoretic analyses. In this contribution, we explore the motivation and features of infomeasure; its validation, using known analytical solutions; and exemplify its utility in a case study involving the analysis of human brain time series.</description>
