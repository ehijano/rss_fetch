      <title>Space Charge-Induced Emittance Growth in the downstream Section of ERL Injectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The injector for ERL-FEL has been widely researched. Unlike traditional linacs, the bunch in the injector for ERLs requires additional deflection and matching section at lower energies. It makes the bunch more susceptible to the effects of the Space Charge. This will lead to a degradation in beam quality. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the impact of space charge on ERL-injector and propose new design concepts to further maintain beam quality.</description>

      <title>The Development of Low-Q Cavity Type Beam Position Monitor with a Position Resolution of Nanometer for Future Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nano-meter beam size in future linear colliders requires very high resolution beam position monitor since higher resolution allows more accurate position measurement in the interaction point. We developed and tested a low-Q C-band beam position monitor with position resolution of nanometer. The C-band BPM was tested for the fast beam feedback system at the interaction point of ATF2 in KEK, in which C-band beam position monitor is called to IPBPM (Interaction Point Beam Position Monitor). The average position resolution of the developed IPBPMs was measured to be 10.1 nm at a nominal beam charge of $87\%$ of ATF2. From the measured beam position resolution, we can expect beam position resolution of around 8.8 nm and 4.4 nm with nominal ATF2 and ILC beam charge conditions, respectively, in which the position resolution is below the vertical beam size in ILC. In this paper, we describe the development of the IPBPM and the beam test results at the nanometer level in beam position resolution</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical algorithms to study longitudinal beam instabilities in double rf systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double RF systems are critical for achieving the parameters of 4th-generation light sources. These systems, comprising both main and harmonic rf cavities, relax statistical collective effects but also introduce instabilities, such as Robinson and periodic transient beam loading (PTBL) instabilities. In this paper, we provide semi-analytical algorithms designed to predict and analyze these instabilities with improved accuracy and robustness. The algorithms leverage recent advancements in the field, offering a computationally efficient and accurate complement to multibunch tracking simulations. Using the SOLEIL II project as a case study, we demonstrate how these algorithms can optimize rf cavity parameters in high-dimensional parameter spaces, thereby maximizing the Touschek lifetime. An open-source Python package, ALBuMS (Algorithms for Longitudinal Multibunch Beam Stability), is provided as an accessible tool for double RF system stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Isochronous and period-doubling diagrams for symplectic maps of the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symplectic mappings of the plane serve as key models for exploring the fundamental nature of complex behavior in nonlinear systems. Central to this exploration is the effective visualization of stability regimes, which enables the interpretation of how systems evolve under varying conditions. While the area-preserving quadratic H\'enon map has received significant theoretical attention, a comprehensive description of its mixed parameter-space dynamics remain lacking. This limitation arises from early attempts to reduce the full two-dimensional phase space to a one-dimensional projection, a simplification that resulted in the loss of important dynamical features. Consequently, there is a clear need for a more thorough understanding of the underlying qualitative aspects.
  This paper aims to address this gap by revisiting the foundational concepts of reversibility and associated symmetries, first explored in the early works of G.D. Birkhoff. We extend the original framework proposed by H\'enon by adding a period-doubling diagram to his isochronous diagram, which allows to represents the system's bifurcations and the groups of symmetric periodic orbits that emerge in typical bifurcations of the fixed point. A qualitative and quantitative explanation of the main features of the region of parameters with bounded motion is provided, along with the application of this technique to other symplectic mappings, including cases of multiple reversibility. Modern chaos indicators, such as the Reversibility Error Method and the Generalized Alignment Index, are employed to distinguish between various dynamical regimes in the mixed space of variables and parameters. These tools prove effective in differentiating regular and chaotic dynamics, as well as in identifying twistless orbits and their associated bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Micro-Bunching based on Transverse-Longitudinal Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, three specific scenarios of a novel accelerator light source mechanism called steady-state micro-bunching (SSMB) have been studied, i.e., longitudinal weak focusing, longitudinal strong focusing and generalized longitudinal strong focusing (GLSF). At present, GLSF is the most promising among them in realizing high-power short-wavelength coherent radiation with a mild requirement on the modulation laser power. Its essence is to exploit the ultrasmall natural vertical emittance of an electron beam in a planar storage ring for efficient microbunching formation, like a partial transverse-longitudinal emittance exchange at the optical laser wavelength range. Based on indepth investigation of related beam physics, a solution of a GLSF SSMB storage ring which can deliver 1 kW-average-power EUV light is presented. The work in this paper, such as the generalized Courant-Snyder formalism, the analysis of theoretical minimum emittances, transverse-longitudinal coupling dynamics, and the derivation of bunching factor and modulation strengths for laser-induced microbunching schemes, is expected to be useful not only for the development of SSMB but also for future accelerator light sources in general that demand increasingly precise electron beam phase space manipulations.</description>

      <title>Time-inversion of spatiotemporal beam dynamics using uncertainty-aware latent evolution reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charged particle dynamics under the influence of electromagnetic fields is a challenging spatiotemporal problem. Many high performance physics-based simulators for predicting behavior in a charged particle beam are computationally expensive, limiting their utility for solving inverse problems online. The problem of estimating upstream six-dimensional phase space given downstream measurements of charged particles in an accelerator is an inverse problem of growing importance. This paper introduces a reverse Latent Evolution Model (rLEM) designed for temporal inversion of forward beam dynamics. In this two-step self-supervised deep learning framework, we utilize a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to project 6D phase space projections of a charged particle beam into a lower-dimensional latent distribution. Subsequently, we autoregressively learn the inverse temporal dynamics in the latent space using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The coupled CVAE-LSTM framework can predict 6D phase space projections across all upstream accelerating sections based on single or multiple downstream phase space measurements as inputs. The proposed model also captures the aleatoric uncertainty of the high-dimensional input data within the latent space. This uncertainty, which reflects potential uncertain measurements at a given module, is propagated through the LSTM to estimate uncertainty bounds for all upstream predictions, demonstrating the robustness of the LSTM against in-distribution variations in the input data.</description>

      <title>Accurate simulation of the European XFEL scintillating screens point spread function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The European XFEL is equipped with scintillating screens as a profile measurement monitor. The scintillating material used is Gadolinium Aluminium Gallium Garnet doped with Cerium (GAGG:Ce). At most of the stations, the screen is positioned perpendicular to the electron beam, with scintillation observed at a backward angle. The scintillator thickness is usually 200 um, making the resolution worse in the plane with the angle, as it allows for the entire particle track within the scintillator to be seen. Besides, aberrations are introduced by the objective used. This study outlines an accurate simulation of the point spread function (PSF) caused by all distortions of the optical system and, in addition, a method to improve the screens resolution by including the PSF into a fitting function, assuming a Gaussian beam shape.</description>
