      <title>Four decades of photometry of XX Trianguli, `the most spotted star' in the sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past 40 years the brightness variations of XX Tri, a single line RS CVn type binary system with a synchronized K-giant primary, has exceeded one magnitude in the V band. Although these changes are primarily caused by starspots, an additional activity-related mechanism may also be behind the long-term trend of overall brightness increase.
  By compiling the most complete photometric data set so far, we attempt to examine how the nature of seasonal-to-decadal changes can be linked to global magnetism.
  The long-term brightening of XX Tri was accompanied by a gradual increase in the effective temperature, which resulted in a blueing shift in the Herzsprung-Russell diagram. In the long term, a constant cycle of about 4 years is most strongly present in the entire data. Besides, we also found a modulation of about 11 years, and a slowly decreasing cycle of about 5.7-5.2 years. From the seasonal datasets we found that the most dominant rotation-related periods are scattered around the orbital period. From this we infer a solar-type surface differential rotation, although the surface shear is significantly smaller than that of the Sun.
  The 4-year cycle indicates flip-flop-like behavior: during this time, the 2-3 active longitudes usually present on the stellar surface are rearranged. The magnitude-range changes in the long term cannot be interpreted solely as changes in the number and size of spots; the unspotted brightness of XX Tri has also increased over the decades. This should alert users of photometric spot models to reconsider the basic concept of constant unspotted brightness in similar cases.</description>

      <title>Re-examining Super-Nyquist Frequencies of 68 $\delta$ Scuti Stars Utilizing the Kepler Long Cadence Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-precision and long-duration photometry provided by the $Kepler$ mission has greatly advanced frequency analyses of a large number of pulsating stars, a fundamental step in asteroseismology. For $\delta$ Scuti stars, analyses are typically confined to frequencies below the Nyquist frequency. However, signals above this limit can be reflected into the sub-Nyquist range, especially in long-cadence data, where they may overlap with genuine pulsation modes and lead to misinterpretation. To address this issue, a recently proposed method -- the sliding Lomb-Scargle periodogram (sLSP) -- can effectively distinguish real frequencies from aliased ones. In this study, we compiled a sample of 68 $\delta$ Scuti stars whose frequency analyses were based on the $Kepler$ photometry. Using the sLSP method, we systematically examined the 1,406 reported frequencies in the literature. As a result, we identified 6 previously unrecognized reflected super-Nyquist frequencies in four stars: KIC 3440495, KIC 5709664, KIC 7368103, and KIC 9204718. We have once again demonstrated the ability of the sLSP method to detect and correct such artifacts. This technique improves the reliability of frequency selection, thereby enhancing the accuracy of asteroseismic interpretation and stellar modeling for the pulsating stars.</description>

      <title>Spatial extent of the magnetic influence of an active region on the solar atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar activity can be witnessed in the form of sunspots and active regions, where the magnetic field is enhanced by up to a factor 1000 as compared to that of the quiet Sun. In addition, solar activity manifests itself in terms of flares, jets, coronal mass ejections, and production of highly energetic particles. All these processes are governed by the solar magnetic field. Here we study the spatial reach of the influence of the magnetic field of active regions on the photosphere and in the solar corona. An active region is modelled by a magnetic dipole located under the photosphere. This simplified description allows us to study the spatial influence of an active region in the solar atmosphere in a rough but easy way. We find that the area of influence of the magnetic field of an active region on the solar atmosphere increases with, both, the maximum strength of the magnetic field in the active region and the depth of the dipole under the photosphere. For a typical active region, the magnetic field can be neglected for distances beyond ca. 700 Mm on the photosphere and two solar radii in the solar corona.</description>

      <title>EWOCS-IV: 1Ms ACIS Chandra observation of the supergiant B[e] star Wd1-9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supergiant B[e] (sgB[e]) stars are exceptionally rare objects, with only a handful of confirmed examples in the Milky Way. The evolutionary pathways leading to the sgB[e] phase remain largely debated, highlighting the need for additional observations. The sgB[e] star Wd1-9, located in the massive cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd1), is enshrouded in a dusty cocoon--likely the result of past eruptive activity--leaving its true nature enigmatic. We present the most detailed X-ray study of Wd1-9 to date, using X-rays that pierce through its cocoon with the aim to uncover its nature and evolutionary state. We utilize 36 Chandra observations of Wd1 from the 'Extended Westerlund 1 and 2 Open Clusters Survey' (EWOCS), plus eight archival datasets, totalling 1.1 Ms. This dataset allows investigation of long-term variability and periodicity in Wd1-9, while X-ray colours and spectra are analysed over time to uncover patterns that shed light on its nature. Wd1-9 exhibits significant long-term X-ray variability, within which we identify a strong 14-day periodic signal. We interpret this as the orbital period, marking the first period determination for the system. The X-ray spectrum of Wd1-9 is thermal and hard (kT approximately 3.0 keV), resembling the spectra of bright Wolf-Rayet (WR) binaries in Wd1, while a strong Fe emission line at 6.7 keV indicates hot plasma from a colliding-wind X-ray binary. Wd1-9, with evidence of past mass loss, circumbinary material, a hard X-ray spectrum, and a newly detected 14-day period, displays all the hallmarks of a binary--likely a WR+OB--that recently underwent early Case B mass transfer. Its sgB[e] classification is likely phenomenological reflecting emission from the dense circumbinary material. This places Wd1-9 in a rarely observed phase, possibly revealing a newly formed WN star, bridging the gap between immediate precursors and later evolutionary stages in Wd1.</description>

      <title>Collapsar Disk Outflows III: Detectable Neutrino and Gravitational Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from accretion disks formed during the failed collapse of a rotating massive star (a collapsar). Following black hole formation, a neutrino-cooled, shocked accretion disk forms, which displays non-spherical oscillations for a period of seconds before becoming advective and exploding the star. We compute the neutrino and GW signals (matter quadrupole) from collapsar disks using global axisymmetric, viscous hydrodynamic simulations. The neutrino signal with typical energies of O$(10)$ MeV is maximal during the neutrino-cooled (NDAF) phase that follows shock formation. This phase lasts for a few seconds and is easily detectable within O$(10-100)$ kpc by the IceCube Neutrino Telescope. Additional neutrino signatures from a precursor equatorial shock and by stochastic accretion plumes during the advective phase are detectable within the galaxy. The GW signal during the NDAF phase is detectable in the galaxy by current and next-generation ground-based observatories. The explosion (memory) GW signal is similar to that of standard core-collapse supernovae and can be probed with a deci-Hertz space-based detector. Shock oscillations during the NDAF phase impart time variations with frequency O$(10-100)$ Hz to the neutrino and GW signals, encoding information about the shock dynamics and inner disk. These time variations can be detectable in neutrinos by IceCube within O$(1-10)$ kpc depending on progenitor model, flavor transformation scenario, and detailed properties of the angular momentum transport mechanism.</description>

      <title>A Sequential Unsupervised Learning Approach for Large, Multicolor, Photometric Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observational astronomy has undergone a significant transformation driven by large-scale surveys, such as the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) Survey, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and the Gaia Mission. These programs yield large, complex datasets that pose significant challenges for conventional analysis methods, and as a result, many different machine learning techniques are being tested and deployed. We introduce a new approach to analyzing multiband photometry by using a long-short term memory autoencoder (LSTM-AE). This model views mean measurements of multicolor photometry as a sequence in wavelength in order to encode patterns present in the stars' spectral energy distributions (SEDs) into a two-dimensional latent space. We showcase this by using Pan-STARRS grizy mean magnitudes, and we use globular clusters, labels from SIMBAD, Gaia DR3 parallaxes, and PanSTARRS images to aid our analysis and understanding of the latent space. For 3,112,259 stars in an annulus around the North Galactic Cap, 99.51% have their full SED shape reconstructed--that is the absolute difference between the observed and the model predicted magnitude in every band--within five hundredths of a magnitude. We show that the model likely denoises photometric data, potentially improving the quality of measurements. Lastly, we show that the detection of rare stellar types can be performed by analyzing poorly reconstructed photometry.</description>

      <title>One Year of ASPEX-STEPS Operation: Characteristic Features, Observations and Science Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS), a subsystem of the Aditya Solar wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) onboard India's Aditya-L1 satellite, is designed to study different aspects of energetic particles in the interplanetary medium from the Sun-Earth L1 point using six detector units oriented in different directions. This article presents details of the one-year operation (08 January 2024 - 28 February 2025) of the AL1-ASPEX-STEPS after the insertion of the satellite into the final halo orbit around the L1 point with emphasis on performance, science observations, and scientific potentials. Four out of six AL1-ASPEX-STEPS units exhibit a stable detector response throughout the observation period, confirming operational robustness. This work also includes the temporal variation of particle fluxes, spectra of ions during selected quiet times and transient events, and cross-comparisons with existing instruments at the L1 point. A strong correlation (with coefficient of determination, R2 ~ 0.9) is observed in the cross-comparison study, establishing the reliability of the AL1- ASPEX-STEPS observations. AL1-ASPEX-STEPS also captures different forms of energetic ion spectra similar to those observed by previous missions. These results underscore the instrument's potential to contribute significantly to the study of energetic particle acceleration, transport, and long-term space weather monitoring from the Sun-Earth L1 vantage point.</description>

      <title>Bridging the gap: consistent modeling of protoplanetary disk heating and gap formation by planet-induced spiral shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A giant planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk excites spiral density waves, which steepen into shocks as they propagate away from the planet. These shocks lead to secular disk heating and gap opening, both of which can have important implications for the evolution of solids near the planet. To date, these two effects have largely been modeled independently. In this study, we present a self-consistent model that unifies these processes by linking shock heating and angular momentum deposition through the entropy jumps across the spiral shocks. We show that the model accurately reproduces the temperature and surface density profiles around the planet's orbit, as obtained from two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with standard $\alpha$ viscosity and $\beta$ thermal relaxation prescriptions. Furthermore, by incorporating an empirically derived scaling law for the radial distribution of the entropy jump, we construct a fully analytic model that self-consistently predicts the temperature and surface density structures of disks hosting a giant planet. This work represents a first step toward understanding how early-formed giant planets influence the formation of second-generation planets and planetesimals in their vicinity.</description>

      <title>EP250108a/SN2025kg: A Magnetar-powered Gamma-Ray Burst Supernova Originating from a Close Helium-star Binary via Isolated Binary Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SN\,2025kg, linked to EP250108a, is among the brightest broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN Ic-BL) known, showing unique helium absorptions, a late-time broad H$\alpha$, and an early bump. In this {\em{Letter}}, we propose a jet-cocoon origin to explain EP250108a as off-axis cooling emission from a mildly relativistic inner cocoon viewed at $\sim45^\circ$ and the early bump of SN\,2025kg as the outer cocoon cooling emission, both constraining an energy of $\sim(1-2)\times10^{52}{\rm{erg}}$ and a progenitor radius of $\sim5\,R_\odot$. To explain SN\,2025kg's exceptionally luminous peak, potential energy injection into the $\sim2.5\,M_\odot$ ejecta from a magnetar with initial period $\sim1.7\,{\rm{ms}}$ and magnetic field $\sim2\times10^{15}{\rm{G}}$ may be required, implying a rapidly rotating $\sim4\,M_\odot$ progenitor. Thus, the progenitor may be a low-mass helium star with an extended helium envelope, supported by helium absorption lines and an inferred weak pre-SN wind. Hydrogen-rich material may reside in the inner ejecta layers, as suggested by the late-time broad H$\alpha$, possibly originating from main-sequence companion material evaporated by the magnetar wind. Since the observed near-solar metallicity challenges the popular quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution channel, the rapidly rotating helium-star progenitor of EP250108a/SN\,2025kg might attain angular momentum by being tidally spun up by a main-sequence companion in a close binary formed through isolated binary evolution.</description>

      <title>An S-shaped filament formed due to Cloud-Cloud Collision in molecular cloud G178.28-00.61</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present compelling observational evidence supporting G178.28-00.61 as an early-stage candidate for Cloud-Cloud Collision (CCC), with indications of the formation of an S-shaped filament, evenly-separated dense cores, and young star clusters. The observations of CO molecular line emission demonstrate the existence of two interacting molecular clouds with systemic velocities of 0.8 km/s and -1.2 km/s, respectively. The convergence zone of these two clouds reveals an S-shaped filament in the JCMT 850 micron continuum image, suggesting cloud interaction. In line with expectations from CCC simulations, broad bridging features are discernible in the position-velocity diagrams. An elevated concentration of identified Class I and II young stellar objects along the filament at the intersection area further supports the hypothesis of a collision-induced origin. This observation could be explained by a recent MHD model of CCC (Kong et al. 2024), which predicts a similar morphology, scale, density, and unbound status, as well as the orientation of the polarization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to identify the cluster members, estimate cluster properties, study the dynamical state of the clusters as a function of mass, trace the existence of dynamical effects in massive stars, and check for spatial patterns of members in young clusters. We studied 14 young open clusters located within 1 kpc using the data from Gaia DR3 with the membership estimated using the GMM method. The cluster parameters such as age, distance, metallicity, and extinction were estimated by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the CMDs. These clusters are found to have ages between 6-90 Myr, located between 334-910 pc, covering a mass range, of 0.13 to 13.77 solar mass. In five of these clusters, stars from F to M spectral type show increasing velocity dispersion, a signature for dynamical relaxation. We detect high proper motion for B and A-type stars, possible walkaway stars in the other five clusters, Alessi Teutsch 5, ASCC 16, ASCC 21, IC 2395, and NGC 6405. We demonstrate the existence of mass-dependent velocity dispersion in young clusters suggestive of dynamical relaxation. The typical range of transverse velocity dispersion is found to be 0.40 - 0.70 km/s for young clusters.</description>

      <title>Ancient, eclipsing, tidally-locked: A blue lurker progenitor in the population of extreme-velocity star candidates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many extreme velocity candidate stars have been found based on \textit{Gaia} astrometry, but need spectroscopic confirmation. We select late-type hypervelocity star (HVS) candidates from the \textit{Gaia} DR3 catalog with a $1\sigma$ lower limit of the tangential velocity of 800 km\,s$^{-1}$. J1903-0023, one of the brightest targets, stands out as high priority candidate for follow-up spectroscopy using the X-shooter instrument at ESO-VLT. We determine its atmospheric parameters and abundances utilizing synthetic spectral grids and a global $\chi^2-$minimization procedure, and its stellar parameters with the help of evolutionary tracks and the spectral energy distribution. The star shows variability in its light curve and follow-up spectroscopy confirms that the star is radial-velocity variable. The spectroscopic distance of J1903-0023 is lower than that based on the parallax, indicating that the star is not a hypervelocity binary star but bound to the Galaxy. The star turned out to be of spectral type F, very similar to the extreme-velocity star J0725-2351, which we analyse in the same way as the target. Apparently, both stars are very metal poor and old halo main-sequence (sdF) stars with masses slightly below the halo turn-off mass, and share the low metallicity ([Fe/H]=-2.3,-2.6) and strong alpha enhancement ([$\alpha$/Fe]$\sim0.44$). While J0725-2351 is non-rotating ($v\sin\,i&lt;3$\,km\,s$^{-1}$), J1903-0023 is a fast rotator ($v\sin i=42.3\pm2.0$ km\,s$^{-1}$). The Gaia, and ZTF light curves show an eclipse at a 1.179 day period, similar to the rotation period of J1903-0023. We therefore conclude that J1903-0023 is a high-velocity tidally-synchronised binary most likely with a metal-poor M dwarf companion.</description>

      <title>Effects of chemically homogeneous evolution of the first stars on the 21-cm signal and reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first generation of stars, known as Population III (Pop III), played a crucial role in the early Universe through their unique formation environment and metal-free composition. These stars can undergo chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) due to fast rotation, becoming more compact and hotter/bluer than their (commonly assumed) non-rotating counterparts. In this study, we investigate the impact of Pop III CHE on the 21-cm signal and cosmic reionization under various assumptions on Pop III star formation, such as their formation efficiency, initial mass function, and transition to metal-enriched star formation. We combine stellar spectra computed by detailed atmosphere models with semi-numerical simulations of Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization ($z\sim 6-30$). The key effect of CHE arises from the boosted ionizing power of Pop III stars, which reduces the Pop III stellar mass density required to reproduce the observed Thomson scattering optical depth by a factor of $\sim 2$. Meanwhile, the maximum 21-cm global absorption signal is shallower by up to $\sim 15$ mK (11%), partly due to the reduced Lyman-band emission from CHE, and the large-scale ($k\sim 0.2\ \rm cMpc^{-1}$) power drops by a factor of a few at $z\gtrsim 25$. In general, the effects of CHE can be comparable to those of Pop III star formation parameters, showing an interesting interplay with distinct features in different epochs. These results highlight the importance of metal-free/poor stellar evolution in understanding the early Universe and suggest that future studies should consider joint constraints on the physics of star/galaxy formation and stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>Core-Corona Decomposition of Very Compact (Neutron) Stars: Accounting for Current Data of XTE J1814-338</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A core-corona decomposition of compact (neutron) star models was compared with the current mass-radius data of the outlier XTE~J1814-338. The corona (which may also be dubbed the envelope, halo or outer crust) is assumed to be of Standard Model matter, with an equation of state that is supposed to be faithfully known and accommodates nearly all other neutron star data. The core, solely parameterized by its mass, radius and transition pressure, presents a challenge regarding its composition. We derived a range of core parameters needed to describe the current data of XTE J1814-338.</description>

      <title>Inflated hot Jupiters: Inferring average atmospheric velocity via Ohmic models coupled with internal dynamo evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inflated radii observed in hundreds of hot Jupiters (HJ) represent a long-standing open issue. In this study, we quantitatively investigate this phenomenon within the framework of Ohmic dissipation arising from magnetic induction in the atmosphere, one of the most promising mechanisms for explaining the radius anomaly. We simulate the evolution of irradiated giant planets with MESA, spanning the observed range of masses and equilibrium temperatures, incorporating an internal source of Ohmic dissipation that extends to deep layers of the envelope. We infer average atmospheric wind intensities, averaged in the region $p &lt; 10$ bar, in the range 0.01-1 km/s in order to reproduce the range of observed radii, decreasing roughly linearly with planetary mass, and much more steeply with equilibrium temperature. This is consistent with the expected effects of magnetic drag from the induced field, which is higher for more intense irradiation, via conductivity, and for larger masses, which have higher dynamo fields. Due to the evolution of the dynamo field and the proportionality of the induced currents on it, the Ohmic efficiency typically decreases by at least one order of magnitude from 0.1 to 10 Gyr, at contrast with the common assumption of a constant-in-time value. Notably, the extent of the main convective region, and the associated heat flux supporting the dynamo, is reduced in the presence of strong Ohmic dissipation, which in turn depends on the dynamo field strength, generating a non-trivial coupling of the latter with the atmospheric induction, potentially leading to an oscillatory behaviour of the field strength. These findings remain generally valid even when accounting for a long-term increase in the main-sequence host star luminosity, although this case can more readily lead to HJ re-inflation, consistent with previous studies.</description>
