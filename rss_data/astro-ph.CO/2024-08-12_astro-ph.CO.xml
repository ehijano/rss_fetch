      <title>On the (higher multipoles) variance asymmetry in the cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the cosmic microwave background (CMB) map looking for features beyond cosmological isotropy. We began by tiling the CMB variance map (which are produced by different smoothing scales) with stripes of different sizes along the most prominent dipole direction. We were able to confirm previous findings regarding the significance of the dipole. Furthermore, we discovered that some of the higher multipoles exhibit significance comparable to the dipole which naturally depends on the smoothing scales. At the end, we discussed this result having an eye on look-elsewhere-effect. We believe our results may indicate an anomalous patch in the CMB sky that warrants further investigation.</description>

      <title>Late-time cosmology in $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity: Analytical solutions and observational fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examined the late-time cosmic expansion of the universe within the framework of $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity, where $Q$ denotes the non-metricity and $L_{m}$ represents the matter Lagrangian. We analyzed a linear $f(Q, L_m)$ model of the form $f(Q, L_m) = -\alpha Q + 2 L_{m} + \beta$. Using MCMC methods, we constrained the model parameters $H_0$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ with various datasets, including $H(z)$, Pantheon+SH0ES, and BAO data. For the $H(z)$ dataset, we found $H_0 = 67.90 \pm 0.66$, $\alpha = 0.1072_{-0.0069}^{+0.0054}$, and $\beta = -1988.2 \pm 1.0$. For the Pantheon+SH0ES dataset, $H_0 = 70.05 \pm 0.68$, $\alpha = 0.0916_{-0.0033}^{+0.0028}$, and $\beta = -1988.3 \pm 1.0$. For the BAO dataset, $H_0 = 68.1 \pm 1.0$, $\alpha = 0.1029_{-0.0052}^{+0.0041}$, and $\beta = -1988.24 \pm 0.99$. Moreover, the energy density remains positive and approaches zero in the distant future, and the deceleration parameter indicates a transition from deceleration to acceleration, with transition redshifts of $z_t = 0.60$, $z_t = 0.78$, and $z_t = 0.66$ for the respective datasets. These findings align with previous observational studies and contribute to our understanding of the universe's expansion dynamics.</description>

      <title>The evolving role of astrophysical modelling in dark matter halo relaxation response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the change in the radial distribution of dark matter within haloes in response to baryonic astrophysical processes in galaxies at different epochs, investigating the role of astrophysical modeling in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations in producing the response. We find that the linear quasi-adiabatic relaxation with additional dependence on the halo-centric distance provides a good description not only at $z=0$, but also at an earlier epoch ($z=1$) in the IllustrisTNG simulation suite, with parameters being more universal across a much larger variety of haloes at $z=1$ than at $z=0$. Through systematic analysis of a large collection of simulations from the CAMELS project, we find that the baryonic prescriptions for both AGN and stellar feedbacks have a strong influence on the relaxation response of the dark matter halo. In particular, only the parameters controlling the overall feedback energy flux have an effect on the relaxation response, while the wind speed and burstiness have negligible effect on the relaxation at a fixed amount of energy flux. However, the exact role of these parameters on the relaxation depends on the redshift. We also study the role of a variety of baryonic astrophysical processes through the EAGLE physics variation simulations. While these depict a similar picture regarding the importance of feedback effects, they also reveal that the gas equation of state has one of the strongest influences on the relaxation response, consistent with the expectation from self-similar analyses.</description>

      <title>Modelling DSA, FAST and CRAFT surveys in a z-DM analysis and constraining a minimum FRB energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio burst (FRB) science primarily revolves around two facets: the origin of these bursts and their use in cosmological studies. This work follows from previous redshift-dispersion measure ($z$-DM) analyses in which we model instrumental biases and simultaneously fit population parameters and cosmological parameters to the observed population of FRBs. This sheds light on both the progenitors of FRBs and cosmological questions. Previously, we have completed similar analyses with data from the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and the Murriyang (Parkes) Multibeam system. With this manuscript, we additionally incorporate data from the Deep Synoptic Array (DSA) and the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), invoke a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler and implement uncertainty in the Galactic DM contributions. The latter leads to larger uncertainties in derived model parameters than previous estimates despite the additional data. We provide refined constraints on FRB population parameters and derive a new constraint on the minimum FRB energy of log$\,E_{\mathrm{min}}$(erg)=39.49$^{+0.39}_{-1.48}$ which is significantly higher than bursts detected from strong repeaters. This result may indicate a low-energy turnover in the luminosity function or may suggest that strong repeaters have a different luminosity function to single bursts. We also predict that FAST will detect 25-41% of their FRBs at $z \gtrsim 2$ and DSA will detect 2-12% of their FRBs at $z \gtrsim 1$.</description>

      <title>Searching for blue in the dark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primordial power spectrum of curvature perturbations has been well-measured on large scales but remains fairly unconstrained at smaller scales, where significant deviations from $\Lambda$CDM may occur. Measurements of 21-cm intensity mapping in the dark ages promise to access very small scales that have yet to be probed, extending beyond the reach of CMB and galaxy surveys. In this paper, we investigate how small-scale power-law enhancements -- or blue tilts -- of the primordial power spectrum affect the 21-cm power spectrum. We consider generic enhancements due to curvature modes, isocurvature modes, and runnings of the spectral tilt. We present forecasts for Earth- and lunar-based instruments to detect a blue-tilted primordial spectrum. We find that an Earth-based instrument capable of reaching the dark ages could detect any enhancements of power on nearly all the scales it can observe, which depends on the baseline of the interferometer. The smallest scales observed by such an instrument can only detect a very strong enhancement. However, an instrument on the far side of the Moon of the same size would be able to probe shallower slopes with higher precision. We forecast results for instruments with $100 \, {\rm km} \, (3000 \, {\rm km})$ baselines and find that they can probe up to scales of order $k_{\rm max} \sim 8 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1} \, (k_{\rm max} \sim 250 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1})$, thereby providing invaluable information on exotic physics and testing inflationary models on scales not otherwise accessible.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of Nanohertz Gravitational Wave Background and Individual Sources from Supermassive Binary Black Holes: Probe of Cosmic Large Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several pulsar timing array (PTA) groups have recently claimed the detection of nanohertz gravitational wave (GW) background, but the origin of this GW signal remains unclear. Nanohertz GWs generated by supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs) are one of the most important GW sources in the PTA band. Utilizing data from numerical cosmology simulation, we generate mock SMBBHs within the observable universe and treat them as PTA band GW sources. We present their statistical properties, and analyze the isotropic and anisotropic characteristics of the gravitational wave background (GWB) signal they produce. Specifically, we derive the characteristic amplitude and spectrum of the GWB signal, and calculate the angular power spectrum for both GW strains/energy density and the position distribution of GW sources. We predict that the angular power spectrum of GWB energy density has $C_1/C_0\approx0.40\pm0.32$, and $C_l/C_0\simeq \frac{1}{2(2l+1)}$ (for $l&gt;1$). Furthermore, for the upcoming Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) and Square Kilometre Array (SKA) PTA, we predict the spatial distribution, numbers and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distribution of individual GW sources that may be detected with SNR&gt;8, and study the anisotropy property in the spatial distribution of these individual GW sources.</description>

      <title>On the origin of transient features in cosmological N-Body Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of gravitational clustering at small scales on larger scales by studying mode coupling between virialised halos. We build on the calculation by Peebles (1974) where it was shown that a virialised halo does not contribute any mode coupling terms at small wave numbers $k$. Using a perturbative expansion in wave number, we show that this effect is small and arises from the deviation of halo shapes from spherical and also on tidal interactions between halos. We connect this with the impact of finite mass resolution of cosmological N-Body simulations on the evolution of perturbations at early times. This difference between the expected evolution and the evolution obtained in cosmological N-Body simulations can be quantified using such an estimate. We also explore the impact of a finite shortest scale up to which the desired power spectrum is realised in simulations. Several simulation studies have shown that this effect is small in comparison with the effect of perturbations at large scales on smaller scales. It is nevertheless important to study these effects and develop a general approach for estimating their magnitude. This is especially relevant in the present era of precision cosmology. We provide basic estimates of the magnitude of these effects and their power spectrum dependence. We find that the impact of small scale cutoff in the initial power spectrum and discreteness increases with $(n+3)$, with $n$ being the index of the power spectrum. In general, we recommend that cosmological simulation data should be used only if the scale of non-linearity, defined as the scale where the linearly extrapolated {\it rms} amplitude of fluctuations is unity, is larger than the average inter-particle separation.</description>

      <title>Third-order corrections to the slow-roll expansion: calculation and constraints with Planck, ACT, SPT, and BICEP/Keck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the primordial power spectra (PPS) of scalar and tensor perturbations, derived through the slow-roll approximation. By solving the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation and the tensor perturbation equation with Green's function techniques, we extend the PPS calculations to third-order corrections, providing a comprehensive perturbative expansion in terms of slow-roll parameters. We investigate the accuracy of the analytic predictions with the numerical solutions of the perturbation equations for a selection of single-field slow-roll inflationary models. We derive the constraints on the Hubble flow functions $\epsilon_i$ from Planck, ACT, SPT, and BICEP/Keck data. We find an upper bound $\epsilon_1 \lesssim 0.002$ at 95\% CL dominated by BICEP/Keck data and robust to all the different combination of datasets. We derive the constraint $\epsilon_2 \simeq 0.031 \pm 0.004$ at 68\% confidence level (CL) from the combination of Planck data and late-time probes such as baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and supernovae data at first order in the slow-roll expansion. The uncertainty on $\epsilon_2$ gets larger including second- and third-order corrections, allowing for a non-vanishing running and running of the running respectively, leading to $\epsilon_2 \simeq 0.034 \pm 0.007$ at 68\% CL. We find $\epsilon_3 \simeq 0.1 \pm 0.4$ at 95\% CL both at second and at third order in the slow-roll expansion of the spectra. $\epsilon_4$ remains always unconstrained. The combination of Planck and SPT data leads to slightly tighter constraints on $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_3$. On the contrary, the combination of Planck data with ACT measurements, which point to higher values of the scalar spectral index compared to Planck findings, leads to shifts in the means and maximum likelihood values for $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_3$.</description>

      <title>Dancing with invisible partners: Three-body exchanges with primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The abundance of massive primordial black holes has historically been constrained by dynamical probes. Since these objects can participate in hard few-body scattering processes, they can readily transfer energy to stellar systems, and, in particular, can disrupt wide binaries. However, disruption is not the only possible outcome of such few-body processes. Primordial black holes could also participate in exchange processes, in which one component of a binary system is ejected and replaced by the black hole itself. In this case, the remaining object in the binary would dynamically appear to have an invisible companion. We study the rate of exchange processes for primordial black holes as a component of dark matter and evaluate possible mechanisms for detecting such binaries. We find that many such binaries plausibly exist in the Solar neighborhood, and show that this process can account for observed binary systems whose properties run counter to the predictions of isolated binary evolution.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Anisotropy and Bianchi Characterization: Killing vector fields and the implied finding of their metric frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the largest scales the universe appears to be almost perfectly homogeneous and isotropic, adhering to the cosmological principle. On smaller scales inhomogeneities and anisotropies become increasingly prominent, reflecting the origin, emergence and formation of structure in the Universe and its cosmological impact. Also, a range of tensions between various cosmological observations may suggest it to be necessary to explore the consequences of such deviations from the ideal uniform universe. In this study, we restrict this to an investigation of anisotropies on the nature of the Universe. This motivates a more thorough understanding of the manifestation of anisotropy in cosmological applications. When letting go of the assumption of isotropy, spacetime metrics become homogeneous and completely anisotropic. As such, the Lie algebras of Killing vector fields will be 3D, and fit into the so-called 9-part Bianchi classification. This work strives to, given a suitable 3D Lie algebra of vector fields $\{\xi_a\}_{a=1,2,3}$ reconstruct the basis for a metric on which this Lie algebra is Killing. Through finding a determining equation for the frame invariant under $\{\xi_a\}$ and using the method of characteristics to solve it, expressions for said invariant frame in terms of the $\{\xi_a\}$ are obtained. This leads to general equations for the invariant frame in terms of the $\{\xi_a\}$, organized by Bianchi class. Some examples demonstrating this method are worked out.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Supernova Constraints on Millicharged Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot and dense environment of the supernova core serves as an extraordinary factory for new feebly-interacting particles. Low-energy supernovae, a class of supernovae with low explosion energy, are particularly intriguing due to their stringent constraints on the energy transfer caused by new particles from the supernova core to the mantle. We investigate low-energy supernova constraints on millicharged particles by considering three production channels in the core: plasmon decay, proton bremsstrahlung, and electron-positron annihilation processes. We find that the electron-positron annihilation process, previously omitted in supernova studies on millicharged particles, is the dominant production channel in the high-mass region. By studying the energy deposition due to Coulomb scatterings with protons in the supernova mantle, we find that low-energy supernovae impose the most stringent constraints on millicharged particles in the mass range of $\sim(10-200)$ MeV, surpassing the energy loss limit from SN1987A by nearly one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Galaxy-dark matter connection from weak lensing in imaging surveys: Impact of photometric redshift errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The uncertainties in photometric redshifts and stellar masses from imaging surveys affect galaxy sample selection, their abundance measurements, as well as the measured weak lensing signals. We develop a framework to assess the systematic effects arising from the use of redshifts and stellar masses derived from photometric data, and explore their impact on the inferred galaxy-dark matter connection. We use galaxy catalogues from the UniverseMachine (UM) galaxy formation model to create Pz-mock galaxy samples that approximately follow the redshift errors in the Subaru HSC survey. We focus on galaxy stellar-mass thresholds ranging from $\log\left[M_*/(h^{-2}M_\odot)\right]$ from $8.6$ to $11.2$ in steps of 0.2 dex within two redshift bins $0.30-0.55$ and $0.55-0.80$. A comparison of the Pz-mock samples to true galaxy samples in UM shows a relatively mild sample contamination for thresholds with $\log\left[M_{*,\rm limit}/(h^{-2}M_\odot)\right]&lt;10.6$, while an increasing contamination towards the more massive end. We show how such contamination affects the measured abundance and the lensing signal. A joint HOD modelling of the observables from the Pz-mock compared to the truth in the UM informs the systematic biases on the average halo masses of central galaxies in the HSC survey. Even with a reasonably conservative choice of photo-$z$ errors in Pz-mock, we show that the inferred halo masses deduced from the HSC galaxies for low-mass thresholds will have a systematic bias smaller than 0.05 dex. Beyond $\log\left[M_{*,\rm limit}/(h^{-2}M_\odot)\right]=10.6$, the inferred halo masses show an increasing systematic bias with stellar mass, reaching values of order $0.2$ dex, larger than the statistical error.</description>

      <title>$SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ Cosmological Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cosmological theory where the kinetic term and potential have $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry. Potentials have a plateau at large values of the inflaton field where the axion forms a flat direction, a saddle point at $\tau=i$, and a minimum at $\tau=e^{2\pi i\over 3}$. Due to the underlying hyperbolic geometry, the theory exhibits an $\alpha$-attractor behavior: its cosmological predictions are stable with respect to certain modifications of the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant potentials. We present a supersymmetric version of this theory in the framework of $\overline {D3}$ induced geometric inflation. The choice of $\alpha$ is determined by underlying string compactification. For example, in a CY compactification with $T^2$, one has $3\alpha=1$, the lowest discrete Poincar\'e disk target for LiteBIRD.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cosmological Parameters with Viscous Modified Chaplygin Gas and Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin Gas Models in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity: Utilizing Late-time Datasets</title>

Abstract: This study examines accelerated cosmic expansion using the Viscous Modified Chaplygin Gas (VMMG) and Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin Gas (GCCM) within Horava-Lifshitz gravity. Our aim is to constrain essential cosmological parameters, such as the Hubble Parameter ($H_{0}$) and Sound Horizon ($r_{d}$). We utilize late-time datasets: 17 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation observations, 33 Cosmic Chronometer measurements, 40 Type Ia Supernovae data points, 24 quasar Hubble diagram data points, and 162 Gamma Ray Bursts data points, along with the latest determination of the Hubble constant (R22). Treating $r_{d}$ as a free parameter offers several advantages, including mitigating bias, enhancing precision, and improving compatibility with various datasets. By introducing random correlations in the covariance matrix during simulation, errors are effectively reduced. Our estimated values of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and $r_{d}$ consistently align with measurements from both the Planck and SDSS experiments. Cosmographic tests provide valuable insights into the dynamics of various cosmological models, enriching our understanding of cosmic evolution. Statefinder diagnostics offer deeper insights into cosmic expansion dynamics, aiding in distinguishing between cosmological frameworks. Furthermore, the $o_{m}$ diagnostic test reveals that at late times, VMMG falls into the phantom region, while GCCM falls into the quintessence region. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) support all models, indicating plausible explanations. Notably, the $\Lambda$CDM model emerges with the lowest AIC score, suggesting its relatively superior fit. Validation via the reduced $\chi_{\text{red}}^{2}$ statistic confirms satisfactory fits across all models, reinforcing their credibility.</description>

      <title>A theoretical perspective on the almost dark galaxy Nube: exploring the fuzzy dark matter model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent astronomical observations, an almost dark galaxy, designated as Nube, has unveiled an intriguing anomaly in its stellar distribution. Specifically, Nube exhibits an exceptionally low central brightness, with the 2D half-light radius of its stars far exceeding the typical values found in dwarf galaxies, and even surpassing those observed in ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). This phenomenon is difficult to explain within the framework of cold dark matter (CDM). Meanwhile, due to its ultralight particle mass, fuzzy dark matter (FDM) exhibits a de Broglie wavelength on the order of kiloparsecs under the typical velocities of galaxies. The interference between different modes of the FDM wave gives rise to fluctuations in the gravitational field, which can lead to the dynamical heating of stars within galaxies, resulting in an expansion of their spatial distribution. In this paper, we aim to interpret the anomalous stellar distribution observed in Nube as a consequence of the dynamical heating effect induced by FDM. Our findings suggest that a FDM particle mass around $1-2\times 10^{-23}$ eV can effectively account for this anomaly. And we propose that the FDM dynamical heating effect provides a new insight into understanding the formation of field UDGs.</description>

      <title>Redshift drift in a universe with structure III: Numerical relativity</title>

Abstract: Measurements of the cosmic redshift drift - the change in redshift of a source over time - will enable independent detection of cosmological expansion thanks to the immense precision soon reached by new facilities such as the Square Kilometer Array Observatory and the Extremely Large Telescope. We conduct the first ever redshift drift computation in fully relativistic cosmological simulations, with the simulations performed with the Einstein Toolkit. We compute the redshift drift over the full skies of 50 synthetic observers in the simulation. We compare all-sky averages for each observer - and across all observers - to the Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) model which represents the large-scale spatially-averaged spacetime of the simulation. We find that at $z\approx0.2$ the mean redshift drift across the sky for all observers deviates from the EdS prediction at the percent level, reducing to $\sim0.1\%$ by $z\approx 1$. However, fluctuations in the redshift drift across the sky are $\sim 10-30\%$ at $z\approx 0.1$ and a few percent at $z\approx 0.5$. Such fluctuations are large enough to potentially exceed the expected precision of upcoming redshift drift measurements. Additionally, we find that along 0.48% of the light rays the redshift drift becomes temporarily positive at very low redshift of $z\lesssim 0.02$. This occurs despite our simulation data being based on a matter-dominated model universe. By including a cosmological constant, we expect a slower growth of structures than in the leading-order EdS space-time, and this may reduce the anisotropy over the observers' skies, although we generally expect our results to hold as order-of-magnitude estimates. Redshift drift is arguably one of the most important measurements to be made by next-generation telescopes. Our results collectively serve as preparation for interpreting such a measurement in the presence of realistic cosmic structures.</description>

      <title>Turbulence revealed by wavelet transform: power spectrum and intermittency for the velocity field of the cosmic baryonic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use continuous wavelet transform techniques to construct the global and environment-dependent wavelet statistics, such as energy spectrum and kurtosis, to study the fluctuation and intermittency of the turbulent motion in the cosmic fluid velocity field with the IllustrisTNG simulation data. We find that the peak scale of the energy spectrum define a characteristic scale, which can be regarded as the integral scale of turbulence, and the Nyquist wavenumber can be regarded as the dissipation scale. With these two characteristic scales, the energy spectrum can be divided into the energy-containing range, the inertial range and the dissipation range of turbulence. The wavelet kurtosis is an increasing function of the wavenumber $k$, first grows rapidly then slowly with $k$, indicating that the cosmic fluid becomes increasingly intermittent with $k$. In the energy-containing range, the energy spectrum increases significantly from $z = 2$ to $1$, but remains almost unchanged from $z = 1$ to $0$. We find that both the environment-dependent spectrum and kurtosis are similar to the global ones, and the magnitude of the spectrum is smallest in the lowest-density and largest in the highest-density environment, suggesting that the cosmic fluid is more turbulent in a high-density than in a low-density environment. In the inertial range, the energy spectrum's exponent is steeper than both the Kolmogorov and Burgers exponents, indicating more efficient energy transfer compared to Kolmogorov or Burgers turbulence.</description>

Abstract: I argue that research in physics operates under an implicit community philosophy, and I offer a definition I think physicists would accept, by and large. I compare this definition to what philosophers, sociologists, and historians of science, with physicists, say we are doing.</description>

      <title>The influence of baryons on low-mass haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Voids-within-Voids-within-Voids (VVV) project used dark-matter-only simulations to study the abundance and structure of dark matter haloes over the full mass range populated in the standard $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmology. Here we explore how baryonic effects modify these results for $z=0$ halo masses in the range $10^4$ to $10^7~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, below the threshold for galaxy formation. Our main study focuses on three simulations from identical initial conditions at $z=127$, one following dark matter only, one including non-radiative gas, and one additionally including the baryonic physics relevant in this halo mass range (cooling and photoheating). In the non-radiative simulation, above $10^{5.5}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, halo abundance and internal structure are very similar to the dark-matter-only simulation, and the baryon to dark matter ratio is everywhere close to the cosmic value. At lower mass, this ratio drops and haloes are less concentrated and less massive in the non-radiative case. Test simulations at higher resolution show this to be mainly a resolution effect; the expected drop in baryon content due to residual pressure effects only becomes substantial for $z=0$ haloes below $\sim 10^{2.7}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. However, gas is heated by reionization at $z=6$ in our "full physics" run, and this results in almost complete expulsion of gas from all haloes in our simulated mass range. This suppresses the halo mass function by $\sim 30 \%$, lowers halo concentration, and consequently weakens the dark matter annihilation signal by $\sim 40-60 \%$.</description>

      <title>Finite distance effects on the Hellings-Downs curve in modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is growing interest in the overlap reduction function in pulsar timing array observations as a probe of modified gravity. However, current approximations to the Hellings-Downs curve for subluminal gravitational wave propagation, say $v&lt;1$, diverge at small angular pulsar separation. In this paper, we find that the ORF for the $v&lt;1$ case is sensitive to finite distance effects. First, we show that finite distance effects introduce an effective cut-off in the spherical harmonics decomposition at $\ell\sim \sqrt{1-v^2} \, kL$, where $\ell$ is the multipole number, $k$ the wavenumber of the gravitational wave and $L$ the distance to the pulsars. Then, we find that the overlap reduction function in the small angle limit approaches a value given by $\pi kL\,v^2\,(1-v^2)^2$ times a normalization factor, exactly matching the value for the autocorrelation recently derived. Although we focus on the $v&lt;1$ case, our formulation is valid for any value of $v$.</description>

      <title>Why artificial disruption is not a concern for current cosmological simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that cold dark matter subhalos are hard to disrupt and almost all cases of subhalo disruption observed in numerical simulations are due to numerical effects. However, these findings primarily relied on idealized numerical experiments, which do not fully capture the realistic conditions of subhalo evolution within a hierarchical cosmological context. Based on the Aquarius simulations, we identify clear segregation in the population of surviving and disrupted subhalos, which corresponds to two distinct acquisition channels of subhalos. We find that all of the first-order subhalos accreted after redshift 2 survive to the present time without suffering from artificial disruption. On the other hand, most of the disrupted subhalos are sub-subhalos accreted at high redshift. Unlike the first-order subhalos, sub-subhalos experience pre-processing and many of them are accreted through major mergers at high redshift, resulting in very high mass loss rates. We confirm these high mass loss rates are physical through both numerical experiments and semi-analytical modeling, thus supporting a physical origin for their rapid disappearance in the simulation. Even though we cannot verify whether these subhalos have fully disrupted or not, their extreme mass loss rates dictate that they can at most contribute a negligible fraction to the very low mass end of the subhalo mass function. We thus conclude that current state-of-the-art cosmological simulations have reliably resolved the subhalo population.</description>
