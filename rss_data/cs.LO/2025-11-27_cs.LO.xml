      <title>Coco: Corecursion with Compositional Heterogeneous Productivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary proof assistants impose restrictive syntactic guardedness conditions that reject many valid corecursive definitions. Existing approaches to overcome these restrictions present a fundamental trade-off between coverage and automation.
  We present Compositional Heterogeneous Productivity (CHP), a theoretical framework that unifies high automation with extensive coverage for corecursive definitions. CHP introduces heterogeneous productivity applicable to functions with diverse domain and codomain types, including non-coinductive types. Its key innovation is compositionality: the productivity of composite functions is systematically computed from their components, enabling modular reasoning about complex corecursive patterns.
  Building on CHP, we develop Coco, a corecursion library for Rocq that provides extensive automation for productivity computation and fixed-point generation.</description>

      <title>Common Knowledge, Sailboats, and Publicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a recent puzzle about common knowledge, the ``sailboat" case (Lederman, 2018), and argue that Lewisian common knowledge allows us to reconcile the pre-theoretical intuition that certain facts are ``public" in such situations, while these facts cannot be common knowledge in the classical, iterative sense. The crux of the argument is to understand Lewisian common knowledge as an account of what it means for an event to be public. We first formulate this argument informally to clarify its philosophical commitment and then propose one way to capture it formally in epistemic-plausibility models. Taken together, we take the philosophical and the formal arguments as providing evidence that Lewisian common knowledge is a plausible account of what it means for an event to be public.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation Logic: Separation Through Ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Bifurcation Logic, BL, which combines a basic classical modality with separating conjunction * together with its naturally associated multiplicative implication, that is defined using the modal ordering. Specifically, a formula A*B is true at a world w if and only if each of A,B holds at worlds that are each above w, on separate branches of the order, and have no common upper bound. We provide a labelled tableaux calculus for BL and establish soundness and completeness relative to its relational semantics. The standard finite model property fails for BL. However, we show that, in the absence of multiplicative implication, but in the presence of *, every model has an equivalent finite representation and that this is sufficient to obtain decidability. We illustrate the use of BL through an example of modelling multi-agent access control that is quite generic in its form, suggesting many applications.</description>

      <title>Two behavioural pseudometrics for continuous-time Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bisimulation is a concept that captures behavioural equivalence of states in a variety of types of transition systems. It has been widely studied in discrete-time settings where a key notion is the bisimulation metric which quantifies "how similar two states are". In [ 11], we generalized the concept of bisimulation metric in order to metrize the behaviour of continuous-time Markov processes. Similarly to the discrete-time case, we constructed a pseudometric following two iterative approaches - through a functional and through a real-valued logic, and showed that the outcomes coincide: the pseudometric obtained from the logic is a specific fixpoint of the functional which yields our first pseudometric. However, different from the discrete-time setting, in which the process has a step-by-step dynamics, the behavioural pseudometric we constructed applies to Markov processes that evolve continuously through time, such as diffusions and jump diffusions. While our treatment of the pseudometric in [11] relied on the time-indexed Markov kernels, in [ 8 , 9, 10 ], we showed the importance of trajectories in the consideration of behavioural equivalences for true continuous-time Markov processes. In this paper, we take the work from [11 ] further and propose a second behavioural pseudometric for diffusions based on trajectories. We conduct a similar study of this pseudometric from both the perspective of a functional and the viewpoint of a real-valued logic. We also compare this pseudometric with the first pseudometric obtained in [11].</description>

      <title>Paraconsistent-Lib: an intuitive PAL2v algorithm Python Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Paraconsistent-Lib, an open-source, easy-to-use Python library for building PAL2v algorithms in reasoning and decision-making systems. Paraconsistent-Lib is designed as a general-purpose library of PAL2v standard calculations, presenting three types of results: paraconsistent analysis in one of the 12 classical lattice PAL2v regions, paraconsistent analysis node (PAN) outputs, and a decision output. With Paraconsistent-Lib, well-known PAL2v algorithms such as Para-analyzer, ParaExtrCTX, PAL2v Filter, paraconsistent analysis network (PANnet), and paraconsistent neural network (PNN) can be written in stand-alone or network form, reducing complexity, code size, and bugs, as two examples presented in this paper. Given its stable state, Paraconsistent-Lib is an active development to respond to user-required features and enhancements received on GitHub.</description>

      <title>The Dual of Quantifier Elimination: Boolean Elimination over C and R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every finite Boolean combination of polynomial equalities and inequalities in C^n admits two uniform normal forms: an $\exists\forall$ form and a $\forall\exists$ form, each using a single polynomial equation. Both forms have one existentially quantified variable and one universally quantified variable; regardless of the complexity of the original formula, no longer quantifier blocks are needed. The constructions are explicit and have linear degree bounds. Optimality results demonstrate that no purely existential or universal normal form is possible over C.
  Over R, similar normal forms exist, including a singly-quantified $\exists$ form for Boolean combinations of equations and inequations, and $\exists^d$ and $\forall\exists$ forms for Boolean combinations involving order inequalities. Prior results establish the existence of a $\exists$ normal form for R by other methods. Finally, similar forms exist over Q as well.
  These results may be viewed as a dual to classical quantifier elimination: instead of removing quantifiers at the cost of increased Boolean complexity, they remove Boolean structure at the cost of a short, fixed quantifier prefix.</description>

      <title>General Decidability Results for Systems with Continuous Counters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counters that hold natural numbers are ubiquitous in modeling and verifying software systems; for example, they model dynamic creation and use of resources in concurrent programs. Unfortunately, such discrete counters often lead to extremely high complexity. Continuous counters are an efficient over-approximation of discrete counters. They are obtained by relaxing the original counters to hold values over the non-negative rational numbers.
  This work shows that continuous counters are extraordinarily well-behaved in terms of decidability. Our main result is that, despite continuous counters being infinite-state, the language of sequences of counter instructions that can arrive in a given target configuration, is regular. Moreover, a finite automaton for this language can be computed effectively. This implies that a wide variety of transition systems can be equipped with continuous counters, while maintaining decidability of reachability properties. Examples include higher-order recursion schemes, well-structured transition systems, and decidable extensions of discrete counter systems.
  We also prove a non-elementary lower bound for the size of the resulting finite automaton.</description>

      <title>Natural Strategic Ability in Stochastic Multi-Agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strategies synthesized using formal methods can be complex and often require infinite memory, which does not correspond to the expected behavior when trying to model Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). To capture such behaviors, natural strategies are a recently proposed framework striking a balance between the ability of agents to strategize with memory and the model-checking complexity, but until now has been restricted to fully deterministic settings. For the first time, we consider the probabilistic temporal logics PATL and PATL* under natural strategies (NatPATL and NatPATL*, resp.). As main result we show that, in stochastic MAS, NatPATL model-checking is NP-complete when the active coalition is restricted to deterministic strategies. We also give a 2NEXPTIME complexity result for NatPATL* with the same restriction. In the unrestricted case, we give an EXPSPACE complexity for NatPATL and 3EXPSPACE complexity for NatPATL*.</description>

      <title>On Polynomial-Time Decidability of k-Negations Fragments of First-Order Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a generic framework that provides sufficient conditions for guaranteeing polynomial-time decidability of fixed-negation fragments of first-order theories that adhere to certain fixed-parameter tractability requirements. It enables deciding sentences of such theories with arbitrary existential quantification, conjunction and a fixed number of negation symbols in polynomial time. It was recently shown by Nguyen and Pak [SIAM J. Comput. 51(2): 1--31 (2022)] that an even more restricted such fragment of Presburger arithmetic (the first-order theory of the integers with addition and order) is NP-hard. In contrast, by application of our framework, we show that the fixed negation fragment of weak Presburger arithmetic, which drops the order relation from Presburger arithmetic in favour of equality, is decidable in polynomial time. We give two further examples of instantiations of our framework, showing polynomial-time decidability of the fixed negation fragments of weak linear real arithmetic and of the restriction of Presburger arithmetic in which each inequality contains at most one variable.</description>

      <title>Formalizing Computational Paths and Fundamental Groups in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational paths treat propositional equality as explicit paths built from labelled deduction steps and rewrite rules. This view originates in work by de Queiroz and collaborators [1] and yields a weak groupoid structure for equality, together with a computational account of homotopy inspired by homotopy type theory. In this paper we present a complete mechanization of this framework in Lean 4 and show how it supports concrete homotopy theoretic computations. Our contributions are threefold. First, we formalize the theory of computational paths in Lean, including path formation, composition, inverses, and a rewrite system that identifies redundant or trivial paths. We prove that equality types with computational paths carry a weak groupoid structure in the sense of the original theory. Second, we organize this material into a reusable Lean library, ComputationalPathsLean, which exposes an interface for paths, rewrites, and loop spaces. This library allows later developments to treat computational paths as a drop-in replacement for propositional equality when reasoning about homotopical structure. Third, we apply the library to six canonical examples in algebraic topology. We give Lean proofs that the fundamental group of the circle is isomorphic to the integers, the cylinder and Mobius band also have fundamental group isomorphic to the integers (via retraction to the circle), the fundamental group of the torus is isomorphic to the product of two copies of the integers, the fundamental group of the Klein bottle is isomorphic to the semidirect product Z cross Z, and the fundamental group of the real projective plane is isomorphic to Z_2. These case studies demonstrate that the computational paths approach scales to nontrivial homotopical computations in a modern proof assistant. All the definitions and proofs described here are available in an open-source Lean 4 repository.</description>
