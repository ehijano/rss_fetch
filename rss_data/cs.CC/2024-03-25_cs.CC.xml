      <title>Training Fully Connected Neural Networks is $\exists\mathbb{R}$-Complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding weights and biases for a two-layer fully connected neural network to fit a given set of data points as well as possible, also known as EmpiricalRiskMinimization. Our main result is that the associated decision problem is $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete, that is, polynomial-time equivalent to determining whether a multivariate polynomial with integer coefficients has any real roots. Furthermore, we prove that algebraic numbers of arbitrarily large degree are required as weights to be able to train some instances to optimality, even if all data points are rational. Our result already applies to fully connected instances with two inputs, two outputs, and one hidden layer of ReLU neurons. Thereby, we strengthen a result by Abrahamsen, Kleist and Miltzow [NeurIPS 2021]. A consequence of this is that a combinatorial search algorithm like the one by Arora, Basu, Mianjy and Mukherjee [ICLR 2018] is impossible for networks with more than one output dimension, unless $\mathsf{NP}=\exists\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>No distributed quantum advantage for approximate graph coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an almost complete characterization of the hardness of $c$-coloring $\chi$-chromatic graphs with distributed algorithms, for a wide range of models of distributed computing. In particular, we show that these problems do not admit any distributed quantum advantage. To do that: 1) We give a new distributed algorithm that finds a $c$-coloring in $\chi$-chromatic graphs in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{\frac{1}{\alpha}})$ rounds, with $\alpha = \bigl\lfloor\frac{c-1}{\chi - 1}\bigr\rfloor$. 2) We prove that any distributed algorithm for this problem requires $\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{\alpha}})$ rounds.
  Our upper bound holds in the classical, deterministic LOCAL model, while the near-matching lower bound holds in the non-signaling model. This model, introduced by Arfaoui and Fraigniaud in 2014, captures all models of distributed graph algorithms that obey physical causality; this includes not only classical deterministic LOCAL and randomized LOCAL but also quantum-LOCAL, even with a pre-shared quantum state.
  We also show that similar arguments can be used to prove that, e.g., 3-coloring 2-dimensional grids or $c$-coloring trees remain hard problems even for the non-signaling model, and in particular do not admit any quantum advantage. Our lower-bound arguments are purely graph-theoretic at heart; no background on quantum information theory is needed to establish the proofs.</description>

      <title>Dually conformal hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, the dual hypergraph of $\mathcal{H}$ is the hypergraph of all minimal transversals of $\mathcal{H}$. The dual hypergraph is always Sperner, that is, no hyperedge contains another. A special case of Sperner hypergraphs are the conformal Sperner hypergraphs, which correspond to the families of maximal cliques of graphs. All these notions play an important role in many fields of mathematics and computer science, including combinatorics, algebra, database theory, etc. In this paper we study conformality of dual hypergraphs and prove several results related to the problem of recognizing this property. In particular, we show that the problem is in co-NP and can be solved in polynomial time for hypergraphs of bounded dimension. In the special case of dimension $3$, we reduce the problem to $2$-Satisfiability. Our approach has an implication in algorithmic graph theory: we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing graphs in which all minimal transversals of maximal cliques have size at most $k$, for any fixed $k$.</description>

      <title>On graphs with well-distributed edge density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of graphs which we call average hereditary graphs. Most graphs that occur in the usual graph theory applications belong to this class of graphs. Many popular types of graphs fall under this class, such as regular graphs, trees and other popular classes of graphs. We prove a new upper bound for the chromatic number of a graph in terms of its maximum average degree and show that this bound is an improvement on previous bounds. From this, we show a relationship between the average degree and the chromatic number of an average hereditary graph. This class of graphs is explored further by proving some interesting properties regarding the class of average hereditary graphs. An equivalent condition is provided for a graph to be average hereditary, through which we show that we can decide if a given graph is average hereditary in polynomial time. We then provide a construction for average hereditary graphs, using which an average hereditary graph can be recursively constructed. We also show that this class of graphs is closed under a binary operation, from this another construction is obtained for average hereditary graphs, and we see some interesting algebraic properties this class of graphs has. We then explore the effect on the complexity of graph 3-coloring problem when the input is restricted to average hereditary graphs.</description>
