      <title>Energetic particle acceleration and transport with the novel Icarus$+$PARADISE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of satellites and mankind's growing dependence on technology, there is an increasing awareness of space weather phenomena related to high-energy particles. Shock waves driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and corotating interaction regions (CIRs) occasionally act as potent particle accelerators, generating hazardous solar energetic particles (SEPs) that pose risks to satellite electronics and astronauts. Numerical simulation tools capable of modelling and predicting large SEP events are thus highly demanded. We introduce the new Icarus$+$PARADISE model as an advancement of the previous EUHFORIA$+$PARADISE model. Icarus, based on the MPI-AMRVAC framework, is a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic code that models solar wind configurations from 0.1 au onwards, encompassing transient structures like CMEs or CIRs. Differing from EUHFORIA's uniform-only grid, Icarus incorporates solution adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and grid stretching. The particle transport code PARADISE propagates energetic particles as test particles through these solar wind configurations by solving the focused transport equation in a stochastic manner. We validate our new model by reproducing EUHFORIA+PARADISE results. This is done by modelling the acceleration and transport of energetic particles in a synthetic solar wind configuration containing an embedded CIR. Subsequently, we illustrate how the simulation results vary with grid resolution by employing different levels of AMR. The resulting intensity profiles illustrate increased particle acceleration with higher levels of AMR in the shock region, better capturing the effects of the shock.</description>

      <title>Radio Observations as an Extrasolar Planet Discovery and Characterization: Interior Structure and Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of radio emission from Jupiter was identified quickly as being due to its planetary-scale magnetic field. Subsequent spacecraft investigations have revealed that many of the planets, and even some moons, either have or have had large-scale magnetic fields. In the case of the Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the their magnetic fields are generated by dynamo processes within these planets, and an interaction between the solar wind and their magnetic fields generates intense radio emission via the electron cyclotron maser instability. In the case of Jupiter, its magnetic field interacts with the moon Io to result in radio emission as well.
  Extrasolar planets reasonably may be expected to generate large-scale magnetic fields and to sustain an electron cyclotron maser instability. Not only may these radio emissions be a means for discovering extrasolar planets, because magnetic fields are tied to the properties of planetary interiors, radio emissions may be a remote sensing means of constraining extrasolar planetary properties that will be otherwise difficult to access. In the case of terrestrial planets, the presence or absence of a magnetic field may be an indicator for habitability. Since the first edition of the Handbook, there have been a number of advances, albeit there remain no unambigous detection of radio emission from extrasolar planets. New ground-based telescopes and new possibilities for space-based telescopes provide promise for the future.</description>
