      <title>Extra-Dimensional Axion Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions arising as modes of higher-dimensional gauge fields are known to offer a compelling solution to the axion quality problem and to naturally arise in string theory. In this context, it is interesting to ask how we would interpret an experimental measurement of the axion decay constant $f$. I give several arguments for, as well as concrete examples in string theory of, the existence in such a model of an axion string with tension of order $2\pi S_\mathrm{inst} f^2$, where $S_\mathrm{inst}$ is the instanton action. Furthermore, in models of this type axion strings are typically fundamental objects (rather than solitons), whose tension is at or above the fundamental cutoff of the theory. As a result, I argue that for an extra-dimensional QCD axion, it is likely that the fundamental cutoff scale lies at most two orders of magnitude above $f$. In addition to these core arguments, this paper begins with a self-contained introduction to the physics of extra-dimensional axions and ends with some comments on axion physics in relation to chiral fermions.</description>

      <title>Color Coherence Effects in Dipole-Quark Scattering in the Soft Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color coherence effects play a crucial role in the description of jet evolution at collider experiments. It is well known that the stimulated gluon emission suffered by energetic jets traversing deconfined QCD matter is also affected by color coherence effects. Through multiple soft scatterings with the medium constituents, an antenna will lose its color correlation, causing its legs to behave as independent emitters after the so-called decoherence time. In this work we provide the first computation of the properties of the recoils produced as a result of these soft scatterings between a color coherent dipole and the medium constituents. Our findings reveal that the angular phase-space of these soft recoils is strongly restricted by the opening angle of the dipole itself due to quantum interference effects. In this long wavelength limit, one can effectively consider that interactions take place with each of the legs of the dipole separately, provided that the angular constraints dictated by the corresponding color flow topologies are respected. This is in complete analogy with the case of soft gluon emission in vacuum, where the recoil quark plays the role of the emitted gluon. As a direct phenomenological application we estimate the collisional energy loss rate of a color antenna. Importantly, these results indicate the way in which color coherence effects can be implemented in jet quenching models that account for the recoils from elastic scatterings, improving in this way our description of medium response physics in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>SHIFT@LHC: Searches for New Physics with Shifted Interaction on a Fixed Target at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New low-mass particles with very small couplings to standard model particles that travel significant distances before decaying are interesting candidates to address some of the most intriguing questions of modern physics. In this paper, I propose to extend the LHC's research program by installing a fixed target referred to as SHIFT at around 160 meters from the CMS interaction point. When the LHC proton beam collides with this target, interactions at a center of mass energy of $\approx$113 GeV would occur. The particles produced in such collisions, or their decay products, would travel through the rock and other material on their path, potentially reaching the CMS detector where they can be registered and studied. Such an approach would allow us to access otherwise uncovered regions of parameters phase space at a relatively low cost since it does not require constructing a new detector. Various aspects such as angular and lifetime coverage or material survival probability have been studied. The results are interpreted within two new physics models, namely, the Dark Photons and the Hidden Valley scenarios, and compared with the standard proton-proton physics program of CMS. A comparison is also made with the fixed target program at LHCb, as well as parasitic detectors such as FASER or MATHUSLA. The obtained results indicate that, despite assuming just 1% of the nominal CMS luminosity to be available to SHIFT, the physics reach could be extended by a factor of more than 20, depending on the signal model parameters.</description>

      <title>The connection between Nucleon Energy Correlators and Fracture Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a sum rule that connects fracture functions to nucleon energy-energy correlators~(NEECs) in a one-to-one correspondence. Using this sum rule, we study the energy pattern in the target fragmentation region of deep inelastic scatterings. Through investigations up to twist-3, we express all eighteen energy-pattern structure functions in terms of associated NEECs, elucidating various azimuthal and spin asymmetries critical for nucleon tomography. Additionally, we investigate the perturbative matching of the twist-2 quark NEECs. We demonstrate that the Sivers-type and worm-gear-type quark NEECs match onto twist-3 multi-parton distributions. Our work provides a framework for examining energy-weighted observables through hadron production processes in the target fragmentation region, offering new insights into nucleon tomography.</description>

      <title>FastEEC: Fast Evaluation of N-point Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy correlators characterize the asymptotic energy flow in scattering events produced at colliders, from which the microscopic physics of the scattering can be deduced. This view of collisions is akin to analyses of the Cosmic Microwave Background, and a range of promising phenomenological applications of energy correlators have been identified, including the study of hadronization, the deadcone effect, measuring $\alpha_s$ and the top quark mass. While $N$-point energy correlators are interesting to study for larger values of $N$, their evaluation is computationally intensive, scaling like $M^N/N!$, where $M$ is the number of particles. In this letter we develop a fast method for their evaluation, exploiting that correlations at a given angular scale are insensitive to effects at other (widely-separated) scales. For concreteness we focus on the projected energy correlator, which projects onto the largest separation between the $N$ directions. E.g.~for $N=7$ we find a speed up of up to four orders of magnitude, depending on the desired accuracy. We also consider the possibility of raising the energy to a power higher than one in the energy correlator, which has been proposed to reduce soft sensitivity, and further cuts back the required computation time. These higher-power correlators are not collinear safe, but as a byproduct our approach suggests a natural method to regularize them, such that they can be described using perturbation theory. This letter is accompanied by a public code that implements our method.</description>

      <title>Dark Neutrino Moments From Light Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active and sterile neutrinos may acquire "dark moments" via one-loop diagrams with a massless dark photon and new light particles in the loop. Due to the kinetic mixing between the dark photon and the Standard Model photon, neutrinos would obtain effective electromagnetic moments. This mechanism allows for enhanced electromagnetic moments that can evade constraints on particles directly charged under electromagnetism. We show that in a wide region of parameter space, the model features testable predictions for the anapole and magnetic moment of active and sterile neutrinos with dark matter direct detection experiments sensitive to the solar neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Scalar Weak Gravity Conjecture and its Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalized formulation of the Scalar Weak Gravity Conjecture (SWGC) based on the analogy with the derivation of the Gauge Weak Gravity Conjecture (GWGC). We discuss some phenomenological implications of this Generalized SWGC, including the scale of New Physics (NP) when applied to the SM Higgs sector, and the bounds on the axion's couplings to fermions and the photon when applied to the axion. The Generalized SWGC constraints rule out most of the parameter space of axion-nucleon couplings, leaving only a tiny parameter space.</description>

      <title>$T_{cc}$ in the Diabatic Diquark Model: Effects of $D^*D$ Isospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $T_{cc}^+$ is an isoscalar 4-quark state with mass lying barely below the $D^{*+} D^0$ threshold, and several times further below the $D^{*0} D^+$ threshold. It allows both di-meson molecular and elementary diquark-antidiquark $(cc)(\bar u \bar d)$ substructures. The diabatic generalization of the adiabatic approximation within the Born-Oppenheimer formalism rigorously incorporates the mixing of such elementary eigenstates with states corresponding to two-particle thresholds. We examine the separate influence of the two $D^* \! D$ isospin channels and find that the influence of $D^{*+} D^0$ is larger than that of $D^{*0} D^+$ but not overwhelmingly so, and that $T_{cc}^+$ contains an $O(10\%)$ $(cc)(\bar u \bar d)$ component. We then explore the variation of these results if the isospin breaking between the di-meson thresholds is varied, and also the sensitivity of our results to variation of the mixing-potential parameters.</description>

      <title>Scotogenic gauge mechanism for neutrino mass and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scotogenic is a scheme for neutrino mass generation through the one-loop contribution of an inert scalar doublet and three sterile neutrinos. This work argues that such inert scalar doublet is a Goldstone boson mode associated with a gauge symmetry breaking. Hence, the resultant scotogenic gauge mechanism is very predictive, generating neutrino mass as contributed by a new gauge boson doublet that eats such Goldstone bosons. The dark matter stability is manifestly ensured by a matter parity as residual gauge symmetry for which a vector dark matter candidate is hinted.</description>

      <title>Energy-momentum tensor in $\Phi^4$ theory at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy-momentum tensor form factors are studied in $\Phi^4$ theory to one-loop order with particular focus on the $D$-term, a particle property which has attracted a lot of attention in the recent literature. It is shown that the free Klein-Gordon theory value of the $D$-term $D_{\text{free}}=-1$ is reduced to $D_{\text{one-loop}} =-\frac13$ even if the $\Phi^4$ interaction is infinitesimally small. A companion work in $\Phi^3$ theory confirms this result which may indicate that it is independent of the type of interaction as long as the scalar theory is renormalizable. Dispersion relations are studied. Various definitions of mean square radii including the mechanical radius are investigated. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the EMT properties of particles and their interpretation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate helicity amplitudes for $e^-e^+\to W^-W^+$ analytically in the Feynman-diagram (FD) gauge. We show that, unlike in the unitary gauge, there is no energy growth of the individual Feynman amplitudes for the longitudinally polarized W bosons, and the contributions from the associated Goldstone bosons are manifest even without taking the high-energy limit. We also find that the physical distributions can be interpreted by the individual amplitudes in the FD gauge.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson Production from Inflaton Coupling during Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) fields is a common feature in many models beyond the Standard Model, characterized by their exclusive derivative couplings. This paper investigates a scenario where a pNGB is coupled to the inflaton field during the reheating phase of the early universe. We calculate the perturbative decay rate of a coherently oscillating inflaton into pNGBs on a general basis, considering both constant and field-dependent couplings with monomial potentials at the minimum. As a concrete application, we explore the production of axions when the radial mode of the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) scalar serves as the inflaton, particularly in the presence of a large gravitational non-minimal coupling. Our findings suggest that the presence of pNGBs during reheating can lead to significant non-thermal relics, offering new constraints on inflationary reheating models and providing potential observational signatures in the form of dark radiation.</description>

      <title>Vector-like quarks: status and new directions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental searches for vector-like quarks have until now only considered their decays into Standard Model particles. However, various new physics scenarios predict additional scalars, so that these vector-like quarks can decay to new channels. These new channels reduce the branching ratios into Standard Model final states, significantly affecting current mass bounds. In this article, we quantitatively assess the relevance and observability of single and pair production processes of vector-like quarks, followed by decays into both standard and exotic final states. We highlight the importance of large widths and the relative interaction strengths with Standard Model particles and new scalars. Then, we review the post-Moriond 2024 status of these models in light of available LHC data and discuss potential future strategies to enhance the scope of vector-like quark searches.</description>

      <title>Absorptive Corrections to the Electromagnetic Form Factor in High-Energy Elastic Proton-Proton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it was noted that absorptive corrections to the electromagnetic form factor in high-energy proton-proton scattering are important for the theoretical interpretation of the $p^\uparrow{p}$ and $p^\uparrow{A}$ analyzing power $A_\text{N}(t)$ measurements with the Hydrogen Jet Target polarimeter (HJET) at RHIC. Here, a concise expression for the absorptive correction was derived within the eikonal approach. The resulting analysis reveals a systematic bias, nearly independent of the beam energy, in the experimental determination of the real-to-imaginary ratio $\rho$ when absorption effects are overlooked in the data analysis. Quantification of this bias, as $\rho^\text{meas}=\rho + (0.036\pm0.016)_\text{bias}$, was achieved using a Regge fit applied to available proton-proton measurements of $\rho^\text{meas}(s)$ and $\sigma^\text{meas}_\text{tot}(s)$. Considering the potential impact of such an effect on the experimentally determined $A_\text{N}(t)$, one may enhance consistency between the HJET and STAR measurements of the hadronic spin-flip amplitude. While the sign of the bias in the value of $\rho$ aligns with the anticipated effective increase in the proton charge radius in $pp$ scattering due to absorption, it amplifies the observed discrepancy between $\sigma^\text{meas}_\text{tot}$ and $\rho^\text{meas}$ values at $\sqrt{s}=13\,\text{TeV}$ as measured in the TOTEM experiment. Evaluation (using published TOTEM data) of the measured proton-proton $d\sigma/dt$ dependence on the absorptive corrections indicated that possible soft photon corrections to the hadronic amplitude slope may be essential for such data analysis.</description>

      <title>Extraction of Information from Polarized Deep Exclusive Scattering with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A framework defining benchmarks for the analysis of polarized exclusive scattering cross sections is proposed that uses physics symmetry constraints as well as lattice QCD predictions. These constraints are built into machine learning (ML) algorithms. Both physics driven and ML based benchmarks are applied to a wide range of deeply virtual exclusive processes through explainable ML techniques with controllable uncertainties. The observables, namely the Compton Form Factors (CFFs) which are convolutions of Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), are extracted using methods such as the random targets method to evaluate the separate contribution of the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in exclusive scattering analyses.</description>

      <title>Novel azimuthal observables from two-photon collision at $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we advocate a set of novel azimuthal-angle-related observables associated with exclusive hadron production from two-photon fusion at $e^+ e^-$ colliders, taking the $\gamma\gamma\to \pi\pi$ as a benchmark process. As a direct consequence of the linearly polarized quasi-real photons emitted off the electron and positron beams, the $\cos 2\phi$ azimuthal asymmetry in dipion production is predicted within the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization framework. In numerical analysis, we take the helicity amplitudes of $\gamma\gamma\to \pi\pi$ determined from the partial wave solutions in dispersion relation as input, and find that the predicted $\cos2\phi$ azimuthal modulation may reach 40\% for the typical kinematical setup of {\tt Belle} experiment. Future accurate measurement of this azimuthal asymmetry may facilitate the direct extraction of the relative phase between two helicity amplitudes with photon helicity configurations $++$ and $+-$. This knowledge provides a valuable input for the dispersive determination of the hadronic light-by-light (Hlbl) contributions, which constitutes one of the largest theoretical uncertainties in predictions for the muon anomalous magnetic moment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17409v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of ultraheavy (UH) nuclei as ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We show that their energy loss lengths at $\lesssim300$~EeV are significantly longer than those of protons and intermediate-mass nuclei, and that the highest-energy cosmic rays with energies beyond $\sim100$ EeV, including the Amaterasu particle, may originate from such UH-UHECRs. We derive constraints on the contribution of UH-UHECR sources, and find that they are consistent with energy generation rate densities of UHECRs from collapsars and neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Ringdown stability: greybody factors as stable gravitational-wave observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01692v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasinormal mode spectrum of black holes plays a crucial role in the modelling of post-merger ringdown signals. However, the spectrum is extremely sensitive to small deformations of the system and describes the linear response only in a certain (not precisely defined) timeframe after the merger. We argue here that the greybody factors, recently shown to describe the ringdown spectral amplitude at relatively high frequencies, are instead stable under small perturbations of the system and free of certain ambiguities that plague the quasinormal mode spectrum. Our analysis also unveils a nontrivial interplay: while certain ringdown quantities are dominated by the contribution of spectrally unstable quasinormal modes, these modes conspire to produce stable observables. Thus, we propose a complementary approach to ringdown studies, which circumvents some limitations of the standard quasinormal mode description.</description>

      <title>Consistent Theories for the DESI dark energy fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for physically consistent realizations of evolving dark energy suggested by the cosmological fit of DESI, Planck and Supernovae data. First we note that any lagrangian description of the standard Chevallier-Linder-Polarski (CLP) parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm eff}$, allows for the addition of a cosmological constant. We perform the cosmological fit finding new regions of parameter space that however continue to favour dark energy with $w_{\rm eff}&lt;-1$ at early times that are challenging to realize in theoretically consistent theories. Next, in the spirit of effective field theories, we consider the effect of higher order terms in the Taylor expansion of the equation of state around the present epoch. We find that non-linear corrections of the equation of state are weakly constrained, thus opening the way to scenarios that differ from CLP at early times, possibly with $w_{\rm eff}&gt;-1$ at all times. We present indeed scenarios where evolving dark energy can be realized through quintessence models. We introduce in particular the ramp model where dark energy coincides with CLP at late times and approximates to a cosmological constant at early times. The latter model provides a much better fit than $\Lambda$CDM, and only slightly worse than $w_0w_a$CDM, but with the big advantage of being described by a simple and theoretically consistent lagrangian of a canonical quintessence model.</description>

      <title>Warm Hawking Relics From Primordial Black Hole Domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological impact of warm, dark-sector relic particles produced as Hawking radiation in a primordial-black-hole-dominated universe before big bang nucleosynthesis. If those dark-sector particles are stable, they would survive to the present day as "Hawking relics" and modify the subsequent growth of cosmological structure. We show that such relics are produced with much larger momenta, but in smaller quantities than the familiar thermal relics considered in standard cosmology. Consequently, Hawking relics with keV-MeV masses affect the growth of large-scale structure in a similar way to eV-scale thermal relics like massive neutrinos. We model their production and evolution, and show that their momentum distributions are broader than comparable relics with thermal distributions. Warm Hawking relics affect the growth of cosmological perturbations and we constrain their abundance to be less than $2\%$ of the dark matter over a broad range of their viable parameter space. Finally, we examine how future measurements of the matter power spectrum can distinguish Hawking relics from thermal particles.</description>

      <title>Jet Flavour Tagging at FCC-ee with a Transformer-based Neural Network: DeepJetTransformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet flavour tagging is crucial in experimental high-energy physics. A tagging algorithm, \texttt{DeepJetTransformer}, is presented, which exploits a transformer-based neural network that is substantially faster to train.
  The \texttt{DeepJetTransformer} network uses information from particle flow-style objects and secondary vertex reconstruction as is standard for $b$- and $c$-jet identification supplemented by additional information, such as reconstructed V$^0$s and $K^{\pm}/\pi^{\pm}$ discrimination, typically not included in tagging algorithms at the LHC. The model is trained as a multiclassifier to identify all quark flavours separately and performs excellently in identifying $b$- and $c$-jets. An $s$-tagging efficiency of $40\%$ can be achieved with a $10\%$ $ud$-jet background efficiency. The impact of including V$^0$s and $K^{\pm}/\pi^{\pm}$ discrimination is presented.
  The network is applied on exclusive $Z \to q\bar{q}$ samples to examine the physics potential and is shown to isolate $Z \to s\bar{s}$ events. Assuming all other backgrounds can be efficiently rejected, a $5\sigma$ discovery significance for $Z \to s\bar{s}$ can be achieved with an integrated luminosity of $60~\text{nb}^{-1}$, corresponding to less than a second of the FCC-ee run plan at the $Z$ resonance.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Ultra Heavy Dark Matter Properties from Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies with LHAASO Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we try to search for signals generated by ultra-heavy dark matter at the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) data. We look for possible gamma-ray by dark matter annihilation or decay from 16 dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the field of view of LHAASO. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are among the most promising targets for indirect detection of dark matter which have low fluxes of astrophysical $\gamma$-ray background while large amount of dark matter. By analyzing more than 700 days observational data at LHAASO, no significant dark matter signal from 1 TeV to 1 EeV is detected. Accordingly we derive the most stringent constraints on the ultra-heavy dark matter annihilation cross-section up to EeV. The constraints on the lifetime of dark matter in decay mode are also derived.</description>

      <title>Primordial magnetic relics and their signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes bearing magnetic charges may bypass the constraints imposed by Hawking radiation, thereby enabling reasonable present-day populations, even for masses below $10^{15}\,\text{g}$ -- a range previously considered improbable. They could, therefore, conceivably contribute to a component of dark matter. We investigate novel Faraday rotation signatures exhibited by primordial magnetic black holes while also establishing new Parker-type bounds on their populations. For the latter, we bound the dark matter fraction from intergalactic magnetic fields in cosmic voids $\left(f_{\text{DM}} \lesssim 10^{-8}\right)$ and cosmic web filaments $\left(f_{\text{ DM}} \lesssim 10^{-4}\right)$, notably eclipsing previous bounds. Exploring Faraday rotation effects, we discern a pronounced rotation of the polarization angle and the rotation measure values for extremal primordial magnetic black holes with masses $M^{\text{ ex.}}_{\text{ BH}}\gtrsim 10^{-6}~ \text{M}_\odot$. This makes them potentially detectable in current observations. A comparative investigation finds that the effects are notably greater than for a neutron star, like a Magnetar, with a similar magnetic field at the surface. Moreover, the polarization angle maps for primordial magnetic black holes exhibit unique features, notably absent in other astrophysical magnetic configurations. In this context, we also introduce a simple integral measure, offering a quantitative measure for their discrimination in many scenarios. These traits potentially suggest a robust avenue for their observational detection and differentiation.</description>

Abstract: We study the stabilization of a twisted modulus in Type IIB flux compactifications on a mirror of the rigid Calabi-Yau threefold. By analyzing the effective action of twisted and untwisted moduli, we find that three-form fluxes satisfying the tadpole cancellation conditions lead to supersymmetric AdS vacua. We also investigate swampland conjectures on this non-geometric background.</description>

      <title>MURCA driven Bulk viscosity in neutrino trapped baryonic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine bulk viscosity, taking into account trapped neutrinos in baryonic matter, in the context of binary neutron star mergers. Following the merging event, the binary star can yield a remnant compact object with densities up to $5$ nuclear saturation density and temperature upto $50$ MeV resulting in the retention of neutrinos. We employ two relativistic mean field models, NL3 and DDME2, to describe the neutrino-trapped baryonic matter. The dissipation coefficient is determined by evaluating the Modified URCA interaction rate in the dense baryonic medium, and accounting for perturbations caused by density oscillations. We observe the resonant behavior of bulk viscosity as it varies with the temperature of the medium. The bulk viscosity peak remains within the temperature range of $\sim 13-50$ MeV, depending upon the underlying equation of states and lepton fractions. This temperature range corresponds to the relevant domain of binary neutron star mergers. We also note that in presence of neutrinos in the medium the bulk viscosity peak shifts towards higher temperature and the peak value of bulk viscosity also changes. The time scale of viscous dissipation is dictated by the beta-off-equilibrium susceptibilities derived from the nuclear equation of state. The resulting viscous decay time scale ranges from $32-100$ milliseconds, which aligns with the order of magnitude of the post-merger object's survival time in some specific scenarios.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from self-resonant preheating?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the question of how generic is the formation of primordial black holes via self-resonant growth of inflaton fluctuations in the post-inflationary, preheating phase. Using analytical and lattice calculations, we find that primordial black hole production is far from being a generic outcome. Also, in most of the parameter space of viable inflationary models, the metric preheating term is subleading to the anharmonic terms and the approximation of a quadratic potential for describing the resonance dynamics is inadequate. Nonetheless, the anharmonicity of the potential cannot be used to rescue the mechanism: The generic outcome of the non-linear evolution of the scalar field in this case is the formation of metastable transients or oscillons, that do not generically collapse into black holes.</description>

Abstract: Single-field models of accelerated expansion with nearly flat potentials, despite being able to provide observationally viable explanations for the early-time cosmic inflation and the late-time cosmic acceleration, are in strong tension with string theory evidence and the associated de Sitter swampland constraints. It has recently been argued that in an open universe, where the spatial curvature is negative (i.e., with $\Omega_k&gt;0$), a new stable fixed point arises, which may lead to viable single-field-based accelerated expansion with an arbitrarily steep potential. Here we show, through a dynamical systems analysis and a Bayesian statistical inference of cosmological parameters, that the additional cosmological solutions based on the new fixed point do not render steep-potential, single-field, accelerated expansion observationally viable. We mainly focus on quintessence models of dark energy, but we also argue that a similar conclusion can be drawn for cosmic inflation.</description>

      <title>Final-state interactions in neutrino-induced proton knockout from argon in MicroBooNE</title>

Abstract: Neutrino event generators make use of intranuclear cascade models (INCs), to predict the kinematics of hadrons produced in neutrino-nucleus interactions. We perform a consistent comparison of different INCs, by using the same set of events as input to the NEUT, NuWro, Achilles and INCL INCs. The inputs correspond to calculations of the fully differential single-proton knockout cross section, either in the distorted-wave impulse approximation (DWIA) or plane-wave impulse approximation (PWIA), both including realistic nuclear hole spectral functions. We compare the INC results to DWIA calculations with an optical potential, used extensively in the analysis of (e,e'p) experiments. We point out a systematic discrepancy between both approaches. We apply the INC results to recent MicroBooNE data. We assess the influence of the choice of spectral function, finding that large variations in realistic spectral functions are indistinguishable with present data. The data is underpredicted, with strength missing in the region where two-nucleon knockout and resonance production contribute. However, the data is underpredicted also in regions of low transverse missing momentum, where one-nucleon knockout dominates. The inclusion of the interference with two-body currents could lead to additional strength in this region.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group Evolution of the Standard Model Dimension Six Operators III: Gauge Coupling Dependence and Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2014</link>
      <description>arXiv:1312.2014v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the gauge terms of the one-loop anomalous dimension matrix for the dimension-six operators of the Standard Model effective field theory (SM EFT). Combining these results with our previous results for the $\lambda$ and Yukawa coupling terms completes the calculation of the one-loop anomalous dimension matrix for the dimension-six operators. There are 1350 $CP$-even and $1149$ $CP$-odd parameters in the dimension-six Lagrangian for 3 generations, and our results give the entire $2499 \times 2499$ anomalous dimension matrix. We discuss how the renormalization of the dimension-six operators, and the additional renormalization of the dimension $d \le 4$ terms of the SM Lagrangian due to dimension-six operators, lays the groundwork for future precision studies of the SM EFT aimed at constraining the effects of new physics through precision measurements at the electroweak scale. As some sample applications, we discuss some aspects of the full RGE improved result for essential processes such as $gg \to h$, $h \to \gamma \gamma$ and $h \to Z \gamma$, for Higgs couplings to fermions, for the precision electroweak parameters $S$ and $T$, and for the operators that modify important processes in precision electroweak phenomenology, such as the three-body Higgs boson decay $h \rightarrow Z \, \ell^+ \, \ell^-$ and triple gauge boson couplings. We discuss how the renormalization group improved results can be used to study the flavor problem in the SM EFT, and to test the minimal flavor violation (MFV) hypothesis. We briefly discuss the renormalization effects on the dipole coefficient $C_{e\gamma}$ which contributes to $\mu \to e \gamma$ and to the muon and electron magnetic and electric dipole moments.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from first-order phase transition in an electroweakly interacting vector dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13510v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss gravitational waves in an electroweakly interacting vector dark matter model. In the model, the electroweak gauge symmetry is extended to SU(2)$_0 \times$ SU(2)$_1 \times$SU(2)$_2 \times$ U(1)$_Y$ and spontaneously broken into SU(2)$_L \times$ U(1)$_Y$ at TeV scale. The model has an exchange symmetry between SU(2)$_0$ and SU(2)$_2$. This symmetry stabilizes some massive vector bosons associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking described above, and an electrically neutral one is a dark matter candidate. In the previous study, it was found that the gauge couplings of SU(2)$_0$ and SU(2)$_1$ are relatively large to explain the measured value of the dark matter energy density via the freeze-out mechanism. With the large gauge couplings, the gauge bosons potentially have a sizable effect on the scalar potential. In this paper, we focus on the phase transition of SU(2)$_0 \times$ SU(2)$_1 \times$ SU(2)$_2 \to$ SU(2)$_L$. We calculate the effective potential at finite temperature and find that the phase transition is first-order and strong in a wide range of the parameter space. The strong first-order phase transition generates gravitational waves. We calculate the gravitational wave spectrum and find that it is possible to detect the gravitational waves predicted in the model by future space-based gravitational wave interferometers. We explore the regions of the parameter space probed by the gravitational wave detection. We find that the gravitational wave detection can probe the region where the mass of $h'$, a CP-even scalar in the model, is a few TeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We proposed a viable and predictive model based on the $SU(3)_C \times SU(3)_L \times U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry, supplemented by the global $U(1)_{Lg}$ symmetry, the $S_4$ family symmetry and several auxiliary cyclic symmetries, which successfully reproduces the experimentally observed SM fermion mass and mixing pattern. The tiny active neutrino masses are generated through an inverse seesaw mechanism mediated by right-handed Majorana neutrinos. The model is consistent with the SM fermion masses and mixings and successfully accommodates the current Higgs diphoton decay rate constraints as well as the constraints arising from oblique $S$, $T$ and $U$ parameters and we studied the meson mixing due to flavor changing neutral currents mediated by heavy scalars, finding parameter space consistent with experimental constraints.</description>

Abstract: We present a new paradigm for the production of the dark matter (DM) relic abundance based on the evaporation of early Universe primordial black holes (PBHs) themselves formed from DM particles. As a concrete realization, we consider a minimal model of the dark sector in which a first-order phase transition results in the formation of Fermiball remnants that collapse to PBHs, which then emit DM particles. We show that the regurgitated DM scenario allows for DM in the mass range $\sim1$ GeV $- \,10^{16}$ GeV, thereby unlocking parameter space considered excluded.</description>

      <title>PCN: A Deep Learning Approach to Jet Tagging Utilizing Novel Graph Construction Methods and Chebyshev Graph Convolutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08630v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jet tagging is a classification problem in high-energy physics experiments that aims to identify the collimated sprays of subatomic particles, jets, from particle collisions and tag them to their emitter particle. Advances in jet tagging present opportunities for searches of new physics beyond the Standard Model. Current approaches use deep learning to uncover hidden patterns in complex collision data. However, the representation of jets as inputs to a deep learning model have been varied, and often, informative features are withheld from models. In this study, we propose a graph-based representation of a jet that encodes the most information possible. To learn best from this representation, we design Particle Chebyshev Network (PCN), a graph neural network (GNN) using Chebyshev graph convolutions (ChebConv). ChebConv has been demonstrated as an effective alternative to classical graph convolutions in GNNs and has yet to be explored in jet tagging. PCN achieves a substantial improvement in accuracy over existing taggers and opens the door to future studies into graph-based representations of jets and ChebConv layers in high-energy physics experiments.

Abstract: The study delves into the production of (multi-)strange hadrons in proton-proton collisions at LHC. Novel observables are proposed to distinguish between EPOS4, based on core-corona separation between a thermalised QGP phase and a vacuum phase with global strangeness conservation, and PYTHIA8.3, based on microscopic interactions between Lund strings that conserve strangeness locally. Correlations between a $\phi$ meson and (multi-)strange hadrons are shown to be an excellent discriminator between the two types of models.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy analysis of ultra-soft pion trap at LHC energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Femtoscopy studies of pion radiation in heavy-ion collisions have been conducted extensively at all available collider energies, both theoretically and experimentally. In all these studies a special interest is given to $m_{T}$ dependency of pion femtoscopy radii, usually approximated by a power-law function at transverse momenta above 200~MeV/$c$. However, the radii behaviour has been much less explored for the ultra-soft pions, possessing the transverse momentum comparable to or lower than the pion mass. For many experimental setups this region is difficult to measure. In this work we present theoretical calculations of pion emission in the ultra-soft region in the two hybrid models -- iHKM and LHYQUID+THERMINATOR2. Along with the particle transverse momentum spectra, we present the calculated femtoscopy radii, both in one-dimensional and three-dimensional representations. We investigate the radii dependence on pair $m_{T}$ and observe, in particular, a departure from the power-law behaviour at ultra-soft momenta, potentially reflecting a decoupling of such slow pions from the rest of collectively expanding system. We provide the theoretical interpretation of this result and discuss its significance, in particular, for the ongoing non-identical particle femtoscopy analysis for pairs consisting of a pion and a baryon (or of a pion and a charmed meson).</description>

      <title>QCD effects in electroweak $WZjj$ production at current and future hadron colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an update of an existing implementation of $WZjj$ production via vector-boson scattering in the framework of the POWHEG BOX program. In particular, previously unavailable semi-leptonic and fully hadronic decay modes of the intermediate vector bosons are provided, and operators of dimension six in an effective-field theory approach to account for physics beyond the Standard Model in the electroweak sector are included. For selected applications phenomenological results are provided to illustrate the capabilities of the new program. The impact of the considered dimension-six operators on experimentally accessible distributions is found to be small for current LHC energies, but enhanced in the kinematic reach of a potential future hadron collider with an energy of 100 TeV. The relevance of fully accounting for spin correlations and off-shell effects in the decay system is explored by a comparison with results obtained with the MadSpin tool that are based on an approximate treatment of the leptonic final state resulting from vector boson scattering processes. For selected semi-leptonic and hadronic decay modes we demonstrate the sensitivity of realistic signal selection procedures on QCD corrections and parton-shower effects.</description>

      <title>Polarization Dynamics in Paramagnet of Charged Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is commonly understood that the strong magnetic field produced in heavy ion collisions is short-lived. The electric conductivity of the quark-gluon plasma is unable to significantly extend the life time of magnetic field. We propose an alternative scenario to achieve this: with finite baryon density and spin polarization by the initial magnetic field, the quark-gluon plasma behaves as a paramagnet, which may continue to polarize quark after fading of initial magnetic field. We confirm this picture by calculations in both quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics. In the former case, we find a splitting in the damping rates of probe fermion with opposite spin component along the magnetic field. In the latter case, we find a similar splitting in damping rate of probe quark in quark-gluon plasma in both high density and low density limits. The splitting provides a way of polarizing strange quarks by the quark-gluon plasma paramagnet consisting of light quarks, which effectively extends the lifetime of magnetic field in heavy ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: We present the Feynman rules for leading-twist gauge-invariant quark and gluon operators with an arbitrary number of total derivatives and applicable to any order in perturbation theory. This generalizes previous results and constitutes a necessary ingredient in the computation of the matrix elements of the corresponding operators. The results are written in a form appropriate for implementation in a computer algebra system. To illustrate the latter we provide implementations in Mathematica and FORM, which are made available at https://github.com/vtsam/NKLO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the perturbative $T$-odd contributions to the lepton angular distribution in the Drell-Yan process. Using collinear factorization, we work at the first order in QCD perturbation theory where these contributions appear, ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^2)$, and address both $W^\pm$ and $\gamma/Z^0$ boson exchange. A major focus of our calculation is on the regime where the boson's transverse momentum $Q_T$ is much smaller than its mass $Q$. We carefully expand our results up to next-to-next-to-leading power in $Q_T/Q$. Our calculation provides a benchmark for studies of $T$-odd contributions that employ transverse-momentum dependent parton distribution functions. In the neutral-current case we compare our results for the $T$-odd structure functions to available ATLAS data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses the calculation of local form factors involved in the theoretical predictions of semileptonic $B$-meson decays at low-$q^2$. We present a new approach to the method of QCD Light-Cone Sum Rule with $B-$meson Light-Cone Distribution Amplitudes. In our strategy, we bypass the semi-global quark-hadron duality (QHD) approximation which usually contributes an unknown and potentially large systematic error to the prediction of form factors. We trade this improvement for an increased reliance on higher-order contributions in perturbation theory. Unlike the systematic error from semi-global QHD, truncation errors are assessable and systematically improvable, hence allowing robust predictions of form factors. For the transitions $B\to \pi,\rho,K^{(*)}$, our predictions agree with the literature for all form factors at $q^2=0$.</description>

      <title>A minimal solution to the axion isocurvature problem from a non-minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main limitation for pre-inflationary breaking of Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is the upper bound on the Hubble rate during inflation from axion isocurvature fluctuations. This leads to a tension between high scale inflation and QCD axions with Grand Unified Theory (GUT) scale decay constants, which reduces the potential for a detection of tensor modes at next generation CMB experiments. We propose a mechanism that excplicitly breaks PQ symmetry via non-minimal coupling to gravity, that lifts the axion mass above the Hubble scale during inflation and has negligible impact on today's axion potential. The initially heavy axion gets trapped at an intermediate minimum during inflation given by the phase of the non-minimal coupling, before it moves to its true CP-conserving minimum after inflation. During this stage it undergoes coherent oscillations around an adiabatically decreasing minimum, which slightly dilutes the axion energy density, while still being able to explain the observed dark matter relic abundance. This scenario can be tested by the combination of next generation CMB surveys like CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD with haloscopes such as ABRACADABRA or CASPEr-Electric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM), if augmented with a light SM-singlet scalar $\phi$ and a TeV-scale scalar leptoquark (LQ) $S_1$, 2-body charged lepton flavor violating (CLFV) decay channels can be accessed with $\phi$ as one of the final states, where the leading order effective interactions between $\phi$ and the SM fields arise at one-loop level. Further, in the presence of $S_1$, $\phi$ can mediate 3-body CLFV processes with either two photons or two gluons in the final states. Thus, the model predicts an exotic 3-body CLFV channel: $\ell_A\to\ell_B gg$, which can be tested/constrained only through some future high-energy experiments looking for di-gluon signals from a leptonic decay.</description>

Abstract: Texture zeros play a crucial role in the phenomenological implementation of a particular model in the Beyond Standard Model framework. As such, in this work we study the possibility concerning the origin of texture zero in the neutrino mass matrix in the context of modular Left-Right Symmetric Model. Implementation of texture zeros in the light neutrino mass matrix brings forth the existence of allowed and disallowed classes of the texture zero classification. In the present work, we have studied Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay, Lepton flavor violation and Resonant Leptogenesis and tried to analyze if the simultaneous study of these three phenomenology are connected with a common parameter space within the model. We have determined the possible combinations of 1-0 and 2-0 textures in the context of resulting light neutrino mass matrix and illustrated the allowed classes for both textures corresponding to the realization of neutrinoless double beta decay, leptogenesis and lepton flavor violation. The study has been carried out for both normal and inverted hierarchy and the results have been illustrated in the present work.</description>

      <title>A bridge between trace anomaly and deconfinement phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the fact that both the dilaton potential encoding the trace anomalies of QCD and the Polyakov loop potential measuring the deconfinement phase transition can be expressed in the logarithmic forms, as well as the fact that the scale symmetry is expected to be restoring and colors are deconfined in extreme conditions such as high temperatures and/or densities, we conjecture a relation between the dilaton potential and the Polyakov loop potential. Explicitly, we start from the Coleman--Weinberg type potential of a real scalar field -- a dilaton or conformal compensator -- and make an ansatz of the relation between this scalar field and the Polyakov loop to obtain the Polyakov loop potential, which can be parameterized in Lattice QCD (LQCD) in the pure glue sector. We find that the coefficients of Polyakov potential fitted from Lattice data are automatically satisfied in this ansatz, the locations of deconfinement and scale restoration are locked to each other, and the first-order phase transition can be realized. Extensions to the low-energy effective quark models are also discussed. The conjectured relation may deepen our understanding of the evolution of the universe, the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking, the phase diagram of QCD matter, and the properties of neutron~stars.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein Condensate and Liquid Helium He$^4$: Implications of GUP and Modified Gravity Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the recently established connection between Palatini-like gravity and linear Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) models, we have formulated an approach that facilitates the examination of Bose gases. Our primary focus is on the ideal Bose-Einstein condensate and liquid helium, chosen as illustrative examples to underscore the feasibility of tabletop experiments in assessing gravity models. The non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate imposes constraints on linear GUP and Palatini $f(R)$ gravity (Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity) within the ranges of $-10^{12}\lesssim\sigma\lesssim 3\times 10^{24}{\text{ s}}/{\text{kg m}}$ and $-10^{-1}\lesssim\bar\beta\lesssim 10^{11} \text{ m}^2$ ($-4\times10^{-1}\lesssim\epsilon\lesssim 4\times 10^{11} \text{ m}^2$), respectively. In contrast, the properties of liquid helium suggest more realistic bounds, specifically $-10^{23}\lesssim\sigma\lesssim 10^{23}{\text{ s}}/{\text{kg m}}$ and $-10^{9}\lesssim\bar\beta\lesssim 10^{9} \text{ m}^2$. Additionally, we argue that the newly developed method employing Earth seismic waves provides improved constraints for quantum and modified gravity by approximately one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Photoproduction of lepton pair in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dilepton production provides a unique probe of the strong electromagnetic field produced in heavy-ion collisions. To map out the behavior of its transverse momentum broadening, we present a theoretical model based on the equivalent photon approximation, and then we update it to make direct comparisons with the recent experimental measurements. We find that the model calculations can describe well, not only the average transverse momentum squared of $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs in Au--Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV, but also the acoplanarity of $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ pairs in Pb--Pb collisions at$\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV. Furthermore, the model predictions are also able to reproduce the measured dependencies of the pair mass and the transverse momentum squared.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Rate Predictions for FASER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Forward Search Experiment (FASER) at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has recently directly detected the first collider neutrinos. Neutrinos play an important role in all FASER analyses, either as signal or background, and it is therefore essential to understand the neutrino event rates. In this study, we update previous simulations and present prescriptions for theoretical predictions of neutrino fluxes and cross sections, together with their associated uncertainties. With these results, we discuss the potential for possible measurements that could be carried out in the coming years with the FASER neutrino data to be collected in LHC Run 3 and Run 4.</description>

      <title>On classical de Sitter solutions and parametric control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding string backgrounds with de Sitter spacetime, where all approximations and corrections are controlled, is an open problem. We revisit the search for de Sitter solutions in the classical regime for specific type IIB supergravity compactifications on group manifolds, an under-explored corner of the landscape that offers an interesting testing ground for swampland conjectures. While the supergravity de Sitter solutions we obtain numerically are ambiguous in terms of their classicality, we find an analytic scaling that makes four out of six compactification radii, as well as the overall volume, arbitrarily large. This potentially provides parametric control over corrections. If we could show that these solutions, or others to be found, are fully classical, they would constitute a counterexample to conjectures stating that asymptotic de Sitter solutions do not exist. We discuss this point in great detail.</description>
