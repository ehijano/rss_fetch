      <title>Charting a finite element, mechanical atlas of dermatologic wound closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wound geometry and the mechanical properties of human skin govern the failure modes of partially healed or scarred tissue. Though dermatologists and surgeons develop an intuitive understanding of the mechanical characteristics of skin through clinical practice, finite element models of wounds can aid in formalizing intuition. In this work, we explore the effect of wound geometry and primary intention closure on the propagation of mechanical stresses through skin. We use a two-layer, orthotropic, hyperelastic model of the epidermis, dermis, and subcutis to accurately capture the mechanical and geometric effects at work. We highlight the key assumptions which must be made when modeling closure of wounds by primary intention, clearly delineating promising areas for model improvement. Models are implemented in DOLFINx, an open-source finite element framework, and reference code is provided for reproducible and extensible science.</description>

      <title>Modeling fibrous tissue in vascular fluid-structure interaction: a morphology-based pipeline and biomechanical significance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a suite of technologies for analyzing the interaction between anisotropic arterial walls and blood flow for subject-specific geometries. Utilizing an established lumen modeling strategy, we present a comprehensive pipeline for generating the thick-walled artery models. Through a specialized mesh generation procedure, we obtain the meshes for the arterial lumen and wall with mesh continuity across the interface ensured. Exploiting the centerline information, a series of procedures is introduced for generating local basis vectors within the arterial wall. The procedures are tailored to handle thick-walled and, in particular, aneurysmatic tissues in which the basis vectors may exhibit transmural variations. Additionally, we propose methods to accurately identify the centerline in multi-branched vessels and bifurcating regions. The developed fiber generation method is evaluated against the strategy using linear elastic analysis, demonstrating that the proposed approach yields satisfactory fiber definitions in the considered benchmark. Finally, we examine the impact of anisotropic arterial wall models on the vascular fluid-structure interaction analysis through numerical examples. For comparison purposes, the neo-Hookean model is considered. The first case involves an idealized curved geometry, while the second case studies an image-based abdominal aorta model. The numerical results reveal that the deformation and stress distribution are critically related to the constitutive model of the wall, while the hemodynamic factors are less sensitive to the wall model. This work paves the way for more accurate image-based vascular modeling and enhances the prediction of arterial behavior under physiologically realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Analysing contact conditions in hard-on-hard hip replacements: effectiveness of current analytical methods and novel data-driven approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contact mechanics models that can accurately estimate the contact conditions and, consequently predict wear must be developed for hip implants. This study analyses and verifies the existing Hertz and Fang analytical models applicable to hard-on-hard hip implants. The contact parameters, such as the maximum contact pressure, contact radius and the maximum deformation, are considered for the validation with FEM. Both analytical models fail to predict the contact conditions throughout a gait cycle. A novel data-driven ANN model is developed to comprehensively predict the contact conditions considering different input parameters. The analysis shows that cup thickness significantly affects the output contact conditions. Therefore, it is recommended to consider cup thickness in the analytical model interpretation for hard-on-hard hip implants.</description>

      <title>A directional total variation minimization algorithm for isotropic resolution in digital breast tomosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optimization-based image reconstruction algorithm is developed for contrast enhanced digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) using dual-energy scanning. The algorithm minimizes directional total variation (TV) with a data discrepancy and non-negativity constraints. Iodinated contrast agent (ICA) imaging is performed by reconstructing images from dual-energy DBT data followed by weighted subtraction. Physical DBT data is acquired with a Siemens Mammomat scanner of a structured breast phantom with ICA inserts. Results are shown for both directional TV minimization and filtered back-projection for reference. It is seen that directional TV is able to substantially reduce depth blur for the ICA objects.</description>

      <title>CT Reconstruction using Diffusion Posterior Sampling conditioned on a Nonlinear Measurement Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been demonstrated as powerful deep learning tools for image generation in CT reconstruction and restoration. Recently, diffusion posterior sampling, where a score-based diffusion prior is combined with a likelihood model, has been used to produce high quality CT images given low-quality measurements. This technique is attractive since it permits a one-time, unsupervised training of a CT prior; which can then be incorporated with an arbitrary data model. However, current methods rely on a linear model of x-ray CT physics to reconstruct or restore images. While it is common to linearize the transmission tomography reconstruction problem, this is an approximation to the true and inherently nonlinear forward model. We propose a new method that solves the inverse problem of nonlinear CT image reconstruction via diffusion posterior sampling. We implement a traditional unconditional diffusion model by training a prior score function estimator, and apply Bayes rule to combine this prior with a measurement likelihood score function derived from the nonlinear physical model to arrive at a posterior score function that can be used to sample the reverse-time diffusion process. This plug-and-play method allows incorporation of a diffusion-based prior with generalized nonlinear CT image reconstruction into multiple CT system designs with different forward models, without the need for any additional training. We develop the algorithm that performs this reconstruction, including an ordered-subsets variant for accelerated processing and demonstrate the technique in both fully sampled low dose data and sparse-view geometries using a single unsupervised training of the prior.</description>

      <title>Generating Synthetic Computed Tomography for Radiotherapy: SynthRAD2023 Challenge Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation therapy plays a crucial role in cancer treatment, necessitating precise delivery of radiation to tumors while sparing healthy tissues over multiple days. Computed tomography (CT) is integral for treatment planning, offering electron density data crucial for accurate dose calculations. However, accurately representing patient anatomy is challenging, especially in adaptive radiotherapy, where CT is not acquired daily. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides superior soft-tissue contrast. Still, it lacks electron density information while cone beam CT (CBCT) lacks direct electron density calibration and is mainly used for patient positioning. Adopting MRI-only or CBCT-based adaptive radiotherapy eliminates the need for CT planning but presents challenges. Synthetic CT (sCT) generation techniques aim to address these challenges by using image synthesis to bridge the gap between MRI, CBCT, and CT. The SynthRAD2023 challenge was organized to compare synthetic CT generation methods using multi-center ground truth data from 1080 patients, divided into two tasks: 1) MRI-to-CT and 2) CBCT-to-CT. The evaluation included image similarity and dose-based metrics from proton and photon plans. The challenge attracted significant participation, with 617 registrations and 22/17 valid submissions for tasks 1/2. Top-performing teams achieved high structural similarity indices (&gt;0.87/0.90) and gamma pass rates for photon (&gt;98.1%/99.0%) and proton (&gt;97.3%/97.0%) plans. However, no significant correlation was found between image similarity metrics and dose accuracy, emphasizing the need for dose evaluation when assessing the clinical applicability of sCT. SynthRAD2023 facilitated the investigation and benchmarking of sCT generation techniques, providing insights for developing MRI-only and CBCT-based adaptive radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>In vivo fundus imaging and computational refocusing with a diffuser-based fundus camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Access to eye care can be expanded with high-throughput, easy-to-use, and portable diagnostic tools. Phase mask encoded imaging could improve these aspects of the fundus camera by enabling computational refocusing without any moving parts. This approach circumvents the need to adjust lenses to compensate for refractive errors. We developed a computational fundus camera by introducing a holographic diffuser at the plane conjugate to the ocular pupil, resulting in a laterally shift-invariant point spread function. We demonstrate computational refocusing of a model eye fundus over a large range of defocus errors. We also show computationally refocused, color, in vivo, human fundus images with a $\geq$35-degree field-of-view (FOV). This technology could eventually be combined with the wavefront-sensing capabilities of phase mask encoded imaging to create a compact ophthalmic imaging system that simultaneously captures a fundus image and performs aberrometry.</description>
