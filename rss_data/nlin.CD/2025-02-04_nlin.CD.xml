      <title>Nonreciprocal Amplification Toward Chaos in a Chain of Duffing Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unidirectional amplification in a nonreciprocally coupled chain of harmonic oscillators serves as a classical analog of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). We extend this concept to the nonlinear regime using double-well Duffing oscillators arranged in a ring-structured unit. Adding a unit induces bifurcations of attractors, transitioning from limit cycles to tori, chaos, and hyper-chaos. The unidirectional couplings between units enable the decomposition of dynamics in a high-dimensional phase space into subspace attractors. In the chaotic regime, a saturation behavior is observed, characterized by monotonically decreasing amplitudes within a unit, contrasting with the increasing amplitudes seen in the linear NHSE. This work reveals novel bifurcation behaviors arising from the intricate interplay between nonreciprocality and nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Control Strategy for Generalized Synchrony in Coupled Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical systems can be coupled in a manner that is designed to drive the resulting dynamics onto a specified lower dimensional submanifold in the phase space of the combined system. On the submanifold, the variables of the two systems have a well-defined unique functional relationship. This process can thus be viewed as a control technique that ensures generalized synchronization. Depending on the nature of the dynamical systems and the specified submanifold, different coupling functions can be derived in order to achieve a desired control objective. We discuss the circuit implementations of this strategy in representative examples of coupled chaotic dynamical systems, namely Lorenz oscillators</description>

      <title>Energy, enstrophy and helicity transfers in polymeric turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterise the scale-by-scale transfers of energy, enstrophy and helicity in homogeneous and isotropic polymeric turbulence using direct numerical simulations. The microscale Reynolds number is set to $Re_\lambda \approx 460$, and the Deborah number $De = \tau_p/\tau_f$ is varied between $1/9 \le De \le 9$; $\tau_p$ is the polymeric relaxation time and $\tau_f$ is the turnover time of the largest scales of the flow. The study relies on the exact scale-by-scale budget equations (derived from the the governing model equations) for energy, enstrophy and helicity, which account for the back-reaction of the polymers on the flow. Polymers act as a sink/source in the flow, and provide alternative routes for the scale-by-scale transfers of the three quantities, whose relevance changes with $De$. We find that polymers deplete the nonlinear energy cascade mainly at smaller scales, by weakening both the extreme forward as well as reverse local events. The new polymer-driven energy flux dominates at small scales for $De \ge 1$, and on average transfers energy from larger to smaller scales with localised backscatter events. Polymers weaken the stretching of vorticity with the enstrophy being mainly generated by the fluid-polymer interaction, especially when $De \ge 1$. Accordingly, an inspection of the small-scale flow topology shows that polymers favour events with two-dimensional state of straining, and promote/inhibit extreme extension/rotation events: in polymeric turbulence shear and planar extensional flows are more probable. The helicity injected at the largest scales shows a similar transfer process to as energy, being mainly driven by the nonlinear cascade at large scales and by the polymer-driven flux at small scales. Polymers are found to favour events that break the small-scale mirror symmetry, with the relative helicity monotonically increasing with $De$ at all scales.</description>

      <title>Constants of Motion for Conserved and Non-conserved Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper begins with a dynamical model that was obtained by applying a machine learning technique (FJet) to time-series data; this dynamical model is then analyzed with Lie symmetry techniques to obtain constants of motion. This analysis is performed on both the conserved and non-conserved cases of the 1D and 2D harmonic oscillators. For the 1D oscillator, constants are found in the cases where the system is underdamped, overdamped, and critically damped. The novel existence of such a constant for a non-conserved model is interpreted as a manifestation of the conservation of energy of the {\em total} system (i.e., oscillator plus dissipative environment). For the 2D oscillator, constants are found for the isotropic and anisotropic cases, including when the frequencies are incommensurate; it is also generalized to arbitrary dimensions. In addition, a constant is identified which generalizes angular momentum for all ratios of the frequencies. The approach presented here can produce {\em multiple} constants of motion from a {\em single}, generic data set.</description>

      <title>Orbital dynamics in galactic potentials under mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16367v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent potentials are common in galactic systems that undergo significant evolution, interactions, or encounters with other galaxies, or when there are dynamic processes like star formation and merging events. Recent studies show that an ensemble approach along with the so-called snapshot framework in dynamical system theory provide a powerful tool to analyze time dependent dynamics.
  In this work, we aim to explore and quantify the phase space structure and dynamical complexity in time-dependent galactic potentials consisting of multiple components. We apply the classical method of Poincar\'e-surface of section to analyze the phase space structure in a chaotic Hamiltonian system subjected to parameter drift. This, however, makes sense only when the evolution of a large ensemble of initial conditions is followed. Numerical simulations explore the phase space structure of such ensembles while the system undergoes a continuous parameter change. The pair-wise average distance of ensemble members allows us to define a generalized Lyapunov-exponent, that might also be time dependent, to describe the system stability. We provide a comprehensive dynamical analysis of the system under circumstances where linear mass transfer occurs between the disk and bulge components of the model.</description>

      <title>Novel Topology and Manipulation of Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control of wave scattering in complex non-Hermitian settings is an exciting subject -- often challenging the creativity of researchers and stimulating the imagination of the public. Successful outcomes include invisibility cloaks, wavefront shaping protocols, active metasurface development, and more. At their core, these achievements rely on our ability to engineer the resonant spectrum of the underlying physical structures which is conventionally accomplished by carefully imposing geometrical and/or dynamical symmetries. In contrast, by taking active control over the boundary conditions in complex scattering environments which lack artificially-imposed geometric symmetries, we demonstrate via microwave experiments the ability to manipulate the spectrum of the scattering operator. This active control empowers the creation, destruction and repositioning of exceptional point degeneracies (EPD's) in a two-dimensional (2D) parameter space. The presence of EPD's signifies a coalescence of the scattering eigenmodes, which dramatically affects transport. The scattering EPD's are partitioned in domains characterized by a binary charge, as well as an integer winding number, are topologically stable in the two-dimensional parameter space, and obey winding number-conservation laws upon interactions with each other, even in cases where Lorentz reciprocity is violated; in this case the topological domains are destroyed. Ramifications of this understanding is the proposition for a unique input-magnitude and phase-insensitive 50:50 in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) power splitter. Our study establishes an important step towards complete control of scattering processes in complex non-Hermitian settings.</description>

      <title>Brickwall One-Loop Determinant: Spectral Statistics &amp; Krylov Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon -- a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon -- within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.</description>
