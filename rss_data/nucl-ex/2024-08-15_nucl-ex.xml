      <title>Experimental signatures of a new channel of the DD reaction at very-low energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of a new, strong reaction channel of the deuteron-deuteron fusion at very low energies might have major consequences for the construction of a future clean and efficient energy source. Following the first theoretical and experimental indications for the existence of the deuteron-deuteron threshold resonance in the $^4$He nucleus and its dominant decay by the internal $e^+e^-$ pair creation, we present here an extensive experimental study confirming emission of high-energy electrons and positrons. A simultaneous use of Si charged particle detectors of different thicknesses and large volume NaI(Tl) and HPGe detectors has allowed for the first time to determine the branching ratio between emitted protons, neutrons and $e^+e^-$ pairs for deuteron energies down to 5 keV. The high-energy positrons could be unambiguously detected by their bremsstrahlung spectra and annihilation radiation, supported by the Monte Carlo Geant4 simulations. The theoretical calculations, based on a destructive interference between the threshold resonance and the known broad resonance in $^4$He, agree very well with experimentally observed increase of branching ratios for lowering projectile energies. The partial width of the threshold resonance for the $e^+e^-$ pair creation should be at least 10 times larger than that of the proton channel.</description>

      <title>Search for baryon junctions in e+A collisions at the Electron Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constituent quarks in a nucleon are the essential elements in the standard ``quark model" associated with the electric charge, spin, mass, and baryon number of a nucleon. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) describes nucleon as a composite object containing current quarks (valence quarks and sea (anti-)quarks) and gluons. These subatomic elements and their interactions are known to contribute in complex ways to the overall nucleon spin and mass. In the early development of QCD theory in the 1970s, an alternative hypothesis postulated that the baryon number might manifest itself through a non-perturbative configuration of gluon fields forming a Y-shaped topology known as the gluon junction. In this work, we propose to test such hypothesis by measuring (i) the Regge intercept of the net-baryon distributions for $e$+($p$)Au collisions, (ii) baryon and charge transport in the isobaric ratio between $e$+Ru and $e$+Zr collisions, and (iii) target flavor dependence of proton and antiproton yields at large rapidity, transported from the hydrogen and deuterium targets in $e+p$(d) collisions. Our study indicates that these measurements at the EIC can help determine what carries the baryon number.</description>

      <title>Study of the Log-third-difference method for the computation of even-odd staggering in fission yields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The even-odd staggering in fission fragments yield distributions is an important observable to address the role of intrinsic excitations in the fission process. However, its computation as a function of the fragment split is an ill-posed problem that is usually solved through certain assumptions. Arguably, the most widely used method for its computation is the Log-third-difference method, which assumes an underlying local Gaussian distribution. Experimental data of the even-odd effect show sharp features and peaks that are a challenge for the Log-third difference method (or any method for that matter). This paper presents a detailed study of the performance of the Log-third difference method and describes three strategies for improving the precision and accuracy around these sharp features. The best results are obtained with an iterative application of the method and with the use of a multi-Gaussian fit. In regions with a smooth behaviour, the direct application of the Log-third-difference method remains the best option.</description>

      <title>Dihadron azimuthal asymmetry and light-quark dipole moments at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to probe light-quark dipole moments by examining the azimuthal asymmetries between a collinear pair of hadrons in semi-inclusive deep inelastic lepton scattering off an unpolarized proton target at the Electron-Ion Collider. These asymmetries provide a means to observe transversely polarized quarks, which arise exclusively from the interference between the dipole and the Standard Model interactions, thereby depending linearly on the dipole couplings. We demonstrate that this novel approach can enhance current constraints on light-quark dipole operators by an order of magnitude, free from contamination of other new physics effects. Furthermore, it allows for a simultaneous determination of both the real and imaginary parts of the dipole couplings, offering a new avenue for investigating potential $CP$-violating effects at high energies.</description>

      <title>Survival Probabilities of Compound Superheavy Nuclei Towards Element 119</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To synthesize superheavy element 119 is becoming highly concerned as several experimental projects in major laboratories are being pursued. This work studied the survival probabilities of compound superheavy nuclei after multiple neutron emissions based on microscopic energy dependent fission barriers, demonstrating a significant role of triaxial deformation in decreasing the first fission barriers in the heaviest region. Together with the fusion cross sections by the dinuclear system model, the optimal energy and the residual cross section of $^{243}$Am($^{48}$Ca, 3$n$)$^{288}$Mc are reproduced. Finally the cross sections and optimal beam energies of $^{243}$Am+$^{54}$Cr and $^{249}$Bk+$^{50}$Ti reactions are estimated, providing clues for the synthesis of new elements.</description>

      <title>Anti-flow of Mesons in the High Baryon Density Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The E895 and STAR experiments demonstrate that the slopes of directed flow with respect to rapidity ($dv_1/dy|_{y=0}$) of mesons are negative in the low transverse momentum ($p_T$) region, $p_T &lt; 0.8$ GeV/$c$, in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3.0 - 3.9$ GeV. Using the transport model JAM, we investigate the directed flow of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, and $K^0$ as functions of rapidity, $p_T$, and collision energy in Au + Au collisions at the same energies as those in the E895 and STAR experiments. We find that the JAM model can qualitatively reproduce the anti-flow of $K^0_S$ observed in the E895 experiment. The $v_1$ slopes of pions and kaons are analyzed as functions of the $p_T$ window, revealing a strong $p_T$ dependence of the $v_1$ slopes. Negative $v_1$ slopes are observed in the low $p_T$ region, $p_T &lt; 0.8$ GeV/$c$, while positive slopes are shown in the higher $p_T$ region. We find that the shadowing effect from spectators is crucial in generating the anti-flow of mesons at low $p_T$ in the high baryon density region.</description>

      <title>$X(3960)$, $X_0(4140)$, and other compact $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectrum and rearrangement decays of S-wave $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquark states in a simplified quark model. The masses and widths are estimated by assuming that the $X(4140)$ is the lower $1^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquark. Comparing our results with experimental measurements, we find that the recently observed $X(3960)$ by LHCb can be assigned as the lowest $0^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquark state and the $X_0(4140)$ could be the second lowest $0^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquark. Predictions of ratios between partial widths for the involved tetraquarks are given. We call for searches for more $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquarks with $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$, $0^{++}$, and $2^{++}$.</description>

      <title>Long-range near-side correlation in $e^+e^-$ Collisions at 183-209 GeV with ALEPH Archived Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05084v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first measurement of two-particle angular correlations for charged particles with LEP-II data is presented. The study is performed using archived hadronic $e^+e^-$ data collected by ALEPH at center-of-mass energies up to 209 GeV, above the $W^+W^-$ production threshold, which provide access to unprecedented charged-particle multiplicities and more complex color-string configurations if compared to previous measurements at LEP-I energies. An intriguing long-range near-side excess is observed in the correlation function measured with respect to the thrust axis in the highest multiplicity interval $N_{\mathrm{trk}}\geq 50$. Such a structure is not predicted by the Monte-Carlo simulation. The harmonic anisotropy coefficients $v_n$, which result from the Fourier expansion of the two-particle correlation functions, were also measured for the first time in $e^+e^-$ data, and compared to PYTHIA6 predictions and to the results obtained in proton-proton collisions. The results presented in the Letter provide novel experimental constraints on the formation of collective phenomena in point-like $e^+e^-$ collisions.</description>
