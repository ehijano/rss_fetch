      <title>A Novel Use of Pseudospectra in Mathematical Biology: Understanding HPA Axis Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis is a major neuroendocrine system, and its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases. This system also presents interesting mathematical challenges for modeling. We consider a nonlinear delay differential equation model and calculate pseudospectra of three different linearizations: a time-dependent Jacobian, linearization around the limit cycle, and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) analysis of Koopman operators (global linearization). The time-dependent Jacobian provided insight into experimental phenomena, explaining why rats respond differently to perturbations during corticosterone secretion's upward versus downward slopes. We developed new mathematical techniques for the other two linearizations to calculate pseudospectra on Banach spaces and apply DMD to delay differential equations, respectively. These methods helped establish local and global limit cycle stability and study transients. Additionally, we discuss using pseudospectra to substantiate the model in experimental contexts and establish bio-variability via data-driven methods. This work is the first to utilize pseudospectra to explore the HPA axis.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem for Dirac operators with a small delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses inverse spectral problems associated with Dirac-type operators with a constant delay, specifically when this delay is less than one-third of the interval length. Our research focuses on eigenvalue behavior and operator recovery from spectra. We find that two spectra alone are insufficient to fully recover the potentials. Additionally, we consider the Ambarzumian-type inverse problem for Dirac-type operators with a delay. Our results have significant implications for the study of inverse problems related to the differential operators with a constant delay and may inform future research directions in this field.</description>

      <title>p-adic Equiangular Lines and p-adic van Lint-Seidel Relative Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of p-adic equiangular lines and derive the first fundamental relation between common angle, dimension of the space and the number of lines. More precisely, we show that if $\{\tau_j\}_{j=1}^n$ is p-adic $\gamma$-equiangular lines in $\mathbb{Q}^d_p$, then \begin{align*} (1) \quad\quad \quad \quad |n|^2\leq |d|\max\{|n|, \gamma^2 \}. \end{align*} 
  We call Inequality (1) as the p-adic van Lint-Seidel relative bound. We believe that this complements fundamental van Lint-Seidel \textit{[Indag. Math., 1966]} relative bound for equiangular lines in the p-adic case.</description>

      <title>Green functions and completeness; the $3$-body problem revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the class of Derezi{\'n}ski-Enss pair-potentials which includes Coulomb potentials a stationary scattering theory for $N$-body systems was recently developed \cite {Sk1}. In particular the wave and scattering matrices as well as the restricted wave operators are all defined at any non-threshold energy, and this holds without imposing any a priori decay condition on channel eigenstates. In this paper we improve for the case of $3$-body systems on the known \emph{weak continuity} properties in that we show that all non-threshold energies are \emph{stationary complete} in this case, resolving a conjecture from \cite {Sk1} in the special case $N=3$. A consequence is that the above scattering quantities depend \emph{strongly continuously} on the energy parameter at all non-threshold energies, hence not only almost everywhere as previously demonstrated (for an arbitrary $N$). Another consequence is that the  scattering matrix is unitary at any such energy. As a side result we give an independent stationary proof of asymptotic completeness for $3$-body systems with long-range pair-potentials. This is an alternative to the known time-dependent proofs \cite{De, En}.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Witten instanton complexes on stratified pseudomanifolds with K\"ahler wedge metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct Witten instanton complexes for K\"ahler Hamiltonian Morse functions on stratified pseudomanifolds with wedge K\"ahler metrics satisfying a local conformally totally geodesic condition. We use this to extend Witten's holomorphic Morse inequalities for the $L^2$ cohomology of Dolbeault complexes, deriving versions for Poincar\'e Hodge polynomials, the spin Dirac and signature complexes for which we prove rigidity results, in particular establishing the rigidity of $L^2$ de Rham cohomology for these circle actions. We study formulas for Rarita Schwinger operators, generalize formulas studied by Witten and Gibbons-Hawking for the equivariant signature and extend formulas used to compute NUT charges of gravitational instantons. We discuss conjectural inequalities extending known Lefschetz-Riemann-Roch formulas for other cohomology theories including those of Baum-Fulton-Quart. This article contains the first extension of Witten's holomorphic Morse inequalities and instanton complexes to singular spaces.</description>
