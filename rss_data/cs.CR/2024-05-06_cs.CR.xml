      <title>The Democratization of Wealth Management: Hedged Mutual Fund Blockchain Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop several innovations designed to bring the best practices of traditional investment funds to the blockchain landscape. Our innovations combine the superior mechanisms of mutual funds and hedge funds. Specifically, we illustrate how fund prices can be updated regularly like mutual funds and performance fees can be charged like hedge funds. We show how mutually hedged blockchain investment funds can operate with investor protection schemes - high water marks - and measures to offset trading slippage when redemptions happen. We provide detailed steps - including mathematical formulations and instructive pointers - to implement these ideas as blockchain smart contracts. We discuss how our designs overcome several blockchain bottlenecks and how we can make smart contracts smarter. We provide numerical illustrations of several scenarios related to the mechanisms we have tailored for blockchain implementation.
  The concepts we have developed for blockchain implementation can also be useful in traditional financial funds to calculate performance fees in a simplified manner. We highlight two main issues with the operation of mutual funds and hedge funds and show how blockchain technology can alleviate those concerns. The ideas developed here illustrate on one hand, how blockchain can solve many issues faced by the traditional world and on the other hand, how many innovations from traditional finance can benefit decentralized finance and speed its adoption. This becomes an example of symbiosis between decentralized and traditional finance - bringing these two realms closer and breaking down barriers between such artificial distinctions - wherein the future will be about providing better risk adjusted wealth appreciation opportunities to end customers through secure, reliable, accessible and transparent services - without getting too caught up about how such services are being rendered.</description>

      <title>Improved Communication-Privacy Trade-offs in $L_2$ Mean Estimation under Streaming Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $L_2$ mean estimation under central differential privacy and communication constraints, and address two key challenges: firstly, existing mean estimation schemes that simultaneously handle both constraints are usually optimized for $L_\infty$ geometry and rely on random rotation or Kashin's representation to adapt to $L_2$ geometry, resulting in suboptimal leading constants in mean square errors (MSEs); secondly, schemes achieving order-optimal communication-privacy trade-offs do not extend seamlessly to streaming differential privacy (DP) settings (e.g., tree aggregation or matrix factorization), rendering them incompatible with DP-FTRL type optimizers.
  In this work, we tackle these issues by introducing a novel privacy accounting method for the sparsified Gaussian mechanism that incorporates the randomness inherent in sparsification into the DP noise. Unlike previous approaches, our accounting algorithm directly operates in $L_2$ geometry, yielding MSEs that fast converge to those of the uncompressed Gaussian mechanism. Additionally, we extend the sparsification scheme to the matrix factorization framework under streaming DP and provide a precise accountant tailored for DP-FTRL type optimizers. Empirically, our method demonstrates at least a 100x improvement of compression for DP-SGD across various FL tasks.</description>

      <title>Backdoor-based Explainable AI Benchmark for High Fidelity Evaluation of Attribution Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attribution methods compute importance scores for input features to explain the output predictions of deep models. However, accurate assessment of attribution methods is challenged by the lack of benchmark fidelity for attributing model predictions. Moreover, other confounding factors in attribution estimation, including the setup choices of post-processing techniques and explained model predictions, further compromise the reliability of the evaluation. In this work, we first identify a set of fidelity criteria that reliable benchmarks for attribution methods are expected to fulfill, thereby facilitating a systematic assessment of attribution benchmarks. Next, we introduce a Backdoor-based eXplainable AI benchmark (BackX) that adheres to the desired fidelity criteria. We theoretically establish the superiority of our approach over the existing benchmarks for well-founded attribution evaluation. With extensive analysis, we also identify a setup for a consistent and fair benchmarking of attribution methods across different underlying methodologies. This setup is ultimately employed for a comprehensive comparison of existing methods using our BackX benchmark. Finally, our analysis also provides guidance for defending against backdoor attacks with the help of attribution methods.</description>

      <title>Temporal assessment of malicious behaviors: application to turnout field data monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitored data collected from railway turnouts are vulnerable to cyberattacks: attackers may either conceal failures or trigger unnecessary maintenance actions. To address this issue, a cyberattack investigation method is proposed based on predictions made from the temporal evolution of the turnout behavior. These predictions are then compared to the field acquired data to detect any discrepancy. This method is illustrated on a collection of real-life data.</description>

      <title>Adaptive and robust watermark against model extraction attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have boosted Large Models as a Service (LMaaS) into a thriving business sector. But even model owners offering only API access while keeping model parameters and internal workings private, their Intellectual Property (IP) are still at risk of theft through model extraction attacks. To safeguard the IP of these models and mitigate unfair competition in the language model market, watermarking technology serves as an efficient post-hoc solution for identifying IP infringements. However, existing IP protection watermarking methods either explicitly alter the original output of the language model or implant watermark signals in the model logits. These methods forcefully distort the original distribution of the language model and impact the sampling process, leading to a decline in the quality of the generated text. The existing method also fails to achieve end-to-end adaptive watermark embedding and lack robustness verification in complex scenarios where watermark detection is subject to interference. To overcome these challenges, we propose PromptShield, a plug-and-play IP protection watermarking method to resist model extraction attacks without training additional modules. Leveraging the self-reminding properties inherent in large language models, we encapsulate the user's query with a watermark self-generated instruction, nudging the LLMs to automatically generate watermark words in its output without compromising generation quality. Our method does not require access to the model's internal logits and minimizes alterations to the model's distribution using prompt-guided cues. Comprehensive experimental results consistently demonstrate the effectiveness, harmlessness, and robustness of our watermark. Moreover, Our watermark detection method remains robust and high detection sensitivity even when subjected to interference.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: A Study of AI-based Vulnerability Management between Industry and Academia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have yielded promising results for automated software vulnerability management. AI-based models are reported to greatly outperform traditional static analysis tools, indicating a substantial workload relief for security engineers. However, the industry remains very cautious and selective about integrating AI-based techniques into their security vulnerability management workflow. To understand the reasons, we conducted a discussion-based study, anchored in the authors' extensive industrial experience and keen observations, to uncover the gap between research and practice in this field. We empirically identified three main barriers preventing the industry from adopting academic models, namely, complicated requirements of scalability and prioritization, limited customization flexibility, and unclear financial implications. Meanwhile, research works are significantly impacted by the lack of extensive real-world security data and expertise. We proposed a set of future directions to help better understand industry expectations, improve the practical usability of AI-based security vulnerability research, and drive a synergistic relationship between industry and academia.</description>

      <title>FastLloyd: Federated, Accurate, Secure, and Tunable $k$-Means Clustering with Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of privacy-preserving $k$-means clustering in the horizontally federated setting. Existing federated approaches using secure computation, suffer from substantial overheads and do not offer output privacy. At the same time, differentially private (DP) $k$-means algorithms assume a trusted central curator and do not extend to federated settings. Naively combining the secure and DP solutions results in a protocol with impractical overhead. Instead, our work provides enhancements to both the DP and secure computation components, resulting in a design that is faster, more private, and more accurate than previous work. By utilizing the computational DP model, we design a lightweight, secure aggregation-based approach that achieves four orders of magnitude speed-up over state-of-the-art related work. Furthermore, we not only maintain the utility of the state-of-the-art in the central model of DP, but we improve the utility further by taking advantage of constrained clustering techniques.</description>

      <title>ProFLingo: A Fingerprinting-based Copyright Protection Scheme for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention in recent years. Due to their "Large" nature, training LLMs from scratch consumes immense computational resources. Since several major players in the artificial intelligence (AI) field have open-sourced their original LLMs, an increasing number of individual researchers and smaller companies are able to build derivative LLMs based on these open-sourced models at much lower costs. However, this practice opens up possibilities for unauthorized use or reproduction that may not comply with licensing agreements, and deriving models can change the model's behavior, thus complicating the determination of model ownership. Current copyright protection schemes for LLMs are either designed for white-box settings or require additional modifications to the original model, which restricts their use in real-world settings.
  In this paper, we propose ProFLingo, a black-box fingerprinting-based copyright protection scheme for LLMs. ProFLingo generates adversarial examples (AEs) that can represent the unique decision boundary characteristics of an original model, thereby establishing unique fingerprints. Our scheme checks the effectiveness of these adversarial examples on a suspect model to determine whether it has been derived from the original model. ProFLingo offers a non-invasive approach, which neither requires knowledge of the suspect model nor modifications to the base model or its training process. To the best of our knowledge, our method represents the first black-box fingerprinting technique for copyright protection for LLMs. Our source code and generated AEs are available at: https://github.com/hengvt/ProFLingo_arXiv.</description>

      <title>DRAMScope: Uncovering DRAM Microarchitecture and Characteristics by Issuing Memory Commands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for precise information on DRAM microarchitectures and error characteristics has surged, driven by the need to explore processing in memory, enhance reliability, and mitigate security vulnerability. Nonetheless, DRAM manufacturers have disclosed only a limited amount of information, making it difficult to find specific information on their DRAM microarchitectures. This paper addresses this gap by presenting more rigorous findings on the microarchitectures of commodity DRAM chips and their impacts on the characteristics of activate-induced bitflips (AIBs), such as RowHammer and RowPress. The previous studies have also attempted to understand the DRAM microarchitectures and associated behaviors, but we have found some of their results to be misled by inaccurate address mapping and internal data swizzling, or lack of a deeper understanding of the modern DRAM cell structure. For accurate and efficient reverse-engineering, we use three tools: AIBs, retention time test, and RowCopy, which can be cross-validated. With these three tools, we first take a macroscopic view of modern DRAM chips to uncover the size, structure, and operation of their subarrays, memory array tiles (MATs), and rows. Then, we analyze AIB characteristics based on the microscopic view of the DRAM microarchitecture, such as 6F^2 cell layout, through which we rectify misunderstandings regarding AIBs and discover a new data pattern that accelerates AIBs. Lastly, based on our findings at both macroscopic and microscopic levels, we identify previously unknown AIB vulnerabilities and propose a simple yet effective protection solution.</description>

      <title>A Novel Endorsement Protocol to Secure BFT-Based Consensus in Permissionless Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permissionless blockchain technology offers numerous potential benefits for decentralised applications, such as security, transparency, and openness. BFT-based consensus mechanisms are widely adopted in the permissioned blockchain to meet the high scalability requirements of the network. Sybil attacks are one of the most potential threats when applying BFT-based consensus mechanisms in permissionless blockchain due to the lack of effective verification mechanisms for participants' identities. This paper presents a novel endorsement-based bootstrapping protocol with a signature algorithm that offers a streamlined, scalable identity endorsement and verification process. This approach effectively safeguards the BFT-based consensus mechanism against Sybil attacks. Using our proposed method, we have conducted thorough security analyses and simulation experiments to assess security, robustness, and scalability advantages in large-scale networks. Our results demonstrate that the scheme can effectively address the identity verification challenges when applying BFT-based consensus in a permissionless blockchain.</description>

      <title>CNN-LSTM and Transfer Learning Models for Malware Classification based on Opcodes and API Calls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model for a malware classification system based on Application Programming Interface (API) calls and opcodes, to improve classification accuracy. This system uses a novel design of combined Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory. We extract opcode sequences and API Calls from Windows malware samples for classification. We transform these features into N-grams (N = 2, 3, and 10)-gram sequences. Our experiments on a dataset of 9,749,57 samples produce high accuracy of 99.91% using the 8-gram sequences. Our method significantly improves the malware classification performance when using a wide range of recent deep learning architectures, leading to state-of-the-art performance. In particular, we experiment with ConvNeXt-T, ConvNeXt-S, RegNetY-4GF, RegNetY-8GF, RegNetY-12GF, EfficientNetV2, Sequencer2D-L, Swin-T, ViT-G/14, ViT-Ti, ViT-S, VIT-B, VIT-L, and MaxViT-B. Among these architectures, Swin-T and Sequencer2D-L architectures achieved high accuracies of 99.82% and 99.70%, respectively, comparable to our CNN-LSTM architecture although not surpassing it.</description>

      <title>TetraBFT: Reducing Latency of Unauthenticated, Responsive BFT Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents TetraBFT, a novel unauthenticated Byzantine fault tolerant protocol for solving consensus in partial synchrony, eliminating the need for public key cryptography and ensuring resilience against computationally unbounded adversaries. TetraBFT has several compelling features: it necessitates only constant local storage, has optimal communication complexity, satisfies optimistic responsiveness -- allowing the protocol to operate at actual network speeds under ideal conditions -- and can achieve consensus in just 5 message delays, which outperforms all known unauthenticated protocols achieving the other properties listed. We validate the correctness of TetraBFT through rigorous security analysis and formal verification. Furthermore, we extend TetraBFT into a multi-shot, chained consensus protocol, making a pioneering effort in applying pipelining techniques to unauthenticated protocols. This positions TetraBFT as a practical and deployable solution for blockchain systems aiming for high efficiency.</description>

      <title>SPARSE: Semantic Tracking and Path Analysis for Attack Investigation in Real-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the complexity and destructiveness of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) increase, there is a growing tendency to identify a series of actions undertaken to achieve the attacker's target, called attack investigation. Currently, analysts construct the provenance graph to perform causality analysis on Point-Of-Interest (POI) event for capturing critical events (related to the attack). However, due to the vast size of the provenance graph and the rarity of critical events, existing attack investigation methods suffer from problems of high false positives, high overhead, and high latency. To this end, we propose SPARSE, an efficient and real-time system for constructing critical component graphs (i.e., consisting of critical events) from streaming logs. Our key observation is 1) Critical events exist in a suspicious semantic graph (SSG) composed of interaction flows between suspicious entities, and 2) Information flows that accomplish attacker's goal exist in the form of paths. Therefore, SPARSE uses a two-stage framework to implement attack investigation (i.e., constructing the SSG and performing path-level contextual analysis). First, SPARSE operates in a state-based mode where events are consumed as streams, allowing easy access to the SSG related to the POI event through semantic transfer rule and storage strategy. Then, SPARSE identifies all suspicious flow paths (SFPs) related to the POI event from the SSG, quantifies the influence of each path to filter irrelevant events. Our evaluation on a real large-scale attack dataset shows that SPARSE can generate a critical component graph (~ 113 edges) in 1.6 seconds, which is 2014 X smaller than the backtracking graph (~ 227,589 edges). SPARSE is 25 X more effective than other state-of-the-art techniques in filtering irrelevant edges.</description>

      <title>Updating Windows Malware Detectors: Balancing Robustness and Regression against Adversarial EXEmples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial EXEmples are carefully-perturbed programs tailored to evade machine learning Windows malware detectors, with an on-going effort in developing robust models able to address detection effectiveness. However, even if robust models can prevent the majority of EXEmples, to maintain predictive power over time, models are fine-tuned to newer threats, leading either to partial updates or time-consuming retraining from scratch. Thus, even if the robustness against attacks is higher, the new models might suffer a regression in performance by misclassifying threats that were previously correctly detected. For these reasons, we study the trade-off between accuracy and regression when updating Windows malware detectors, by proposing EXE-scanner, a plugin that can be chained to existing detectors to promptly stop EXEmples without causing regression. We empirically show that previously-proposed hardening techniques suffer a regression of accuracy when updating non-robust models. On the contrary, we show that EXE-scanner exhibits comparable performance to robust models without regression of accuracy, and we show how to properly chain it after the base classifier to obtain the best performance without the need of costly retraining. To foster reproducibility, we openly release source code, along with the dataset of adversarial EXEmples based on state-of-the-art perturbation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Metric Differential Privacy at the User-Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metric differential privacy (DP) provides heterogeneous privacy guarantees based on a distance between the pair of inputs. It is a widely popular notion of privacy since it captures the natural privacy semantics for many applications (such as, for location data) and results in better utility than standard DP. However, prior work in metric DP has primarily focused on the \textit{item-level} setting where every user only reports a single data item. A more realistic setting is that of user-level DP where each user contributes multiple items and privacy is then desired at the granularity of the user's \textit{entire} contribution. In this paper, we initiate the study of metric DP at the user-level. Specifically, we use the earth-mover's distance ($d_\textsf{EM}$) as our metric to obtain a notion of privacy as it captures both the magnitude and spatial aspects of changes in a user's data.
  We make three main technical contributions. First, we design two novel mechanisms under $d_\textsf{EM}$-DP to answer linear queries and item-wise queries. Specifically, our analysis for the latter involves a generalization of the privacy amplification by shuffling result which may be of independent interest. Second, we provide a black-box reduction from the general unbounded to bounded $d_\textsf{EM}$-DP (size of the dataset is fixed and public) with a novel sampling based mechanism. Third, we show that our proposed mechanisms can provably provide improved utility over user-level DP, for certain types of linear queries and frequency estimation.</description>

      <title>DiffuseTrace: A Transparent and Flexible Watermarking Scheme for Latent Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) enable a wide range of applications but raise ethical concerns regarding illegal utilization.Adding watermarks to generative model outputs is a vital technique employed for copyright tracking and mitigating potential risks associated with AI-generated content. However, post-hoc watermarking techniques are susceptible to evasion. Existing watermarking methods for LDMs can only embed fixed messages. Watermark message alteration requires model retraining. The stability of the watermark is influenced by model updates and iterations. Furthermore, the current reconstruction-based watermark removal techniques utilizing variational autoencoders (VAE) and diffusion models have the capability to remove a significant portion of watermarks. Therefore, we propose a novel technique called DiffuseTrace. The goal is to embed invisible watermarks in all generated images for future detection semantically. The method establishes a unified representation of the initial latent variables and the watermark information through training an encoder-decoder model. The watermark information is embedded into the initial latent variables through the encoder and integrated into the sampling process. The watermark information is extracted by reversing the diffusion process and utilizing the decoder. DiffuseTrace does not rely on fine-tuning of the diffusion model components. The watermark is embedded into the image space semantically without compromising image quality. The encoder-decoder can be utilized as a plug-in in arbitrary diffusion models. We validate through experiments the effectiveness and flexibility of DiffuseTrace. DiffuseTrace holds an unprecedented advantage in combating the latest attacks based on variational autoencoders and Diffusion Models.</description>

      <title>Confidential and Protected Disease Classifier using Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid surge in the prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs), individuals are increasingly turning to conversational AI for initial insights across various domains, including health-related inquiries such as disease diagnosis. Many users seek potential causes on platforms like ChatGPT or Bard before consulting a medical professional for their ailment. These platforms offer valuable benefits by streamlining the diagnosis process, alleviating the significant workload of healthcare practitioners, and saving users both time and money by avoiding unnecessary doctor visits. However, Despite the convenience of such platforms, sharing personal medical data online poses risks, including the presence of malicious platforms or potential eavesdropping by attackers. To address privacy concerns, we propose a novel framework combining FHE and Deep Learning for a secure and private diagnosis system. Operating on a question-and-answer-based model akin to an interaction with a medical practitioner, this end-to-end secure system employs Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to handle encrypted input data. Given FHE's computational constraints, we adapt deep neural networks and activation functions to the encryted domain. Further, we also propose a faster algorithm to compute summation of ciphertext elements. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The proposed framework achieves strict security and privacy with minimal loss in performance.</description>

      <title>Nip in the Bud: Forecasting and Interpreting Post-exploitation Attacks in Real-time through Cyber Threat Intelligence Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks have caused significant damage worldwide. Various Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems are deployed by enterprises to fight against potential threats. However, EDR suffers from high false positives. In order not to affect normal operations, analysts need to investigate and filter detection results before taking countermeasures, in which heavy manual labor and alarm fatigue cause analysts miss optimal response time, thereby leading to information leakage and destruction. Therefore, we propose Endpoint Forecasting and Interpreting (EFI), a real-time attack forecast and interpretation system, which can automatically predict next move during post-exploitation and explain it in technique-level, then dispatch strategies to EDR for advance reinforcement. First, we use Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports to extract the attack scene graph (ASG) that can be mapped to low-level system logs to strengthen attack samples. Second, we build a serialized graph forecast model, which is combined with the attack provenance graph (APG) provided by EDR to generate an attack forecast graph (AFG) to predict the next move. Finally, we utilize the attack template graph (ATG) and graph alignment plus algorithm for technique-level interpretation to automatically dispatch strategies for EDR to reinforce system in advance. EFI can avoid the impact of existing EDR false positives, and can reduce the attack surface of system without affecting the normal operations. We collect a total of 3,484 CTI reports, generate 1,429 ASGs, label 8,000 sentences, tag 10,451 entities, and construct 256 ATGs. Experimental results on both DARPA Engagement and large scale CTI dataset show that the alignment score between the AFG predicted by EFI and the real attack graph is able to exceed 0.8, the forecast and interpretation precision of EFI can reach 91.8%.</description>

      <title>Insights Gained after a Decade of Cellular Automata-based Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular Automata (CA) have been extensively used to implement symmetric cryptographic primitives, such as pseudorandom number generators and S-boxes. However, most of the research in this field, except the very early works, seems to be published in non-cryptographic venues. This phenomenon poses a problem of relevance: are CA of any use to cryptographers nowadays? This paper provides insights into this question by briefly outlining the history of CA-based cryptography. In doing so, the paper identifies some shortcomings in the research addressing the design of symmetric primitives exclusively from a CA standpoint, alongside some recommendations for future research. Notably, the paper remarks that researchers working in CA and cryptography often tackle similar problems, albeit under different perspectives and terminologies. This observation indicates that there is still ample room for fruitful collaborations between the CA and cryptography communities in the future.</description>

      <title>Preventive Audits for Data Applications Before Data Sharing in the Power IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increase in data volume, more types of data are being used and shared, especially in the power Internet of Things (IoT). However, the processes of data sharing may lead to unexpected information leakage because of the ubiquitous relevance among the different data, thus it is necessary for data owners to conduct preventive audits for data applications before data sharing to avoid the risk of key information leakage. Considering that the same data may play completely different roles in different application scenarios, data owners should know the expected data applications of the data buyers in advance and provide modified data that are less relevant to the private information of the data owners and more relevant to the nonprivate information that the data buyers need. In this paper, data sharing in the power IoT is regarded as the background, and the mutual information of the data and their implicit information is selected as the data feature parameter to indicate the relevance between the data and their implicit information or the ability to infer the implicit information from the data. Therefore, preventive audits should be conducted based on changes in the data feature parameters before and after data sharing. The probability exchange adjustment method is proposed as the theoretical basis of preventive audits under simplified consumption, and the corresponding optimization models are constructed and extended to more practical scenarios with multivariate characteristics. Finally, case studies are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed preventive audits.</description>

      <title>FairRelay: Fair and Cost-Efficient Peer-to-Peer Content Delivery through Payment Channel Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer-to-Peer (P2P) content delivery, known for scalability and resilience, offers a decentralized alternative to traditional centralized Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). A significant challenge in P2P content delivery remains: the fair compensation of relayers for their bandwidth contributions. Existing solutions employ blockchains for payment settlements, however, they are not practical due to high on-chain costs and over-simplified network assumptions. In this paper, we introduce FairRelay, a fair and cost-efficient protocol that ensures all participants get fair payoff in complex content delivery network settings. We introduce a novel primitive, Enforceable Accumulative Hashed TimeLock Contract (Enforceable A-HTLC), designed to guarantee payment atomicity - ensuring all participants receive their payments upon successful content delivery.
  The fairness of FairRelay is proved using the Universal Composability (UC) framework. Our evaluation demonstrates that, in optimistic scenarios, FairRelay employs zero on-chain costs. In pessimistic scenarios, the on-chain dispute costs for relayers and customers are constant, irrespective of the network complexity. Specifically, empirical results indicate that the on-chain dispute costs for relayers and customers are 24,902 gas (equivalent to 0.01 USD on Optimism L2) and 290,797 gas (0.07 USD), respectively. In a 10-hop relay path, FairRelay introduces less than 1.5% additional overhead compared to pure data transmission, showcasing the efficiency of FairRelay.</description>

      <title>Defense against Joint Poison and Evasion Attacks: A Case Study of DERMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an upward trend of deploying distributed energy resource management systems (DERMS) to control modern power grids. However, DERMS controller communication lines are vulnerable to cyberattacks that could potentially impact operational reliability. While a data-driven intrusion detection system (IDS) can potentially thwart attacks during deployment, also known as the evasion attack, the training of the detection algorithm may be corrupted by adversarial data injected into the database, also known as the poisoning attack. In this paper, we propose the first framework of IDS that is robust against joint poisoning and evasion attacks. We formulate the defense mechanism as a bilevel optimization, where the inner and outer levels deal with attacks that occur during training time and testing time, respectively. We verify the robustness of our method on the IEEE-13 bus feeder model against a diverse set of poisoning and evasion attack scenarios. The results indicate that our proposed method outperforms the baseline technique in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall for intrusion detection.</description>

      <title>Explainable Malware Detection with Tailored Logic Explained Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malware detection is a constant challenge in cybersecurity due to the rapid development of new attack techniques. Traditional signature-based approaches struggle to keep pace with the sheer volume of malware samples. Machine learning offers a promising solution, but faces issues of generalization to unseen samples and a lack of explanation for the instances identified as malware. However, human-understandable explanations are especially important in security-critical fields, where understanding model decisions is crucial for trust and legal compliance. While deep learning models excel at malware detection, their black-box nature hinders explainability. Conversely, interpretable models often fall short in performance. To bridge this gap in this application domain, we propose the use of Logic Explained Networks (LENs), which are a recently proposed class of interpretable neural networks providing explanations in the form of First-Order Logic (FOL) rules. This paper extends the application of LENs to the complex domain of malware detection, specifically using the large-scale EMBER dataset. In the experimental results we show that LENs achieve robustness that exceeds traditional interpretable methods and that are rivaling black-box models. Moreover, we introduce a tailored version of LENs that is shown to generate logic explanations with higher fidelity with respect to the model's predictions.</description>

      <title>On the use of dynamical systems in cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ever since the link between nonlinear science and cryptography became apparent, the problem of applying chaotic dynamics to the construction of cryptographic systems has gained a broad audience and has been the subject of thousands of papers. Yet, the field has not found its place in mainstream cryptography, largely due to persistent weaknesses in the presented systems. The goal of this paper is to help remedy this problem in two ways. The first is by providing a new algorithm that can be used to attack -- and hence test the security of -- stream ciphers based on the iteration of a chaotic map of the interval. The second is to cast discrete dynamical systems problems in a modern cryptographic and complexity theoretic language, so that researchers working in chaos-based cryptography can begin designing cryptographic protocols that have a better chance of meeting the extreme standards of modern cryptography.</description>

      <title>Swipe2Pair: Secure and Fast In-Band Wireless Device Pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless device pairing is a critical security mechanism to bootstrap the secure communication between two devices without a pre-shared secret. It has been widely used in many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as smart-home and smart-health. Most existing device pairing mechanisms are based on out-of-band channels, e.g., extra sensors or hardware, to validate the proximity of pairing devices. However, out-of-band channels are not universal across all wireless devices, so such a scheme is limited to certain application scenarios or conditions. On the other hand, in-band channel-based device pairing seeks universal applicability by only relying on wireless interfaces. Existing in-band channel-based pairing schemes either require multiple antennas separated by a good distance on one pairing device, which is not feasible in certain scenarios, or require users to repeat multiple sweeps, which is not optimal in terms of usability.
  Therefore, an in-band wireless device pairing scheme providing high security while maintaining high usability (simple pairing process and minimal user intervention) is highly desired. In this work, we propose an easy-to-use mutual authentication device pairing scheme, named Swipe2Pair, based on the proximity of pairing devices and randomization of wireless transmission power. We conduct extensive security analysis and collect considerable experimental data under various settings across different environments. Experimental results show that Swipe2Pair achieves high security and usability. It only takes less than one second to complete the pairing process with a simple swipe of one device in front of the other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread use of the Internet of Things has led to the development of large amounts of perception data, making it necessary to develop effective and scalable data analysis tools. Federated Learning emerges as a promising paradigm to address the inherent challenges of power consumption and data privacy in IoT environments. This paper explores the transformative potential of FL in enhancing the longevity of IoT devices by mitigating power consumption and enhancing privacy and security measures.

      <title>FOBNN: Fast Oblivious Binarized Neural Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superior performance of deep learning has propelled the rise of Deep Learning as a Service, enabling users to transmit their private data to service providers for model execution and inference retrieval. Nevertheless, the primary concern remains safeguarding the confidentiality of sensitive user data while optimizing the efficiency of secure protocols. To address this, we develop a fast oblivious binarized neural network inference framework, FOBNN. Specifically, we customize binarized convolutional neural networks to enhance oblivious inference, design two fast algorithms for binarized convolutions, and optimize network structures experimentally under constrained costs. Initially, we meticulously analyze the range of intermediate values in binarized convolutions to minimize bit representation, resulting in the Bit Length Bounding (BLB) algorithm. Subsequently, leveraging the efficiency of bitwise operations in BLB, we further enhance performance by employing pure bitwise operations for each binary digit position, yielding the Layer-wise Bit Accumulation (LBA) algorithm. Theoretical analysis validates FOBNN's security and indicates up to $2 \times$ improvement in computational and communication costs compared to the state-of-the-art method. We demonstrates our framework's effectiveness in RNA function prediction within bioinformatics. Rigorous experimental assessments confirm that our oblivious inference solutions not only maintain but often exceed the original accuracy, surpassing prior efforts.</description>

      <title>An Efficient All-to-All GCD Algorithm for Low Entropy RSA Key Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RSA is an incredibly successful and useful asymmetric encryption algorithm. One of the types of implementation flaws in RSA is low entropy of the key generation, specifically the prime number creation stage. This can occur due to flawed usage of random prime number generator libraries, or on computers where there is a lack of a source of external entropy. These implementation flaws result in some RSA keys sharing prime factors, which means that the full factorization of the public modulus can be recovered incredibly efficiently by performing a computation GCD between the two public key moduli that share the prime factor. However, since one does not know which of the composite moduli share a prime factor a-priori, to determine if any such shared prime factors exist, an all-to-all GCD attack (also known as a batch GCD attack, or a bulk GCD attack) can be performed on the available public keys so as to recover any shared prime factors. This study describes a novel all-to-all batch GCD algorithm, which will be referred to as the binary tree batch GCD algorithm, that is more efficient than the current best batch GCD algorithm (the remainder tree batch GCD algorithm). A comparison against the best existing batch GCD method (which is a product tree followed by a remainder tree computation) is given using a dataset of random RSA moduli that are constructed such that some of the moduli share prime factors. This proposed binary tree batch GCD algorithm has better runtime than the existing remainder tree batch GCD algorithm, although asymptotically it has nearly identical scaling and its complexity is dependent on how many shared prime factors exist in the set of RSA keys. In practice, the implementation of the proposed binary tree batch GCD algorithm has a roughly 6x speedup compared to the standard remainder tree batch GCD approach.</description>

      <title>PCG: Mitigating Conflict-based Cache Side-channel Attacks with Prefetching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To defend against conflict-based cache side-channel attacks, cache partitioning or remapping techniques were proposed to prevent set conflicts between different security domains or obfuscate the locations of such conflicts. But such techniques complicate cache design and may result in significant performance penalties. Therefore, there have been lightweight prefetching-based schemes proposed to introduce noise to confuse attackers' observation. However, we have validated experimentally that relying on prefetching to only introduce noise is insufficient, as attackers can still reliably distinguish the victim's cache accesses. This paper proposes a novel prefetching-based scheme, called PCG. It combines adding victim-irrelevant cache occupancy changes and reducing victim-relevant cache occupancy changes to disrupt attackers by generating noisy and indistinguishable cache access patterns. Additionally, PCG can either work independently or seamlessly be integrated with most of the commonly used prefetchers. We have implemented and evaluated PCG in both gem5 and the open-source RISC-V core BOOMv3. The evaluation results show the PCG's robust security superior to the existing solutions, while without resulting in significant performance degradation. According to the evaluation based on the SPEC CPU 2017 benchmark suite, PCG even shows an average performance improvement of about 1.64%. Moreover, it incurs only 1.26% overhead on hardware resource consumption.</description>

Abstract: Malware attacks have become significantly more frequent and sophisticated in recent years. Therefore, malware detection and classification are critical components of information security. Due to the large amount of malware samples available, it is essential to categorize malware samples according to their malicious characteristics. Clustering algorithms are thus becoming more widely used in computer security to analyze the behavior of malware variants and discover new malware families. Online clustering algorithms help us to understand malware behavior and produce a quicker response to new threats. This paper introduces a novel machine learning-based model for the online clustering of malicious samples into malware families. Streaming data is divided according to the clustering decision rule into samples from known and new emerging malware families. The streaming data is classified using the weighted k-nearest neighbor classifier into known families, and the online k-means algorithm clusters the remaining streaming data and achieves a purity of clusters from 90.20% for four clusters to 93.34% for ten clusters. This work is based on static analysis of portable executable files for the Windows operating system. Experimental results indicate that the proposed online clustering model can create high-purity clusters corresponding to malware families. This allows malware analysts to receive similar malware samples, speeding up their analysis.</description>

      <title>DarkFed: A Data-Free Backdoor Attack in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been demonstrated to be susceptible to backdoor attacks. However, existing academic studies on FL backdoor attacks rely on a high proportion of real clients with main task-related data, which is impractical. In the context of real-world industrial scenarios, even the simplest defense suffices to defend against the state-of-the-art attack, 3DFed. A practical FL backdoor attack remains in a nascent stage of development.
  To bridge this gap, we present DarkFed. Initially, we emulate a series of fake clients, thereby achieving the attacker proportion typical of academic research scenarios. Given that these emulated fake clients lack genuine training data, we further propose a data-free approach to backdoor FL. Specifically, we delve into the feasibility of injecting a backdoor using a shadow dataset. Our exploration reveals that impressive attack performance can be achieved, even when there is a substantial gap between the shadow dataset and the main task dataset. This holds true even when employing synthetic data devoid of any semantic information as the shadow dataset. Subsequently, we strategically construct a series of covert backdoor updates in an optimized manner, mimicking the properties of benign updates, to evade detection by defenses. A substantial body of empirical evidence validates the tangible effectiveness of DarkFed.</description>

      <title>SEvenLLM: Benchmarking, Eliciting, and Enhancing Abilities of Large Language Models in Cyber Threat Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the increasing complexity and frequency of cybersecurity incidents emphasized by the recent cybersecurity threat reports with over 10 billion instances, cyber threat intelligence (CTI) plays a critical role in the modern cybersecurity landscape by offering the insights required to understand and combat the constantly evolving nature of cyber threats. Inspired by the powerful capability of large language models (LLMs) in handling complex tasks, in this paper, we introduce a framework to benchmark, elicit, and improve cybersecurity incident analysis and response abilities in LLMs for Security Events (SEvenLLM). Specifically, we create a high-quality bilingual instruction corpus by crawling cybersecurity raw text from cybersecurity websites to overcome the lack of effective data for information extraction. Then, we design a pipeline to auto-select tasks from the tasks pool and convert the raw text into supervised corpora comprised of question and response. The instruction dataset SEvenLLM-Instruct is used to train cybersecurity LLMs with the multi-task learning objective (27 well-designed tasks) for augmenting the analysis of cybersecurity events. Extensive experiments in our curated benchmark (SEvenLLM-bench) demonstrate that SEvenLLM performs more sophisticated threat analysis and fortifies defenses against the evolving landscape of cyber threats.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Datasets for Program Similarity Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Program similarity has become an increasingly popular area of research with various security applications such as plagiarism detection, author identification, and malware analysis. However, program similarity research faces a few unique dataset quality problems in evaluating the effectiveness of novel approaches. First, few high-quality datasets for binary program similarity exist and are widely used in this domain. Second, there are potentially many different, disparate definitions of what makes one program similar to another and in many cases there is often a large semantic gap between the labels provided by a dataset and any useful notion of behavioral or semantic similarity. In this paper, we present HELIX - a framework for generating large, synthetic program similarity datasets. We also introduce Blind HELIX, a tool built on top of HELIX for extracting HELIX components from library code automatically using program slicing. We evaluate HELIX and Blind HELIX by comparing the performance of program similarity tools on a HELIX dataset to a hand-crafted dataset built from multiple, disparate notions of program similarity. Using Blind HELIX, we show that HELIX can generate realistic and useful datasets of virtually infinite size for program similarity research with ground truth labels that embody practical notions of program similarity. Finally, we discuss the results and reason about relative tool ranking.</description>

      <title>UnsafeBench: Benchmarking Image Safety Classifiers on Real-World and AI-Generated Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image safety classifiers play an important role in identifying and mitigating the spread of unsafe images online (e.g., images including violence, hateful rhetoric, etc.). At the same time, with the advent of text-to-image models and increasing concerns about the safety of AI models, developers are increasingly relying on image safety classifiers to safeguard their models. Yet, the performance of current image safety classifiers remains unknown for real-world and AI-generated images. To bridge this research gap, in this work, we propose UnsafeBench, a benchmarking framework that evaluates the effectiveness and robustness of image safety classifiers. First, we curate a large dataset of 10K real-world and AI-generated images that are annotated as safe or unsafe based on a set of 11 unsafe categories of images (sexual, violent, hateful, etc.). Then, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of five popular image safety classifiers, as well as three classifiers that are powered by general-purpose visual language models. Our assessment indicates that existing image safety classifiers are not comprehensive and effective enough in mitigating the multifaceted problem of unsafe images. Also, we find that classifiers trained only on real-world images tend to have degraded performance when applied to AI-generated images. Motivated by these findings, we design and implement a comprehensive image moderation tool called PerspectiveVision, which effectively identifies 11 categories of real-world and AI-generated unsafe images. The best PerspectiveVision model achieves an overall F1-Score of 0.810 on six evaluation datasets, which is comparable with closed-source and expensive state-of-the-art models like GPT-4V. UnsafeBench and PerspectiveVision can aid the research community in better understanding the landscape of image safety classification in the era of generative AI.</description>

      <title>QBER: Quantifying Cyber Risks for Strategic Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying cyber risks is essential for organizations to grasp their vulnerability to threats and make informed decisions. However, current approaches still need to work on blending economic viewpoints to provide insightful analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce QBER approach to offer decision-makers measurable risk metrics. The QBER evaluates losses from cyberattacks, performs detailed risk analyses based on existing cybersecurity measures, and provides thorough cost assessments. Our contributions involve outlining cyberattack probabilities and risks, identifying Technical, Economic, and Legal (TEL) impacts, creating a model to gauge impacts, suggesting risk mitigation strategies, and examining trends and challenges in implementing widespread Cyber Risk Quantification (CRQ). The QBER approach serves as a guided approach for organizations to assess risks and strategically invest in cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>A Formal Model of Security Controls' Capabilities and Its Applications to Policy Refinement and Incident Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enforcing security requirements in networked information systems relies on security controls to mitigate the risks from increasingly dangerous threats. Configuring security controls is challenging; even nowadays, administrators must perform it without adequate tool support. Hence, this process is plagued by errors that translate to insecure postures, security incidents, and a lack of promptness in answering threats. This paper presents the Security Capability Model (SCM), a formal model that abstracts the features that security controls offer for enforcing security policies, which includes an Information Model that depicts the basic concepts related to rules (i.e., conditions, actions, events) and policies (i.e., conditions' evaluation, resolution strategies, default actions), and a Data Model that covers the capabilities needed to describe different types of filtering and channel protection controls. Following state-of-the-art design patterns, the model allows for generating abstract versions of the security controls' languages and a model-driven approach for translating abstract policies into device-specific configuration settings. By validating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, we show that SCM enables the automation of different and complex security tasks, i.e., accurate and granular security control comparison, policy refinement, and incident response. Lastly, we present opportunities for extensions and integration with other frameworks and models.</description>

      <title>Detecting Android Malware: From Neural Embeddings to Hands-On Validation with BERTroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As cyber threats and malware attacks increasingly alarm both individuals and businesses, the urgency for proactive malware countermeasures intensifies. This has driven a rising interest in automated machine learning solutions. Transformers, a cutting-edge category of attention-based deep learning methods, have demonstrated remarkable success. In this paper, we present BERTroid, an innovative malware detection model built on the BERT architecture. Overall, BERTroid emerged as a promising solution for combating Android malware. Its ability to outperform state-of-the-art solutions demonstrates its potential as a proactive defense mechanism against malicious software attacks. Additionally, we evaluate BERTroid on multiple datasets to assess its performance across diverse scenarios. In the dynamic landscape of cybersecurity, our approach has demonstrated promising resilience against the rapid evolution of malware on Android systems. While the machine learning model captures broad patterns, we emphasize the role of manual validation for deeper comprehension and insight into these behaviors. This human intervention is critical for discerning intricate and context-specific behaviors, thereby validating and reinforcing the model's findings.</description>

      <title>LaserEscape: Detecting and Mitigating Optical Probing Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The security of integrated circuits (ICs) can be broken by sophisticated physical attacks relying on failure analysis methods. Optical probing is one of the most prominent examples of such attacks, which can be accomplished in a matter of days, even with limited knowledge of the IC under attack. Unfortunately, few countermeasures are proposed in the literature, and none has been fabricated and tested in practice. These countermeasures usually require changing the standard cell libraries and, thus, are incompatible with digital and programmable platforms, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In this work, we shift our attention from preventing the attack to detecting and responding to it. We introduce LaserEscape, the first fully digital and FPGA-compatible countermeasure to detect and mitigate optical probing attacks. LaserEscape incorporates digital delay-based sensors to reliably detect the physical alteration on the fabric caused by laser beam irradiations in real time. Furthermore, as a response to the attack, LaserEscape deploys real-time hiding approaches using randomized hardware reconfigurability. It realizes 1) moving target defense (MTD) to physically move the sensitive circuity under attack out of the probing field of focus to protect secret keys and 2) polymorphism to logically obfuscate the functionality of the targeted circuit to counter function extraction and reverse engineering attempts. We demonstrate the effectiveness and resiliency of our approach by performing optical probing attacks on protected and unprotected designs on a 28-nm FPGA. Our results show that optical probing attacks can be reliably detected and mitigated without interrupting the chip's operation.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning Privacy: Attacks, Defenses, Applications, and Policy Landscape - A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has shown incredible potential across a vast array of tasks and accompanying this growth has been an insatiable appetite for data. However, a large amount of data needed for enabling deep learning is stored on personal devices and recent concerns on privacy have further highlighted challenges for accessing such data. As a result, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an important privacy-preserving technology enabling collaborative training of machine learning models without the need to send the raw, potentially sensitive, data to a central server. However, the fundamental premise that sending model updates to a server is privacy-preserving only holds if the updates cannot be "reverse engineered" to infer information about the private training data. It has been shown under a wide variety of settings that this premise for privacy does {\em not} hold.
  In this survey paper, we provide a comprehensive literature review of the different privacy attacks and defense methods in FL. We identify the current limitations of these attacks and highlight the settings in which FL client privacy can be broken. We dissect some of the successful industry applications of FL and draw lessons for future successful adoption. We survey the emerging landscape of privacy regulation for FL. We conclude with future directions for taking FL toward the cherished goal of generating accurate models while preserving the privacy of the data from its participants.</description>

      <title>When LLMs Meet Cybersecurity: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues across various fields, including cybersecurity, which faces an ever-evolving threat landscape and need for innovative technologies. Despite initial explorations into the application of LLMs in cybersecurity, there is a lack of a comprehensive overview of this research area. This paper bridge this gap by providing a systematic literature review, encompassing an analysis of over 180 works, spanning across 25 LLMs and more than 10 downstream scenarios. Our comprehensive overview addresses three critical research questions: the construction of cybersecurity-oriented LLMs, LLMs' applications in various cybersecurity tasks, and the existing challenges and further research in this area. This study aims to shed light on the extensive potential of LLMs in enhancing cybersecurity practices, and serve as a valuable resource for applying LLMs in this doamin. We also maintain and regularly updated list of practical guides on LLMs for cybersecurity at https://github.com/tmylla/Awesome-LLM4Cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Deeply Detect Complex Malicious Queries? A Framework for Jailbreaking via Obfuscating Intent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To demonstrate and address the underlying maliciousness, we propose a theoretical hypothesis and analytical approach, and introduce a new black-box jailbreak attack methodology named IntentObfuscator, exploiting this identified flaw by obfuscating the true intentions behind user prompts.This approach compels LLMs to inadvertently generate restricted content, bypassing their built-in content security measures. We detail two implementations under this framework: "Obscure Intention" and "Create Ambiguity", which manipulate query complexity and ambiguity to evade malicious intent detection effectively. We empirically validate the effectiveness of the IntentObfuscator method across several models, including ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Qwen and Baichuan, achieving an average jailbreak success rate of 69.21\%. Notably, our tests on ChatGPT-3.5, which claims 100 million weekly active users, achieved a remarkable success rate of 83.65\%. We also extend our validation to diverse types of sensitive content like graphic violence, racism, sexism, political sensitivity, cybersecurity threats, and criminal skills, further proving the substantial impact of our findings on enhancing 'Red Team' strategies against LLM content security frameworks.</description>

      <title>Cutting through buggy adversarial example defenses: fixing 1 line of code breaks Sabre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sabre is a defense to adversarial examples that was accepted at IEEE S&amp;P 2024. We first reveal significant flaws in the evaluation that point to clear signs of gradient masking. We then show the cause of this gradient masking: a bug in the original evaluation code. By fixing a single line of code in the original repository, we reduce Sabre's robust accuracy to 0%. In response to this, the authors modify the defense and introduce a new defense component not described in the original paper. But this fix contains a second bug; modifying one more line of code reduces robust accuracy to below baseline levels.</description>

      <title>Delphi: Efficient Asynchronous Approximate Agreement for Distributed Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agreement protocols are crucial in various emerging applications, spanning from distributed (blockchains) oracles to fault-tolerant cyber-physical systems. In scenarios where sensor/oracle nodes measure a common source, maintaining output within the convex range of correct inputs, known as convex validity, is imperative. Present asynchronous convex agreement protocols employ either randomization, incurring substantial computation overhead, or approximate agreement techniques, leading to high $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(n^3)$ communication for an $n$-node system.
  This paper introduces Delphi, a deterministic protocol with $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(n^2)$ communication and minimal computation overhead. Delphi assumes that honest inputs are bounded, except with negligible probability, and integrates agreement primitives from literature with a novel weighted averaging technique. Experimental results highlight Delphi's superior performance, showcasing a significantly lower latency compared to state-of-the-art protocols. Specifically, for an $n=160$-node system, Delphi achieves an 8x and 3x improvement in latency within CPS and AWS environments, respectively.</description>

      <title>SSI4IoT: Unlocking the Potential of IoT Tailored Self-Sovereign Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) techniques, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), move control of digital identity from conventional identity providers to individuals and lay down the foundation for people, organizations, and things establishing rich digital relationship. The existing applications of SSI mainly focus on creating person-to-person and person-to-service relationships, whereas person-to-device and device-to-device interactions have been largely overlooked. In this paper, we close this gap by identifying a number of key challenges of applying SSI to the Internet of Things (IoT) and providing a comprehensive taxonomy and usage of VCs in the IoT context with respect to their validity period, trust and interoperability level, and scope of usage. The life-cycle management of VCs as well as various optimization techniques for realizing SSI in IoT environments are also addressed in great detail. This work is a noteworthy step towards massive adoption of SSI for securing existing and future IoT applications in practice.</description>

      <title>RICE: Breaking Through the Training Bottlenecks of Reinforcement Learning with Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is playing an increasingly important role in real-world applications. However, obtaining an optimally performing DRL agent for complex tasks, especially with sparse rewards, remains a significant challenge. The training of a DRL agent can be often trapped in a bottleneck without further progress. In this paper, we propose RICE, an innovative refining scheme for reinforcement learning that incorporates explanation methods to break through the training bottlenecks. The high-level idea of RICE is to construct a new initial state distribution that combines both the default initial states and critical states identified through explanation methods, thereby encouraging the agent to explore from the mixed initial states. Through careful design, we can theoretically guarantee that our refining scheme has a tighter sub-optimality bound. We evaluate RICE in various popular RL environments and real-world applications. The results demonstrate that RICE significantly outperforms existing refining schemes in enhancing agent performance.</description>

      <title>Impact of EIP-4844 on Ethereum: Consensus Security, Ethereum Usage, Rollup Transaction Dynamics, and Blob Gas Fee Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On March 13, 2024, Ethereum implemented EIP-4844, designed to enhance its role as a data availability layer. While this upgrade reduces data posting costs for rollups, it also raises concerns about its impact on the consensus layer due to increased propagation sizes. Moreover, the broader effects on the overall Ethereum ecosystem remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis of the impact of EIP-4844 on consensus security, Ethereum usage, rollup transaction dynamics, and the blob gas fee mechanism. We explore changes in synchronization times, provide quantitative assessments of rollup and user behaviors, and deepen the understanding of the blob gas fee mechanism, highlighting both enhancements and areas of concern post-upgrade.</description>

      <title>Provably Unlearnable Examples</title>

Abstract: The exploitation of publicly accessible data has led to escalating concerns regarding data privacy and intellectual property (IP) breaches in the age of artificial intelligence. As a strategy to safeguard both data privacy and IP-related domain knowledge, efforts have been undertaken to render shared data unlearnable for unauthorized models in the wild. Existing methods apply empirically optimized perturbations to the data in the hope of disrupting the correlation between the inputs and the corresponding labels such that the data samples are converted into Unlearnable Examples (UEs). Nevertheless, the absence of mechanisms that can verify how robust the UEs are against unknown unauthorized models and train-time techniques engenders several problems. First, the empirically optimized perturbations may suffer from the problem of cross-model generalization, which echoes the fact that the unauthorized models are usually unknown to the defender. Second, UEs can be mitigated by train-time techniques such as data augmentation and adversarial training. Furthermore, we find that a simple recovery attack can restore the clean-task performance of the classifiers trained on UEs by slightly perturbing the learned weights. To mitigate the aforementioned problems, in this paper, we propose a mechanism for certifying the so-called $(q, \eta)$-Learnability of an unlearnable dataset via parametric smoothing. A lower certified $(q, \eta)$-Learnability indicates a more robust protection over the dataset. Finally, we try to 1) improve the tightness of certified $(q, \eta)$-Learnability and 2) design Provably Unlearnable Examples (PUEs) which have reduced $(q, \eta)$-Learnability. According to experimental results, PUEs demonstrate both decreased certified $(q, \eta)$-Learnability and enhanced empirical robustness compared to existing UEs.</description>

      <title>A Group Key Establishment Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.15037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group authentication is a method of confirmation that a set of users belong to a group and of distributing a common key among them. Unlike the standard authentication schemes where one central authority authenticates users one by one, group authentication can handle the authentication process at once for all members of the group. The recently presented group authentication algorithms mainly exploit Lagrange's polynomial interpolation along with elliptic curve groups over finite fields. As a fresh approach, this work suggests use of linear spaces for group authentication and key establishment for a group of any size. The approach with linear spaces introduces a reduced computation and communication load to establish a common shared key among the group members. The advantages of using vector spaces make the proposed method applicable to energy and resource constrained devices. In addition to providing lightweight authentication and key agreement, this proposal allows any user in a group to make a non-member to be a member, which is expected to be useful for autonomous systems in the future. The scheme is designed in a way that the sponsors of such members can easily be recognized by anyone in the group. Unlike the other group authentication schemes based on Lagrange's polynomial interpolation, the proposed scheme doesn't provide a tool for adversaries to compromise the whole group secrets by using only a few members' shares as well as it allows to recognize a non-member easily, which prevents service interruption attacks.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Learning for Cyberattack Detection in Blockchain Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11076v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article aims to study intrusion attacks and then develop a novel cyberattack detection framework to detect cyberattacks at the network layer (e.g., Brute Password and Flooding of Transactions) of blockchain networks. Specifically, we first design and implement a blockchain network in our laboratory. This blockchain network will serve two purposes, i.e., to generate the real traffic data (including both normal data and attack data) for our learning models and to implement real-time experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed intrusion detection framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset that is synthesized in a laboratory for cyberattacks in a blockchain network. We then propose a novel collaborative learning model that allows efficient deployment in the blockchain network to detect attacks. The main idea of the proposed learning model is to enable blockchain nodes to actively collect data, learn the knowledge from data using the Deep Belief Network, and then share the knowledge learned from its data with other blockchain nodes in the network. In this way, we can not only leverage the knowledge from all the nodes in the network but also do not need to gather all raw data for training at a centralized node like conventional centralized learning solutions. Such a framework can also avoid the risk of exposing local data's privacy as well as excessive network overhead/congestion. Both intensive simulations and real-time experiments clearly show that our proposed intrusion detection framework can achieve an accuracy of up to 98.6% in detecting attacks.</description>

      <title>Light Clients for Lazy Blockchains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.15968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lazy blockchains decouple consensus from transaction verification and execution to increase throughput. Although they can contain invalid transactions (e.g., double spends) as a result, these can easily be filtered out by full nodes that check if there have been previous conflicting transactions. However, creating light (SPV) clients that do not see the whole transaction history becomes a challenge: A record of a transaction on the chain does not necessarily entail transaction confirmation. In this paper, we devise a protocol that enables the creation of efficient light clients for lazy blockchains. The number of interaction rounds and the communication complexity of our protocol are logarithmic in the blockchain execution time. Our construction is based on a bisection game that traverses the Merkle tree containing the ledger of all - valid or invalid - transactions. We prove that our proof system is succinct, complete and sound, and empirically demonstrate the feasibility of our scheme.</description>

      <title>Poisoning Web-Scale Training Datasets is Practical</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning models are often trained on distributed, web-scale datasets crawled from the internet. In this paper, we introduce two new dataset poisoning attacks that intentionally introduce malicious examples to a model's performance. Our attacks are immediately practical and could, today, poison 10 popular datasets. Our first attack, split-view poisoning, exploits the mutable nature of internet content to ensure a dataset annotator's initial view of the dataset differs from the view downloaded by subsequent clients. By exploiting specific invalid trust assumptions, we show how we could have poisoned 0.01% of the LAION-400M or COYO-700M datasets for just $60 USD. Our second attack, frontrunning poisoning, targets web-scale datasets that periodically snapshot crowd-sourced content -- such as Wikipedia -- where an attacker only needs a time-limited window to inject malicious examples. In light of both attacks, we notify the maintainers of each affected dataset and recommended several low-overhead defenses.</description>

      <title>Resource-aware Cyber Deception for Microservice-based Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03151v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyber deception can be a valuable addition to traditional cyber defense mechanisms, especially for modern cloud-native environments with a fading security perimeter. However, pre-built decoys used in classical computer networks are not effective in detecting and mitigating malicious actors due to their inability to blend with the variety of applications in such environments. On the other hand, decoys cloning the deployed microservices of an application can offer a high-fidelity deception mechanism to intercept ongoing attacks within production environments. However, to fully benefit from this approach, it is essential to use a limited amount of decoy resources and devise a suitable cloning strategy to minimize the impact on legitimate services performance. Following this observation, we formulate a non-linear integer optimization problem that maximizes the number of attack paths intercepted by the allocated decoys within a fixed resource budget. Attack paths represent the attacker's movements within the infrastructure as a sequence of violated microservices. We also design a heuristic decoy placement algorithm to approximate the optimal solution and overcome the computational complexity of the proposed formulation. We evaluate the performance of the optimal and heuristic solutions against other schemes that use local vulnerability metrics to select which microservices to clone as decoys. Our results show that the proposed allocation strategy achieves a higher number of intercepted attack paths compared to these schemes while requiring approximately the same number of decoys.</description>

Abstract: Reverse engineering (RE) of finite state machines (FSMs) is a serious threat when protecting designs against RE attacks. While most recent protection techniques rely on the security of a secret key, this work presents a new approach: hardware FSM honeypots. These honeypots lead the RE tools to a wrong but, for the tools, very attractive FSM, while making the original FSM less attractive. The results show that state-of-the-art RE methods favor the highly attractive honeypot as FSM candidate or do no longer detect the correct, original FSM.</description>

      <title>Vector Commitments with Efficient Updates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04085v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic vector commitments that enable local updates of opening proofs have applications ranging from verifiable databases with membership changes to stateless clients on blockchains. In these applications, each user maintains a relevant subset of the committed messages and the corresponding opening proofs with the goal of ensuring a succinct global state. When the messages are updated, users are given some global update information and update their opening proofs to match the new vector commitment. We investigate the relation between the size of the update information and the runtime complexity needed to update an individual opening proof. Existing vector commitment schemes require that either the information size or the runtime scale linearly in the number $k$ of updated state elements. We construct a vector commitment scheme that asymptotically achieves both length and runtime that is sublinear in $k$, namely $k^\nu$ and $k^{1-\nu}$ for any $\nu \in (0,1)$. We prove an information-theoretic lower bound on the relation between the update information size and runtime complexity that shows the asymptotic optimality of our scheme. For $\nu = 1/2$, our constructions outperform Verkle commitments by about a factor of $2$ in terms of both the update information size and runtime, but makes use of larger public parameters.</description>

      <title>GPTScan: Detecting Logic Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts by Combining GPT with Program Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smart contracts are prone to various vulnerabilities, leading to substantial financial losses over time. Current analysis tools mainly target vulnerabilities with fixed control or data-flow patterns, such as re-entrancy and integer overflow. However, a recent study on Web3 security bugs revealed that about 80% of these bugs cannot be audited by existing tools due to the lack of domain-specific property description and checking. Given recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), it is worth exploring how Generative Pre-training Transformer (GPT) could aid in detecting logicc vulnerabilities.
  In this paper, we propose GPTScan, the first tool combining GPT with static analysis for smart contract logic vulnerability detection. Instead of relying solely on GPT to identify vulnerabilities, which can lead to high false positives and is limited by GPT's pre-trained knowledge, we utilize GPT as a versatile code understanding tool. By breaking down each logic vulnerability type into scenarios and properties, GPTScan matches candidate vulnerabilities with GPT. To enhance accuracy, GPTScan further instructs GPT to intelligently recognize key variables and statements, which are then validated by static confirmation. Evaluation on diverse datasets with around 400 contract projects and 3K Solidity files shows that GPTScan achieves high precision (over 90%) for token contracts and acceptable precision (57.14%) for large projects like Web3Bugs. It effectively detects ground-truth logic vulnerabilities with a recall of over 70%, including 9 new vulnerabilities missed by human auditors. GPTScan is fast and cost-effective, taking an average of 14.39 seconds and 0.01 USD to scan per thousand lines of Solidity code. Moreover, static confirmation helps GPTScan reduce two-thirds of false positives.</description>

      <title>Robustness Over Time: Understanding Adversarial Examples' Effectiveness on Longitudinal Versions of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) undergo continuous updates to improve user experience. However, prior research on the security and safety implications of LLMs has primarily focused on their specific versions, overlooking the impact of successive LLM updates. This prompts the need for a holistic understanding of the risks in these different versions of LLMs. To fill this gap, in this paper, we conduct a longitudinal study to examine the adversarial robustness -- specifically misclassification, jailbreak, and hallucination -- of three prominent LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA. Our study reveals that LLM updates do not consistently improve adversarial robustness as expected. For instance, a later version of GPT-3.5 degrades regarding misclassification and hallucination despite its improved resilience against jailbreaks, and GPT-4 demonstrates (incrementally) higher robustness overall. Moreover, larger model sizes do not necessarily yield improved robustness. Specifically, larger LLaMA models do not uniformly exhibit improved robustness across all three aspects studied. Importantly, minor updates lacking substantial robustness improvements can exacerbate existing issues rather than resolve them. By providing a more nuanced understanding of LLM robustness over time, we hope our study can offer valuable insights for developers and users navigating model updates and informed decisions in model development and usage for LLM vendors.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents secure mempool designs under asymmetric DoS attacks. We formulate safety definitions under two abstract DoSes, namely eviction- and locking-based attacks.
  We propose a safe transaction admission framework for securing mempools, named saferAd, that achieves both eviction- and locking-safety. The proven security stems from an upper bound of the attack damage under locking DoSes and a lower bound of the attack cost under eviction DoSes. The evaluation by replaying real transaction traces shows saferAd incurs negligible latency or insignificant change of validator revenue.</description>

Abstract: The classical distributed key generation protocols (DKG) are resurging due to their widespread applications in blockchain. While efforts have been made to improve DKG communication, practical large-scale deployments are still yet to come due to various challenges, including the heavy computation and communication (particularly broadcast) overhead in their adversarial cases. In this paper, we propose a practical DKG for DLog-based cryptosystems, which achieves (quasi-)linear computation and communication per-node cost with the help of a common coin, even in the face of the maximal amount of Byzantine nodes. Moreover, our protocol is secure against adaptive adversaries, which can corrupt less than half of all nodes. The key to our improvements lies in delegating the most costly operations to an Any-Trust group together with a set of techniques for adaptive security. This group is randomly sampled and consists of a small number of individuals. The population only trusts that at least one member in the group is honest, without knowing which one. Moreover, we present a generic transformer that enables us to efficiently deploy a conventional distributed protocol like our DKG, even when the participants have different weights. Additionally, we introduce an extended broadcast channel based on a blockchain and data dispersal network (such as IPFS), enabling reliable broadcasting of arbitrary-size messages at the cost of constant-size blockchain storage.</description>

Abstract: Forensic toolmark analysis traditionally relies on subjective human judgment, leading to inconsistencies and inaccuracies. The multitude of variables, including angles and directions of mark generation, further complicates comparisons. To address this, we introduce a novel approach leveraging 3D data capturing toolmarks from various angles and directions. Through algorithmic training, we objectively compare toolmark signals, revealing clustering by tool rather than angle or direction. Our method utilizes similarity matrices and density plots to establish thresholds for classification, enabling the derivation of likelihood ratios for new mark pairs. With a cross-validated sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 96%, our approach enhances the reliability of toolmark analysis. While its applicability to diverse tools and factors warrants further exploration, this empirically trained, open-source solution offers forensic examiners a standardized means to objectively compare toolmarks, potentially curbing miscarriages of justice in the legal system.</description>

      <title>RandOhm: Mitigating Impedance Side-channel Attacks using Randomized Circuit Configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical side-channel attacks can compromise the security of integrated circuits. Most physical side-channel attacks (e.g., power or electromagnetic) exploit the dynamic behavior of a chip, typically manifesting as changes in current consumption or voltage fluctuations where algorithmic countermeasures, such as masking, can effectively mitigate them. However, as demonstrated recently, these mitigation techniques are not entirely effective against backscattered side-channel attacks such as impedance analysis. In the case of an impedance attack, an adversary exploits the data-dependent impedance variations of the chip power delivery network (PDN) to extract secret information. In this work, we introduce RandOhm, which exploits a moving target defense (MTD) strategy based on the partial reconfiguration (PR) feature of mainstream FPGAs and programmable SoCs to defend against impedance side-channel attacks. We demonstrate that the information leakage through the PDN impedance could be significantly reduced via runtime reconfiguration of the secret-sensitive parts of the circuitry. Hence, by constantly randomizing the placement and routing of the circuit, one can decorrelate the data-dependent computation from the impedance value. Moreover, in contrast to existing PR-based countermeasures, RandOhm deploys open-source bitstream manipulation tools on programmable SoCs to speed up the randomization and provide real-time protection. To validate our claims, we apply RandOhm to AES ciphers realized on 28-nm FPGAs. We analyze the resiliency of our approach by performing non-profiled and profiled impedance analysis attacks and investigate the overhead of our mitigation in terms of delay and performance.</description>

      <title>The SkipSponge Attack: Sponge Weight Poisoning of Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sponge attacks aim to increase the energy consumption and computation time of neural networks deployed on hardware accelerators. Existing sponge attacks can be performed during inference via sponge examples or during training via Sponge Poisoning. Sponge examples leverage perturbations added to the model's input to increase energy and latency, while Sponge Poisoning alters the objective function of a model to induce inference-time energy effects. In this work, we propose a novel sponge attack called SkipSponge. SkipSponge is the first sponge attack that is performed directly on the parameters of a pre-trained model using only a few data samples. Our experiments show that SkipSponge can successfully increase the energy consumption of image classification models with fewer samples required than Sponge Poisoning. We show that poisoning defenses are ineffective if not adjusted specifically for the defense against SkipSponge (i.e., they decrease target layer bias values). Our work shows that SkipSponge is more effective on the GANs and the autoencoders than the state-of-the-art. Additionally, SkipSponge is stealthier than the previous Sponge Poisoning attack as it does not require significant changes in the victim model's weights. Our experiments indicate that the SkipSponge attack can be performed even when an attacker has access to only 1% of the entire dataset and reaches up to 13% energy increase.</description>

      <title>Kronos: A Secure and Generic Sharding Blockchain Consensus with Optimized Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sharding enhances blockchain scalability by dividing the network into shards, each managing specific unspent transaction outputs or accounts. As an introduced new transaction type, cross-shard transactions pose a critical challenge to the security and efficiency of sharding blockchains. Currently, there is a lack of a generic sharding consensus pattern that achieves both security and low overhead. In this paper, we present Kronos, a secure sharding blockchain consensus achieving optimized overhead. In particular, we propose a new secure sharding consensus pattern, based on a buffer managed jointly by shard members. Valid transactions are transferred to the payee via the buffer, while invalid ones are rejected through happy or unhappy paths. Kronos is proved to achieve security with atomicity under malicious clients with optimal intra-shard overhead $kB$ ($k$ for involved shard number and $B$ for a Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) cost). Besides, we propose secure cross-shard certification methods based on batch certification and reliable cross-shard transfer. The former combines hybrid trees or vector commitments, while the latter integrates erasure coding. Handling $b$ transactions, Kronos is proved to achieve reliability with low cross-shard overhead $O(n b \lambda)$ ($n$ for shard size and $\lambda$ for the security parameter). Notably, Kronos imposes no restrictions on BFT and does not rely on time assumptions, offering optional constructions in various modules. We implement Kronos using two prominent BFT protocols: asynchronous Speeding Dumbo and partial synchronous Hotstuff. Extensive experiments demonstrate Kronos scales the consensus nodes to thousands, achieving a substantial throughput of 320 ktx/sec with 2.0 sec latency. Compared with the past solutions, Kronos outperforms, achieving up to a 12* improvement in throughput and a 50% reduction in latency.</description>

      <title>Zero-Knowledge Proof of Distinct Identity: a Standard-compatible Sybil-resistant Pseudonym Extension for C-ITS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pseudonyms are widely used in Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) to protect the location privacy of vehicles. However, the unlinkability nature of pseudonyms also enables Sybil attacks, where a malicious vehicle can pretend to be multiple vehicles at the same time. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol called zero-knowledge Proof of Distinct Identity (zk-PoDI,) which allows a vehicle to prove that it is not the owner of another pseudonym in the local area, without revealing its actual identity. Zk-PoDI is based on the Diophantine equation and zk-SNARK, and does not rely on any specific pseudonym design or infrastructure assistance. We show that zk-PoDI satisfies all the requirements for a practical Sybil-resistance pseudonym system, and it has low latency, adjustable difficulty, moderate computation overhead, and negligible communication cost. We also discuss the future work of implementing and evaluating zk-PoDI in a realistic city-scale simulation environment.</description>

      <title>Protected QR Code-based Anti-counterfeit System for Pharmaceutical Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pharmaceutical manufacturing faces critical challenges due to the global threat of counterfeit drugs. This paper proposes a new approach of protected QR codes to secure unique product information for safeguarding the pharmaceutical supply chain. The proposed solution integrates secure QR code generation and encrypted data transmission to establish a comprehensive anti-counterfeit ecosystem. The protected QR codes encapsulate product information that cannot be identified using traditional QR code scanners which protect the information against replication and tampering. The system is developed with scalability in mind, which can be easily implemented without introducing any additional modification in the traditional supply chain.</description>

Abstract: REST APIs have a pivotal role in accessing protected resources. Despite the availability of security testing tools, mass assignment vulnerabilities are common in REST APIs, leading to unauthorized manipulation of sensitive data. We propose a lightweight approach to mine the REST API specifications and identify operations and attributes that are prone to mass assignment. We conducted a preliminary study on 100 APIs and found 25 prone to this vulnerability. We confirmed nine real vulnerable operations in six APIs.</description>

      <title>Purify Unlearnable Examples via Rate-Constrained Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlearnable examples (UEs) seek to maximize testing error by making subtle modifications to training examples that are correctly labeled. Defenses against these poisoning attacks can be categorized based on whether specific interventions are adopted during training. The first approach is training-time defense, such as adversarial training, which can mitigate poisoning effects but is computationally intensive. The other approach is pre-training purification, e.g., image short squeezing, which consists of several simple compressions but often encounters challenges in dealing with various UEs. Our work provides a novel disentanglement mechanism to build an efficient pre-training purification method. Firstly, we uncover rate-constrained variational autoencoders (VAEs), demonstrating a clear tendency to suppress the perturbations in UEs. We subsequently conduct a theoretical analysis for this phenomenon. Building upon these insights, we introduce a disentangle variational autoencoder (D-VAE), capable of disentangling the perturbations with learnable class-wise embeddings. Based on this network, a two-stage purification approach is naturally developed. The first stage focuses on roughly eliminating perturbations, while the second stage produces refined, poison-free results, ensuring effectiveness and robustness across various scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable performance of our method across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and a 100-class ImageNet-subset. Code is available at https://github.com/yuyi-sd/D-VAE.</description>

Abstract: Linux systems are integral to the infrastructure of modern computing environments, necessitating robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access. Privilege escalation attacks represent a significant threat, typically allowing attackers to elevate their privileges from an initial low-privilege account to the all-powerful root account.
  A benchmark set of vulnerable systems is of high importance to evaluate the effectiveness of privilege-escalation techniques performed by both humans and automated tooling. Analyzing their behavior allows defenders to better fortify their entrusted Linux systems and thus protect their infrastructure from potentially devastating attacks.
  To address this gap, we developed a comprehensive benchmark for Linux privilege escalation. It provides a standardized platform to evaluate and compare the performance of human and synthetic actors, e.g., hacking scripts or automated tooling.</description>

      <title>A New Linear Scaling Rule for Private Adaptive Hyperparameter Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.04486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An open problem in differentially private deep learning is hyperparameter optimization (HPO). DP-SGD introduces new hyperparameters and complicates existing ones, forcing researchers to painstakingly tune hyperparameters with hundreds of trials, which in turn makes it impossible to account for the privacy cost of HPO without destroying the utility. We propose an adaptive HPO method that uses cheap trials (in terms of privacy cost and runtime) to estimate optimal hyperparameters and scales them up. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on 22 benchmark tasks, across computer vision and natural language processing, across pretraining and finetuning, across architectures and a wide range of $\varepsilon \in [0.01,8.0]$, all while accounting for the privacy cost of HPO.</description>

      <title>Data Depth and Core-based Trend Detection on Blockchain Transaction Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blockchains are significantly easing trade finance, with billions of dollars worth of assets being transacted daily. However, analyzing these networks remains challenging due to the sheer volume and complexity of the data. We introduce a method named InnerCore that detects market manipulators within blockchain-based networks and offers a sentiment indicator for these networks. This is achieved through data depth-based core decomposition and centered motif discovery, ensuring scalability. InnerCore is a computationally efficient, unsupervised approach suitable for analyzing large temporal graphs. We demonstrate its effectiveness by analyzing and detecting three recent real-world incidents from our datasets: the catastrophic collapse of LunaTerra, the Proof-of-Stake switch of Ethereum, and the temporary peg loss of USDC - while also verifying our results against external ground truth. Our experiments show that InnerCore can match the qualified analysis accurately without human involvement, automating blockchain analysis in a scalable manner, while being more effective and efficient than baselines and state-of-the-art attributed change detection approach in dynamic graphs.</description>

      <title>Are aligned neural networks adversarially aligned?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models are now tuned to align with the goals of their creators, namely to be "helpful and harmless." These models should respond helpfully to user questions, but refuse to answer requests that could cause harm. However, adversarial users can construct inputs which circumvent attempts at alignment. In this work, we study adversarial alignment, and ask to what extent these models remain aligned when interacting with an adversarial user who constructs worst-case inputs (adversarial examples). These inputs are designed to cause the model to emit harmful content that would otherwise be prohibited. We show that existing NLP-based optimization attacks are insufficiently powerful to reliably attack aligned text models: even when current NLP-based attacks fail, we can find adversarial inputs with brute force. As a result, the failure of current attacks should not be seen as proof that aligned text models remain aligned under adversarial inputs.
  However the recent trend in large-scale ML models is multimodal models that allow users to provide images that influence the text that is generated. We show these models can be easily attacked, i.e., induced to perform arbitrary un-aligned behavior through adversarial perturbation of the input image. We conjecture that improved NLP attacks may demonstrate this same level of adversarial control over text-only models.</description>

      <title>FT-Shield: A Watermark Against Unauthorized Fine-tuning in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image generative models, especially those based on latent diffusion models (LDMs), have demonstrated outstanding ability in generating high-quality and high-resolution images from textual prompts. With this advancement, various fine-tuning methods have been developed to personalize text-to-image models for specific applications such as artistic style adaptation and human face transfer. However, such advancements have raised copyright concerns, especially when the data are used for personalization without authorization. For example, a malicious user can employ fine-tuning techniques to replicate the style of an artist without consent. In light of this concern, we propose FT-Shield, a watermarking solution tailored for the fine-tuning of text-to-image diffusion models. FT-Shield addresses copyright protection challenges by designing new watermark generation and detection strategies. In particular, it introduces an innovative algorithm for watermark generation. It ensures the seamless transfer of watermarks from training images to generated outputs, facilitating the identification of copyrighted material use. To tackle the variability in fine-tuning methods and their impact on watermark detection, FT-Shield integrates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach for watermark detection. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed FT-Shield.</description>

      <title>Jailbreak and Guard Aligned Language Models with Only Few In-Context Demonstrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in various tasks, but concerns about their safety and the potential for generating harmful content have emerged. In this paper, we delve into the potential of In-Context Learning (ICL) to modulate the alignment of LLMs. Specifically, we propose the In-Context Attack (ICA), which employs strategically crafted harmful demonstrations to subvert LLMs, and the In-Context Defense (ICD), which bolsters model resilience through examples that demonstrate refusal to produce harmful responses. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of ICA and ICD in respectively elevating and mitigating the success rates of jailbreaking prompts. Moreover, we offer theoretical insights into the mechanism by which a limited set of in-context demonstrations can pivotally influence the safety alignment of LLMs. Our findings illuminate the profound influence of ICL on LLM behavior, opening new avenues for improving the safety and alignment of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Privacy Amplification for Matrix Mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Privacy amplification exploits randomness in data selection to provide tighter differential privacy (DP) guarantees. This analysis is key to DP-SGD's success in machine learning, but, is not readily applicable to the newer state-of-the-art algorithms. This is because these algorithms, known as DP-FTRL, use the matrix mechanism to add correlated noise instead of independent noise as in DP-SGD.
  In this paper, we propose "MMCC", the first algorithm to analyze privacy amplification via sampling for any generic matrix mechanism. MMCC is nearly tight in that it approaches a lower bound as $\epsilon\to0$. To analyze correlated outputs in MMCC, we prove that they can be analyzed as if they were independent, by conditioning them on prior outputs. Our "conditional composition theorem" has broad utility: we use it to show that the noise added to binary-tree-DP-FTRL can asymptotically match the noise added to DP-SGD with amplification. Our amplification algorithm also has practical empirical utility: we show it leads to significant improvement in the privacy-utility trade-offs for DP-FTRL algorithms on standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Sui Lutris: A Blockchain Combining Broadcast and Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sui Lutris is the first smart-contract platform to sustainably achieve sub-second finality. It achieves this significant decrease by employing consensusless agreement not only for simple payments but for a large variety of transactions. Unlike prior work, Sui Lutris neither compromises expressiveness nor throughput and can run perpetually without restarts. Sui Lutris achieves this by safely integrating consensuless agreement with a high-throughput consensus protocol that is invoked out of the critical finality path but ensures that when a transaction is at risk of inconsistent concurrent accesses, its settlement is delayed until the total ordering is resolved. Building such a hybrid architecture is especially delicate during reconfiguration events, where the system needs to preserve the safety of the consensusless path without compromising the long-term liveness of potentially misconfigured clients. We thus develop a novel reconfiguration protocol, the first to provably show the safe and efficient reconfiguration of a consensusless blockchain. Sui Lutris is currently running in production and underpins the Sui smart-contract platform. Combined with the use of Objects instead of accounts it enables the safe execution of smart contracts that expose objects as a first-class resource. In our experiments Sui Lutris achieves latency lower than 0.5 seconds for throughput up to 5,000 certificates per second (150k ops/s with transaction blocks), compared to the state-of-the-art real-world consensus latencies of 3 seconds. Furthermore, it gracefully handles validators crash-recovery and does not suffer visible performance degradation during reconfiguration.</description>

      <title>Delocate: Detection and Localization for Deepfake Videos with Randomly-Located Tampered Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13516v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deepfake videos are becoming increasingly realistic, showing few tampering traces on facial areasthat vary between frames. Consequently, existing Deepfake detection methods struggle to detect unknown domain Deepfake videos while accurately locating the tampered region. To address thislimitation, we propose Delocate, a novel Deepfake detection model that can both recognize andlocalize unknown domain Deepfake videos. Ourmethod consists of two stages named recoveringand localization. In the recovering stage, the modelrandomly masks regions of interest (ROIs) and reconstructs real faces without tampering traces, leading to a relatively good recovery effect for realfaces and a poor recovery effect for fake faces. Inthe localization stage, the output of the recoveryphase and the forgery ground truth mask serve assupervision to guide the forgery localization process. This process strategically emphasizes the recovery phase of fake faces with poor recovery, facilitating the localization of tampered regions. Ourextensive experiments on four widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that Delocate not onlyexcels in localizing tampered areas but also enhances cross-domain detection performance.</description>

      <title>Efficient Weighting Schemes for Auditing Instant-Runoff Voting Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various risk-limiting audit (RLA) methods have been developed for instant-runoff voting (IRV) elections. A recent method, AWAIRE, is the first efficient approach that can take advantage of but does not require cast vote records (CVRs). AWAIRE involves adaptively weighted averages of test statistics, essentially "learning" an effective set of hypotheses to test. However, the initial paper on AWAIRE only examined a few weighting schemes and parameter settings.
  We explore schemes and settings more extensively, to identify and recommend efficient choices for practice. We focus on the case where CVRs are not available, assessing performance using simulations based on real election data.
  The most effective schemes are often those that place most or all of the weight on the apparent "best" hypotheses based on already seen data. Conversely, the optimal tuning parameters tended to vary based on the election margin. Nonetheless, we quantify the performance trade-offs for different choices across varying election margins, aiding in selecting the most desirable trade-off if a default option is needed.
  A limitation of the current AWAIRE implementation is its restriction to a small number of candidates -- up to six in previous implementations. One path to a more computationally efficient implementation would be to use lazy evaluation and avoid considering all possible hypotheses. Our findings suggest that such an approach could be done without substantially compromising statistical performance.</description>

      <title>AC4: Algebraic Computation Checker for Circuit Constraints in ZKPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ZKP systems have surged attention and held a fundamental role in contemporary cryptography. Zk-SNARK protocols dominate the ZKP usage, often implemented through arithmetic circuit programming paradigm. However, underconstrained or overconstrained circuits may lead to bugs. Underconstrained circuits refer to circuits that lack the necessary constraints, resulting in unexpected solutions in the circuit and causing the verifier to accept a bogus witness. Overconstrained circuits refer to circuits that are constrained excessively, resulting in the circuit lacking necessary solutions and causing the verifier to accept no witness, rendering the circuit meaningless. This paper introduces a novel approach for pinpointing two distinct types of bugs in ZKP circuits. The method involves encoding the arithmetic circuit constraints to polynomial equation systems and solving polynomial equation systems over a finite field by algebraic computation. The classification of verification results is refined, greatly enhancing the expressive power of the system. We proposed a tool, AC4, to represent the implementation of this method. Experiments demonstrate that AC4 represents a substantial 29% increase in the checked ratio compared to prior work. Within a solvable range, the checking time of AC4 has also exhibited noticeable improvement, demonstrating a magnitude increase compared to previous efforts.</description>

      <title>The power of a single Haar random state: constructing and separating quantum pseudorandomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the following question: what are the cryptographic implications of having access to an oracle that provides a single Haar random quantum state? We show, perhaps surprisingly, that such an oracle is sufficient to construct quantum pseudorandomness.
  Pseudorandom states (PRS) are a family of states for which it is hard to distinguish between polynomially many copies of either a state sampled uniformly from the family or a Haar random state. A weaker notion, called single-copy pseudorandom states (1PRS), satisfies this property with respect to a single copy. Our main result is that 1PRS (as well as bit-commitments) exist relative to an oracle that provides a single Haar random state. We build on this result to show the existence of an oracle relative to which 1PRS exist, but PRS do not. This provides one of the first black-box separations between different forms of quantum pseudorandomness.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Shading: Provable Performance-Lossless Image Watermarking for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ethical concerns surrounding copyright protection and inappropriate content generation pose challenges for the practical implementation of diffusion models. One effective solution involves watermarking the generated images. However, existing methods often compromise the model performance or require additional training, which is undesirable for operators and users. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Shading, a diffusion model watermarking technique that is both performance-lossless and training-free, while serving the dual purpose of copyright protection and tracing of offending content. Our watermark embedding is free of model parameter modifications and thus is plug-and-play. We map the watermark to latent representations following a standard Gaussian distribution, which is indistinguishable from latent representations obtained from the non-watermarked diffusion model. Therefore we can achieve watermark embedding with lossless performance, for which we also provide theoretical proof. Furthermore, since the watermark is intricately linked with image semantics, it exhibits resilience to lossy processing and erasure attempts. The watermark can be extracted by Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion and inverse sampling. We evaluate Gaussian Shading on multiple versions of Stable Diffusion, and the results demonstrate that Gaussian Shading not only is performance-lossless but also outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness.</description>

      <title>mABC: multi-Agent Blockchain-Inspired Collaboration for root cause analysis in micro-services architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The escalating complexity of micro-services architecture in cloud-native technologies poses significant challenges for maintaining system stability and efficiency. To conduct root cause analysis (RCA) and resolution of alert events, we propose a pioneering framework, multi-Agent Blockchain-inspired Collaboration for root cause analysis in micro-services architecture (mABC), to revolutionize the AI for IT operations (AIOps) domain, where multiple agents based on the powerful large language models (LLMs) perform blockchain-inspired voting to reach a final agreement following a standardized process for processing tasks and queries provided by Agent Workflow. Specifically, seven specialized agents derived from Agent Workflow each provide valuable insights towards root cause analysis based on their expertise and the intrinsic software knowledge of LLMs collaborating within a decentralized chain. To avoid potential instability issues in LLMs and fully leverage the transparent and egalitarian advantages inherent in a decentralized structure, mABC adopts a decision-making process inspired by blockchain governance principles while considering the contribution index and expertise index of each agent. Experimental results on the public benchmark AIOps challenge dataset and our created train-ticket dataset demonstrate superior performance in accurately identifying root causes and formulating effective solutions, compared to previous strong baselines. The ablation study further highlights the significance of each component within mABC, with Agent Workflow, multi-agent, and blockchain-inspired voting being crucial for achieving optimal performance. mABC offers a comprehensive automated root cause analysis and resolution in micro-services architecture and achieves a significant improvement in the AIOps domain compared to existing baselines</description>

      <title>Efficient and Near-Optimal Noise Generation for Streaming Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the task of differentially private (DP) continual counting, we receive a stream of increments and our goal is to output an approximate running total of these increments, without revealing too much about any specific increment. Despite its simplicity, differentially private continual counting has attracted significant attention both in theory and in practice. Existing algorithms for differentially private continual counting are either inefficient in terms of their space usage or add an excessive amount of noise, inducing suboptimal utility.
  The most practical DP continual counting algorithms add carefully correlated Gaussian noise to the values. The task of choosing the covariance for this noise can be expressed in terms of factoring the lower-triangular matrix of ones (which computes prefix sums). We present two approaches from this class (for different parameter regimes) that achieve near-optimal utility for DP continual counting and only require logarithmic or polylogarithmic space (and time).
  Our first approach is based on a space-efficient streaming matrix multiplication algorithm for a class of Toeplitz matrices. We show that to instantiate this algorithm for DP continual counting, it is sufficient to find a low-degree rational function that approximates the square root on a circle in the complex plane. We then apply and extend tools from approximation theory to achieve this. We also derive efficient closed-forms for the objective function for arbitrarily many steps, and show direct numerical optimization yields a highly practical solution to the problem. Our second approach combines our first approach with a recursive construction similar to the binary tree mechanism.</description>

      <title>LLM Security Guard for Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many developers rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate software development. Nevertheless, these models have exhibited limited capabilities in the security domain. We introduce LLMSecGuard, a framework to offer enhanced code security through the synergy between static code analyzers and LLMs. LLMSecGuard is open source and aims to equip developers with code solutions that are more secure than the code initially generated by LLMs. This framework also has a benchmarking feature, aimed at providing insights into the evolving security attributes of these models.</description>
