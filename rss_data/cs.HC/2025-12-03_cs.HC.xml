      <title>Young children's anthropomorphism of an AI chatbot: Brain activation and the role of parent co-presence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02179v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots powered by a large language model (LLM) are entering young children's learning and play, yet little is known about how young children construe these agents or how such construals relate to engagement. We examined anthropomorphism of a social AI chatbot during collaborative storytelling and asked how children's attributions related to their behavior and prefrontal activation. Children at ages 5-6 (N = 23) completed three storytelling sessions: interacting with (1) an AI chatbot only, (2) a parent only, and (3) the AI and a parent together. After the sessions, children completed an interview assessing anthropomorphism toward both the AI chatbot and the parent. Behavioral engagement was indexed by the conversational turn count (CTC) ratio, and concurrent fNIRS measured oxygenated hemoglobin in bilateral vmPFC and dmPFC regions. Children reported higher anthropomorphism for parents than for the AI chatbot overall, although AI ratings were relatively high for perceptive abilities and epistemic states. Anthropomorphism was not associated with CTC. In the right dmPFC, higher perceptive scores were associated with greater activation during the AI-only condition and with lower activation during the AI+Parent condition. Exploratory analyses indicated that higher dmPFC activation during the AI-only condition correlated with higher end-of-session "scared" mood ratings. Findings suggest that stronger perceptive anthropomorphism can be associated with greater brain activation related to interpreting the AI's mental states, whereas parent co-presence may help some children interpret and regulate novel AI interactions. These results may have design implications for encouraging parent-AI co-use in early childhood.</description>

      <title>DepthScape: Authoring 2.5D Designs via Depth Estimation, Semantic Understanding, and Geometry Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2.5D effects, such as occlusion and perspective foreshortening, enhance visual dynamics and realism by incorporating 3D depth cues into 2D designs. However, creating such effects remains challenging and labor-intensive due to the complexity of depth perception. We introduce DepthScape, a human-AI collaborative system that facilitates 2.5D effect creation by directly placing design elements into 3D reconstructions. Using monocular depth reconstruction, DepthScape transforms images into 3D reconstructions where visual contents are placed to automatically achieve realistic occlusion and perspective foreshortening. To further simplify 3D placement through a 2D viewport, DepthScape uses a vision-language model to analyze source images and extract key visual components as content anchors for direct manipulation editing. We evaluate DepthScape with nine participants of varying design backgrounds, confirming the effectiveness of our creation pipeline. We also test on 100 professional stock images to assess robustness, and conduct an expert evaluation that confirms the quality of DepthScape's results.</description>

      <title>Understanding Down Syndrome Stereotypes in LLM-Based Personas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a case study of Persona-L, a system that leverages large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to model personas of people with Down syndrome. Existing approaches to persona creation can often lead to oversimplified or stereotypical profiles of people with Down Syndrome. To that end, we built stereotype detection capabilities into Persona-L. Through interviews with caregivers and healthcare professionals (N=10), we examine how Down Syndrome stereotypes could manifest in both, content and delivery of LLMs, and interface design. Our findings show the challenges in stereotypes definition, and reveal the potential stereotype emergence from the training data, interface design, and the tone of LLM output. This highlights the need for participatory methods that capture the heterogeneity of lived experiences of people with Down Syndrome.</description>

      <title>Artographer: a Curatorial Interface for Art Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relating a piece to previously established works is crucial in creating and engaging with art, but AI interfaces tend to obscure such relationships, rather than helping users explore them. Embedding models present new opportunities to support discovering and relating artwork through spatial interaction. We built Artographer, an art exploration system featuring a zoomable 2-D map, constructed from the similarity-clustered embeddings of 15,000+ historical artworks. Using Artographer as a probe to investigate spatial artwork exploration, we analyzed how 20 participants (including 9 art history scholars) traversed the map, during a goal-driven task and when freely exploring. We observe divergent and convergent exploration behaviors (Jumping, Wandering, Fixation, Revisiting) and identify values enacted by spatial art-finding (Visibility, Agency, Serendipity, Friction.) We situate spatial maps within a space of Curatorial Interfaces, systems that select and present artworks, and discuss centering pluralism and agency in the design of more responsible AI systems for art curation.</description>

      <title>A Visual Analytics System to Understand Behaviors of Multi Agents in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a branch of machine learning in which agents interact and learn optimal policies through trial and error, addressing complex scenarios where multiple agents interact and learn in the same environment at the same time. Analyzing and understanding these complex interactions is challenging, and existing analysis methods are limited in their ability to fully reflect and interpret this complexity. To address these challenges, we provide MARLViz, a visual analytics system for visualizing and analyzing the policies and interactions of agents in MARL environments. The system is designed to visually show the difference in behavior of agents under different environment settings and help users understand complex interaction patterns. In this study, we analyzed agents with similar behaviors and selected scenarios to understand the interactions of the agents, which made it easier to understand the strategies of agents in MARL.</description>

      <title>Reframing Human-Robot Interaction Through Extended Reality: Unlocking Safer, Smarter, and More Empathic Interactions with Virtual Robots and Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This perspective reframes human-robot interaction (HRI) through extended reality (XR), arguing that virtual robots powered by large foundation models (FMs) can serve as cognitively grounded, empathic agents. Unlike physical robots, XR-native agents are unbound by hardware constraints and can be instantiated, adapted, and scaled on demand, while still affording embodiment and co-presence. We synthesize work across XR, HRI, and cognitive AI to show how such agents can support safety-critical scenarios, socially and cognitively empathic interaction across domains, and outreaching physical capabilities with XR and AI integration. We then discuss how multimodal large FMs (e.g., large language model, large vision model, and vision-language model) enable context-aware reasoning, affect-sensitive situations, and long-term adaptation, positioning virtual robots as cognitive and empathic mediators rather than mere simulation assets. At the same time, we highlight challenges and potential risks, including overtrust, cultural and representational bias, privacy concerns around biometric sensing, and data governance and transparency. The paper concludes by outlining a research agenda for human-centered, ethically grounded XR agents - emphasizing multi-layered evaluation frameworks, multi-user ecosystems, mixed virtual-physical embodiment, and societal and ethical design practices to envision XR-based virtual agents powered by FMs as reshaping future HRI into a more efficient and adaptive paradigm.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Integrated Digital Interventions Delivered by a Therapeutic Companion Agent for Young Adults with Symptoms of Depression: A Proof-of-Concept Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Despite the clinical effectiveness of digital interventions for young adults with depression, low engagement and adherence remain persistent challenges. Building a strong digital therapeutic alliance has been proposed to address these barriers. This study highlights the need for a conversational therapeutic companion agent (TCA)-based intervention design. Objective: This study aimed to develop a Wizard-of-Oz TCA-centered prototype integrating social-support-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA), ecological momentary intervention (EMI), behavioral activation, and gamification. We evaluated the six-week proof-of-concept efficacy of this intervention among young adults with depressive symptoms. Methods: Korean young adults aged 20--39 years with mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) were recruited online. The intervention group ($n = 29$) received a six-week TCA-based digital intervention, while the control group ($n = 29$), recruited four weeks later, continued their usual routines. The TCA guided four daily behavioral-activation tasks, three mood assessments, meditation, daily summaries, and weekly mission feedback. Both groups were assessed at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, and 6 using the BDI-II, GAD-7, and Q-LES-Q-SF. Results: Of 58 participants, 57 completed the study (one dropout in the intervention group). At week 6, the intervention group showed significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms and improvements in quality of life than controls. Adherence was 78\% for EMA, 51\% for EMI, and 65\% for daily routines. Conclusions: The TCA-based digital intervention improved depressive symptoms and quality of life with adherence levels comparable to previous digital health interventions. Future studies should refine the TCA design and conduct larger-scale evaluations.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Multimodal Data Collection Using Smartwatches and Its Visualization in Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable sensors, such as smartwatches, have become increasingly prevalent across domains like healthcare, sports, and education, enabling continuous monitoring of physiological and behavioral data. In the context of education, these technologies offer new opportunities to study cognitive and affective processes such as engagement, attention, and performance. However, the lack of scalable, synchronized, and high-resolution tools for multimodal data acquisition continues to be a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Multimodal Learning Analytics in real-world educational settings. This paper presents two complementary tools developed to address these challenges: Watch-DMLT, a data acquisition application for Fitbit Sense 2 smartwatches that enables real-time, multi-user monitoring of physiological and motion signals; and ViSeDOPS, a dashboard-based visualization system for analyzing synchronized multimodal data collected during oral presentations. We report on a classroom deployment involving 65 students and up to 16 smartwatches, where data streams including heart rate, motion, gaze, video, and contextual annotations were captured and analyzed. Results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of the proposed system for supporting fine-grained, scalable, and interpretable Multimodal Learning Analytics in real learning environments.</description>

      <title>Perception of AI-Generated Music -- The Role of Composer Identity, Personality Traits, Music Preferences, and Perceived Humanness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid rise of AI-generated art has sparked debate about potential biases in how audiences perceive and evaluate such works. This study investigates how composer information and listener characteristics shape the perception of AI-generated music, adopting a mixed-method approach. Using a diverse set of stimuli across various genres from two AI music models, we examine effects of perceived authorship on liking and emotional responses, and explore how attitudes toward AI, personality traits, and music-related variables influence evaluations. We further assess the influence of perceived humanness and analyze open-ended responses to uncover listener criteria for judging AI-generated music. Attitudes toward AI proved to be the best predictor of both liking and emotional intensity of AI-generated music. This quantitative finding was complemented by qualitative themes from our thematic analysis, which identified ethical, cultural, and contextual considerations as important criteria in listeners' evaluations of AI-generated music. Our results offer a nuanced view of how people experience music created by AI tools and point to key factors and methodological considerations for future research on music perception in human-AI interaction.</description>

      <title>Humans incorrectly reject confident accusatory AI judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated verbal deception detection using methods from Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been shown to outperform humans in disentangling lies from truths. Research suggests that transparency and interpretability of computational methods tend to increase human acceptance of using AI to support decisions. However, the extent to which humans accept AI judgments for deception detection remains unclear. We experimentally examined how an AI model's accuracy (i.e., its overall performance in deception detection) and confidence (i.e., the model's uncertainty in single-statements predictions) influence human adoption of the model's judgments. Participants (n=373) were presented with veracity judgments of an AI model with high or low overall accuracy and various degrees of prediction confidence. The results showed that humans followed predictions from a highly accurate model more than from a less accurate one. Interestingly, the more confident the model, the more people deviated from it, especially if the model predicted deception. We also found that human interaction with algorithmic predictions either worsened the machine's performance or was ineffective. While this human aversion to accept highly confident algorithmic predictions was partly explained by participants' tendency to overestimate humans' deception detection abilities, we also discuss how truth-default theory and the social costs of accusing someone of lying help explain the findings.</description>

      <title>In Silico Development of Psychometric Scales: Feasibility of Representative Population Data Simulation with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing and validating psychometric scales requires large samples, multiple testing phases, and substantial resources. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the generation of synthetic participant data by prompting models to answer items while impersonating individuals of specific demographic profiles, potentially allowing in silico piloting before real data collection. Across four preregistered studies (N = circa 300 each), we tested whether LLM-simulated datasets can reproduce the latent structures and measurement properties of human responses. In Studies 1-2, we compared LLM-generated data with real datasets for two validated scales; in Studies 3-4, we created new scales using EFA on simulated data and then examined whether these structures generalized to newly collected human samples. Simulated datasets replicated the intended factor structures in three of four studies and showed consistent configural and metric invariance, with scalar invariance achieved for the two newly developed scales. However, correlation-based tests revealed substantial differences between real and synthetic datasets, and notable discrepancies appeared in score distributions and variances. Thus, while LLMs capture group-level latent structures, they do not approximate individual-level data properties. Simulated datasets also showed full internal invariance across gender. Overall, LLM-generated data appear useful for early-stage, group-level psychometric prototyping, but not as substitutes for individual-level validation. We discuss methodological limitations, risks of bias and data pollution, and ethical considerations related to in silico psychometric simulations.</description>

      <title>FluxLab: Creating 3D Printable Shape-Changing Devices with Integrated Deformation Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FluxLab, a system comprising interactive tools for creating custom 3D-printable shape-changing devices with integrated deformation sensing. To achieve this, we propose a 3D printable nesting structure, consisting of a central SMA channel for sensing and actuation, lattice-based padding in the middle for structural support and controllable elasticity, and parallel helix-based surface wires that preserve the overall form and provide anchoring struts for guided deformation. We developed a design editor to embed these structures into custom 3D models for printing with elastic silicone resin on a consumer-grade SLA 3D printer and minimal post-printing assembly. A deformation authoring tool was also developed for users to build a machine learning-based classifier that distinguishes desired deformation behaviors using inductive sensing. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our system through example applications, including a self-deformable steamer bowl clip, a remotely controllable gripper, and an interactive desk lamp.</description>

      <title>DySTAN: Joint Modeling of Sedentary Activity and Social Context from Smartphone Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately recognizing human context from smartphone sensor data remains a significant challenge, especially in sedentary settings where activities such as studying, attending lectures, relaxing, and eating exhibit highly similar inertial patterns. Furthermore, social context plays a critical role in understanding user behavior, yet is often overlooked in mobile sensing research. To address these gaps, we introduce LogMe, a mobile sensing application that passively collects smartphone sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and rotation vector) and prompts users for hourly self-reports capturing both sedentary activity and social context. Using this dual-label dataset, we propose DySTAN (Dynamic Cross-Stitch with Task Attention Network), a multi-task learning framework that jointly classifies both context dimensions from shared sensor inputs. It integrates task-specific layers with cross-task attention to model subtle distinctions effectively. DySTAN improves sedentary activity macro F1 scores by 21.8% over a single-task CNN-BiLSTM-GRU (CBG) model and by 8.2% over the strongest multi-task baseline, Sluice Network (SN). These results demonstrate the importance of modeling multiple, co-occurring context dimensions to improve the accuracy and robustness of mobile context recognition.</description>

      <title>DialogGuard: Multi-Agent Psychosocial Safety Evaluation of Sensitive LLM Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now mediate many web-based mental-health, crisis, and other emotionally sensitive services, yet their psychosocial safety in these settings remains poorly understood and weakly evaluated. We present DialogGuard, a multi-agent framework for assessing psychosocial risks in LLM-generated responses along five high-severity dimensions: privacy violations, discriminatory behaviour, mental manipulation, psychological harm, and insulting behaviour. DialogGuard can be applied to diverse generative models through four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines, including single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, and stochastic majority voting, grounded in a shared three-level rubric usable by both human annotators and LLM judges. Using PKU-SafeRLHF with human safety annotations, we show that multi-agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging; dual-agent correction and majority voting provide the best trade-off between accuracy, alignment with human ratings, and robustness, while debate attains higher recall but over-flags borderline cases. We release Dialog-Guard as open-source software with a web interface that provides per-dimension risk scores and explainable natural-language rationales. A formative study with 12 practitioners illustrates how it supports prompt design, auditing, and supervision of web-facing applications for vulnerable users.</description>

      <title>TaleFrame: An Interactive Story Generation System with Fine-Grained Control and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of natural language generation (NLG) technologies, creative story generation systems have gained increasing attention. However, current systems often fail to accurately translate user intent into satisfactory story outputs due to a lack of fine-grained control and unclear input specifications, limiting their applicability. To address this, we propose TaleFrame, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) with human-computer interaction (HCI) to generate stories through structured information, enabling precise control over the generation process. The innovation of TaleFrame lies in decomposing the story structure into four basic units: entities, events, relationships, and story outline. We leverage the Tinystories dataset, parsing and constructing a preference dataset consisting of 9,851 JSON-formatted entries, which is then used to fine-tune a local Llama model. By employing this JSON2Story approach, structured data is transformed into coherent stories. TaleFrame also offers an intuitive interface that supports users in creating and editing entities and events and generates stories through the structured framework. Users can control these units through simple interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop, attach, and connect), thus influencing the details and progression of the story. The generated stories can be evaluated across seven dimensions (e.g., creativity, structural integrity), with the system providing suggestions for refinement based on these evaluations. Users can iteratively adjust the story until a satisfactory result is achieved. Finally, we conduct quantitative evaluation and user studies that demonstrate the usefulness of TaleFrame.

      <title>"Can you feel the vibes?": An exploration of novice programmer engagement with vibe coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging alongside generative AI and the broader trend of AI-assisted coding, the term "vibe coding" refers to creating software via natural language prompts rather than direct code authorship. This approach promises to democratize software development, but its educational implications remain underexplored. This paper reports on a one-day educational hackathon investigating how novice programmers and mixed-experience teams engage with vibe coding. We organized an inclusive event at a Brazilian public university with 31 undergraduate participants from computing and non-computing disciplines, divided into nine teams. Through observations, an exit survey, and semi-structured interviews, we examined creative processes, tool usage patterns, collaboration dynamics, and learning outcomes. Findings reveal that vibe coding enabled rapid prototyping and cross-disciplinary collaboration, with participants developing prompt engineering skills and delivering functional demonstrations within time constraints. However, we observed premature convergence in ideation, uneven code quality requiring rework, and limited engagement with core software engineering practices. Teams adopted sophisticated workflows combining multiple AI tools in pipeline configurations, with human judgment remaining essential for critical refinement. The short format (9 hours) proved effective for confidence-building among newcomers while accommodating participants with limited availability. We conclude that vibe coding hackathons can serve as valuable low-stakes learning environments when coupled with explicit scaffolds for divergent thinking, critical evaluation of AI outputs, and realistic expectations about production quality.</description>

      <title>Cross-Lingual Prompt Steerability: Towards Accurate and Robust LLM Behavior across Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: System prompts provide a lightweight yet powerful mechanism for conditioning large language models (LLMs) at inference time. While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Generalized BCIs: Benchmarking 340,000+ Unique Algorithmic Configurations for EEG Mental Command Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust decoding and classification of brain patterns measured with electroencephalography (EEG) remains a major challenge for real-world (i.e. outside scientific lab and medical facilities) brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to well documented inter- and intra-participant variability. Here, we present a large-scale benchmark evaluating over 340,000+ unique combinations of spatial and nonlinear EEG classification. Our methodological pipeline consists in combinations of Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), Riemannian geometry, functional connectivity, and fractal- or entropy-based features across three open-access EEG datasets. Unlike prior studies, our analysis operates at the per-participant level and across multiple frequency bands (8-15 Hz and 8-30 Hz), enabling direct assessment of both group-level performance and individual variability. Covariance tangent space projection (cov-tgsp) and CSP consistently achieved the highest average classification accuracies. However, their effectiveness was strongly dataset-dependent, and marked participant-level differences persisted, particularly in the most heterogeneous of the datasets. Importantly, nonlinear methods outperformed spatial approaches for specific individuals, underscoring the need for personalized pipeline selection. Our findings highlight that no universal 'one-size-fits-all' method can optimally decode EEG motor imagery patterns across all users or datasets. Future work will require adaptive, multimodal, and possibly novel approaches to fully address neurophysiological variability in practical BCI applications where the system can automatically adapt to what makes each user unique.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introduction: This multi-disciplinary case study details how an interactive decision support tool leverages game design to inform an international plastic pollution treaty.
  Design: Seeking to make our scientific findings more usable within the policy process, our interactive software supports manipulation of a mathematical model using techniques borrowed from games. These "ludic" approaches aim to enable user agency to find custom policy solutions, invite deep engagement with scientific results, serve audiences of diverse expertise, and accelerate scientific process to keep pace with intergovernmental negotiations.
  Implementation: Built in JavaScript and D3 with user-modifiable logic via an ANTLR domain specific language, this browser-based application offers adaptability and explorability for our machine learning results with privacy preserving architecture and offline capability.
  Demonstration: Policymakers and the supporting community engaged with this public simulation tool across multiple treaty-related events, investigating plastic waste outcomes under diverse and sometimes unexpected policy scenarios.
  Conclusion: Contextualizing our open source software within a broader lineage of digital media research, we reflect on this interactive modeling platform, considering how game design approaches may help facilitate collaboration at the science / policy nexus.
  Materials: Available on the public Internet, we host this browser-based decision support tool at global-plastics-tool.org, work also archived at zenodo.org/records/12615011 in a Docker container.</description>

      <title>Animating Language Practice: Engagement with Stylized Conversational Agents in Japanese Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore Jouzu, a Japanese language learning application that integrates large language models with anime-inspired conversational agents. Designed to address challenges learners face in practicing natural and expressive dialogue, Jouzu combines stylized character personas with expressive text-to-speech to create engaging conversational scenarios. We conducted a two-week in-the-wild deployment with 52 Japanese learners to examine how such stylized agents influence engagement and learner experience. Our findings show that participants interacted frequently and creatively, with advanced learners demonstrating greater use of expressive forms. Participants reported that the anime-inspired style made practice more enjoyable and encouraged experimenting with different registers. We discuss how stylization shapes willingness to engage, the role of affect in sustaining practice, and design opportunities for culturally grounded conversational AI in computer-assisted language learning (CALL). By framing our findings as an exploration of design and engagement, we highlight opportunities for generalization beyond Japanese contexts and contribute to international HCI scholarship.</description>

      <title>Feed-O-Meter: Investigating AI-Generated Mentee Personas as Interactive Agents for Scaffolding Design Feedback Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective feedback, including critique and evaluation, helps designers develop design concepts and refine their ideas, supporting informed decision-making throughout the iterative design process. However, in studio-based design courses, students often struggle to provide feedback due to a lack of confidence and fear of being judged, which limits their ability to develop essential feedback-giving skills. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) suggest that role-playing with AI agents can let learners engage in multi-turn feedback without the anxiety of external judgment or the time constraints of real-world settings. Yet prior studies have raised concerns that LLMs struggle to behave like real people in role-play scenarios, diminishing the educational benefits of these interactions. Therefore, designing AI-based agents that effectively support learners in practicing and developing intellectual reasoning skills requires more than merely assigning the target persona's personality and role to the agent. By addressing these issues, we present Feed-O-Meter, a novel system that employs carefully designed LLM-based agents to create an environment in which students can practice giving design feedback. The system enables users to role-play as mentors, providing feedback to an AI mentee and allowing them to reflect on how that feedback impacts the AI mentee's idea development process. A user study (N=24) indicated that Feed-O-Meter increased participants' engagement and motivation through role-switching and helped them adjust feedback to be more comprehensible for an AI mentee. Based on these findings, we discuss future directions for designing systems to foster feedback skills in design education.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Academic advising is critical to student success in higher education, yet high student-to-advisor ratios limit advisors' capacity to provide timely support, particularly during peak periods. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) present opportunities to enhance the advising process. We present AdvisingWise, a multi-agent system that automates time-consuming tasks, such as information retrieval and response drafting, while preserving human oversight. AdvisingWise leverages authoritative institutional resources and adaptively prompts students about their academic backgrounds to generate reliable, personalized responses. All system responses undergo human advisor validation before delivery to students. We evaluate AdvisingWise through a mixed-methods approach: (1) expert evaluation on responses of 20 sample queries, (2) LLM-as-a-judge evaluation of the information retrieval strategy, and (3) a user study with 8 academic advisors to assess the system's practical utility. Our evaluation shows that AdvisingWise produces accurate, personalized responses. Advisors reported increasingly positive perceptions after using AdvisingWise, as their initial concerns about reliability and personalization diminished. We conclude by discussing the implications of human-AI synergy on the practice of academic advising.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Educators frequently rely on diagrams to explain complex concepts during lectures, yet creating clear and complete visual representations in real time while simultaneously speaking can be cognitively demanding. Incomplete or unclear diagrams may hinder student comprehension, as learners must mentally reconstruct missing information while following the verbal explanation. Inspired by advances in code completion tools, we introduce DrawDash, an AI-powered whiteboard assistant that proactively completes and refines educational diagrams through multimodal understanding. DrawDash adopts a TAB-completion interaction model: it listens to spoken explanations, detects intent, and dynamically suggests refinements that can be accepted with a single keystroke. We demonstrate DrawDash across four diverse teaching scenarios, spanning topics from computer science and web development to biology. This work represents an early exploration into reducing instructors' cognitive load and improving diagram-based pedagogy through real-time, speech-driven visual assistance, and concludes with a discussion of current limitations and directions for formal classroom evaluation.</description>

      <title>Could AI Leapfrog the Web? Evidence from Teachers in Sierra Leone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Only 37% of sub-Saharan Africans use the internet, and those who do seldom rely on traditional web search. A major reason is that bandwidth is scarce and costly. We study whether an AI-powered WhatsApp chatbot can bridge this gap by analyzing 40,350 queries submitted by 529 Sierra Leonean teachers over 17 months. Each month, more teachers relied on AI than web search for teaching assistance. We compare the AI responses to the top results from google.com.sl, which mostly returns web pages formatted for foreign users: just 2% of pages originate in-country. Also, each web page consumes 3,107 times more bandwidth than an AI response on average. As a result, querying AI through WhatsApp is 98% less expensive than loading a web page, even including AI compute costs. In blinded evaluations, an independent sample of teachers rate AI responses as more relevant, helpful, and correct answers to queries than web search results. These findings suggest that AI can provide cost-effective access to information in low-connectivity environments.</description>

      <title>Self-Calibrating BCIs: Ranking and Recovery of Mental Targets Without Labels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a mental target (e.g., an image of a face) that a participant has in mind from paired EEG (i.e., brain responses) and image (i.e., perceived faces) data collected during interactive sessions without access to labeled information. The problem has been previously explored with labeled data but not via self-calibration, where labeled data is unavailable. Here, we present the first framework and an algorithm, CURSOR, that learns to recover unknown mental targets without access to labeled data or pre-trained decoders. Our experiments on naturalistic images of faces demonstrate that CURSOR can (1) predict image similarity scores that correlate with human perceptual judgments without any label information, (2) use these scores to rank stimuli against an unknown mental target, and (3) generate new stimuli indistinguishable from the unknown mental target (validated via a user study, N=53).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16264v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ParlAI Vote, an interactive web platform for exploring European Parliament debates and votes, and for testing LLMs on vote prediction and bias analysis. This web system connects debate topics, speeches, and roll-call outcomes, and includes rich demographic data such as gender, age, country, and political group. Users can browse debates, inspect linked speeches, compare real voting outcomes with predictions from frontier LLMs, and view error breakdowns by demographic group. Visualizing the EuroParlVote benchmark and its core tasks of gender classification and vote prediction, ParlAI Vote highlights systematic performance bias in state-of-the-art LLMs. It unifies data, models, and visual analytics in a single interface, lowering the barrier for reproducing findings, auditing behavior, and running counterfactual scenarios. This web platform also shows model reasoning, helping users see why errors occur and what cues the models rely on. It supports research, education, and public engagement with legislative decision-making, while making clear both the strengths and the limitations of current LLMs in political analysis.</description>

      <title>AIDEN: Design and Pilot Study of an AI Assistant for the Visually Impaired</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents AIDEN, an artificial intelligence-based assistant designed to enhance the autonomy and daily quality of life of visually impaired individuals, who often struggle with object identification, text reading, and navigation in unfamiliar environments. Existing solutions such as screen readers or audio-based assistants facilitate access to information but frequently lead to auditory overload and raise privacy concerns in open environments. AIDEN addresses these limitations with a hybrid architecture that integrates You Only Look Once (YOLO) for real-time object detection and a Large Language and Vision Assistant (LLaVA) for scene description and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). A key novelty of the system is a continuous haptic guidance mechanism based on a Geiger-counter metaphor, which supports object centering without occupying the auditory channel, while privacy is preserved by ensuring that no personal data are stored. Empirical evaluations with visually impaired participants assessed perceived ease of use and acceptance using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Results indicate high user satisfaction, particularly regarding intuitiveness and perceived autonomy. Moreover, the ``Find an Object'' achieved effective real-time performance. These findings provide promising evidence that multimodal haptic-visual feedback can improve daily usability and independence compared to traditional audio-centric methods, motivating larger-scale clinical validations.</description>

Abstract: Focus group discussions generate rich qualitative data but their analysis traditionally relies on labor-intensive manual coding that limits scalability and reproducibility. We present a systematic framework for applying BERTopic to focus group transcripts using data from ten focus groups exploring HPV vaccine perceptions in Tunisia (1,075 utterances). We conducted comprehensive hyperparameter exploration across 27 configurations, evaluating each through bootstrap stability analysis, performance metrics, and comparison with LDA baseline. Bootstrap analysis revealed that stability metrics (NMI and ARI) exhibited strong disagreement (r = -0.691) and showed divergent relationships with coherence, demonstrating that stability is multifaceted rather than monolithic. Our multi-criteria selection framework yielded a 7-topic model achieving 18\% higher coherence than optimized LDA (0.573 vs. 0.486) with interpretable topics validated through independent human evaluation (ICC = 0.700, weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.678). These findings demonstrate that transformer-based topic modeling can extract interpretable themes from small focus group transcript corpora when systematically configured and validated, while revealing that quality metrics capture distinct, sometimes conflicting constructs requiring multi-criteria evaluation. We provide complete documentation and code to support reproducibility.</description>
