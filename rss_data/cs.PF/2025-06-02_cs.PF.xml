      <title>Linear Layouts: Robust Code Generation of Efficient Tensor Computation Using $\mathbb{F}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient tensor computation is a cornerstone of modern deep learning (DL) workloads, yet existing approaches struggle to achieve flexible and performant design and implementation of tensor layouts -- mappings between logical tensors and hardware resources. The increasing complexity of DL algorithms and hardware demands a generic and systematic approach to handling tensor layouts. In this work, we introduce Linear Layouts, a novel approach that models tensor layouts using linear algebra over $\mathbb{F}_2$. By representing tensor layouts as binary matrices acting on the bits of the hardware representation, our approach enables a generic layout definition -- as opposed to the classical case-by-case approach -- and allows for generic layout-to-layout conversions, eliminating the quadratic explosion that plagues existing solutions. We integrate linear layouts with Triton and demonstrate their effectiveness in optimizing individual Triton operators as well as kernels written in Triton. We also show that linear layouts reduce engineering effort in the compiler backend while fixing several bugs in Triton's legacy layout system.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection and Improvement of Clusters using Enhanced K-Means Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a unified approach to cluster refinement and anomaly detection in datasets. We propose a novel algorithm that iteratively reduces the intra-cluster variance of N clusters until a global minimum is reached, yielding tighter clusters than the standard k-means algorithm. We evaluate the method using intrinsic measures for unsupervised learning, including the silhouette coefficient, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin index, and extend it to anomaly detection by identifying points whose assignment causes a significant variance increase. External validation on synthetic data and the UCI Breast Cancer and UCI Wine Quality datasets employs the Jaccard similarity score, V-measure, and F1 score. Results show variance reductions of 18.7% and 88.1% on the synthetic and Wine Quality datasets, respectively, along with accuracy and F1 score improvements of 22.5% and 20.8% on the Wine Quality dataset.</description>

      <title>Avoid Forgetting by Preserving Global Knowledge Gradients in Federated Learning with Non-IID Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inevitable presence of data heterogeneity has made federated learning very challenging. There are numerous methods to deal with this issue, such as local regularization, better model fusion techniques, and data sharing. Though effective, they lack a deep understanding of how data heterogeneity can affect the global decision boundary. In this paper, we bridge this gap by performing an experimental analysis of the learned decision boundary using a toy example. Our observations are surprising: (1) we find that the existing methods suffer from forgetting and clients forget the global decision boundary and only learn the perfect local one, and (2) this happens regardless of the initial weights, and clients forget the global decision boundary even starting from pre-trained optimal weights. In this paper, we present FedProj, a federated learning framework that robustly learns the global decision boundary and avoids its forgetting during local training. To achieve better ensemble knowledge fusion, we design a novel server-side ensemble knowledge transfer loss to further calibrate the learned global decision boundary. To alleviate the issue of learned global decision boundary forgetting, we further propose leveraging an episodic memory of average ensemble logits on a public unlabeled dataset to regulate the gradient updates at each step of local training. Experimental results demonstrate that FedProj outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.</description>
