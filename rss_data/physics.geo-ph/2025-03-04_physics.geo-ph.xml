      <title>SeisDiff-deno: A Diffusion-Based Denoising Framework for Tube Wave Attenuation in VSP Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tube waves present a significant challenge in vertical seismic profiling data, often obscuring critical seismic signals from seismic acquisition. In this study, we introduce the Seismic Diffusion Model for Denoising, a fast diffusion model specifically designed to remove the noise from seismic shotgather effectively. Our approach balances computational efficiency with high-quality image denoising, ensuring that the method is practical and robust for real-world applications. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through rigorous testing on both synthetic and field data, demonstrating its capability to preserve essential seismic signals while eliminating unwanted coherent noise. The results suggest that the proposed method enhances data quality and supports continuous production during seismic acquisition, paving the way for improved subsurface monitoring and analysis.</description>

      <title>A new practical and effective source-independent full-waveform inversion with a velocity-distribution supported deep image prior: Applications to two real datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is an advanced technique for reconstructing high-resolution subsurface physical parameters by progressively minimizing the discrepancy between observed and predicted seismic data. However, conventional FWI encounters challenges in real data applications, primarily due to its conventional objective of direct measurements of the data misfit. Accurate estimation of the source wavelet is essential for effective data fitting, alongside the need for low-frequency data and a reasonable initial model to prevent cycle skipping. Additionally, wave equation solvers often struggle to accurately simulate the amplitude of observed data in real applications. To address these challenges, we introduce a correlation-based source-independent objective function for FWI that aims to mitigate source uncertainty and amplitude dependency, which effectively enhances its practicality for real data applications. We develop a deep-learning framework constrained by this new objective function with a velocity-distribution supported deep image prior, which reparameterizes velocity inversion into trainable parameters within an autoencoder, thereby reducing the nonlinearity in the conventional FWI's objective function. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method using synthetic data from benchmark velocity models and, more importantly, two real datasets. These examples highlight its effectiveness and practicality even under challenging conditions, such as missing low frequencies, a crude initial velocity model, and an incorrect source wavelet.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Airborne Electromagnetic Data Inversion: a Bootstrapped Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aircraft-based surveying to collect airborne electromagnetic data is a key method to image large swaths of the Earth's surface in pursuit of better knowledge of aquifer systems. Despite many years of advancements, 3D inversion still poses challenges in terms of computational requirements, regularization selection, hyperparameter tuning and real-time inversion. We present a new approach for the inversion of airborne electromagnetic data that leverages machine learning to overcome the computational burden of traditional 3D inversion methods, which implicitly includes learned regularization and is applicable in real-time. The method combines 1D inversion results with geostatistical modeling to create tailored training datasets, enabling the development of a specialized neural network that predicts 2D conductivity models from airborne electromagnetic data. This approach requires 3D forward modeling and 1D inversion up front, but no forward modeling during inference. The workflow is applied to the Kaweah Subbasin in California, where it successfully reconstructs conductivity models consistent with real-world data and geological drill hole information. The results highlight the method's capability to deliver fast and accurate subsurface imaging, offering a valuable tool for groundwater exploration and other near-surface applications.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamic Process of Fluvial Process Based on Theories of Chaos and Dissipative Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of riverbed evolution is an important basis for decision-making on river improvement, flood control project construction, and water conservancy hub dispatching and application. From the perspective of river nonlinear dynamic system, this paper deeply understands the disorder and order in the evolution and development of river bed. Using the chaos theory, the phase diagram is legally used to identify the chaos of the river time series, and the fractal dimension is quantitatively calculated to calculate the characteristic quantities of chaos. Combined with the theory of dissipative structure, the orderliness in evolution and development is understood, and the internal mechanism of river self-organization is analyzed by the principle of minimum entropy generation. The river information entropy is introduced to identify the local scouring and silting pattern of the river section. The results show that the runoff and sediment transport in the three sections are chaotic, and the information entropy fluctuates with a certain range with time, and develops to a decreasing size, that is, the river section as a whole develops in an orderly direction. However, the chaos and disorder of the Sanmenxia section are the most prominent, which may be affected by the imbalance of sediment transport caused by the construction of the reservoir, and the change of beach trough scouring and silting here is significantly affected, and the situation has been improved with the development of bank protection projects.</description>

      <title>On a planetary forcing of global seismicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have explored the temporal variability of the seismicity at global scale over the last 124 years, as well as its potential drivers. To achieve this, we constructed and analyzed an averaged global seismicity curve for earthquakes of magnitude equal or greater than 6 since 1900. Using Singular Spectrum Analysis, we decomposed this curve and compared the extracted pseudo-cycles with two global geophysical parameters associated with Earth's tides: length-of-day variations and sea-level changes. Our results reveal that these three geophysical phenomena can be be explained with 90% accuracy, as the sum of up to seven periodic components, largely aligned with planetary ephemerides: 1 year, 3.4 years (Quasi-Biennial Oscillation, QBO), $\sim$11 years, $\sim$14 years, $\sim$18.6 years (lunar nodal cycle), $\sim$33 years, and $\sim$60 years. We discuss these results in the framework of Laplace's theory, with a particular focus on the phase relationships between seismicity, length-of-day variations, and sea-level changes to further elucidate the underlying physical mechanisms. Finally,integrating observations from seismogenic regions, we propose a trigger mechanism based on solid Earth-hydrosphere interactions, emphasizing the key role of water-rock interactions in modulating earthquake occurrence.</description>

      <title>$\textit{In situ}$ time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy of shock-loaded magnesiosiderite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbonate minerals are important in Earth's system sciences and have been found on Mars and in meteorites and asteroids, highlighting the importance of impacts in planetary processes. While extensively studied under static compression, the behavior of carbonates under shock compression remains underexplored, with no $\textit{in situ}$ X-ray investigations reported so far. Here we investigate natural magnesiosiderite (Fe$_{0.6}$Mg$_{0.4}$CO$_{3}$) under nanosecond laser-driven shock compression at pressures up to 150 GPa, coupled with $\textit{in situ}$ ultrafast synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The interpretation of the experimental spectra is complemented using first-principles absorption cross-section calculations performed on crystalline phases at different pressures and on a dense liquid phase obtained using density functional theory-based molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations. Under laser-driven shock compression, the magnesiosiderite crystal phase remains unchanged up to the melt. Under shock reverberation, the absorption spectra show changes similar to those attributed to a high-spin to low-spin transition observed under static compression. At higher pressures, the laser shock induces the formation of CO$_4$ tetrahedral units in the melt. Upon unloading from the shocked state, only a few nanoseconds later, the original magnesiosiderite phase is recovered.</description>

      <title>Lossy Neural Compression for Geospatial Analytics: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been an explosion in the amount of available Earth Observation (EO) data. The unprecedented coverage of the Earth's surface and atmosphere by satellite imagery has resulted in large volumes of data that must be transmitted to ground stations, stored in data centers, and distributed to end users. Modern Earth System Models (ESMs) face similar challenges, operating at high spatial and temporal resolutions, producing petabytes of data per simulated day. Data compression has gained relevance over the past decade, with neural compression (NC) emerging from deep learning and information theory, making EO data and ESM outputs ideal candidates due to their abundance of unlabeled data. In this review, we outline recent developments in NC applied to geospatial data. We introduce the fundamental concepts of NC including seminal works in its traditional applications to image and video compression domains with focus on lossy compression. We discuss the unique characteristics of EO and ESM data, contrasting them with "natural images", and explain the additional challenges and opportunities they present. Moreover, we review current applications of NC across various EO modalities and explore the limited efforts in ESM compression to date. The advent of self-supervised learning (SSL) and foundation models (FM) has advanced methods to efficiently distill representations from vast unlabeled data. We connect these developments to NC for EO, highlighting the similarities between the two fields and elaborate on the potential of transferring compressed feature representations for machine--to--machine communication. Based on insights drawn from this review, we devise future directions relevant to applications in EO and ESM.</description>

      <title>Multi-block chemometric approaches to the unsupervised spectral characterization of geological samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an example for the potential use of multi-block chemometric methods to provide improved unsupervised characterization of compositionally complex materials through the integration of multi-modal spectrometric data sets, we analysed spectral data derived from five field instruments (one XRF, two NIR, and two FT-Raman), collected on 76 bedrock samples of diverse composition. These data were analysed by single- and multi- block latent variable models, based on principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS). For the single-block approach, PCA and PLS models were generated; whilst hierarchical partial least squares (HPLS) regression was applied for the multi-block modelling. We also tested whether dimensionality reduction resulted in a more computationally efficient muti-block HPLS model with enhanced model interpretability and geological characterization power using the variable influence on projection (VIP) feature selection method.
  The results showed differences in the characterization power of the five spectrometer data sets for the bedrock samples based on their mineral composition and geological properties; moreover, some spectroscopic techniques under-performed for distinguishing samples by composition. The multi-block HPLS and its VIP-strengthened model yielded a more complete unsupervised geological aggrupation of the samples in a single parsimonious model. We conclude that multi-block HPLS models are effective at combining multi-modal spectrometric data to provide a more comprehensive characterization of compositionally complex samples, and VIP can reduce HPLS model complexity, while increasing its data interpretability. These approaches have been applied here to a geological data set, but are amenable to a broad range of applications across chemical and biomedical disciplines.</description>
