      <title>Comparative Analysis of POX and RYU SDN Controllers in Scalable Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the Quality of Service (QoS) performance of two widely used Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controllers, POX and Ryu, using Mininet for network simulation. SDN, a transformative approach to network architecture, separates the control and data planes, enabling centralized management, improved agility, and cost-effective solutions. The study evaluates key QoS parameters, including throughput, delay, and jitter, to understand the capabilities and limitations of the POX and Ryu controllers in handling traffic under diverse network topologies. The research employs a systematic methodology involving the design of custom network topologies, implementation of OpenFlow rules, and analysis of controller behavior under simulated conditions. Results reveal that while POX offers simplicity and ease of use, making it suitable for smaller-scale applications and experimentation, Ryu provides superior scalability and adaptability for more complex network environments. The findings highlight the strengths and challenges of each controller, providing valuable insights for organizations seeking to optimize SDN deployment. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on SDN technologies and their role in building scalable, efficient, and resilient network infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Graph Attention Reinforcement Learning for Multicast Routing and Age-Optimal Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18084v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Age of Information (AoI) has emerged as a prominent metric for evaluating the timeliness of information in time-critical applications, such as video streaming, virtual reality, and metaverse platforms, which often rely on multicast communication. Optimizing AoI in multicast networks is challenging due to the coupling of multicast routing and scheduling decisions, the complexity of the multicast, and the graph representation. This paper focuses on dynamic multicast networks and aims to minimize the expected average AoI by integrating multicast routing and scheduling. To address the inherent complexity of the problem, we first decompose the original problem into two subtasks amenable to hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We propose the first RL framework to address the multicast routing problem, also known as the Steiner Tree problem, by incorporating graph embedding and the successive addition of nodes and links. For graph embedding, we propose the Normalized Graph Attention mechanism (NGAT) framework with a proven contraction mapping property, enabling effective graph information capture and superior generalization within the hierarchical RL framework. We validate our framework through experiments on four datasets, including the real-world AS-733 dataset. The results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can be $11.56\times$ more computationally efficient than traditional multicast routing algorithms while achieving approximation ratios of 1.1-1.3, comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Additionally, our age-optimal TGMS algorithm reduces the average weighted Age of Information (AoI) by 25.6% and the weighted peak age by 29.2% in low-energy scenarios.</description>

      <title>Efficient Adaptive Bandwidth Allocation for Deadline-Aware Online Admission Control in Time-Sensitive Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing demand for dynamic real-time applications, online admission control for time-critical event-triggered (ET) traffic in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has become a critical challenge. The main issue lies in dynamically allocating bandwidth with real-time guarantees in response to traffic changes while also meeting the requirements for rapid response, scalability, and high resource utilization in online scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose an online admission control method for ET traffic based on the TSN/ATS+CBS (asynchronous traffic shaper and credit-based shaper) architecture. This method provides a flexible framework for real-time guaranteed online admission control, supporting dynamic bandwidth allocation and reclamation at runtime without requiring global reconfiguration, thus improving scalability. Within this framework, we further integrate a novel strategy based on network calculus (NC) theory for efficient and high-utilization bandwidth reallocation. On the one hand, the strategy focuses on adaptively balancing residual bandwidth with deadline awareness to prevent bottleneck egress ports, thereby improving admission capacity. On the other hand, it employs a non-trivial analytical result to reduce the search space, accelerating the solving process. Experimental results from both large-scale synthetic and realistic test cases show that, compared to the state-of-the-art, our method achieves an average 56% increase in admitted flows and an average 92% reduction in admission time. Additionally, it postpones the occurrence of bottleneck egress ports and the first rejection of admission requests, thereby enhancing adaptability.</description>
