      <title>Quasicomplemented distributive nearlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study the class of quasicomplemented distributive nearlattices. We investigate $\alpha$-filters and $\alpha$-ideals in quasicomplemented distributive nearlattices and some results on ideals-congruence-kernels. Finally, we also study the notion of Stone distributive nearlattice and give a characterization by means $\sigma$-filters.</description>

      <title>(Non-)well-founded derivations in the provability logic $\mathsf{GLP}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine cyclic, non-well-founded and well-founded derivations in the provability logic $\mathsf{GLP}$. While allowing cyclic derivations does not change the system, the non-well-founded and well-founded derivations we consider define the same proper infinitary extension of $\mathsf{GLP}$. We establish that this extension is strongly algebraic and neighbourhood complete with respect to both local and global semantic consequence relations. In fact, these completeness results are proved for generalizations of global and local consequence relations, which we call global-local. In addition, we prove strong local neighbourhood completeness for the original system $\mathsf{GLP}$ (with ordinary derivations only).</description>

      <title>Axiomatic Foundations of Fractal Analysis and Fractal Number Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an axiomatic framework for fractal analysis and fractal number theory grounded in hierarchies of definability. Central to this approach is a sequence of formal systems F_n, each corresponding to a definability level S_n contained in R of constructively accessible mathematical objects. This structure refines classical analysis by replacing uncountable global constructs with countable, syntactically constrained approximations.
  The axioms formalize: - A hierarchy of definability levels S_n, indexed by syntactic and ordinal complexity; - Fractal topologies and the induced notions of continuity, compactness, and differentiability; - Layered integration and differentiation with explicit convergence and definability bounds; - Arithmetic and function spaces over the stratified continuum R_{S_n}, which is a subset of R.
  This framework synthesizes constructive mathematics, proof-theoretic stratification, and fractal geometric intuition into a unified, finitistically structured model. Key results include the definability-based classification of real numbers (e.g., algebraic, computable, Liouville), a stratified fundamental theorem of calculus with syntactic error bounds, and compatibility with base systems such as RCA_0 and ACA_0.
  The framework enables constructive approximation and syntactic regularization of classical analysis, with applications to proof assistants, computable mathematics, and foundational studies of the continuum.</description>

      <title>Definably amenable groups in Continuous logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.09971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of definable amenability and extreme definable amenability for groups in continuous structures and conduct an extensive analysis of them, drawing parallels with the classical first-order case. We characterize both notions using fixed-point properties. We show that stable and ultracompact groups are definably amenable and prove that, for groups definable in dependent theories, definable amenability is equivalent to the existence of an f-generic type. Finally, we show the randomizations of first-order definably amenable groups are extremely definably amenable.</description>

      <title>Contracting Endomorphisms of Valued Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the class of separably algebraically closed valued fields equipped with a distinguished Frobenius endomorphism $x \mapsto x^q$ is decidable, uniformly in $q$. The result is a simultaneous generalization of the work of Chatzidakis and Hrushovski (in the case of the trivial valuation) and the work of the first author and Hrushovski (in the case where the fields are algebraically closed).
  The logical setting for the proof is a model completeness result for valued fields equipped with an endomorphism $\sigma$ which is locally infinitely contracting and fails to be onto. Namely we prove the existence of a model complete theory $\widetilde{\mathrm{VFE}}$ amalgamating the theories $\mathrm{SCFE}$ and $\widetilde{\mathrm{VFA}}$ introduced in [5] and [11], respectively. In characteristic zero, we also prove that $\widetilde{\mathrm{VFE}}$ is NTP$_2$ and classify the stationary types: they are precisely those orthogonal to the fixed field and the value group.</description>

      <title>Aggregation of evaluations without unanimity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dokow and Holzman determined which predicates over $\{0, 1\}$ satisfy an analog of Arrow's theorem: all unanimous aggregators are dictatorial. Szegedy and Xu, extending earlier work of Dokow and Holzman, extended this to predicates over arbitrary finite alphabets.
  Mossel extended Arrow's theorem in an orthogonal direction, determining all aggregators without the assumption of unanimity. We bring together both threads of research by extending the results of Dokow-Holzman and Szegedy-Xu to the setting of Mossel. As an application, we determine, for each symmetric predicate over $\{0,1\}$, all of its aggregators.</description>
