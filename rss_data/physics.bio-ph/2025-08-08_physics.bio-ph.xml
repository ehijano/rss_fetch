      <title>The seed-carrying stalk of the linden diaspore ensures autorotating flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersal of seeds by wind is one of the most evolved mechanisms plants use to invade new territories. Linden trees grow diaspores with a curved bract acting as a wing, where the seed pods are connected underneath by a stalk. Besides the seed-carrying capacity, the other functions of the stalk remain unknown. We demonstrate that the stalk of linden (genus Tilia L.) diaspores plays an essential role in their flight. The stalk length to wing span ratio is found to be the key parameter for facilitating steady autorotating flight in Tilia x europaea diaspores, effectively doubling their flight time compared to an unsteady tumbling motion. Flight experiments with biological and synthetic diaspores reveal a critical stalk length needed to induce autorotation, which correlates with analysis of collected biological samples and points to a possible evolutionarily selected trait. Flow measurements show that the vortical structures around the curved wing cause the elevated lift force during the autorotating flight.</description>

      <title>The Missing Reward: Active Inference in the Era of Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy, allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical constraints.</description>

      <title>Fluid flow generates bacterial conjugation hotspots by increasing the rate of shear-driven cell-cell encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conjugation accelerates bacterial evolution by enabling bacteria to acquire genes horizontally from their neighbors. Plasmid donors must physically encounter and connect with recipients to allow plasmid transfer, and different environments are characterized by vastly different encounter rates between cells, based on mechanisms ranging from simple diffusion to fluid flow. However, how the environment affects the conjugation rate by setting the encounter rate has been largely neglected, mostly because existing experimental setups do not allow direct control over cell encounters. Here, we describe the results of conjugation experiments in E. coli in which we systematically varied the magnitude of shear flow using a cone-and-plate rheometer to control the encounter rate. We discovered that the conjugation rate increases with shear until it peaks at an optimal shear rate (100 1/s), reaching a conjugation rate five-fold higher than the baseline set by diffusion-driven encounters. This optimum marks the transition from a regime in which shear promotes conjugation by increasing the rate of cell-cell encounters to a regime in which shear disrupts conjugation. Regions of high fluid shear are widespread in aquatic systems, in the gut of host organisms, and in soil, and our results indicate that these regions could be hotspots of bacterial conjugation in the environment.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-giant number fluctuations and nematic order in microswimmer suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Giant number fluctuations (GNFs), whereby the standard deviation $\Delta N$ in the local number of particles $\langle N \rangle$ grows faster than $\sqrt{\langle N \rangle}$, are a hallmark property of dry active matter systems with orientational order, such as a collection of granular particles on a vibrated plate. This contrasts with momentum-conserving ("wet") active matter systems, such as suspensions of swimming bacteria, where no theoretical prediction of GNFs exist, although numerous experimental observations of such enhanced fluctuations have been reported. In this Letter, we numerically confirm the emergence of super-Gaussian number fluctuations in a 3-dimensional suspension of pusher microswimmers undergoing a transition to collective motion. These fluctuations emerge sharply above the transition, but only for sufficiently large values of the bacterial persistence length $\ell_p = v_s / \lambda$, where $v_s$ is the bacterial swimming speed and $\lambda$ the tumbling rate. Crucially, these "pseudo-GNFs" differ from true GNFs, as they only occur on length scales shorter than the typical size $\xi$ of nematic patches in the collective motion state, which is in turn proportional to the single-swimmer persistence length $\ell_p$. Our results thus suggest that observations of enhanced density fluctuations in biological active matter systems actually represent transient effects that decay away beyond mesoscopic length scales, and raises the question to what extent "true" GNFs with universal properties can exist in the presence of fluid flows.</description>

      <title>Enantioselective radical reactions can be induced by electron spin polarization: A quantum mechanism for Nature's emergent homochirality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomolecules that constitute life on Earth are chiral, but the precise mechanism by which homochirality emerged remains a mystery. In this work it is demonstrated that reactions of radical pairs, where one of the radical electron spins is polarised, can be enantioselective. This phenomenon arises from transient coherent quantum dynamics of the radical pair electron spins, which is known to occur even in warm and noisy condensed phase environments, where energetic perturbations much smaller than thermal energy can have large effects on reactivity. A quantitative theory is presented based on the molecular theory of chirality induced spin selectivity (CISS), where electron exchange interactions and chirality-dependent spin-orbit coupling effects control enantioselectivity. This theory provides useful bounds on the maximum enantiomeric excess for these reactions, which are found to be consistent with previous experiments. The enantioseletive radical pair mechanism presented here provides an alternative mechanistic basis to a recent proposal that spin-polarised photoelectrons from magnetite provided the initial chiral symmetry breaking necessary for the inception of homochirality in Nature, as well as suggests a new strategy for asymmetric synthesis using spin-polarised electrons.</description>
