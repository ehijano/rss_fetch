      <title>Can Common VLMs Rival Medical VLMs? Evaluation and Strategic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) leverage large-scale pretraining for diverse imaging tasks but require substantial computational and data resources. Meanwhile, common or general-purpose VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA), though not trained for medical use, show promise with fine-tuning. This raises a key question: Can efficient fine-tuned common VLMs rival generalist medical VLMs for solving specific medical imaging tasks? This study systematically evaluates common and medical VLMs across disease diagnosis and visual question answering (VQA). Using CLIP-based and LLaVA-based models, we examine (1) off-the-shelf performance gaps in in-domain (ID) settings, (2) whether fine-tuning bridges these gaps, and (3) generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) tasks on unseen medical modalities. While medical-specific pretraining provides advantages in ID settings, common VLMs match or surpass medical-specific models after lightweight fine-tuning, with LoRA-based adaptation proving highly effective among different tasks. In OOD tasks, common VLMs demonstrate strong adaptability in some tasks, challenging the assumption that medical-specific pre-training is essential. These findings suggest that leveraging common VLMs with fine-tuning offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative to developing large-scale medical VLMs, providing crucial insights for future research in the medical imaging field.</description>

      <title>DSA-NRP: No-Reflow Prediction from Angiographic Perfusion Dynamics in Stroke EVT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following successful large-vessel recanalization via endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), some patients experience a complication known as no-reflow, defined by persistent microvascular hypoperfusion that undermines tissue recovery and worsens clinical outcomes. Although prompt identification is crucial, standard clinical practice relies on perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 24 hours post-procedure, delaying intervention. In this work, we introduce the first-ever machine learning (ML) framework to predict no-reflow immediately after EVT by leveraging previously unexplored intra-procedural digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences and clinical variables. Our retrospective analysis included AIS patients treated at UCLA Medical Center (2011-2024) who achieved favorable mTICI scores (2b-3) and underwent pre- and post-procedure MRI. No-reflow was defined as persistent hypoperfusion (Tmax &gt; 6 s) on post-procedural imaging. From DSA sequences (AP and lateral views), we extracted statistical and temporal perfusion features from the target downstream territory to train ML classifiers for predicting no-reflow. Our novel method significantly outperformed a clinical-features baseline(AUC: 0.7703 $\pm$ 0.12 vs. 0.5728 $\pm$ 0.12; accuracy: 0.8125 $\pm$ 0.10 vs. 0.6331 $\pm$ 0.09), demonstrating that real-time DSA perfusion dynamics encode critical insights into microvascular integrity. This approach establishes a foundation for immediate, accurate no-reflow prediction, enabling clinicians to proactively manage high-risk patients without reliance on delayed imaging.</description>

      <title>MTSIC: Multi-stage Transformer-based GAN for Spectral Infrared Image Colorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal infrared (TIR) images, acquired through thermal radiation imaging, are unaffected by variations in lighting conditions and atmospheric haze. However, TIR images inherently lack color and texture information, limiting downstream tasks and potentially causing visual fatigue. Existing colorization methods primarily rely on single-band images with limited spectral information and insufficient feature extraction capabilities, which often result in image distortion and semantic ambiguity. In contrast, multiband infrared imagery provides richer spectral data, facilitating the preservation of finer details and enhancing semantic accuracy. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework designed to integrate spectral information to enhance the colorization of infrared images. The framework employs a multi-stage spectral self-attention Transformer network (MTSIC) as the generator. Each spectral feature is treated as a token for self-attention computation, and a multi-head self-attention mechanism forms a spatial-spectral attention residual block (SARB), achieving multi-band feature mapping and reducing semantic confusion. Multiple SARB units are integrated into a Transformer-based single-stage network (STformer), which uses a U-shaped architecture to extract contextual information, combined with multi-scale wavelet blocks (MSWB) to align semantic information in the spatial-frequency dual domain. Multiple STformer modules are cascaded to form MTSIC, progressively optimizing the reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional techniques and effectively enhances the visual quality of infrared images.</description>

      <title>LVPNet: A Latent-variable-based Prediction-driven End-to-end Framework for Lossless Compression of Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive Initial Bits is a framework that integrates sub-image autoregression and latent variable modeling, demonstrating its advantages in lossless medical image compression. However, in existing methods, the image segmentation process leads to an even distribution of latent variable information across each sub-image, which in turn causes posterior collapse and inefficient utilization of latent variables. To deal with these issues, we propose a prediction-based end-to-end lossless medical image compression method named LVPNet, leveraging global latent variables to predict pixel values and encoding predicted probabilities for lossless compression. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multi-scale Sensing Module (GMSM), which extracts compact and informative latent representations from the entire image, effectively capturing spatial dependencies within the latent space. Furthermore, to mitigate the information loss introduced during quantization, we propose the Quantization Compensation Module (QCM), which learns the distribution of quantization errors and refines the quantized features to compensate for quantization loss. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior compression efficiency compared to state-of-the-art lossless image compression approaches, while maintaining competitive inference speed.

      <title>Multimodal Medical Image Binding via Shared Text Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image analysis increasingly relies on the integration of multiple imaging modalities to capture complementary anatomical and functional information, enabling more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Achieving aligned feature representations across these diverse modalities is therefore important for effective multimodal analysis. While contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) and its variant have enabled image-text alignments, they require explicitly paired data between arbitrary two modalities, which is difficult to acquire in medical contexts. To address the gap, we present Multimodal Medical Image Binding with Text (M\textsuperscript{3}Bind), a novel pre-training framework that enables seamless alignment of multiple medical imaging modalities through a shared text representation space without requiring explicit paired data between any two medical image modalities. Specifically, based on the insight that different images can naturally bind with text, M\textsuperscript{3}Bind first fine-tunes pre-trained CLIP-like image-text models to align their modality-specific text embedding space while preserving their original image-text alignments. Subsequently, we distill these modality-specific text encoders into a unified model, creating a shared text embedding space. Experiments on X-ray, CT, retina, ECG, and pathological images on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that M\textsuperscript{3}Bind achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, few-shot classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks compared to its CLIP-like counterparts. These results validate M\textsuperscript{3}Bind's effectiveness in achieving cross-image-modal alignment for medical analysis.</description>

      <title>CT Radiomics-Based Explainable Machine Learning Model for Accurate Differentiation of Malignant and Benign Endometrial Tumors: A Two-Center Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aimed to develop and validate a CT radiomics-based explainable machine learning model for diagnosing malignancy and benignity specifically in endometrial cancer (EC) patients. A total of 83 EC patients from two centers, including 46 with malignant and 37 with benign conditions, were included, with data split into a training set (n=59) and a testing set (n=24). The regions of interest (ROIs) were manually segmented from pre-surgical CT scans, and 1132 radiomic features were extracted from the pre-surgical CT scans using Pyradiomics. Six explainable machine learning modeling algorithms were implemented respectively, for determining the optimal radiomics pipeline. The diagnostic performance of the radiomic model was evaluated by using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, F1 score, confusion matrices, and ROC curves. To enhance clinical understanding and usability, we separately implemented SHAP analysis and feature mapping visualization, and evaluated the calibration curve and decision curve. By comparing six modeling strategies, the Random Forest model emerged as the optimal choice for diagnosing EC, with a training AUC of 1.00 and a testing AUC of 0.96. SHAP identified the most important radiomic features, revealing that all selected features were significantly associated with EC (P &lt; 0.05). Radiomics feature maps also provide a feasible assessment tool for clinical applications. DCA indicated a higher net benefit for our model compared to the "All" and "None" strategies, suggesting its clinical utility in identifying high-risk cases and reducing unnecessary interventions. In conclusion, the CT radiomics-based explainable machine learning model achieved high diagnostic performance, which could be used as an intelligent auxiliary tool for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer.</description>

      <title>Transforming H&amp;E images into IHC: A Variance-Penalized GAN for Precision Oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in breast cells is a key driver of HER2-positive breast cancer, a highly aggressive subtype requiring precise diagnosis and targeted therapy. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the standard technique for HER2 assessment but is costly, labor-intensive, and highly dependent on antibody selection. In contrast, hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining, a routine histopathological procedure, offers broader accessibility but lacks HER2 specificity. This study proposes an advanced deep learning-based image translation framework to generate highfidelity IHC images from H&amp;E-stained tissue samples, enabling cost-effective and scalable HER2 assessment. By modifying the loss function of pyramid pix2pix, we mitigate mode collapse, a fundamental limitation in generative adversarial networks (GANs), and introduce a novel variance-based penalty that enforces structural diversity in generated images. Our model particularly excels in translating HER2-positive (IHC 3+) images, which have remained challenging for existing methods due to their complex morphological variations. Extensive evaluations on the BCI histopathological dataset demonstrate that our model surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of peak signal-tonoise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and Frechet Inception Distance (FID), particularly in accurately translating HER2-positive (IHC 3+) images. Beyond medical imaging, our model exhibits superior performance in general image-to-image translation tasks, showcasing its potential across multiple domains. This work marks a significant step toward AI-driven precision oncology, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to traditional HER2 diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Taming Vision-Language Models for Medical Image Analysis: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in cross-modal semantic understanding between visual and textual modalities. Given the intrinsic need for multi-modal integration in clinical applications, VLMs have emerged as a promising solution for a wide range of medical image analysis tasks. However, adapting general-purpose VLMs to medical domain poses numerous challenges, such as large domain gaps, complicated pathological variations, and diversity and uniqueness of different tasks. The central purpose of this review is to systematically summarize recent advances in adapting VLMs for medical image analysis, analyzing current challenges, and recommending promising yet urgent directions for further investigations. We begin by introducing core learning strategies for medical VLMs, including pretraining, fine-tuning, and prompt learning. We then categorize five major VLM adaptation strategies for medical image analysis. These strategies are further analyzed across eleven medical imaging tasks to illustrate their current practical implementations. Furthermore, we analyze key challenges that impede the effective adaptation of VLMs to clinical applications and discuss potential directions for future research. We also provide an open-access repository of related literature to facilitate further research, available at https://github.com/haonenglin/Awesome-VLM-for-MIA. It is anticipated that this article can help researchers who are interested in harnessing VLMs in medical image analysis tasks have a better understanding on their capabilities and limitations, as well as current technical barriers, to promote their innovative, robust, and safe application in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>SafeClick: Error-Tolerant Interactive Segmentation of Any Medical Volumes via Hierarchical Expert Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models for volumetric medical image segmentation have emerged as powerful tools in clinical workflows, enabling radiologists to delineate regions of interest through intuitive clicks. While these models demonstrate promising capabilities in segmenting previously unseen anatomical structures, their performance is strongly influenced by prompt quality. In clinical settings, radiologists often provide suboptimal prompts, which affects segmentation reliability and accuracy. To address this limitation, we present SafeClick, an error-tolerant interactive segmentation approach for medical volumes based on hierarchical expert consensus. SafeClick operates as a plug-and-play module compatible with foundation models including SAM 2 and MedSAM 2. The framework consists of two key components: a collaborative expert layer (CEL) that generates diverse feature representations through specialized transformer modules, and a consensus reasoning layer (CRL) that performs cross-referencing and adaptive integration of these features. This architecture transforms the segmentation process from a prompt-dependent operation to a robust framework capable of producing accurate results despite imperfect user inputs. Extensive experiments across 15 public datasets demonstrate that our plug-and-play approach consistently improves the performance of base foundation models, with particularly significant gains when working with imperfect prompts. The source code is available at https://github.com/yifangao112/SafeClick.</description>

      <title>A Deep Convolutional Neural Network-Based Novel Class Balancing for Imbalance Data Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retinal fundus images provide valuable insights into the human eye's interior structure and crucial features, such as blood vessels, optic disk, macula, and fovea. However, accurate segmentation of retinal blood vessels can be challenging due to imbalanced data distribution and varying vessel thickness. In this paper, we propose BLCB-CNN, a novel pipeline based on deep learning and bi-level class balancing scheme to achieve vessel segmentation in retinal fundus images. The BLCB-CNN scheme uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and an empirical approach to balance the distribution of pixels across vessel and non-vessel classes and within thin and thick vessels. Level-I is used for vessel/non-vessel balancing and Level-II is used for thick/thin vessel balancing. Additionally, pre-processing of the input retinal fundus image is performed by Global Contrast Normalization (GCN), Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and gamma corrections to increase intensity uniformity as well as to enhance the contrast between vessels and background pixels. The resulting balanced dataset is used for classification-based segmentation of the retinal vascular tree. We evaluate the proposed scheme on standard retinal fundus images and achieve superior performance measures, including an area under the ROC curve of 98.23%, Accuracy of 96.22%, Sensitivity of 81.57%, and Specificity of 97.65%. We also demonstrate the method's efficacy through external cross-validation on STARE images, confirming its generalization ability.</description>

      <title>Temporal Neural Cellular Automata: Application to modeling of contrast enhancement in breast MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic contrast enhancement offers fast image acquisition and eliminates the need for intravenous injection of contrast agent. This is particularly beneficial for breast imaging, where long acquisition times and high cost are significantly limiting the applicability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a widespread screening modality. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of synthetic contrast generation. However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods lack sufficient measures for consistent temporal evolution. Neural cellular automata (NCA) offer a robust and lightweight architecture to model evolving patterns between neighboring cells or pixels. In this work we introduce TeNCA (Temporal Neural Cellular Automata), which extends and further refines NCAs to effectively model temporally sparse, non-uniformly sampled imaging data. To achieve this, we advance the training strategy by enabling adaptive loss computation and define the iterative nature of the method to resemble a physical progression in time. This conditions the model to learn a physiologically plausible evolution of contrast enhancement. We rigorously train and test TeNCA on a diverse breast MRI dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness, surpassing the performance of existing methods in generation of images that align with ground truth post-contrast sequences.</description>

      <title>3D Gaussian Splatting for Fine-Detailed Surface Reconstruction in Large-Scale Scene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have made significant advances in surface reconstruction. However, scaling these methods to large-scale scenes remains challenging due to high computational demands and the complex dynamic appearances typical of outdoor environments. These challenges hinder the application in aerial surveying and autonomous driving. This paper proposes a novel solution to reconstruct large-scale surfaces with fine details, supervised by full-sized images. Firstly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy to reconstruct a coarse model efficiently, followed by adaptive scene partitioning and sub-scene refining from image segments. Additionally, we integrate a decoupling appearance model to capture global appearance variations and a transient mask model to mitigate interference from moving objects. Finally, we expand the multi-view constraint and introduce a single-view regularization for texture-less areas. Our experiments were conducted on the publicly available dataset GauU-Scene V2, which was captured using unmanned aerial vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, our method outperforms existing NeRF-based and Gaussian-based methods, achieving high-fidelity visual results and accurate surface from full-size image optimization. Open-source code will be available on GitHub.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a foreground-background separation (FBS) method with a novel foreground model based on convolutional sparse representation (CSR). In order to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under undesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations, it is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low frame rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two limitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and background components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture either data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not include explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS process. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based foreground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures scattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex optimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general features, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of noise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and general features to accurately separate the components from various types of noise even under low frame rates. To obtain a solution of the optimization problem, we develop an algorithm that alternately solves its two convex subproblems by newly established algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods using two types of degraded videos: infrared and microscope videos.</description>

      <title>A Selection of Distributions and Their Fourier Transforms with Applications in Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note presents a rigorous introduction to a selection of distributions along with their Fourier transforms, which are commonly encountered in signal processing and, in particular, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In contrast to many textbooks on the principles of MRI, which place more emphasis on the signal processing aspect, this note will take a more mathematical approach. In particular, we will make explicit the underlying topological space of interest and clarify the exact sense in which these distributions and their Fourier transforms are defined. Key results presented in this note involve the Poisson summation formula and the Fourier transform of a Gaussian function via an ordinary differential equation (ODE) argument, etc. Although the readers are expected to have prior exposure to functional analysis and distribution theory, this note is intended to be self-contained.</description>

      <title>Auto-Lesion Segmentation with a Novel Intensity Dark Channel Prior for COVID-19 Detection</title>

Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical imaging techniques like computed tomography (CT) scans have demonstrated effectiveness in combating the rapid spread of the virus. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct research on computerized models for the detection of COVID-19 using CT imaging. A novel processing method has been developed, utilizing radiomic features, to assist in the CT-based diagnosis of COVID-19. Given the lower specificity of traditional features in distinguishing between different causes of pulmonary diseases, the objective of this study is to develop a CT-based radiomics framework for the differentiation of COVID-19 from other lung diseases. The model is designed to focus on outlining COVID-19 lesions, as traditional features often lack specificity in this aspect. The model categorizes images into three classes: COVID-19, non-COVID-19, or normal. It employs enhancement auto-segmentation principles using intensity dark channel prior (IDCP) and deep neural networks (ALS-IDCP-DNN) within a defined range of analysis thresholds. A publicly available dataset comprising COVID-19, normal, and non-COVID-19 classes was utilized to validate the proposed model's effectiveness. The best performing classification model, Residual Neural Network with 50 layers (Resnet-50), attained an average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 98.8%, 99%, 98%, and 98% respectively. These results demonstrate the capability of our model to accurately classify COVID-19 images, which could aid radiologists in diagnosing suspected COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, our model's performance surpasses that of more than 10 current state-of-the-art studies conducted on the same dataset.</description>

      <title>MOST: MR reconstruction Optimization for multiple downStream Tasks via continual learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based Magnetic Resonance (MR) reconstruction methods have focused on generating high-quality images but often overlook the impact on downstream tasks (e.g., segmentation) that utilize the reconstructed images. Cascading separately trained reconstruction network and downstream task network has been shown to introduce performance degradation due to error propagation and the domain gaps between training datasets. To mitigate this issue, downstream task-oriented reconstruction optimization has been proposed for a single downstream task. In this work, we extend the optimization to handle multiple downstream tasks that are introduced sequentially via continual learning. The proposed method integrates techniques from replay-based continual learning and image-guided loss to overcome catastrophic forgetting. Comparative experiments demonstrated that our method outperformed a reconstruction network without finetuning, a reconstruction network with na\"ive finetuning, and conventional continual learning methods.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a crucial diagnostic challenge carrying immense clinical significance, for effective treatment regimens and patient management. For instance, a group of subjects termed SWEDD who are clinically diagnosed as PD, but show normal Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scans, change their diagnosis as non-PD after few years of follow up, and in the meantime, they are treated with PD medications which do more harm than good. In this work, machine learning models are developed using features from SPECT images to detect early PD and SWEDD subjects from normal. These models were observed to perform with high accuracy. It is inferred from the study that these diagnostic models carry potential to help PD clinicians in the diagnostic process</description>

      <title>Ultra-high resolution multimodal MRI densely labelled holistic structural brain atlas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel structural holistic Atlas (holiAtlas) of the human brain anatomy based on multimodal and high-resolution MRI that covers several anatomical levels from the organ to the substructure level, using a new densely labelled protocol generated from the fusion of multiple local protocols at different scales. This atlas was constructed by averaging images and segmentations of 75 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project database. Specifically, MR images of T1, T2 and WMn (White Matter nulled) contrasts at 0.125 $mm^{3}$ resolution were selected for this project. The images of these 75 subjects were nonlinearly registered and averaged using symmetric group-wise normalisation to construct the atlas. At the finest level, the proposed atlas has 350 different labels derived from 7 distinct delineation protocols. These labels were grouped at multiple scales, offering a coherent and consistent holistic representation of the brain across different levels of detail. This multiscale and multimodal atlas can be used to develop new ultra-high-resolution segmentation methods, potentially improving the early detection of neurological disorders. We make it publicly available to the scientific community.</description>

      <title>MDAA-Diff: CT-Guided Multi-Dose Adaptive Attention Diffusion Model for PET Denoising</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acquiring high-quality Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images requires administering high-dose radiotracers, which increases radiation exposure risks. Generating standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) has become a potential solution. However, previous studies have primarily focused on single low-dose PET denoising, neglecting two critical factors: discrepancies in dose response caused by inter-patient variability, and complementary anatomical constraints derived from CT images. In this work, we propose a novel CT-Guided Multi-dose Adaptive Attention Denoising Diffusion Model (MDAA-Diff) for multi-dose PET denoising. Our approach integrates anatomical guidance and dose-level adaptation to achieve superior denoising performance under low-dose conditions. Specifically, this approach incorporates a CT-Guided High-frequency Wavelet Attention (HWA) module, which uses wavelet transforms to separate high-frequency anatomical boundary features from CT images. These extracted features are then incorporated into PET imaging through an adaptive weighted fusion mechanism to enhance edge details. Additionally, we propose the Dose-Adaptive Attention (DAA) module, a dose-conditioned enhancement mechanism that dynamically integrates dose levels into channel-spatial attention weight calculation. Extensive experiments on 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI datasets demonstrate that MDAA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in preserving diagnostic quality under reduced-dose conditions. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>PC-SRGAN: Physically Consistent Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network for General Transient Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Learning, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has revolutionised Super Resolution (SR). However, generated images often lack physical meaningfulness, which is essential for scientific applications. Our approach, PC-SRGAN, enhances image resolution while ensuring physical consistency for interpretable simulations. PC-SRGAN significantly improves both the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and the Structural Similarity Index Measure compared to conventional methods, even with limited training data (e.g., only 13% of training data required for SRGAN). Beyond SR, PC-SRGAN augments physically meaningful machine learning, incorporating numerically justified time integrators and advanced quality metrics. These advancements promise reliable and causal machine-learning models in scientific domains. A significant advantage of PC-SRGAN over conventional SR techniques is its physical consistency, which makes it a viable surrogate model for time-dependent problems. PC-SRGAN advances scientific machine learning, offering improved accuracy and efficiency for image processing, enhanced process understanding, and broader applications to scientific research. We publicly release the complete source code at https://github.com/hasan-rakibul/PC-SRGAN.</description>

      <title>Multi-contrast laser endoscopy for in vivo gastrointestinal imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: White light endoscopy is the clinical gold standard for detecting diseases in the gastrointestinal tract. Most applications involve identifying visual abnormalities in tissue color, texture, and shape. Unfortunately, the contrast of these features is often subtle, causing many clinically relevant cases to go undetected. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Multi-contrast Laser Endoscopy (MLE): a platform for widefield clinical imaging with rapidly tunable spectral, coherent, and directional illumination. We demonstrate three capabilities of MLE: enhancing tissue chromophore contrast with multispectral diffuse reflectance, quantifying blood flow using laser speckle contrast imaging, and characterizing mucosal topography using photometric stereo. We validate MLE with benchtop models, then demonstrate MLE in vivo during clinical colonoscopies. MLE images from 31 polyps demonstrate an approximate three-fold improvement in contrast and a five-fold improvement in color difference compared to white light and narrow band imaging. With the ability to reveal multiple complementary types of tissue contrast while seamlessly integrating into the clinical environment, MLE shows promise as an investigative tool to improve gastrointestinal imaging.</description>

      <title>A Prior-Guided Joint Diffusion Model in Projection Domain for PET Tracer Conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is widely used to assess metabolic activity, but its application is limited by the availability of radiotracers. 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is the most commonly used tracer but shows limited effectiveness for certain tumors. In contrast, 6-18F-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (18F-DOPA) offers higher specificity for neuroendocrine tumors and neurological disorders. However, the complexity of its synthesis process and constraints on transportation time have limited its clinical application. Among different forms of raw data acquired by the scanner, sinogram is a commonly used representation in PET imaging. Therefore, modeling in projection domain enables more direct utilization of the original information, potentially reducing the accumulation errors during the image reconstruction process. Inspired by these factors, this study proposes a prior-guided joint diffusion model (PJDM) for transforming 18F-FDG PET sinograms into 18F-DOPA PET sinograms. During inference, an initial synthetic 18F-DOPA PET sinogram is first generated using a higher-order hybrid sampler. This sinogram is then degraded and serves as an additional condition to guide the iterative refinement process. Experimental results demonstrated that PJDM effectively improved both sinogram quality and the final synthetic outcomes. The code is available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/PJDM.</description>

      <title>Novel Multicolumn Kernel Extreme Learning Machine for Food Detection via Optimal Features from CNN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.07348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic food detection is an emerging topic of interest due to its wide array of applications ranging from detecting food images on social media platforms to filtering non-food photos from the users in dietary assessment apps. Recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has facilitated enforcing an eating ban by automatically detecting eating activities from cameras in public places. Therefore, to tackle the challenge of recognizing food images with high accuracy, we proposed the idea of a hybrid framework for extracting and selecting optimal features from an efficient neural network. There on, a nonlinear classifier is employed to discriminate between linearly inseparable feature vectors with great precision. In line with this idea, our method extracts features from MobileNetV3, selects an optimal subset of attributes by using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, and exploits kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) due to its nonlinear decision boundary and good generalization ability. However, KELM suffers from the 'curse of dimensionality problem' for large datasets due to the complex computation of kernel matrix with large numbers of hidden nodes. We solved this problem by proposing a novel multicolumn kernel extreme learning machine (MCKELM) which exploited the k-d tree algorithm to divide data into N subsets and trains separate KELM on each subset of data. Then, the method incorporates KELM classifiers into parallel structures and selects the top k nearest subsets during testing by using the k-d tree search for classifying input instead of the whole network. For evaluating a proposed framework large food/non-food dataset is prepared using nine publically available datasets. Experimental results showed the superiority of our method on an integrated set of measures while solving the problem of 'curse of dimensionality in KELM for large datasets.</description>

      <title>Anatomical basis of sex differences in the electrocardiogram identified by three-dimensional torso-heart imaging reconstruction pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is used for diagnosis and risk stratification following myocardial infarction (MI). Women have a higher incidence of missed MI diagnosis and complications following infarction, and to address this we aim to provide quantitative information on sex-differences in ECG and torso-ventricular anatomy features. A novel computational automated pipeline is presented enabling the three-dimensional reconstruction of torso-ventricular anatomies for 425 post-MI subjects and 1051 healthy controls from UK Biobank clinical images. Regression models were created relating torso-ventricular and ECG parameters. For post-MI women, the heart is positioned more posteriorly and vertically, than in men (with healthy women yet more vertical). Post-MI women exhibit less QRS prolongation, requiring 27% more prolongation than men to exceed 120ms. Only half of the sex difference in QRS is associated with smaller female cavities. Lower STj amplitude in women is striking, associated with smaller ventricles, but also more superior and posterior cardiac position. Post-MI, T wave amplitude and R axis deviations are strongly associated with a more posterior and horizontal cardiac position in women (but not in men). Our study highlights the need to quantify sex differences in anatomical features, their implications in ECG interpretation, and the application of clinical ECG thresholds in post-MI.</description>

      <title>EmoAgent: A Multi-Agent Framework for Diverse Affective Image Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11290v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affective Image Manipulation (AIM) aims to alter visual elements within an image to evoke specific emotional responses from viewers. However, existing AIM approaches rely on rigid \emph{one-to-one} mappings between emotions and visual cues, making them ill-suited for the inherently subjective and diverse ways in which humans perceive and express emotion.To address this, we introduce a novel task setting termed \emph{Diverse AIM (D-AIM)}, aiming to generate multiple visually distinct yet emotionally consistent image edits from a single source image and target emotion. We propose \emph{EmoAgent}, the first multi-agent framework tailored specifically for D-AIM. EmoAgent explicitly decomposes the manipulation process into three specialized phases executed by collaborative agents: a Planning Agent that generates diverse emotional editing strategies, an Editing Agent that precisely executes these strategies, and a Critic Agent that iteratively refines the results to ensure emotional accuracy. This collaborative design empowers EmoAgent to model \emph{one-to-many} emotion-to-visual mappings, enabling semantically diverse and emotionally faithful edits.Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that EmoAgent substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both emotional fidelity and semantic diversity, effectively generating multiple distinct visual edits that convey the same target emotion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anatomical trees are critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, yet their complex and diverse geometry make accurate representation a significant challenge. Motivated by the latest advances in large language models, we introduce an autoregressive method for synthesizing anatomical trees. Our approach first embeds vessel structures into a learned discrete vocabulary using a VQ-VAE architecture, then models their generation autoregressively with a GPT-2 model. This method effectively captures intricate geometries and branching patterns, enabling realistic vascular tree synthesis. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveal that our technique achieves high-fidelity tree reconstruction with compact discrete representations. Moreover, our B-spline representation of vessel cross-sections preserves critical morphological details that are often overlooked in previous' methods parameterizations. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to generate blood vessels in an autoregressive manner. Code is available at https://github.com/LIA-DiTella/VesselGPT-MICCAI.</description>

      <title>FARCLUSS: Fuzzy Adaptive Rebalancing and Contrastive Uncertainty Learning for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling, which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.</description>

      <title>Inference-Time Gaze Refinement for Micro-Expression Recognition: Enhancing Event-Based Eye Tracking with Motion-Aware Post-Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event-based eye tracking holds significant promise for fine-grained cognitive state inference, offering high temporal resolution and robustness to motion artifacts, critical features for decoding subtle mental states such as attention, confusion, or fatigue. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic, inference-time refinement framework designed to enhance the output of existing event-based gaze estimation models without modifying their architecture or requiring retraining. Our method comprises two key post-processing modules: (i) Motion-Aware Median Filtering, which suppresses blink-induced spikes while preserving natural gaze dynamics, and (ii) Optical Flow-Based Local Refinement, which aligns gaze predictions with cumulative event motion to reduce spatial jitter and temporal discontinuities. To complement traditional spatial accuracy metrics, we propose a novel Jitter Metric that captures the temporal smoothness of predicted gaze trajectories based on velocity regularity and local signal complexity. Together, these contributions significantly improve the consistency of event-based gaze signals, making them better suited for downstream tasks such as micro-expression analysis and mind-state decoding. Our results demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple baseline models on controlled datasets, laying the groundwork for future integration with multimodal affect recognition systems in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Model-Agnostic, Temperature-Informed Sampling Enhances Cross-Year Crop Mapping with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional benchmarks for crop type classification from optical satellite time series typically assume access to labeled data from the same year and rely on fixed calendar-day sampling. This limits generalization across seasons, where crop phenology shifts due to interannual climate variability, and precludes real-time application when current-year labels are unavailable. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification is often neglected, making such approaches unreliable for crop monitoring applications. Inspired by ecophysiological principles of plant growth, we propose a simple, model-agnostic sampling strategy that leverages growing degree days (GDD), based on daily average temperature, to replace calendar time with thermal time. By uniformly subsampling time series in this biologically meaningful domain, the method emphasizes phenologically active growth stages while reducing temporal redundancy and noise. We evaluate the method on a multi-year Sentinel-2 dataset spanning all of Switzerland, training on one growing season and testing on other seasons. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method delivers substantial gains in classification accuracy and, critically, produces more calibrated uncertainty estimates. Notably, our method excels in low-data regimes and enables significantly more accurate early-season classification. With only 10 percent of the training data, our method surpasses the state-of-the-art baseline in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation, and by the end of June, it achieves performance similar to a baseline trained on the full season. These results demonstrate that leveraging temperature data not only improves predictive performance across seasons but also enhances the robustness and trustworthiness of crop-type mapping in real-world applications.</description>
