      <title>Radial Integral Reformulation of the Gauss-Bonnet Weak Deflection Angle at Finite Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a radial integral reformulation of finite distance gravitational lensing in optical geometry for static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. Starting from the Gauss-Bonnet characterization of the finite distance deflection angle, we adopt the Li-type curvature primitive identity [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.101.124058] [2006.13047], which reduces the curvature-area contribution to a one-dimensional integral evaluated along the physical light ray. We then remove the remaining implicit orbit dependence by an explicit change of variables using the null first integrals, converting the Li line integral from $\phi$-integration to $r$-integration and splitting the trajectory at the turning point (closest approach). The resulting formula expresses the deflection angle as a sum of two radial integrals over $[r_0,r_S]$ and $[r_0,r_R]$ plus the finite distance angular bookkeeping term, with a transparent normalization/cancellation structure for the curvature primitive. In Schwarzschild gauge, we provide a weak-field evaluation toolkit that reduces the computation to reusable families of standard radial integrals and gives compact expressions for the endpoint incidence angles in the optical metric. Worked examples include Schwarzschild and Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) spacetimes and a black hole immersed in perfect-fluid dark matter with a finite halo. For the finite-halo model we derive closed-form leading weak-deflection expressions for mixed endpoint configurations (source/receiver inside or outside the halo), illustrating the modularity of the radial Gauss-Bonnet pipeline.</description>

      <title>Quasi-homogeneous geometrothermodynamics of a noncommutative Reissner-Nordstrom black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the thermodynamic properties of a noncommutative Reissner Nordstrom (NCRN) black hole (BH) modeled with Lorentzian distributions. The analysis is carried out using a Legendre invariant formalism called Geometrothermodynamics (GTD) which is applied to a quasihomogeneous system generated by the NCRN BH. This formalism enables the study of phase transitions by locating Ricci scalar singularities, from which the phase transition points are determined in terms of the thermodynamic variables. We also examine how the noncommutative (NC) parameter can be interpreted as a thermodynamic variable within quasi-homogeneous thermodynamic laws, highlighting its potential role on phase transitions beyond those well-known characterized by divergences in the heat capacity.</description>

      <title>Effective geometrodynamics for renormalization-group improved black-hole spacetimes in spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the spherically reduced Einstein-Hilbert action, Einstein field equations and Schwarzschild spacetime modified by a renormalization-group (RG) scale-dependent gravitational Newton coupling, and present a systematic and operational approach to such an RG-improvement. The master field equations for spherically symmetric gravitational fields, recently constructed from two-dimensional Horndeski theory, allow us to retain partial contributions from higher-curvature truncations of the effective action, while preserving the second-order nature of the resulting field equations. Static RG-improved black-hole spacetimes with an effective gravitational coupling depending on the areal radius and the Misner-Sharp mass are derived as vacuum solutions to these master field equations, and are thereby identified as solutions to generally covariant two-dimensional Horndeski theories. We discuss explicitly the embedding of previous key works on RG-improvement into the newly developed formalism to illustrate its broad range of applicability. This formalism moreover allows us to establish explicitly the discrepancies in the outcomes of RG-improvement when implemented at the level of the action, in the field equations, or in the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <title>Averaging Theory and Dynamical Systems in Cosmology: A Qualitative Study of Oscillatory Scalar-Field Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cosmological models using dynamical systems and averaging methods, encompassing flat and open FLRW geometries as well as the LRS Bianchi types I, III, and V. Under mild regularity and frequency-scaling assumptions, we obtain a near-identity conjugacy between the oscillatory flow and an averaged slow flow, with $\| \mathbf{x}(t)-\bar {\mathbf{x}}(t)\| =\mathcal{O}(H(t))$. The effective systems preserve the original asymptotics and yield geometry-dependent late-time attractor classifications. A corollary addresses the case in which the leading averaged vector field vanishes, so the system exhibits no autonomous drift at order $H^0$.</description>

      <title>Varying Newton constant, entropy and the black hole evaporation law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Einstein equations we represent the energy-momentum tensor as the one ($T^{\mu\nu}$ ) of an ideal fluid plus the cosmological term. We consider time-dependent Newton ``constant" $G$, the cosmological term $\Lambda$ and non-conserved $T^{\mu\nu}$. The Bianchi identity imposes a relation between the energy-momentum (non)conservation and the variation of $G$ and $\Lambda$. If the energy-momentum $T^{\mu\nu}$ is conserved then both the Newton ``constant" $G$ and the cosmological term $\Lambda $ either do not change or both must depend on time. If the energy-momentum $T^{\mu\nu}$ is not conserved then the Bianchi identity implies a relation between the energy-momentum and a variation in time of either $G$ or $\Lambda$ (or both). We apply thermodynamics in order to express the non-conservation of the energy-momentum of an ideal fluid by entropy and relate the time variations of $G$ and $\Lambda$ to a change of entropy. Using the relation between a varying Newton constant G and the black hole entropy we derive a modified formula for the Schwarzschild black hole evaporation (a slower evaporation). Its life time is $\frac{9}{5}$ times larger than the one for a constant $G$. The average black hole's density remains constant when the black hole's radius shrinks to zero .</description>

      <title>Dissipative Unimodular Gravity: Linking Energy Diffusion to Bulk Viscosity as an Alternative to $\Lambda$CDM under DESI DR2 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a theoretical and observational study of the presence of viscosity in the Unimodular Gravity formalism, a pioneering approach that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously explored in this context. Specifically, we study a flat FLRW universe at late times, where matter experiences dissipative processes in the form of a bulk viscosity, in the framework of Eckart's theory, which is linked to the energy diffusion function $Q$ through the power law $\xi=\xi_{0}\left|Q\right|^{1/2}$, being $\xi_{0}$ a positive dimensionless parameter. By assuming the ansatz $Q=\nu H^{2}$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $\nu$ is a dimensionless arbitrary constant, we find analytical solutions for the cosmological evolution. We test these models against the most recent cosmological observations, including type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic chronometers, gravitational lensing, and black hole shadow data. Our results show that two of the tested models provide a significantly better fit to the data ($\chi_{\text{min}}^{2}$) and remain as competitive as $\Lambda$CDM model according to the Bayesian Information Criterion. These findings, combined with the inherent ability of Unimodular Gravity to alleviate the cosmological constant problem, position dissipative UG as a robust and compelling alternative to the standard model, potentially suggesting that a very small but nontrivial energy nonconservation is compatible with the late-time observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Induced gravity, defined as a globally scale-invariant ``first-generation'' scalar-tensor theory, is investigated within the framework of the thermodynamics of modified gravity theories. The ``temperature of gravity'' and its evolution equation are derived for this model, and the resulting expressions are used to analyse General-Relativity equilibrium states and to investigate the possible existence of an attractor mechanism toward Einstein's theory with a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Nonsingular Rotating Black Holes in the Dark-Energy Dominated Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by quantum-gravity scenarios that replace the classical black hole singularity with a regular core, and by the possibility that the dark-energy sector may be scale dependent, we construct a broad class of nonsingular rotating black-hole spacetimes embedded in an improved de Sitter--like background with either constant or running $\Lambda$. Because the Newman--Janis algorithm is generically incompatible with a cosmological-constant fluid, we instead propose a generalized Kerr--Schild construction on a (possibly scale-dependent $\Lambda$) de Sitter seed, yielding a Carter-type metric characterized by a mass function and a $\Lambda$ function. Our construction provides a direct map from static, spherically symmetric regular models to their rotating counterparts. We derive sharp regularity conditions at the ring and we identify a minimal-order subclass. We analyze chronology and show that, for non-negative mass function and $\Lambda$ above a certain negative limit, the spacetimes are stably causal. For minimal-order geometries with non-negative mass, we prove that the weak energy condition must be violated. Finally, we illustrate the framework with an asymptotic-safety--inspired model and discuss horizon structure, surface gravities, and conformal diagrams. These results provide a controlled, observationally oriented arena to confront regular rotating black holes in dark-energy backgrounds with the rapidly improving gravitational-wave and horizon-scale imaging data.</description>

      <title>From Thermodynamic Criticality to Geometric Criticality: A Linear Kernel Map from Matter Susceptibilities to Black-Hole Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an explicit linear map from compact, conserved thermodynamic/effective-medium perturbations of the stress-energy tensor to the metric response in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, and from there to geometric observables of direct relevance to horizon-scale imaging: the shadow radius and photon-sphere frequency. The response is expressed through $L^{1}$-bounded kernels written in a piecewise "local $+$ tail" form, which makes transparent the separation between near-photon-sphere sensitivity and far-zone contributions (including AdS tails). Under mild assumptions on the matter susceptibilities near a critical point, dominated convergence transfers the thermodynamic exponent to the geometric susceptibility, $\gamma_{\rm sh}=\gamma_{\rm th}$, with controlled analytic corrections. We further provide AdS far-zone bounds with explicit outside-support constants depending only on background geometric data at the photon sphere and shell geometry. A reproducible numerical pipeline with convergence diagnostics is presented and benchmarked.</description>

      <title>The neutrino behavior in the Einstein$\text{-}$Hilbert$\text{-}$Bumblebee gravity around global monopole field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the phase of neutrino oscillation propagating along radial and non-radial paths in the Einstein$\text{-}$Hilbert$\text{-}$Bumblebee (EHB) gravity around global monopole field, by using the quantummechanical treatment, the expression of the corrected neutrino of probability of oscillation is obtained. Our results show that neutrino oscillation in the EHB gravity around global monopole field is different from that in Schwarzschild black hole, the Lorentz-violating parameter $a$ mainly affects the peak of the oscillation probability, and the global monopole $\overline { \mu }$ and the lightest neutrino mass both affect the frequency of the oscillations of probabilities, which means that studying the neutrino oscillation phenomenon in curved spacetime may not only become a new technology for probing the properties of compact celestial bodies, but also help deepen our understanding of neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Three dimensional black bounces in $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of black bounce solutions in $2+1$ dimensions within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. We analyze whether black bounce geometries originally obtained in general relativity can be consistently generalized to $f(R)$ theories and identify the matter sources capable of supporting such solutions. We also construct a new class of solutions by imposing a vanishing curvature scalar. In the matter sector, we consider models involving a coupling between a scalar field and nonlinear electrodynamics, while in the gravitational sector we analyze both the Starobinsky model and more general forms of $f(R)$. We further examine the viability conditions of the $f(R)$ models that give rise to these spacetimes, including the behavior of the scalaron mass. Finally, we study the associated energy conditions, in order to assess the degree of exoticity of the matter content required to sustain these black bounce solutions and how the $f(R)$ theory modifies the energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Generation of gravitating solutions with Baryonic charge from Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish, for the first time, an exact correspondence between Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theory and gauged Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein models in (3+1) dimensions. By constructing the simplest consistent ansatz within the gauged Skyrme-Maxwell framework, we reveal a remarkable equivalence in a sector that admits nonvanishing, highly magnetized baryonic charge. This correspondence has a particularly appealing consequence: it transfers the full power of solution-generating techniques developed for electrovacuum systems-many of which naturally accommodate scalar fields to the considerably more intricate setting of gauged Skyrme-Maxwell theory minimally coupled to General Relativity. As a result, it opens the door to a systematic and much broader exploration of exact solutions in Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein theory and of their potential applications in cosmology and astrophysics. Notably, the resulting configurations carry nonzero baryonic charge whenever the derivative of the hadronic profile along the magnetic field lines does not vanish. As an illustrative example, we apply this new dictionary to a rotating Kerr-Newman-like spacetime dressed with a scalar field. In the corresponding Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein solution, the quantization of the baryonic charge enforces a quantization of the Kerr rotation parameter. We derive an upper bound on the baryonic charge in terms of the integration constants of the solution and show that, in the regime of small baryonic charge, the rotation parameter depends linearly on the baryonic charge.</description>

      <title>Stability-Protected Phantom Bound in Scalar-Field Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent cosmological observations, most notably from the DESI Data Release 2 (DR2) \cite{DESIDR2}, suggest a potential redshift evolution of the dark energy equation of state, reviving fundamental questions regarding the physical viability of the phantom regime ($w &lt; -1$). In this Letter, a no-go result is established for a broad class of single-field effective scalar cosmologies where the kinetic response is modulated by the Hubble expansion rate, a structural feature characteristic of infrared-modified and nonlocal gravity theories \cite{DeserWoodard2007, Maggiore2014}. It is proved that imposing ghost freedom, defined by the positivity of the kinetic response function $\mathcal{M} \equiv \partial\rho/\partial X &gt; 0$, enforces the phantom divide ($w = -1$) as a \textit{stability-protected boundary} in the cosmological phase space. While the equation of state can approach this limit arbitrarily closely, continuous ghost-free evolution into the phantom regime is shown to be strictly forbidden. The dynamics are found to converge toward a de~Sitter-like attractor where $w \to -1$ emerges as a consequence of dynamical selection and stability rather than the fine-tuning of the scalar potential. These results suggest that the "hints" of evolution observed in DESI DR2 may reflect the underlying stability requirements of the effective field theory, providing a theoretical mechanism that prevents a physical transition into the phantom phase.</description>

      <title>The Hamiltonian for an atom interacting with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the relativistic Hamiltonian of Sonnleitner and Barnett arXiv:1806.00234 and its post-Newtonian extensions by Schwartz and Giuilini arXiv:1908.06929, we investigate composite atomic systems in dynamical gravitational backgrounds. Using a local inertial frame and a perturbed Minkowski metric, we derive curvature-dependent corrections to both center-of-mass and internal Hamiltonians for atoms interacting with weak gravitational waves. The resulting Hamiltonian contains distinct curvature couplings modifying the internal potential and affecting the center-of-mass dynamics. These contributions imply that internal-energy variations do not always reduce to mass renormalization and can induce genuine forces due to changes in momentum. The initial research was motivated by anomalous friction-like forces emerging in quantum optics, and clarified that the anomalous forces are mere relativistic corrections from mass-energy equivalence. Our results suggest that, with increasingly sensitive detectors, additional forces from gravitational wave interactions may become visible in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Telling tails and quasi-resonances in the vicinity of Dymnikova regular black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quasinormal modes, late-time tails, and grey-body factors for massive scalar perturbations in the background of the Dymnikova regular black hole. By applying both the time-domain integration and the WKB method with Pad\'e improvements, we show that the spectrum of massive fields differs qualitatively from the massless case. The oscillation frequency of the dominant mode grows with the field mass $\mu$, while the damping rate decreases, suggesting the existence of quasi-resonances at sufficiently large $\mu$. In the time domain, the late-time signal exhibits oscillatory tails with a power-law envelope, whose decay rate matches analytic expectations. Grey-body factors are also computed, showing strong suppression of radiation when mass is increased. Taken together, these results indicate that massive fields provide distinctive signatures of regular black holes and may serve as probes of near-horizon quantum corrections in the Dymnikova geometry.</description>

      <title>QPO-Based Bayesian Constraints on Charged Particle Dynamics Around Magnetized Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the motion of charged particles with a magnetic dipole moment orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an external paraboloidal magnetic field. The interaction between the particle's intrinsic magnetic moment and the black hole magnetosphere is modeled through a dipole coupling, and the equations of motion are derived using the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. We analyze equatorial circular orbits, the innermost stable circular orbit, and epicyclic oscillations, showing that the magnetic field strength and coupling parameter produce competing effects on orbital stability and fundamental frequencies. These frequencies are applied to model high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations within the relativistic precession framework. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black holes, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. The analysis constrains the black hole mass, magnetic field strength, field geometry, coupling parameter, and QPO orbital radius, highlighting the role of magnetospheric interactions in shaping both particle dynamics and timing properties of accreting black holes.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Compactness Gap and Fermionic Compact Dark Matter in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the gap in the compactness between black holes and neutron stars witnessed in general relativity may be vanishing in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity. Assuming a fermion equation-of-state for simplicity, and solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation within the HL gravity framework, we see that there exists a minimum fermion mass $m_f^\text{(min)}(q,y)$, above which the gap of the compactness between black hole and fermionic compact object vanishes, for a given deformation parameter $q$ of HL and interaction strength $y$ between fermions. Thus, in HL gravity, the mass and radius of an object found in the lower mass gap by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observations might not be able to classify it as a black hole or a neutron star. It is interesting to note that a fermion of mass $\sim 40\ \text{GeV}$ can form a highly compact object of mass $\sim 10^{-4}\ \msun$ and radius $\sim 1\ \text{m}$ that may play the role of the cold dark matter. In addition, we find the possible existence of another class of compact objects whose compactness is comparable to that of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Static stable timelike circular orbits and Aschenbach effect in horizonless solutions of Einstein cubic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the spacetime of horizonless compact objects described by Einsteinian cubic gravity (ECG), we demonstrate the existence of static stable timelike circular orbits on which massive particles remain at rest relative to distant observers. These static orbits are further identified as the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) in this spacetime. If such static orbits form part of an accretion disk, they would give rise to a ring-like structure that is unaffected by Doppler shifts. Moreover, the Aschenbach effect is shown to be present: the orbital velocity of particles on timelike circular orbits, as measured by a zero angular momentum observer (ZAMO), displays a non-monotonic dependence on the radial coordinate. Additionally, the regions supporting stable circular orbits can be discontinuous, and particles on stable orbits near the center can possess specific energies greater than one ($E &gt; 1$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static, spherically symmetric black holes immersed in a dark matter halo with a Hernquist-type density profile have been derived by Cardoso et. al. in Ref. \redcite{Cardoso:2021wlq}. Using the Newman-Janis algorithm, we construct the metric for a stationary and axially symmetric rotating black hole in this environment. Then, we obtain the electromagnetic properties of thin accretion disks around such rotating black holes by utilizing the steady-state Novikov-Thorne model, and study the effects of spin parameter and halo compactness parameter on the disk properties. Finally, by comparison the results of the rotating Cardoso black hole with that of Kerr black hole in the absence of dark matter, we find that the presence of dark matter can not significantly affect the disk properties and thus for astrophysical black holes with large spin parameter, the distinction of rotating Cardoso black holes becomes more difficult than the Kerr black hole.</description>

      <title>Critical collapse of a massive scalar field in semi-classical loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate critical phenomena during the gravitational collapse of a massive scalar field under two distinct semi-classical loop quantum gravity (LQG) approaches within spherical symmetry. Numerical simulations reveal that the massive scalar field in both semi-classical frameworks exhibits two distinct types of critical behavior, consistent with the classical scenario. When the scalar field's mass parameter is small, type II critical phenomena emerge, with the resulting echoing periods and critical exponents precisely matching those obtained in general relativity. In contrast, a large mass parameter triggers type I critical phenomena, where the resulting black holes possess a finite minimum mass. These findings suggest that semi-classical corrections from LQG have a negligible impact on the dynamics of critical collapse.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of junction conditions for gluing different $f(R)$ gravitational theories across a non-null hypersurface. Using the variational approach, we systematically derive the junction conditions for both general $f(R)$ theories and the special case of Einstein gravity, for comparison. We demonstrate that when joining two distinct $f(R)$ theories, the junction conditions require continuity of $\partial f(R)/\partial R$, the extrinsic curvature $K_{\mu \nu}$, while allowing for discontinuities in the Ricci Scalar $R$. Furthermore, we establish the equivalence between Jordan and Einstein frame formulations through careful treatment of conformal transformations; Our results reveal that different $f(R)$ theories can be consistently matched provided specific relations between their functional forms and geometric quantities are satisfied at the interface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general semi-tetrad covariant approach is adopted to analyse the structure scalars of a Type II fluid in generalized Vaidya spacetime. The relationship between the $1+1+2$ covariant quantities and the structure scalars are obtained. We calculate the complexity factor in terms of the Misner-Sharp mass and the matter variables to obtain a non-trivial class of spacetimes with vanishing complexity. Also the Vaidya spacetime with pure Type II matter field has negative complexity. The differences between the complexity of Type I and Type II matter fields are highlighted. We compute the propagation and evolution equations of the structure scalars, showcasing their interdependency through the kinematical variables. The causal wave equation of the Gaussian curvature of the 2-shell and its dependence on the structure scalars are also studied.</description>

      <title>Physical Features of Geometrically Deformed Anisotropic Charged Three-dimensional BTZ Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work employs the minimal geometric deformation decoupling scheme to derive interior stellar solutions in the background of an electrically charged BTZ ansatz as a seed metric in three dimensions. In this respect, we impose two different equations of state to determine the deformation function and the new material contributions emerging from the additional field source. Furthermore, we describe the finiteness of all thermodynamic quantities of the presented stellar solutions, including the effective thermodynamical quantities, for varying values of the deformation parameter and total electric charge. We explore the new interior astrophysical solutions in three-dimensional gravity by analyzing the charged BTZ metric, admitting circular symmetry through the principles of geometric deformation. This study examines the impact of radial-metric deformation on the charged BTZ geometry and underscores the importance of stellar decoupling within the context of electrically charged dense distributions. It is shown that new physically acceptable solutions by incorporating any known three-dimensional spacetime as the isotropic basis are possible, which in turn enable one to analyze the quantum effects due to low degrees of freedom at lower dimensions.</description>

      <title>Assessing astrophysical foreground subtraction in DECIGO using compact binary populations inferred from the first part of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's fourth observation run</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from our Universe under the inflationary era is one of the primary scientific objectives of DECIGO, a space-borne gravitational wave detector sensitive in the 0.1 Hz frequency band. This frequency band is dominated by the gravitational waves from inspiraling compact object binaries. Subtracting these signals is necessary to search for the primordial SGWB. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of the subtraction of such binary signals by employing the population model inferred from the latest gravitational wave event catalogue of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We find that the projection scheme, which was originally proposed by Cutler &amp; Harms (2005), is necessary to reduce the binary signals to the level where DECIGO can detect the primordial background.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed Shannon entropy as a chaos indicator for non-integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel chaos indicator -- time-reversed Shannon entropy (TRSE) -- that leverages the interplay between time-reversal symmetry breaking and information entropy in curved spacetimes. By quantifying statistical discrepancies between forward and backward temporal evolution of particle orbits, TRSE robustly distinguishes chaotic from regular dynamics in non-integrable systems. In contrast, integrable systems exhibit stable, symmetric probability distributions preserved by conserved quantities such as the Carter constant. We validate the method through high-precision numerical simulations in both Kerr and Schwarzschild-Melvin black hole geometries, evolving trajectories forward and backward in time. Furthermore, we refine our previously introduced particle-pair mutual information (MIPP) and perform comprehensive parameter-space scans, revealing a strong quantitative agreement between MIPP and TRSE. The two indicators emerge as complementary probes of chaos: TRSE captures symmetry breaking in orbital evolution, while MIPP measures statistical correlations. Together, they establish a unified framework for diagnosing chaos in general relativistic systems, paving a new path to understand the fundamental nature of chaos in non-integrable systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employ dynamical systems methods to analyse the large-scale structure by considering two distinct interaction models (linear and non-linear) within the dark sector, associated with a specific dynamical dark energy model inspired by the Veneziano ghost theory in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In these models, the dark energy density ($\rho_{DE}$) varies with the Hubble parameter ($H$), expressed as $\rho_{DE} = \alpha H + \beta H^2$. After defining the dimensionless parameters, we present autonomous equations that allow us to find the trace $\text{Tr}(J)$ and the determinant $D(J)$. With these solutions, we demonstrate the presence of unstable, saddle, and stable fixed points, corresponding to the radiation-, matter-, and dark-energy-dominated eras, respectively. Our results suggest that these models are theoretically viable for representing the interaction between dark sector fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational $e^-+e^+\to\ell^-+\ell^+$ scattering process within the framework of gravitoelectromagnetism, a weak-field approximation of gravity analogous to Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. This process involves the interaction between a fermion and an antifermion mediated by graviton exchange. We consider the nonminimal gravitational sector of the standard model extension and calculate the corrections to the scattering cross section arising from Lorentz violation. The analysis is carried out in two scenarios: (i) at zero temperature and (ii) at finite temperature. To incorporate thermal effects, we employ the thermo field dynamics formalism, which allows for a consistent treatment of quantum fields at finite temperature. The results provide insights into how Lorentz-violating and thermal corrections influence gravitational interactions, particularly relevant in high-energy or astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors of Schwarzschild--Tangherlini black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the correspondence between the quasinormal modes and grey-body factors of Schwarzschild--Tangherlini black holes. The gravitational perturbations in higher-dimensional black holes can be classified into scalar, vector, and tensor types. Considering the dimension-dependent forms of their effective potentials, the correspondence was examined for each dimension and perturbation mode. The accurate quasinormal modes were computed by suitably adopting the continued fraction and integration-through-midpoints methods, depending on the structure of the singularity. The grey-body factor can be obtained through its correspondence with the quasinormal mode, and its accuracy was analyzed by calculating its difference from the numerically computed grey-body factor. The correspondence failed for $l=2$ scalar gravitational perturbations in $D\ge7$ because the form of the potential is markedly different from that in four dimensions. The vector and tensor perturbation types exhibited good correspondence accuracies in all cases. The breakdown of the correspondence was rigorously demonstrated to stem from multiple potential barriers, and its applicability to each mode in higher dimensions was assessed.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravitational stellar evolution beyond shell-crossing singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of effective stellar collapse inspired by loop quantum gravity predict a bounce when the stellar energy density reaches the Planck scale, typically followed by the formation of shell-crossing singularities. This work aims to extend the spacetime beyond these singularities by employing a Hamiltonian formulation of the Darmois-Israel junction conditions, treating the singularity as a non-isolated thin dust shell. By construction, the shell's motion remains timelike throughout the entire evolution, regardless of the amount of initial stellar mass, and the induced metric on the shell remains continuous. The resulting stellar evolution produces an inter-universal wormhole, analogous to the simpler Oppenheimer-Snyder scenario. The proposed approach provides a general framework for any effective (or classical) theory of stellar collapse characterized by shell-crossing singularities.</description>

      <title>Novikov Coordinates and the Physical Description of Gravitational Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Novikov coordinates can be obtained in a direct and physically transparent way from the radial geodesics of massive particles with negative energy in the Schwarzschild spacetime. These geodesics form a complete congruence that covers the entire spacetime. By rectifying this family of trajectories using the proper time as the time coordinate, the Novikov variables naturally emerge, providing a clear dynamical interpretation of the different regions usually identified as black-hole and white-hole sectors.
  In Novikov coordinates, observers at fixed spatial position follow free-fall trajectories. From their perspective, the gravitational collapse of a dust star is completed in a finite proper time, independently of their initial distance from the star. In contrast, observers described by Schwarzschild-Droste coordinates perceive the boundary of the collapsing star as taking an infinite coordinate time to reach the horizon.
  We emphasize that Schwarzschild-Droste observers are static with respect to the center of mass of the star and therefore cannot be in free fall. The use of these coordinates implicitly requires the presence of a force that compensates the gravitational attraction. From this viewpoint, the apparent infinite-time collapse is not a physical effect but a coordinate artifact associated with non-inertial observers.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on f(T,B) Gravity from Observations of Early and Late Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified framework that combines early- and late-Universe observations to constrain three functional realizations of f(T,B) gravity: the linear, quadratic, and general power-law models. First, constraints on deviations from the standard weak interaction freeze-out temperature are derived using the most recent measurements of the primordial helium-4 mass fraction. Second, we perform a joint analysis incorporating five priors: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic chronometers, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, and Cosmic Microwave Background in order to place bounds on the model parameters. The joint likelihood analysis significantly tightens the constraints compared to individual datasets. Third, we test the null, strong, and dominant energy conditions to evaluate the physical viability of the best-fit solutions across the cosmic redshift range. Our results show that all three f(T,B) models are consistent with current observations and exhibit stable behavior under the energy-condition criteria, supporting torsion-boundary modified gravity as a robust and viable alternative to General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Towards gravitational wave parameter inference for binaries with an eccentric companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a complete model for dephasing due to line-of-sight acceleration (LOSA) in gravitational wave (GW) signals from stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) in three-body systems. Our prescription provides curvature- and projection-dependent phase features that are not recovered by local-expansion-based treatments. We perform parameter-space surveys and mock parameter inferences assuming the nominal sensitivity of the Einstein Telescope (ET) to identify the regime where the time-varying LOSA allows for separate constraints on the outer orbital parameters, in particular the tertiary mass and distance. We estimate that ET may detect a few to tens of such systems per year, provided that all binaries merge dynamically, and demonstrate that these constraints can be used to directly discriminate between a dynamical and AGN origin for BBHs. Finally, we reanalyse the GW190814 event and four O4a events finding no evidence for LOSA, with the previously claimed LOSA in GW190814 disappearing when a sufficiently long data segment is used.</description>

      <title>Constraining nonminimal f(T) gravity from Primordial Nucleosynthesis to Late-Universe observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-epoch test of f(T) gravity with nonminimal torsion-matter coupling, combining early- and late-Universe observations. At the MeV scale, Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis constrains the fractional variation of the weak freeze-out temperature, |{\delta}{\tau}_f/{\tau}_f|, thereby mapping light-element abundances into limits on deviations from the standard expansion history. At low redshift, we confront the model with type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic-chronometer data, which respectively probe distances, the late-time standard ruler, and the Hubble rate. Independent analyses highlight the complementary roles of each dataset, while a joint SNe Ia + BAO + CC fit breaks degeneracies and yields the tightest combined bounds. As an illustration, we examine two representative torsion-modified gravity scenarios: BBN strongly limits large departures from standard cosmology, whereas late-time probes remain compatible with a near-{\Lambda}CDM background. This unified approach demonstrates the power of linking early-Universe nuclear physics with precision cosmological observables in assessing torsional extensions of gravity.</description>

      <title>A Space-Time Fluid (Unabridged)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This essay is a retelling of general relativity in a language in which space-time geometry is expressed as a fluid. This trivial and useful reformulation gives 1) a non-perturbative covariant description of cosmological inhomogeneities and 2) a simple formula describing how cosmic inhomogeneities are generated on super-horizon scales.
  Methods: Equating the Ricci curvature with the associated matter stress-energy gives a description of space-time geometry in terms of fluid properties. These locally measurable (covariant) non-perturbative quantities are in some ways superior to commonly used "gauge invariant" quantities. The dynamics of a quantity (kurvature) which describes cosmological inhomogeneities is described in detail. A detailed comparison is made of space-time fluid dynamics with that of a classical (Newtonian physics) fluid.
  Results: The fluid lexicon permits an unambiguous definition of the velocity of space-time. The evolution of the space-time fluid is in many ways identical with that of the classical fluid when expressed in Lagrangian coordinates. Kurvature is a measure of the specific binding energy of the fluid and is a most useful covariant measure of cosmological inhomogeneities. For plausible matter models kurvature will increase, even on super-horizon scales, due to non-linear hydrodynamic effects rather than gravity. This phenomena is also exhibited by classical fluids.
  Conclusion: The space-time fluid representation of geometrodynamics gives a simple and useful description of the evolution of cosmological inhomogeneities.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Characteristics of a Fermi Gas with an Invariant Energy Scale and its Astrophysical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of a relativistic Fermi gas governed by a modified dispersion relation in the Magueijo Smolin (MS) formulation of Doubly Special Relativity (DSR), characterized by the presence of an invariant ultraviolet energy (deformation) scale. We study the system in two physically distinct regimes: the near degenerate low temperature limit, and the high temperature regime. In the low temperature regime, we derive the thermodynamic quantities using the standard Sommerfeld expansion. In the high temperature regime, we evaluate all thermodynamic quantities numerically from the exact grand canonical potential and demonstrate that the thermodynamics of the Fermi gas reduces to the standard relativistic ideal gas behavior. We apply the resulting low temperature equation of state to study compact astrophysical objects, namely, non rotating white dwarfs and neutron stars. Helium white dwarfs exhibit a strong dependence on the deformation scale, while white dwarfs composed of heavier elements are less affected. For neutron stars, the modified equation of state leads to configurations that are smaller in radius and lower in mass than is by nucleonic equations of state. Our results highlight how modified relativity theories can be probed by studying astrophysical objects.</description>

Abstract: In this article we give general neccessary and sufficient conditions to ensure that a pseudo-Riemannian manifold is conformal to an Einstein space. These conditions are algorithmic in \emph{the metric tensor} whenever the Weyl endomorphism is invertible. Our conditions depend in an essential manner on the $\mathcal{C}$-connection. We also show how to construct \emph{conformally covariant, pseudo-differential} operators which has an independent interest.</description>

      <title>Euler-Poincar\'e Formulation of Barotropic Fluids Coupled with ADM Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a geometric mechanics framework for the reduction of general relativistic hydrodynamic variational principles, from the variation of worldlines approach in 4D spacetime to 3-dimensional Eulerian descriptions. We consider a self-gravitating, barotropic fluid and obtain the Euler-Poincar\'e equations of the system by Lagrangian reduction. Using the decomposition of general relativity into 3 + 1 dimensions, with a direction of time defined, the gauge invariance of the action over spacetime diffeomorphisms permits a 3-dimensional description of the fluid diffeomorphism by gauge fixing. The configuration space thus mirrors the Newtonian case, and by employing the Euler-Poincar\'e theorem, we derive the Eulerian equations of motion, in the same form as the PDEs from Newtonian fluid dynamics. The equations of motion are then derived, where the fluid variables are measured in a separate frame of reference from the variables involving gravity. Furthermore, the general relativistic barotropic fluid exhibits a Kelvin-Noether circulation conservation, which we derive in both the inertial and moving frames of reference. Finally, potential applications to Numerical Relativity are discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Relativistic Core Collapse of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos -- Limits On Seed Black Hole Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts pose challenges to standard seeding mechanisms. Among competing models, the collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos provide a plausible explanation for early SMBH formation. While previous studies on modeling the gravothermal collapse of SIDM halos have primarily focused on non-relativistic evolution under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, We advance this framework by relaxing the equilibrium assumption and additionally incorporating general-relativistic effects. To this end, we introduce the Misner-Sharp formalism to the SIDM context for the first time. Our model reproduces the standard hydrostatic models in the early long-mean-free-path (LMFP) regime, but displays interesting distinct behavior in the late short-mean-free-path (SMFP) regime, where intense outward heat flux drives a rapid expansion of the outer envelope, removing mass from the core and significantly decelerating the collapse. Our general relativistic treatment enables us to follow halo evolution to the final stage when the apparent horizon forms. Our simulation yields a seed black hole mass of approximately $3\times10^{-8}$ of the halo mass at horizon formation, suggesting that additional mechanisms such as baryonic effects are critical for seeding black holes that are sufficiently massive to account for SMBHs in the early Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove infinitesimal rigidity and integrability of the moduli space for Hermitian gravitational instantons. Together with the recent proof by Biquard, Gauduchon, and LeBrun of local rigidity for Hermitian instantons, this completes the picture of the moduli space of Hermitian gravitational instantons, both for the compact and non-compact cases.
  An important step in the proof is to show that provided certain boundary conditions hold, a curve of Riemannian metrics passing through a Hermitian non-K\"ahler Einstein metric is conformally K\"ahler to second perturbative order. This uses ideas of Wu and LeBrun.</description>

Abstract: We study the power spectral density of time delay fluctuations in an interferometer as a potential low-energy quantum gravitational observable. We derive a general expression for the spectrum in terms of the Wightman function of linear metric perturbations, which we then apply to a variety of cases. We analyze the intrinsic graviton fluctuations in the vacuum, thermal, and squeezed states, as well as the fluctuations induced by the vacuum stress-energy of a massless scalar field. We find that the resulting spectra are free of ultraviolet divergences and that, while thermal and squeezed states provide a natural amplification mechanism, the spectra remain suppressed by the Planck scale.</description>

Abstract: We present a first-principles, non-perturbative worldline instanton analysis of vacuum decay in the non-abelian Yang-Mills root of a Schwarzschild background. We recover the gauge theory color-thermal spectrum as a topological winding mode. The double copy maps vacuum response from the gauge theory directly to the gravity theory. Furthermore, the decay exponent acquires a universal quadratic correction from color charge conservation, showing that the double copy correctly captures the non-linear backreaction as required for unitarity.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realization of Optimized Ternary Mirror Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the first experimental realization of multi-material dielectric mirror coatings designed through a multi-objective optimization algorithm to simultaneously minimize thermal noise and optical losses. We validate this design strategy by fabricating and characterizing two distinct ternary systems: a SiNx -based proof-of-concept and a Ti:GeO2 -based system targeting lower optical losses. The performance of the SiN x coating shows remarkable agreement with predictions, demonstrating a noise amplitude spectral density reduction of 0.82 with respect to current reference coatings, and validating our design-to-fabrication pipeline. The Ti:GeO2 -based system achieves the crucial goal of sub-ppm absorption; its measured thermal noise, however, is higher than the theoretically predicted level of 0.71, extrapolated from single-layer material characterization. A dedicated tolerance analysis confirms that this discrepancy is not attributable to random thickness errors, emphasizing that further studies of the manufacturing process are needed to fully exploit this combination of materials. This work establishes a robust methodology for producing complex, high-performance optical coatings tailored for precision experiments.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension as an Effect of Horizon Entanglement Nonequilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an infrared mechanism for alleviating the Hubble constant tension, based on a small departure from entanglement equilibrium at the cosmological apparent horizon. If the horizon entanglement entropy falls slightly below the Bekenstein-Hawking value, we parametrize the shortfall by a fractional deficit $\delta(a)$ evolving with the FLRW scale factor $a$. The associated equipartition deficit at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature then sources a smooth, homogeneous component whose density scales as $H^{2}/G$, with a dimensionless coefficient $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ of order unity times $\delta(a)$. Because this component tracks $H^{2}$, it is negligible at early times but can activate at redshifts $z\lesssim 1$, raising the late time expansion rate by a few percent without affecting recombination or the sound horizon. We present a minimal three parameter activation model for $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ and derive its impact on the background expansion, effective equation of state, and linear growth for a smooth entanglement sector. The framework predicts a small boost in $H(z)$, a mild suppression of $f\sigma_{8}(z)$, and a corresponding modification of the low-$z$ distance-redshift relation. We test these predictions against current low-redshift data sets, including SN~Ia distance moduli, baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements, cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and redshift space distortion constraints, and discuss whether the $H_0$ tension can be consistently interpreted as a late-time, horizon-scale information deficit rather than an early universe modification.</description>

      <title>EFT Perspective On de-Sitter S-Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-perturbative limitations on low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) based on the characteristics of high-energy theory are provided by the analyticity of the flat-space version of the S-matrix. Although the analyticity of the flat-space S-matrix is widely established, it is difficult to apply this framework to de Sitter space because the growing backdrop breaks time-translation symmetry and makes it more difficult to define asymptotic states. The flat-space analyticity imprint on the de Sitter S-matrix is examined in this study. On a certain limit, we derive a comprehensive relationship between the flat-space amplitude and the de Sitter S-matrix. In particular, we demonstrate that the relationship is valid for tree-level amplitude exchanging with arbitrary local derivative interactions with a large scalar field. Next, we contend that this specific limit is more consistent with the definition of EFT since, similar to flat space, the Mandelstam variable may be identified as the unique energy scale because the total energy dependence of the de Sitter S-matrix becomes negligible. Finally, we also find an unexpected connection between the idea of generalized energy conservation of an S-matrix of four-dimensional de Sitter and exceptional EFTs in de Sitter space. We restrict the coupling constants in theories of self-interacting scalars dwelling in the exceptional series of de Sitter representations by requiring that such an S-matrix only has support when the total energies of in and out states are equal. We rediscover the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) and Special Galileon theories, in which a single coupling constant uniquely fixes the four-point scalar self-interactions.</description>

      <title>Holographic timelike entanglement and subregion complexity with scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the holographic timelike entanglement entropy (HTEE) and timelike subregion complexity of a thermal CFT$_d$ deformed by a relevant scalar operator $\phi_0$, dual to a hairy black hole in AdS$_{d+1}$. We employ the prescription of merging spacelike and timelike surfaces at the interior, constructing an extremal surface homologous to a boundary timelike subsystem with a time interval $\Delta t$. Consequently, this deformation breaks the invariance of the imaginary component of HTEE observed in pure AdS$_3$ and BTZ geometry, introducing a nontrivial dependence on $\Delta t$. At small $\Delta t$, we derive analytical expressions that are in agreement with numerical results, and observe partial consistency with analytic continuation to temporal or spacelike entanglement entropy at the level of the near-boundary expansion. However, analytic continuation of CFT temporal entanglement entropy fails to reproduce the HTEE calculations under boundary deformation, even in $d=2$. Furthermore, we extend the numerical calculations to higher dimensions ($d=3$). In addition, we study holographic timelike subregion complexity within the complexity=volume conjecture and find that it remains real-valued, providing a complementary geometric probe of the black hole interior. In particular, for the BTZ black hole, we analytically show that the UV-finite term of the subregion complexity receives its entire contribution from the interior region alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter introduces the fundamental principles of gravitational wave detectors in a simple and comprehensive manner. Because these instruments aim for extremely high sensitivity, it is essential to understand their various noise sources, how such noise couples to the detector output, and the strategies used to mitigate them. These noises contributions are computed in the frame of the Virgo detector and a sensitivity curve is calculated. Although a simplified layout of a gravitational wave detector is considered, it takes into account the most dominant effects and yields in a sensitivity estimate close to the what is observed in real detectors.</description>

      <title>Impact of Rastall gravity on hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are the largest virialized structures in the Universe and are predominantly dominated by dark matter. The hydrostatic mass and the mass obtained from gravitational lensing measurements generally differ, a discrepancy known as the hydrostatic mass bias. In this work, we derive the hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters within the framework of Rastall gravity and investigate its implications under two scenarios: (i) the absence of dark matter and (ii) the existence of dark matter. In the first scenario, Rastall gravity effectively reduces the hydrostatic mass, bringing it closer to the observed baryonic mass. The best linear fit yields a slope $\mathbf{M}=1.07\pm0.11$, indicating a near one-to-one correspondence between the two masses. In the second scenario, Rastall gravity helps to alleviate the hydrostatic mass bias. The linear fit between the Rastall hydrostatic mass and the observed lensing mass results in a best-fit slope $\mathbf{M}=1.01\pm0.16$, which is very close to unity. These results suggest that Rastall gravity provides a statistically favorable framework for addressing mass discrepancies in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Ultra-fast growth of primordial black holes through radiative absorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Schwarzschild primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the radiation-dominated era can grow extremely rapidly through $\textit{radiative absorption}$ governed by the full Stefan-Boltzmann law. By introducing a principle of isonomy - ensuring identical particle species dependence for Hawking emission and absorption - we find that, whenever the temperature of the PBH environment is larger than the PBH horizon temperature, PBHs generically gain mass. In particular, for PBH masses following the critical collapse mass-scaling law with critical exponent $\gamma_\mathrm{crit}$, with $\gamma_\mathrm{crit} \in (0.33, 0.49)$, the aforementioned radiative absorption mass growth mechanism produces a striking effect: PBHs forming with a mass $10^6M_\odot$ during BBN can reach $\mathcal{O}(10^{10} M_\odot)$ within $\mathcal{O}(10^{6} \mathrm{s})$ ($\sim $ 58 days). Interestingly enough, small deviations from $\gamma_\mathrm{crit}$, depending itself on the number of relativistic species present in the primordial plasma, yield a continuous PBH mass spectrum providing us ultimately with a single, Standard-Model-based explanation for the origin of stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black holes (SMBHs), and naturally accounting for the early appearance of SMBHs. The Schwarzschild treatment presented here can be extended to spherically symmetric cosmological black holes, indicating that radiative absorption is a dominant and previously overlooked PBH growth channel in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Modified General Relativity and dark matter</title>

Abstract: Modified General Relativity (MGR) is the natural extension of General Relativity (GR). MGR explicitly uses the smooth regular line element vector field $(\bm{X},-\bm{X}) $, which exists in all Lorentzian spacetimes, to construct a connection-independent symmetric tensor that represents the energy-momentum of the gravitational field. It solves the problem of the non-localization of gravitational energy-momentum in GR, preserves the ontology of the Einstein equation, and maintains the equivalence principle. The line element field provides MGR with the extra freedom required to describe dark energy and dark matter. An extended Schwarzschild solution for the matter-free Einstein equation of MGR is developed, from which the Tully-Fisher relation is derived, and the gravitational energy density is calculated. The mass of the invisible matter halo of galaxy NGC 3198 calculated with MGR is identical to the result obtained from GR using a dark matter profile. Although dark matter in MGR is described geometrically, it has an equivalent representation as a particle with the property of a vector boson or a pair of fermions; the geometry of spacetime and the quantum nature of matter are linked together by the unit line element covectors that belong to both the Lorentzian metric and the spin-1 Klein-Gordon wave equation. The three classic tests of GR provide a comparison of the theories in the solar system and several parts of the cosmos. MGR provides the flexibility to describe inflation after the Big Bang and galactic anisotropies.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity evolution of spinning binaries and its dependence on the equation of state of the components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the eccentricity of an eccentric orbit with spinning components. We develop a prescription to express the evolving eccentricity in terms of reference eccentricity and frequency. For that purpose we considered the spins to be perpendicular to the orbital plane. Using this we found an analytical result for the contribution of spin in eccentricity evolution. As a result, we expressed orbital eccentricity in a series of reference eccentricity and gravitational wave frequency. The prescription developed here can easily be used to find arbitrarily higher-order contributions of reference eccentricity. With this we computed the eccentricity upto $\mathcal{O}(e_0^5)$. This result can be used to construct the waveforms of spinning compact objects in an eccentric orbit. Since, our expression depends on the spin induced quadrupole moments, we also study the impact of component properties on the eccentricity evolution through the quadrupole moment. We find for BNSs the evolution depends on the equation of state very mildly unless the NSs are subsolar mass. For subsolar mass NSs the deviations from BH case is comparatively larger and has equation of state dependence. For binary boson stars the deviations are comparatively larger across the mass values. We argue that it may affect our understanding of formation channels and their corresponding populations. We also argue that this can possibly be used as another tool to constrain exoticness of compact objects in a binary.</description>

      <title>Short-distance thermal phase structure of charged black holes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05820v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glavan and Lin's proposal of an effective four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4D-EGB) gravity framework yields predictions that differ from general relativity in some regimes. A range of black hole studies have offered insights into the dynamical and phenomenological aspects of this effective theory of gravity. In this work, we study thermodynamics of a charged 4D-EGB black hole with Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupling $\alpha$, characterized by mass $M$ and charge $Q$ in the non-extremal regime $M&gt;\sqrt{Q^2+\alpha}$ by combining a non-perturbative, quantum-gravity-inspired exponential correction to the entropy (quantified by $\eta$) with information-geometric diagnostics. Working in a canonical ensemble (fixed $Q$) paradigm, we identify thermodynamic stability regions and phase-transition-like features as the black hole size tends toward extremality due to Hawking evaporation. We then construct the Ruppeiner metric on the $(M,Q)$ state space and evaluate the associated thermodynamic curvature to characterize the effective interaction signatures and its relation to critical behavior. In addition, an effective quantum-work quantity, defined from the free-energy landscape using Jarzynski equality, is evaluated as an additional probe of short-distance, near-extremal behavior. The results indicate that departures from the general-relativistic behavior are negligible for large black holes but can become relevant at small horizon scales. Specifically, on short-distance scales, the combined influence of $\alpha$ and $\eta$ can modify stability of the extremal black hole geometry and remnants within this thermodynamic model.</description>

      <title>Improving the Detection of Gravitational-Wave Signals in Real Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This thesis presents advancements in the detection of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences, utilising the most sensitive observatories constructed to date. The research focuses on enhancing gravitational-wave signal searches through the development of new tools and the application of existing methodologies to increase the sensitivity of live gravitational-wave searches. We introduced a novel noise artefact model, which enabled the identification and removal of glitches, thereby facilitating the recovery of previously missed gravitational-wave injections. This pioneering approach established a glitch search pipeline that adapted techniques typically used in gravitational-wave searches to address the unique characteristics of glitches. Additionally, we implemented an exponential noise model within the PyCBC Live search framework, significantly improving the detection ranking statistics for gravitational-wave signals and demonstrating the potential for substantial increases in detection sensitivity. Furthermore, we analysed and proposed enhancements for the PyCBC Live Early Warning search to maximise the detection of gravitational-wave events in the early warning regime. Our findings highlighted deficiencies in the current ranking statistic and led to recommendations for optimising coincidence timing windows and refining phase-time-amplitude histograms. These adjustments aim to increase the detection of gravitational-wave signals, particularly binary neutron star events, in early warning scenarios. The results underscore the importance of advancing search techniques in gravitational-wave astronomy, which can operate independently of detector improvements. By refining search methodologies, we enhance the capacity to detect a greater number of events, contributing significantly to our understanding of the Universe.</description>

Abstract: Hermitian non-K\"ahler Einstein 4-manifolds have a quasi-locally conserved charge associated to spin-lowering via Killing spinors, and corresponding to a parameter of the moduli space. This charge is evaluated for all explicitly known examples of gravitational instantons. Generic gravitational perturbations are shown to admit a closed 2-form that measures the perturbation to this charge, generalizing previous Lorentzian results on the linearized mass of perturbed Kerr black holes.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation of Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Black Holes Using Their Shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the shadow of Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black holes (KBRBHs), which have a deviation parameter $B$ that captures the effect of an external magnetic field on the spacetime geometry. These spacetimes of Petrov type $D$ are asymptotically non-flat. We utilise the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to generate null geodesics and examine the crucial impact parameters for unstable photon orbits that define the black hole shadow. We carefully investigate how the magnetic field strength $B$ and spin parameter $a$ influence black hole shadows, discovering that increasing $B$ increases the shadow size while also introducing additional distortions, especially at high spins. We calculate the shadow observables, viz., area $A$ and oblateness $D$ and create contour plots in the parameter space $(a, B)$ to facilitate parameter estimation. We also investigate the dependence of the shadow on the observer's position, specifically by altering the radial coordinate $r_O$ and the inclination angle $\theta$. For far viewers, the shadow approaches its asymptotic shape, but finite-distance observers perceive substantial deviations. The energy emission rate analysis reveals that the magnetic field parameter $B$ modifies the Hawking radiation spectrum, with increasing $B$ suppressing emission via backreaction, which lowers the Hawking temperature. Our findings confirm that KBRBH shadows encode imprints of magnetic deviations, thereby offering a potential avenue to distinguish Kerr from non-Kerr spacetimes and to probe magnetic effects in the strong-gravity regime.</description>

Abstract: Broad all-sky searches for continuous gravitational waves have high computational costs and require hierarchical pipelines. The sensitivity of these approaches is set by the initial search and by the number of candidates from that stage that can be followed up. The current follow-up schemes for the deepest surveys require careful tuning and set-up, have a significant human-labor cost and this impacts the number of follow-ups that can be afforded. Here we present and demonstrate a new follow-up framework based on Bayesian parameter estimation for the rapid, highly automated follow-up of candidates produced by the early stages of deep, wide-parameter space searches for continuous waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18881v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-term rates of change of all the Keplerian orbital elements of a two-body system acted upon by a remote massive pointlike object are analytically worked out, to the Newtonian quadrupolar level, without any restriction either on the orbital eccentricity and inclination of the disturbed pair or the position of the distant perturber. The latter is considered fixed during the average over one orbital revolution of the inner binary by means of which its orbital perturbations are calculated. The results are presented in a compact form that facilitates a straightforward application to the case of the supermassive black hole-or megapyknon-M87$^\ast$. In principle, the presence of another distant intermediate-mass black hole may concur to cause the observed jet precession, assumed tightly coupled with the accretion disk. Such a possibility is ruled out by the exclusion plots in the parameter space obtained with the approach presented here.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Uniform Magnetic Fields on Strong Field Gravitational Lensing by Kerr Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate strong gravitational lensing using magnetized Kerr black holes (MKBHs), which are accurate Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson solutions for Kerr black holes in a uniform magnetic field with additional magnetic field strength $B$ apart from mass $M$ and spin $a$. Unlike previous magnetized spacetimes, the MKBH geometry is Petrov type D, devoid of conical singularities, allowing photons to reach asymptotic infinity and making the concept astrophysically feasible. We use the strong deflection limit formalism to calculate the photon sphere radius, critical impact parameter, deflection angle, and lensing observables including the image position $\theta_\infty$, angular separation $s$ and relative magnification $r_{\text{mag}}$, as well as their relationships with the parameters $a$ and $B$. Our results reveal that the relativistic image's photon sphere and angular size increase with $B$, whereas lensing observables deviate significantly from the Kerr scenario. For M87*, with $a=0.9$, the angular position of relativistic images increases from $10.8~\mu$as (Kerr) to $12.02~\mu$as, and the time delay between the first two images increases from $158.5$ h to $176$ h at $B=0.4$. Similarly, for Sgr A*, the image position increases from $14.4~\mu$as to $16~\mu$as, with time delays enhanced by approximately $0.7$ minutes. The relative magnification $r_{\text{mag}}$ grows with $B$ and deviates by $0.53$ from Kerr black holes at $B=0.4$. Our findings highlight strong gravitational lensing as a powerful tool to probe the presence of magnetic fields around astrophysical black holes, and in particular, we demonstrate that the MKBH spacetime enables constraints on the parameters $a$ and $B$.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Gravitational Effects of Radiation and Cosmological Implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the momentarily comoving frame of a cosmological fluid, the determinant of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) is highly sensitive to its pressure. This component is significant during radiation-dominated epochs and becomes naturally negligible as the universe transitions to the matter-dominated era. Here, we investigate the cosmological consequences of gravity sourced by the determinant of the EMT. Unlike Azri and Nasri, Phys. Lett. B 836, 137626 (2023), we consider the most general scenario in which the second order variation of the perfect-fluid Lagrangian does not vanish. We analyze the dynamics of the power-law case and explore the cosmological implications of the scale-free model characterized by dimensionless couplings to photons and neutrinos. We show that, unlike various theories based on the EMT, the present setup, which leads to enhanced gravitational effects of radiation (EGER), does not alter the time evolution of the energy density of particle species. Using current cosmological observations, we constrain the model parameters and show that EGER may offer a viable mechanism for alleviating the Hubble tension. Although it exhibits a phenomenological analogy to tightly-coupled relativistic fluid scenarios, EGER remains purely gravitational in origin and yields distinguishable signatures in the small-scale anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background. The radiation-gravity couplings we propose here are expected to yield testable cosmological and astrophysical signatures, probing whether gravity distinguishes between relativistic and nonrelativistic species in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Emission of pairs of Minkowski photons through the lens of the Unruh effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the emission of pairs of photons by charges with generic worldlines in the Minkowski vacuum from the viewpoint of inertial observers and interpret them from the perspective of Rindler observers. We show that the emission of pairs of Minkowski photons corresponds, in general, to three distinct processes according to Rindler observers: scattering, and emission and absorption of pairs of Rindler photons. In the special case of uniformly accelerated charges, the radiation observed in the inertial frame can be fully described by the scattering channel in the Rindler frame. Therefore, the emission of pairs of Minkowski photons -- commonly referred to as Unruh radiation -- can be seen as further evidence supporting the Unruh effect.</description>

      <title>Entropic uncertainty and coherence in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate tripartite quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertain and quantum coherence for GHZ and W states of a fermionic field in the background of a spherically symmetric black hole of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity. Two distinct scenarios are analyzed: (i) the quantum memories (held by Bob and Charlie) are near the horizon while the measured particle (Alice) remains in the flat region, and (ii) the reverse configuration. Dimensional dependence is observed: in $d&gt;5$ dimensions, the measurement uncertainty decreases monotonically with increasing horizon radius, while coherence increases; in $d=5$, both quantities exhibit non-monotonic behavior due to distinctive thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, comparative analysis reveals that the W state exhibits higher robustness in preserving coherence, whereas the GHZ state shows greater resistance to measurement uncertainty increase induced by Hawking radiation. Notably, the two scenarios yield qualitatively distinct behaviors: quantum coherence is consistently lower in Scenario 1 (quantum memory near horizon) than in Scenario 2 (measured particle near horizon), irrespective of the quantum state. For measurement uncertainty, the W state displays lower uncertainty in Scenario 1, while the GHZ state exhibits the opposite trend, with higher measurement uncertainty in Scenario 1. These results indicate that the characteristics of different quantum resources provide important insights into the selection and optimization of quantum states for information processing in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of Acceleration-Induced Excitations in Confined Quantum Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum field excitations in a rigid cavity that undergoes a transition from inertial motion to uniform acceleration while maintaining constant proper length. By constructing exact Bogoliubov transformations between inertial and accelerated mode bases, we analyze the induced excitations and identify a universal power-law decay in the excitation power spectrum and an alternating pattern in particle production. The spectrum's dependence solely on the acceleration, and not on the size of the box or the observer's position, highlights a kinematic universality akin to that seen in horizon thermodynamics. Generalization to time-dependent accelerations reveals a convolution structure for the Bogoliubov coefficients, with resonant oscillations selectively enhancing mode excitations. These results provide new analytical insights into the interplay between acceleration, confinement, and quantum excitations.</description>

Abstract: A new thermal view of scalar-tensor gravity, in which general relativity is the zero-temperature state of gravity, is applied to the specific subclass of $f(R)$ gravity theories and, specifically, to spatially homogeneous and isotropic universes. Within the limits of application of the new thermal formalism, results on the convergence to Einstein cosmology (or lack thereof) are first obtained for general $f(R)$ theories, and then illustrated with power-law and Starobinsky $f(R)$ gravity.</description>

Abstract: We numerically study the approach to the singularity in $\mathbb{T}^{2}$-symmetric cosmological spacetimes containing a non-stiff perfect fluid satisfying a linear equation of state $p=K\rho$, $K \in [0,1)$. Near the singularity, the dynamics are found to be local and oscillatory. In particular, our results show, for the first time, that the fluid velocity in inhomogeneous cosmologies develops mixmaster-esque oscillations consistent with the generalised BKL conjecture of Uggla et al. Moreover, we find these fluid oscillations are responsible for the development of local inhomogeneities in the matter density of the early universe.</description>

      <title>The Missing Massive Sector: Massive Boson Stars -- Stability and GW Emission in Head-on Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quartically self-interacting massive boson stars by constructing equilibrium sequences and performing dynamical evolutions. The mass curve $M(|\phi_c|)$ along these sequences develops multiple extrema, yet stability changes only at the first maximum; configurations beyond it become highly compact and collapse under numerically induced perturbations, with near-critical models displaying a short-lived double-dive behaviour. Head-on collisions of equal-mass stars yield three distinct outcomes - boson star remnants, black hole formation at contact, and collapse of each star to a black hole prior to contact. The associated gravitational-wave energies reflect the competition between increasing compactness and decreasing tidal deformability, and at large self-interaction strengths the collapse-before-contact branch exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic structure. The simulations reported here constitute a substantial catalogue of initial conditions and waveforms, providing a natural basis for neural-network techniques aimed at improving boson star initial data and constructing surrogate models capable of rapidly predicting gravitational-wave signals across an extended parameter space.</description>

      <title>Misinterpreting Spin Precession as Orbital Eccentricity in Gravitational-Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing scope and breadth of gravitational wave detectors is providing the opportunity to explore new parameters in gravitational-wave astronomy. Eccentricity and spin-precession are two key observables to infer the origin of a gravitational wave (GW) source. The interpretation of GW source parameters can be plagued by degeneracy, such as the well-known degeneracy between mass and spin. As the field has explored new parameters, questions have been raised about possible degeneracies between eccentricity and spin-precession. Although some state-of-the-art models now include these effects individually, models that incorporate spin-precession and eccentricity are only in their infancy. Until models faithfully cover the complete parameter space of compact binary coalescence, our ability to correctly measure the source parameters and infer the formation of the binary is compromised. Here, we present a study of the distinguishability of these two key parameters. Our work finds that there is indeed a degeneracy between eccentricity and spin-precession; however, it is a highly localized effect. We find that the misidentified eccentricity estimates get worse as the signal gets shorter. Additionally, this misidentification is highly sensitive to the inclination angle of the source system. We provide quantifiable estimates of the potency of this degeneracy in addition to identifying some of the regions of parameter space where this degeneracy exists.</description>

      <title>Could black hole thermodynamics play a role in black hole mergers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers yield values for both the black hole remnant mass $M$ and it's spin $a$, with the $169$ $a$ values collected so far crowding significantly around their average $\bar{a}=0.6869\pm 0.087$. Could this crowding relate directly to the Davies phase transition point at $a=0.68125$ from black hole thermodynamics? I argue that a necessary challenge for such a connection requires a consistent application of the thermodynamic fluctuation theory that follows from black hole thermodynamics (BHT). Specifically, necessary are a correct choice of fluctuating variables, as well as thermal equilibrium between the event horizon at the Hawking temperature $\sim \mu K$ and the outside universe $\sim 3 K$. I show that the former requirement follows in straightforward fashion from the BHT of the Kerr model, while the later requires an accretion disk following the Novikov-Thorne accretion disk model. I construct a thermodynamic fluctuation theory meeting both these requirements. My results open the possibility that black hole mergers are based on some dynamical model (not known to me) with a limiting attractor state at the Davies point.</description>

      <title>Geometry is Wavy: Curvature Wave Equations for Generic Affine Connections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometry is wavy: even at the purely geometric level (no particular theory chosen), curvature satisfies a covariant quasilinear wave equation. In Riemannian geometry equipped with the Levi-Civita connection, the Riemann curvature tensor obeys a wave equation of the schematic form \[ \Box Riem=\mathcal{Q}(Riem,Riem), \] where $\mathcal{Q}(Riem,Riem)$ denotes the terms quadratic in the curvature arising from the Bianchi identities. In this work, we generalize this curvature wave equation to spacetimes endowed with a generic affine connection possessing torsion and nonmetricity. Working within the metric-affine framework, we derive the corresponding wave equation for the Riemann tensor and analyze its structure in several geometrically and physically distinguished settings, including Einstein spaces, teleparallel gravity, and Einstein-Cartan theory.</description>

Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories predict fundamental scalar fields of considerable interest in astrophysics and cosmology. We investigate the superradiant instability of scalar clouds around Kerr black holes, showing that stimulated decay generates detectable electromagnetic signals. The growth of the superradiant scalar cloud differs from that of other bosonic fields and depends sensitively on the matter distribution surrounding the black hole, which originates from the scalar-matter coupling realized by the chameleon mechanism in modified gravity theories. In non-uniform matter distributions, stimulated emission from scalar clouds offers an observational signature that distinguishes fundamental scalars from other light bosonic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Galactic Center black hole environment gives us new opportunity to test deviation from General Relativity and black hole physics. In this work we analytically generate the shape of the Galactic Center black hole by using a recently developed exact stationary, axisymmetric and vacuum solution of $f(R)$ gravity theory. By using scalaron mass as a free parameter we find that the shadow shape along with displacement and asymmetry is sensitive to the scalaron mass, even after keeping the black hole spin low. We recognize scalaron mass which is compatible with Kerr like quadrupole moment and hence black hole "no-hair" theorem. The same mass scale is found to reproduce the PPN parameter ($\gamma$) constrained in the weak field limit of the solar system. Gravitational identifiers, the Kretschmann scalar ($\kappa$) and gravitational potential ($\phi$) have been used to infer scalaron masses in the regime of S-stars which are found to be consistent with the limits obtained using shadow scales. We ensure that $f(R)$ gravity scalaron has an appropriate general relativistic limit in the horizon scale of the black hole. We also identify the possibility of scale invariance of the general relativistic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the axion-photon coupling can lead to quantum stimulated emission of photons and classic exponential amplification of electromagnetic (EM) fields at half the axion mass frequency, when the axion density or the coupling constant is sufficiently large. In this work, we studied the EM photon cloud induced from an axion cloud around a Kerr black hole in the first order of the coupling constant classically. In the presence of a static EM background (such as the extended Wald solution motivated by astrophysical environments), we found that an EM photon cloud emerges, oscillating at the same frequency as the axion cloud and growing exponentially in accordance with the axion cloud when the superradiant condition for the axion field is satisfied. The evolution of the EM photon cloud with time and azimuthal angle is obtained analytically while the cross-sectional distribution is solved numerically. The induced EM field exhibits symmetries that are markedly different from those of the background EM field. Consequently, the induced photon cloud forms an unstable bound configuration that emits EM waves to spatial infinity while being replenished by the axion cloud, providing a potential observational signature of both the presence of an axion cloud and axion-photon coupling.</description>

      <title>Holographic Extended Thermodynamics of deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14873v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and phase structure of the deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole, generated via the gravitational decoupling (GD) method. In the bulk canonical ensemble, our results exhibit a van der Waals-type first-order phase transition in addition to the Hawking-Page transition, in the suitable parameter regime. Further, we compute the critical exponents characterising the bulk transition, confirming their consistency with mean-field theory predictions. Exploiting the exact holographic dictionary between extended black hole thermodynamics and the dual conformal field theory (CFT), we extend this analysis to the boundary and uncover a rich array of phase transitions and critical phenomena across three distinct thermodynamic ensembles. In particular, in the fixed $(\mathcal{V},C)$ ensemble, the dual CFT exhibits a Hawking-Page-type transition. However, in the fixed $(p,C)$ ensemble, the deformation parameter leads to a distinct thermodynamic behaviour in which multiple branches become unstable, leaving a single thermodynamically stable phase, thus marking a clear departure from the standard van der Waals scenario. Throughout, we emphasise the pivotal influence of the GD deformation parameter on the thermodynamic behaviour, and we elucidate its role in the confinement-deconfinement transitions characteristic of the deformed AdS-Schwarzschild geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider 331 composite Higgs model (CHM3) in which the Lagrangian of the strongly coupled sector is invariant with respect to global SU(3)_C \times SU(3)\times U(1)_6 symmetry that can originate from SU(6) subgroup of E_6 and contains the gauge group of the standard model (SM) as a subgroup. The breakdown of the approximate SU(3)\times U(1)_6 symmetry down to SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y subgroup around the scale f\sim 10 TeV results in a set of pseudo--Nambu--Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) that, in particular, involves Higgs doublet. The generation of the masses of the SM fermions in the CHM3 is discussed. We argue that approximate U(1)_L and discrete Z_2 symmetries may give rise to tiny masses of the left--handed neutrinos and several composite fermions with masses 1-2 TeV. The lepton and baryon asymmetries can be generated within the CHM3 via the out--of equilibrium decays of extra Majorana particle into the Higgs doublet and these composite fermions.</description>

Abstract: We recently described a cosmological quantum spacetime of vanishing spatial curvature, which can be considered as background for the IKKT matrix model, assuming that the resulting gauge theory couples weakly. Building on this example, we construct a large class of spatially flat cosmological quantum spacetimes. We also elaborate on various details of their algebraic and semi-classical structure as well as the higher spin modes present in these models. In particular, we introduce the notion of approximate diffeomorphisms on the cosmological quantum spacetimes that stem from gauge transformations of the underlying matrix model, and investigate how different gauges are related in the semi-classical regime by approximate diffeomorphisms. Finally, we briefly outline how the described quantum spacetimes could be incorporated into the full IKKT model.</description>

      <title>Analytical approximations for curved primordial tensor spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build upon previous analytical treatments of scalar perturbations in curved inflationary universes to obtain analytical templates for the primordial tensor power spectrum in models with non-zero primordial spatial curvature. These templates are derived without assuming a particular inflaton potential, within a background history consisting of an initial kinetically dominated phase followed by an ultra-slow-roll inflationary regime, thereby isolating the universal imprints of curvature on tensor modes. Our results predict characteristic large-scale features -- including low-$\ell$ cut-offs and oscillatory patterns -- that are consistent with numerical solutions and provide a clear physical interpretation of how curvature modifies the underlying dynamics. In particular, we show that curvature effects manifest mathematically as systematic shifts in the dynamically relevant wavevectors, mirroring the behaviour previously identified in the scalar power spectrum. These features translate into distinctive signatures in the large-angle $B$-mode polarisation spectrum, offering a potential discriminant for spatial curvature in forthcoming CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and smooth coarse-graining in excursion set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The excursion-set formalism enables us to infer the mass distribution of collapsed objects, such as primordial black holes (PBHs), by the language of stochastic processes. Within the framework, this article investigates how a smooth coarse-graining procedure affects the resulting PBH mass function. As a demonstrative example, we employ a Gaussian window function, for which the stochastic noise becomes fully correlated across scales. It is found that these correlated noises result in a mass function of PBHs, whose maximum and its neighbourhood are predominantly determined by the probability that the density contrast exceeds a given threshold at each mass scale. Our results clarify the role of noise correlations induced by smooth coarse-graining and highlight their importance in predicting the abundance of PBHs.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh Cosmological Cutting Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the realisation of unitarity-based cutting rules for primordial cosmological correlators computed within the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral formalism. While cutting rules have been previously derived for wavefunction coefficients, here we examine them directly at the level of cosmological observables expressed diagrammatically. The resulting rules closely resemble those familiar from flat-space scattering amplitudes, but with an additional subtlety: in order to express the discontinuity of a correlator as the product of lower-order correlators, one must introduce a specific combinations of diagrams which do not appear in the computation of observables themselves. We explicitly verify these rules for several classes of correlators, both at tree level and with loop corrections, arising from theories involving different types of interactions.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Critical Behavior in AdS Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar Theory via Holographic Entanglement Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the holographic mixed-state entanglement measures in the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar (EMS) theory. Several quantities are computed, including the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE), mutual information (MI), entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), and butterfly velocity ($v_B$). Our findings demonstrate that these measures can effectively diagnose phase transitions. Notably, EWCS and MI, as mixed-state entanglement measures, exhibit behavior opposite to that of the HEE. Additionally, we study the butterfly velocity, a dynamic quantum information measure, and observe that it behaves differently from the static quantum information measures. We propose that the butterfly velocity is initially dominated by entanglement and subsequently by thermal entropy as the coupling constant increases. Moreover, we examine the scaling behavior of the holographic entanglement measures and find that all the critical exponents are equal to $1$, which is twice that of the scalar field. We also explore the inequality between EWCS and MI, noting that the growth rate of MI consistently exceeds that of EWCS during phase transitions. These features are expected to be universal across thermodynamic phase transitions, with the inequalities becoming more significant as one moves away from the critical point.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Metal-Insulator and Hawking-Page Transitions: A Mixed-State Entanglement Perspective in Einstein-Born-Infeld-Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study mixed-state entanglement measures in Einstein-Born-Infeld (EN-BI) massive gravity theory, a model exhibiting both Hawking-Page transitions and metal-insulator transitions (MIT) at finite temperatures. Our comprehensive investigation reveals that the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), a novel mixed-state entanglement measure, demonstrates unique properties in detecting phase transitions. For MIT, we find the higher-order terms of EWCS align closely with the critical point, outperforming measures like holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) and mutual information (MI) in finite temperature systems. This enhanced sensitivity provides a more accurate tool for probing quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated systems. In Hawking-Page transitions, we observe that all entanglement measures effectively diagnose both first-order and second-order phase transitions, with EWCS showing configuration-independent behavior. Importantly, we discover that all geometry-related quantities, including entanglement measures, demonstrate a universal critical exponent of 1/3 near the second-order phase transition point, suggesting fundamental connections between quantum information theory and critical phenomena in gravitational systems. Our results highlight EWCS's potential as a powerful probe for phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Hubble tension: Insights from a diverse set of Sound Horizon-free H0 measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is commonly framed as a discrepancy between local, late-time measurements favoring $H_0 \approx 73$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and early-time, Sound-Horizon-based measurements favoring $H_0 \approx 67$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We challenge this viewpoint by analyzing 88 Sound Horizon Free $H_0$ measurements, categorized into four classes: Distance Ladder measurements using local calibrators; Local $\Lambda$CDM measurements assuming the standard expansion history; Pure Local measurements independent of $H(z)$ shape; and CMB Sound--Horizon--Free measurements using CMB data without the Sound Horizon scale. Our analysis reveals that the 30 Distance Ladder measurements yield $H_0 = 72.73 \pm 0.39$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\chi^2_\nu = 0.72$), while the 58 Distance Ladder-Independent/Sound Horizon Free measurements collectively yield $H_0 = 69.37 \pm 0.34$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\chi^2_\nu = 0.95$), a $6.5\sigma$ tension exceeding the Planck--SH0ES discrepancy. This tension remains significant at a minimum value of $3.9\sigma$ after accounting for correlations. Among categories, Local $\Lambda$CDM measurements favor the lowest value ($H_0 = 67.61\pm 0.96$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), Pure Local yield an intermediate value ($H_0 = 71.03 \pm 0.69$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), and CMB Sound Horizon Free measurements give $H_0 = 69.07 \pm 0.44$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We conclude that the Hubble tension is better characterized as a discrepancy between the Distance Ladder and all other methodologies, rather than an early-vs-late-time split. We also identify a $2.9\sigma$ internal tension among Distance Ladder Independent/Sound Horizon Free measurements: analyses assuming $\Lambda$CDM systematically recover lower $H_0$ values compared to cosmological-model-independent methods. This suggests either unrecognized systematics in the Distance Ladder or deviations from $\Lambda$CDM or both.</description>

      <title>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: Experimental Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the experimental predictions of the local scale invariant, non-Hermitian pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) formulation of quantum theory introduced in arXiv:2601.03567. We use Weyl's definition of gravitational radius of charge to obtain the fine-structure constant for non-integrable scale effects $\alpha_S$. The minuteness of $\alpha_S$ relative to $\alpha$ ($\alpha_S/\alpha \sim 10^{-21}$) effectively hides the effects in usual quantum experiments. In an Aharonov-Bohm double-slit experiment, the theory predicts that the position probability density depends on which slit the particle trajectory crosses, due to a non-integrable scale induced by the magnetic flux. This experimental prediction can be tested for an electrically neutral, heavy molecule with mass $m \sim 10^{-19} \text{g}$ at a $\sim 10^5 \text{ esu}$ flux regime. We analyse the Weyl-Einstein debate on the second-clock effect using the theory and show that spectral frequencies are history-independent. We thereby resolve Einstein's key objection against local scale invariance, and obtain two further experimental predictions. First, spectral intensities turn out to be history-dependent. Second, energy eigenvalues are modified by tiny imaginary corrections that modify spectral linewidths. We argue that the trajectory dependence of the probabilities renders our theory empirically distinguishable from other quantum formulations that do not use pilot-wave trajectories, or their mathematical equivalents, to derive experimental predictions.</description>

      <title>Resumming Scattering Amplitudes for Waveforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a formalism to compute non-perturbative 5-point scattering amplitudes and apply it to gravitational waveforms in the two-body problem for arbitrary trajectories. Drawing inspiration from Feshbach's projector formalism in nuclear physics, we introduce effective potentials governing graviton emission and relate them to perturbative scattering amplitudes at arbitrary order in the gravitational coupling and mass ratio. Once these potentials are determined, the corresponding non-perturbative amplitudes in the classical limit are obtained by iterative insertions and subsequently translated into gravitational waveforms using the KMOC formalism. As an application, we compute the gravitational waveform emitted by a conservative two-body dynamics moving along a generic, potentially highly bent, trajectory. Our formalism extends effective field theory matching of the gravitational two-body potential to radiative phenomena, enabling the extraction of gravitational-wave source terms directly from perturbative on-shell amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Sample-efficient non-Gaussian noise reduction in gravitational wave data via learnable wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{WaveletNet}$, a wavelet-based neural network architecture to identify and reduce non-Gaussian noise in gravitational wave data. Traditionally, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used as a flexible machine learning method to mitigate non-Gaussian noise. However, training CNNs requires many data samples, especially when the input data segments are long. Glitches that mimic high-mass black hole signals are empirically known to have a wavelet-like structure. We exploit this property in $\texttt{WaveletNet}$ by using simple neural networks to learn the best family of wavelets to model glitches in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 data. Due to its simplicity, our framework is significantly more sample-efficient than CNNs. As a use case, we build upon the $\texttt{TIER}$ method and show how $\texttt{WaveletNet}$ can improve the performance of any search pipeline. We take potential GW candidates from the pipeline, and then downweight the candidates having noisy strain regions in their vicinity. We use our framework in a modular way: we provide an output score which can be added to the pipeline's existing detection statistic score for the candidates. We test our method using candidates from the $\texttt{IAS-HM}$ search pipeline and show that it improves the search sensitive volume by up to 15% for high-mass, asymmetric binaries.</description>
