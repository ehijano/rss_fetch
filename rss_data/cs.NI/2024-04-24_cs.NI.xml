      <title>Mapping Wireless Networks into Digital Reality through Joint Vertical and Horizontal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the complexity of 5G and beyond wireless networks has escalated, prompting a need for innovative frameworks to facilitate flexible management and efficient deployment. The concept of digital twins (DTs) has emerged as a solution to enable real-time monitoring, predictive configurations, and decision-making processes. While existing works primarily focus on leveraging DTs to optimize wireless networks, a detailed mapping methodology for creating virtual representations of network infrastructure and properties is still lacking. In this context, we introduce VH-Twin, a novel time-series data-driven framework that effectively maps wireless networks into digital reality. VH-Twin distinguishes itself through complementary vertical twinning (V-twinning) and horizontal twinning (H-twinning) stages, followed by a periodic clustering mechanism used to virtualize network regions based on their distinct geological and wireless characteristics. Specifically, V-twinning exploits distributed learning techniques to initialize a global twin model collaboratively from virtualized network clusters. H-twinning, on the other hand, is implemented with an asynchronous mapping scheme that dynamically updates twin models in response to network or environmental changes. Leveraging real-world wireless traffic data within a cellular wireless network, comprehensive experiments are conducted to verify that VH-Twin can effectively construct, deploy, and maintain network DTs. Parametric analysis also offers insights into how to strike a balance between twinning efficiency and model accuracy at scale.</description>

      <title>Channel Access Methods for RF-Powered IoT Networks: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many Internet of Things (IoT) networks with Radio Frequency (RF) powered devices operate over a shared medium. They thus require a channel access protocol. Unlike conventional networks where devices have unlimited energy, in an RF-powered IoT network, devices must first harvest RF energy in order to transmit or/and receive data. To this end, this survey presents the {\em first} comprehensive review of prior works that employ contention-based and contention-free protocols in IoT networks with one or more {\em dedicated} energy sources. Specifically, these protocols work in conjunction with RF-energy sources to deliver energy delivery or/and data. In this respect, this survey covers protocols based on Aloha, Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA), polling, and dynamic Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA). Further, it covers successive interference cancellation protocols. It highlights key issues and challenges addressed by prior works, and provides a qualitative comparison of these works. Lastly, it identifies gaps in the literature and presents a list of future research directions.</description>

      <title>Vulnerable Road User Clustering for Collective Perception Messages: Efficient Representation Through Geometric Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) is a critical concern in transportation, demanding significant attention from researchers and engineers. Recent advancements in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology offer promising solutions to enhance VRU safety. Notably, VRUs often travel in groups, exhibiting similar movement patterns that facilitate the formation of clusters. The standardized Collective Perception Message (CPM) and VRU Awareness Message in ETSI's Release 2 consider this clustering behavior, allowing for the description of VRU clusters. Given the constraints of narrow channel bandwidth, the selection of an appropriate geometric shape for representing a VRU cluster becomes crucial for efficient data transmission. In our study we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of different geometric shapes used to describe VRU clusters. We introduce two metrics: Cluster Accuracy (CA) and Comprehensive Area Density Information (CADI), to assess the precision and efficiency of each shape. Beyond comparing predefined shapes, we propose an adaptive algorithm that selects the preferred shape for cluster description, prioritizing accuracy while maintaining a high level of efficiency. The study culminates by demonstrating the benefits of clustering on data transmission rates. We simulate VRU movement using real-world data and the transmission of CPMs by a roadside unit. The results reveal that broadcasting cluster information, as opposed to individual object data, can reduce the data transmission volume by two-thirds on average. This finding underscores the potential of clustering in V2X communications to enhance VRU safety while optimizing network resources.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Analysis of Vulnerable Road User Safety in Interaction with Connected Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the World Health Organization, the involvement of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) in traffic accidents remains a significant concern, with VRUs accounting for over half of traffic fatalities. The increase of automation and connectivity levels of vehicles has still an uncertain impact on VRU safety. By deploying the Collective Perception Service (CPS), vehicles can include information about VRUs in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) messages, thus raising the general perception of the environment. Although an increased awareness is considered positive, one could argue that the awareness ratio, the metric used to measure perception, is only implicitly connected to the VRUs' safety. This paper introduces a tailored metric, the Risk Factor (RF), to measure the risk level for the interactions between Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and VRUs. By evaluating the RF, we assess the impact of V2X communication on VRU risk mitigation. Our results show that high V2X penetration rates can reduce mean risk, quantified by our proposed metric, by up to 44%. Although the median risk value shows a significant decrease, suggesting a reduction in overall risk, the distribution of risk values reveals that CPS's mitigation effectiveness is overestimated, which is indicated by the divergence between RF and awareness ratio. Additionally, by analyzing a real-world traffic dataset, we pinpoint high-risk locations within a scenario, identifying areas near intersections and behind parked cars as especially dangerous. Our methodology can be ported and applied to other scenarios in order to identify high-risk areas. We value the proposed RF as an insightful metric for quantifying VRU safety in a highly automated and connected environment.</description>

      <title>Understanding IoT Domain Names: Analysis and Classification Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the domain names of servers on the Internet that are accessed by IoT devices performing machine-to-machine communications. Using machine learning, we classify between them and domain names of servers contacted by other types of devices. By surveying past studies that used testbeds with real-world devices and using lists of top visited websites, we construct lists of domain names of both types of servers. We study the statistical properties of the domain name lists and train six machine learning models to perform the classification. The word embedding technique we use to get the real-value representation of the domain names is Word2vec. Among the models we train, Random Forest achieves the highest performance in classifying the domain names, yielding the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our work offers novel insights to IoT, potentially informing protocol design and aiding in network security and performance monitoring.</description>

      <title>Predictive Intent Maintenance with Intent Drift Detection in Next Generation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intent-Based Networking (IBN) is a known concept for enabling the autonomous configuration and self-adaptation of networks. One of the major issues in IBN is maintaining the applied intent due the effects of drifts over time, which is the gradual degradation in the fulfillment of the intents, before they fail. Despite its critical role to intent assurance and maintenance, intent drift detection was largely overlooked in the literature. To fill this gap, we propose an intent drift detection algorithm for predictive maintenance of intents which can use various unsupervised learning techniques (Affinity Propagation, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models, Hierarchical clustering, K-Means clustering, OPTICS, One-Class SVM), here applied and comparatively analyzed due to their simplicity, yet efficiency in detecting drifts. The results show that DBSCAN is the best model for detecting the intent drifts. The worst performance is exhibited by the Affinity Propagation model, reflected in its poorest accuracy and latency values.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Learning as enabler for General-Purpose AI-native RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of data-driven AI-native architecture envisioned for 6G and beyond networks can eventually lead to multiple machine learning (ML) workloads distributed at the network edges driving downstream tasks like secondary carrier prediction, positioning, channel prediction etc. The independent life-cycle management of these edge-distributed independent multiple workloads sharing a resource-constrained compute node e.g., base station (BS) is a challenge that will scale with denser deployments. This study explores the effectiveness of multi-task learning (MTL) approaches in facilitating a general-purpose AI native Radio Access Network (RAN). The investigation focuses on four RAN tasks: (i) secondary carrier prediction, (ii) user location prediction, (iii) indoor link classification, and (iv) line-of-sight link classification. We validate the performance using realistic simulations considering multi-faceted design aspects of MTL including model architecture, loss and gradient balancing strategies, distributed learning topology, data sparsity and task groupings. The quantification and insights from simulations reveal that for the four RAN tasks considered (i) adoption of customized gate control-based expert architecture with uncertainty-based weighting makes MTL perform either best among all or at par with single task learning (STL) (ii) LoS classification task in MTL setting helps other tasks but its own performance is degraded (iii) for sparse training data, training a single global MTL model is helpful but MTL performance is on par with STL (iv) optimal set of group pairing exists for each task and (v) partial federation is much better than full model federation in MTL setting.</description>

      <title>Multi-Tier Non-Terrestrial Networking for Disaster Communications: A Layered Clustering Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is crucial to deploy temporary non-terrestrial networks (NTN) in disaster situations where terrestrial networks are no longer operable. Deploying uncrewed aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs) can provide a radio access network (RAN); however, the backhaul link may also be damaged and unserviceable in such disaster conditions. In this regard, high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) spark attention as they can be deployed as super macro base stations (SMBS) and data centers. Therefore, in this study, we investigate a three-layer heterogeneous network with different topologies to prolong the lifespan of the temporary network by using UAV-BSs for RAN services and HAPS-SMBS as a backhaul. Furthermore, a two-layer clustering algorithm is proposed to handle the UAV-BS ad-hoc networking effectively.</description>

      <title>UCINet0: A Machine Learning based Receiver for 5G NR PUCCH Format 0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate decoding of Uplink Control Information (UCI) on the Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH) is essential for enabling 5G wireless links. This paper explores an AI/ML-based receiver design for PUCCH Format 0. Format 0 signaling encodes the UCI content within the phase of a known base waveform and even supports multiplexing of up to 12 users within the same time-frequency resources. Our first-of-a-kind neural network classifier, which we term UCINet0, is capable of predicting when no user is transmitting on the PUCCH, as well as decoding the UCI content of any number of multiplexed users, up to 12. Inference results with both simulated and hardware-captured field datasets show that the UCINet0 model outperforms conventional DFT-based decoders across all SNR ranges.</description>

      <title>Latency-Distortion Tradeoffs in Communicating Classification Results over Noisy Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the problem of communicating decisions of a classifier over a noisy channel is considered. With machine learning based models being used in variety of time-sensitive applications, transmission of these decisions in a reliable and timely manner is of significant importance. To this end, we study the scenario where a probability vector (representing the decisions of a classifier) at the transmitter, needs to be transmitted over a noisy channel. Assuming that the distortion between the original probability vector and the reconstructed one at the receiver is measured via f-divergence, we study the trade-off between transmission latency and the distortion. We completely analyze this trade-off using uniform, lattice, and sparse lattice-based quantization techniques to encode the probability vector by first characterizing bit budgets for each technique given a requirement on the allowed source distortion. These bounds are then combined with results from finite-blocklength literature to provide a framework for analyzing the effects of both quantization distortion and distortion due to decoding error probability (i.e., channel effects) on the incurred transmission latency. Our results show that there is an interesting interplay between source distortion (i.e., distortion for the probability vector measured via f-divergence) and the subsequent channel encoding/decoding parameters; and indicate that a joint design of these parameters is crucial to navigate the latency-distortion tradeoff. We study the impact of changing different parameters (e.g. number of classes, SNR, source distortion) on the latency-distortion tradeoff and perform experiments on AWGN and fading channels. Our results indicate that sparse lattice-based quantization is the most effective at minimizing latency across various regimes and for sparse, high-dimensional probability vectors (i.e., high number of classes).</description>

      <title>Teaching Network Traffic Matrices in an Interactive Game Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet has become a critical domain for modern society that requires ongoing efforts for its improvement and protection. Network traffic matrices are a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing networks and are broadly taught in online graph theory educational resources. Network traffic matrix concepts are rarely available in online computer network and cybersecurity educational resources. To fill this gap, an interactive game environment has been developed to teach the foundations of traffic matrices to the computer networking community. The game environment provides a convenient, broadly accessible, delivery mechanism that enables making material available rapidly to a wide audience. The core architecture of the game is a facility to add new network traffic matrix training modules via an easily editable JSON file. Using this facility an initial set of modules were rapidly created covering: basic traffic matrices, traffic patterns, security/defense/deterrence, a notional cyber attack, a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, and a variety of graph theory concepts. The game environment enables delivery in a wide range of contexts to enable rapid feedback and improvement. The game can be used as a core unit as part of a formal course or as a simple interactive introduction in a presentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) functioning as autonomous agents are anticipated to play a crucial role in the 6th Generation of wireless networks. Their seamless integration, cost-effectiveness, and the additional controllability through motion planning make them an attractive deployment option for a wide range of applications. However, despite their potential, the convergence of UVs and wireless systems brings forth numerous challenges that require attention from both academia and industry. This paper then aims to offer a comprehensive overview encompassing the transformative possibilities as well as the significant challenges associated with UV-assisted next-generation wireless communications. Considering the diverse landscape of possible application scenarios, problem formulations, and mathematical tools related to UV-assisted wireless systems, the underlying core theme of this paper is the unification of the problem space, providing a structured framework to understand the use cases, problem formulations, and necessary mathematical tools. Overall, the paper sets forth a clear understanding of how unmanned vehicles can be integrated in the 6G ecosystem, paving the way towards harnessing the full potentials at this intersection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a next generation wireless network incorporating a base station a set of typically low-cost and faulty Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs). The base station needs to select the path including the RIS to provide the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the user. We study the effect of the number of elements, distance and RIS hardware failure on the path outage probability, and based on the known signal propagation model at high frequencies, derive the closed-form expression for the said probability of outage. Numerical results show the path outage likelihood as function of the probability of hardware failure of RIS elements, the number of elements, and the distance between mobile users and the RIS.</description>

      <title>Mobility-Aware Resource Allocation for mmWave IAB Networks: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MmWaves have been envisioned as a promising direction to provide Gbps wireless access. However, they are susceptible to high path losses and blockages, which directional antennas can only partially mitigate. That makes mmWave networks coverage-limited, thus requiring dense deployments. Integrated access and backhaul (IAB) architectures have emerged as a cost-effective solution for network densification. Resource allocation in mmWave IAB networks must face big challenges to cope with heavy temporal dynamics, such as intermittent links caused by user mobility and blockages from moving obstacles. This makes it extremely difficult to find optimal and adaptive solutions. In this article, exploiting the distributed structure of the problem, we propose a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework to optimize user throughput via flow routing and link scheduling in mmWave IAB networks characterized by user mobility and link outages generated by moving obstacles. The proposed approach implicitly captures the environment dynamics, coordinates the interference, and manages the buffer levels of IAB relay nodes. We design different MARL components, considering full-duplex and half-duplex IAB-nodes. In addition, we provide a communication and coordination scheme for RL agents in an online training framework, addressing the feasibility issues of practical systems. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>
