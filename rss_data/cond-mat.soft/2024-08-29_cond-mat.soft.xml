      <title>Integer Topological Defects Reveal Effective Forces in Active Nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell layers are often categorized as contractile or extensile active nematics but recent experiments on neural progenitor cells with induced $+1$ topological defects challenge this classification. In a bottom-up approach, we first study a relevant particle-level model and then analyze a continuous theory derived from it. We show that both model and theory account qualitatively for the main experimental result, i.e. accumulation of cells at the core of any type of +1 defect. We argue that cell accumulation is essentially due to two generally ignored 'effective active forces'.
  We finally discuss the relevance and consequences of our findings in the context of other cellular active nematics experiments and previously proposed theories.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian approach to origami vertex analysis: Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of origami in engineering has significantly expanded in recent years, spanning deployable structures across scales, folding robotics, and mechanical metamaterials. However, finding foldable paths can be a formidable task as the kinematics are determined by a nonlinear system of equations, often with several degrees of freedom. In this work, we leverage a Lagrangian approach to derive reduced-order compatibility conditions for rigid-facet origami vertices with reflection and rotational symmetries. Then, using the reduced-order conditions, we derive exact, multi-degree of freedom solutions for degree 6 and degree 8 vertices with prescribed symmetries. The exact kinematic solutions allow us to efficiently investigate the topology of allowable kinematics, including the consideration of a self-contact constraint, and then visually interpret the role of geometric design parameters on these admissible fold paths by monitoring the change in the kinematic topology. We then introduce a procedure to construct lower symmetry kinematic solutions by breaking symmetry of higher order kinematic solutions in a systematic way that preserves compatibility. The multi-degree of freedom solutions discovered here should assist with building intuition of the kinematic feasibility of higher degree origami vertices and also facilitate the development of new algorithmic procedures for origami-engineering design.</description>

      <title>Understanding long-range opposite charge repulsion in multivalent salt solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrostatic correlations between ions profoundly influence the structure and forces within electrical double layers. Here, we apply the modified Gaussian Renormalized Fluctuation theory to investigate the counter-intuitive phenomenon of repulsion between two oppositely charged surfaces and discuss its relationship with overcharging. By accurately accounting for the effect of spatially varying ion-ion correlations, we capture these repulsive forces for divalent, trivalent as well as tetravalent ions, in quantitative agreement with reported simulation results. We show that the opposite-charge repulsion is long-ranged with an effective length scale of a few nanometers. The strength of opposite-charge repulsion increases monotonically with the multivalent salt concentration, in stark contrast with the non-monotonic salt concentration dependence of other ion correlation-driven phenomena, such as overcharging and like-charge attraction. We also elucidate that the origin of the opposite-charge repulsion is the large amount of ions attracted to the double layer as a result of ion-ion correlations, leading to higher osmotic pressure and stronger screening of the electrostatic attraction, which results in an overall repulsive force between two oppositely charged surfaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there is no causal relationship between opposite-charge repulsion and the overcharging of the surface. Opposite-charge repulsion is accompanied by overcharging at large separation distances, but can also occur in normal double layers without overcharging at intermediate separation distances.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear soft-tissue elasticity, remodeling, and degradation described by an extended Finsler geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A continuum mechanical theory incorporating an extension of Finsler geometry is formulated for fibrous soft solids. Especially if of biologic origin, such solids are nonlinear elastic with evolving microstructures. For example, elongated cells or collagen fibers can stretch and rotate independently of motions of their embedding matrix. Here, a director vector or internal state vector, not always of unit length, in generalized Finsler space relates to a physical mechanism, with possible preferred direction and intensity, in the microstructure. Classical Finsler geometry is extended to accommodate multiple director vectors (i.e., multiple fibers in both a differential-geometric and physical sense) at each point on the base manifold. A metric tensor can depend on the ensemble of director vector fields. Residual or remnant strains from biologic growth, remodeling, and degradation manifest as non-affine fiber and matrix stretches. These remnant stretch fields are quantified by internal state vectors and a corresponding, generally non-Euclidean, metric tensor. Euler-Lagrange equations derived from a variational principle yield equilibrium configurations satisfying balances of forces from elastic energy, remodeling and cohesive energies, and external chemical-biological interactions. Given certain assumptions, the model can reduce to a representation in Riemannian geometry. Residual stresses that emerge from a non-Euclidean material metric in the Riemannian setting are implicitly included in the Finslerian setting. The theory is used to study stress and damage in the ventricle (heart muscle) expanding or contracting under internal and external pressure. Remnant strains from remodeling can reduce stress concentrations and mitigate tissue damage under severe loading.</description>

      <title>On the elastoplastic behavior in collisional compression of spherical dust aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregates consisting of submicron-sized cohesive dust grains are ubiquitous, and understanding the collisional behavior of dust aggregates is essential. It is known that low-speed collisions of dust aggregates result in either sticking or bouncing, and local and permanent compaction occurs near the contact area upon collision. In this study, we perform numerical simulations of collisions between two aggregates and investigate their compressive behavior. We find that the maximum compression length is proportional to the radius of aggregates and increases with the collision velocity. We also reveal that a theoretical model of contact between two elastoplastic spheres successfully reproduces the size- and velocity-dependence of the maximum compression length observed in our numerical simulations. Our findings on the plastic deformation of aggregates during collisional compression provide a clue to understanding the collisional growth process of aggregates.</description>

      <title>There is Nothing Anomalous about 'Anomalous' Underscreening in Concentrated Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, experimental measurements of electrostatic screening lengths in concentrated electrolytes have exceeded theoretical predictions by orders of magnitude. This disagreement has led to a paradigm in which such screening lengths are referred to as 'anomalous underscreening', while others - predominantly those predicted by theory and molecular simulation - are referred to as 'normal underscreening'. Herein we use discrete Fourier analysis of the radial charge density obtained from molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the origin of anomalous underscreening in concentrated electrolytes. Normal underscreening above the Kirkwood point arises from low-frequency decay modes of the electrostatic potential, while anomalous underscreening arises from high-frequency decay modes that are observed only at high concentrations. The screening length associated with a particular decay mode is in turn determined by the degree of short-range interference between ion-ion correlation functions. The long-range decay associated with anomalous underscreening is thus ultimately determined by short range structure in the bulk electrolyte. These results reconcile the disagreement between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions of screening lengths in concentrated electrolytes.</description>

      <title>DWR-Drag: A new generation software for the Double Wall-Ring Interfacial Shear Rheometer's data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double wall-ring (DWR) rotational configuration is nowadays the instrument of choice regarding interfacial shear rheometers (ISR) in rotational configurations. Complex numerical schemes must be used in the analysis of the output data in order to appropriately deal with the coupling between interfacial and bulk fluid flows, and to separate viscous and elastic contribution or the interfacial response. We present a second generation code for analyzing the interfacial shear rheology experimental results of small amplitude oscillatory measurements made with a DWR rotational rheometer. The package presented here improves significantly the accuracy and applicability range of the previous available software packages by implementing: i) a physically motivated iterative scheme based on the probe's equation of motion, ii) an increased user selectable spatial resolution, and iii) a second order approximation for the velocity gradients at the ring surfaces. Moreover, the optimization of the computational effort allows, in many cases, for on-the-fly execution during data acquisition in real experiments.</description>

      <title>Self-assembled clusters of magnetically tilted dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the idea of using simple macroscopic examples to illustrate the physics of complex systems, we modify a historic experimental setup in which interacting floating magnets spontaneously self-assemble into ordered clusters. By making the cluster components mechanically stable against their natural tendency to flip and coalesce, we can monitor the torque experienced by individual magnets through the macroscopic tilt angles they acquire when exposed to non-collinear external fields. A mathematical model that reproduces the empirical observations is introduced, enabling us to go beyond the experimental cases considered. The model confirms the existence of alternative orderings as the number of objects increases. Furthermore, a simpler and more mathematically transparent version of our model enables us to establish the conditions under which the cluster structure is stable and when it will collapse. We argue that our simple experimental setup combined with the accompanying models may be useful to describe general features seen in systems composed of mutually repulsive particles in the presence of modulating confining fields.</description>

      <title>Brownian Colloids in Optothermal Field: An Experimental Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal matter undergoing Brownian motion serves as a model system to study various physical phenomena. Understanding the effect of external perturbation on the assembly and dynamics of Brownian colloids has emerged as a relevant research issue in soft matter and biological physics. Optical perturbation in the form of photonic forces and torques has added impetus to this exploration. In recent years, optothermal effects arising due to optical excitation of mesoscale matter have expanded the toolbox of light-colloidal matter interactions. In this perspective, we present an experimental viewpoint on some of the developments related to the assembly and dynamics of Brownian colloids driven by the optothermal field. Furthermore, we discuss some interesting prospects on driven colloidal matter that can have implications on soft matter physics and soft photonics.</description>

      <title>Neural density functional theory of liquid-gas phase coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use supervised machine learning together with the concepts of classical density functional theory to investigate the effects of interparticle attraction on the pair structure, thermodynamics, bulk liquid-gas coexistence, and associated interfacial phenomena in many-body systems. Local learning of the one-body direct correlation functional is based on Monte Carlo simulations of inhomogeneous systems with randomized thermodynamic conditions, randomized planar shapes of the external potential, and randomized box sizes. Focusing on the prototypical Lennard-Jones system, we test predictions of the resulting neural attractive density functional across a broad spectrum of physical behaviour associated with liquid-gas phase coexistence in bulk and at interfaces. We analyse the bulk radial distribution function $g(r)$ obtained from automatic differentiation and the Ornstein-Zernike route and determine i) the Fisher-Widom line, i.e.\ the crossover of the asymptotic (large distance) decay of $g(r)$ from monotonic to oscillatory, ii) the (Widom) line of maximal correlation length, iii) the line of maximal isothermal compressibility and iv) the spinodal by calculating the poles of the structure factor in the complex plane. The bulk binodal and the density profile of the free liquid-gas interface are obtained from density functional minimization and the corresponding surface tension from functional line integration. We also show that the neural functional describes accurately the phenomena of drying at a hard wall and of capillary evaporation for a liquid confined in a slit pore. Our neural framework yields results that improve significantly upon standard mean-field treatments of interparticle attraction. Comparison with independent simulation results demonstrates a consistent picture of phase separation even when restricting the training to supercritical states only.</description>

      <title>Classifying topological floppy modes in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In floppy mechanical lattices, robust edge states and bulk Weyl modes are manifestations of underlying topological invariants. To explore the universality of these phenomena independent of microscopic detail, we formulate topological mechanics in the continuum. By augmenting standard linear elasticity with additional fields of soft modes, we define a continuum version of Maxwell counting, which balances degrees of freedom and mechanical constraints. With one additional field, these augmented elasticity theories can break spatial inversion symmetry and harbor topological edge states. We also show that two additional fields are necessary to harbor Weyl points in two dimensions, and define continuum invariants to classify these states. In addition to constructing the general form of topological elasticity based on symmetries, we derive the coefficients based on the systematic homogenization of microscopic lattices. By solving the resulting partial differential equations, we efficiently predict coarse-grained deformations due to topological floppy modes without the need for a detailed lattice-based simulation. Our discovery formulates novel design principles and efficient computational tools for topological states of matter, and points to their experimental implementation in mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Polar order in a fluid like ferroelectric with a tilted lamellar structure -- observation of a polar smectic C (SmC${_\textrm{P}}$) phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of fluid states of matter with spontaneous bulk polar order is appreciated as a major discovery in the fields of soft matter and liquid crystals. Typically, this manifests as polar order superimposed atop conventional phase structures and is thus far limited to orthogonal phase types. Here we report a family of materials which exhibit a previously unseen state of matter which we conclude is a polar smectic C phase, and so we term it SmC${_\textrm{P}}$. The spontaneous polarisation of the SmC${_\textrm{P}}$ phase is over two orders of magnitude larger than that found in conventional ferroelectric SmC phase of chiral materials used in some LCD devices. Fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations faithfully and spontaneously reproduce the proposed structure and associated bulk properties; comparison of experimental and simulated X-ray scattering patterns shows excellent agreement. The materials disclosed here have significantly smaller dipole moments than typical polar liquid crystals such as RM734 which suggests the role of molecular electrical polarity in generating polar order is perhaps overstated, a view supported by consideration of other molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Structural transitions of a Semi-Flexible Polyampholyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyampholytes (PA) are charged polymers composed of positively and negatively charged monomers along their backbone. The sequence of the charged monomers and the bending of the chain significantly influence the conformation and dynamical behavior of the PA. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we comprehensively study the structural and dynamical properties of flexible and semi-flexible polyampholytes'. The simulation results demonstrate a flexible polyampholyte (PA) chain, displaying a transition from a coil to a globule in the parameter space of the charge sequence. Additionally, the behavior of the mean-square displacement (MSD), denoted as $&lt;(\Delta r(t))^2&gt;$, reveals distinct dynamics, specifically for the alternating and charge-segregated sequences. The MSD follows a power-law behavior, where $&lt;(\Delta r(t))^2&gt; \sim t^\beta$, with $\beta \approx 3/5$ and $\beta \approx 1/2$ for the alternating sequence and charge-segregated sequence in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions, respectively. However, when hydrodynamic interactions are incorporated, the exponent $\beta$ shifts to approximately 3/5 for the charge-segregated sequence and 2/3 for the well-mixed alternating sequence. For a semi-flexible PA chain, varying the bending rigidity and electrostatic interaction strength ($\Gamma_e$) leads to distinct, fascinating conformational states, including globule, bundle, and torus-like conformations. We show that PA acquires circular and hairpin-like conformations in the intermediate bending regime. The transition between various conformations is identified in terms of the shape factor estimated from the ratios of eigenvalues of the gyration tensor.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of surface interactions experienced by sticky microcapsules made from environmentally benign materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study combining experimental measurements, theoretical analysis, and simulations to investigate core-shell microcapsules interacting with a solid boundary, with a particular focus on understanding the short-range potential energy well arising from the tethered force. The microcapsules, fabricated using a Pickering emulsion template with a cinnamon oil core and calcium alginate shell, were characterized for size (5-6 microns in diameter) and surface charge (-20 mV). We employed total internal reflection microscopy and particle tracking to measure the microcapsule-boundary interactions and diffusion, from which potential energy and diffusivity profiles were derived. The potential energy profile was analyzed and simulated by considering electrostatic, gravitational, and tethered forces, while the diffusivity was compared to that of a solid particle-boundary interaction, inclusive of hydrodynamic forces. The diffusivity was represented as a normalized diffusion coefficient to eliminate the impact of fluid viscosity. The normalized diffusion coefficient of polymer-shell microcapsules (0.02) was found to be an order of magnitude smaller than that of solid polystyrene particles (0.2). The microcapsule sampled a potential well consisting of two distinct minima, as observed experimentally and supported by analytical expressions and Brownian dynamics simulations. A critical tethered height (49.8 nm) and the alginate radius of (35.2 nm) were obtained from fitting our model to experimental data. This work concludes that these benign core shell microcapsules interact with a nearby boundary via a transient tethering interaction, overall producing a mild sticky interaction that would likely be beneficial for applications in consumer products.</description>

      <title>How periodic surfaces bend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A periodic surface is one that is invariant by a 2D lattice of translations. Deformation modes that stretch the lattice without stretching the surface are effective membrane modes. Deformation modes that bend the lattice without stretching the surface are effective bending modes. For periodic, piecewise smooth, simply connected surfaces, it is shown that the effective membrane modes are, in a sense, orthogonal to effective bending modes. This means that if a surface gains a membrane mode, it loses a bending mode, and conversely, in such a way that the total number of modes, membrane and bending combined, can never exceed 3. Various examples, inspired from curved-crease origami tessellations, illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>A simulation platform for slender, semiflexible, and inextensible fibers with Brownian hydrodynamics and steric repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last few years have seen an explosion of new numerical methods for filament hydrodynamics. Aside from their ubiquity in biology, physics, and engineering, filaments present unique challenges from an applied-mathematical point of view. Their slenderness, inextensibility, semiflexibility, and meso-scale nature all require numerical methods that can handle multiple lengthscales in the presence of constraints. Accounting for Brownian motion while keeping the dynamics in detailed balance and on the constraint is difficult, as is including a background solvent, which couples the dynamics of multiple filaments together in a suspension. In this paper, we present a simulation platform for deterministic and Brownian inextensible filament dynamics which includes nonlocal fluid dynamics and steric repulsion. We first review previous work, in which we formulated the equations and spatial discretization for deterministic and Brownian inextensible filament dynamics. We then present novel methods for nonlocal fluid dynamics and steric replusion. In the former case, we define the mobility on a single filament using line integrals of Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa regularized singularities, and numerically preserve the symmetric positive definite property by using a thicker regularization width for the nonlocal integrals than for the self term. For steric repulsion, we introduce a soft local repulsive potential defined as a double-integral over two filaments, then present a scheme to identify and evaluate the nonzero components of the integrand. We demonstrate that Langevin dynamics sample from the equilibrium distribution of free filament shapes, and that the modeling error in using the thicker regularization is small. We conclude with two examples, sedimenting filaments and cross-linked fiber networks, in which nonlocal hydrodynamics does and does not generate long-range flow fields, respectively.</description>

      <title>Aspect-ratio-dependent void formation in active rhomboidal and elliptical particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We execute a numerical simulation on active nematics with particles interacting by an excluded volume effect. The systems with rhomboidal particles and that with elliptical particles are considered in order to investigate the effect of the direct contact of particles. In our simulation, the void regions, where the local number density is almost zero, appear in both systems when the aspect ratio of the particles is high. We focused on the relationship between the void regions and the particle orientation of the bulk. The particle number density, particle orientation, topological defects, and void regions are analyzed for different aspect ratios in both systems. The systems with rhomboidal particles have characteristic void sizes, which increase with an increase in the aspect ratio. In contrast, the distribution of the void-region size in the systems with elliptical particles is broad. The present results suggest that the void size in the systems with rhomboidal particles is determined by the correlation length of the particle orientational field around the void regions, while that might be determined by the system size in the systems with elliptical particles.</description>

      <title>Fibrotaxis: gradient-free, spontaneous and controllable droplet motion on soft solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most passive droplet transport strategies rely on spatial variations of material properties to drive droplet motion, leading to gradient-based mechanisms with intrinsic length scales that limit the droplet velocity or the transport distance. Here, we propose droplet {\it fibrotaxis}, a novel mechanism that leverages an anisotropic fiber-reinforced deformable solid to achieve spontaneous and gradient-free droplet transport. Using high-fidelity simulations, we identify the fluid wettability, fiber orientation, anisotropy strength and elastocapillary number as critical parameters that enable controllable droplet velocity and long-range droplet transport. Our results highlight the potential of fibrotaxis as a droplet transport mechanism that can have a strong impact on self-cleaning surfaces, water harvesting and medical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Modular DNA origami-based electrochemical detection of DNA and proteins</title>

Abstract: The diversity and heterogeneity of biomarkers has made the development of general methods for single-step quantification of analytes difficult. For individual biomarkers, electrochemical methods that detect a conformational change in an affinity binder upon analyte binding have shown promise. However, because the conformational change must operate within a nanometer-scale working distance, an entirely new sensor, with a unique conformational change, must be developed for each analyte. Here, we demonstrate a modular electrochemical biosensor, built from DNA origami, which is easily adapted to diverse molecules by merely replacing its analyte binding domains. Instead of relying on a unique nanometer-scale movement of a single redox reporter, all sensor variants rely on the same 100-nanometer scale conformational change, which brings dozens of reporters close enough to a gold electrode surface that a signal can be measured via square wave voltammetry, a standard electrochemical technique. To validate our sensor's mechanism, we used single-stranded DNA as an analyte, and optimized the number of redox reporters and various linker lengths. Adaptation of the sensor to streptavidin and PDGF-BB analytes was achieved by simply adding biotin or anti-PDGF aptamers to appropriate DNA linkers. Geometrically-optimized streptavidin sensors exhibited signal gain and limit of detection markedly better than comparable reagentless electrochemical sensors. After use, the same sensors could be regenerated under mild conditions: performance was largely maintained over four cycles of DNA strand displacement and rehybridization. By leveraging the modularity of DNA nanostructures, our work provides a straightforward route to the single-step quantification of arbitrary nucleic acids and proteins.</description>

      <title>A Physics Preserving Neural Network Based Approach for Constitutive Modeling of Isotropic Fibrous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13357v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new neural network architecture that strictly enforces constitutive constraints such as polyconvexity, frame-indifference, and the symmetry of the stress and material stiffness. Additionally, we show that the accuracy of the stress and material stiffness predictions is significantly improved for this neural network by using a Sobolev minimization strategy that includes derivative terms. Using our neural network, we model the constitutive behavior of fibrous-type discrete network material. With Sobolev minimization, we obtain a normalized mean square error of 0.15% for the strain energy density, 0.815% averaged across the components of the stress, and 5.4% averaged across the components of the stiffness tensor. This machine-learned constitutive model was deployed in a finite element simulation of a facet capsular ligament. The displacement fields and stress-strain curves were compared to a multiscale simulation that required running on a GPU-based supercomputer. The new approach maintained upward of 85% accuracy in stress up to 70% strain while reducing the computation cost by orders of magnitude.</description>
