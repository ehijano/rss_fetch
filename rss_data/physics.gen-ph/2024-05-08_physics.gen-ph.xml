      <title>Thermodynamic Topology of Quantum RN Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the thermodynamics of black holes, focusing on foundational concepts such as free energy, entropy, and topological numbers, alongside a detailed examination of quantum RN black holes. By extending the discussion to encompass the symmetry groups SO(2), SO(3)/SO(2), and SO(3) within the framework of (f(R)) gravity, the paper offers a nuanced understanding of black hole physics. Key insights include the pivotal role of free energy and entropy in understanding the thermodynamic properties of black holes, the significance of topological numbers in determining thermodynamic stability and phase transitions, and the implications of quantum mechanics and (f(R)) gravity on traditional thermodynamic concepts. This exploration not only enriches our theoretical knowledge of black holes but also sets the stage for future empirical investigations, marking a pivotal contribution to our ongoing quest to decipher the universe's mysteries.</description>

      <title>The Phase Transition of Reissner-Nordstr\"om Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the framework of thermodynamics, the phase transition of the black hole is a general issue in general relativity. In this work, the phase transition of charged black holes is discussed carefully. The metric tensor of thermodynamics is redefined in the charged black hole, based on the Ruppeiner geometry. With the well-defined metric tensor of thermodynamics, the scalar curvature of the charged black hole is obtained. It is indicated that the scalar curvature is diverged and infinite when the mass M or charge Q are set by some values, and it is shown that the charged black hole suffers from a phase transition. At the same time, there is a phase transition from small mass to large mass or from small to high charged state. It is shown that the phase transition of a charged black hole is a common and general process and this work is meaningful for the construction of microscopic states of black holes.</description>

      <title>The new concepts of ether and calculation of the cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the general theory of relativity (GR) meets some difficulties, it seems that new considerations on the ether theories of gravitation in the history are needed. A theory of gravity based on some new concepts of ether and particles is briefly reviewed. In this theory, the universe is filled with a kind of fluid which may be called the $\Omega(0)$ substratum, or we say the gravitational ether. Particles are modeled as sink flows in the $\Omega(0)$ substratum. Newton's law of gravitation is derived by methods of fluid mechanics. Thus, gravity is interpreted as attractive force between sinks in the $\Omega(0)$ substratum. The theoretical calculation of the cosmological constant (CC) based on a mechanical model of vacuum is briefly reviewed. A proposed solution of the cosmological constant problem (CCP) is discussed. Inspired by the association of the gravitational wave (GW) event GW170817 and the gamma-ray burst (GRB) event GRB 170817A, we propose a theoretical calculation of the mass density of the electromagnetic ether.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation based on a fluidic continuum model of vacuum and a sink model of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0610224</link>
      <description>arXiv:physics/0610224v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a fluidic continuum model of vacuum and a sink flow model of microscopic particles. The movements of a microscopic particle driven by a stochastic force was studied based on stochastic mechanics. We show that there exists a generalized Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the microscopic particle.</description>
