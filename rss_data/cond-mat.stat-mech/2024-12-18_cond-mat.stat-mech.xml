      <title>Emergent electrostatics in planar XY spin models: the bridge connecting topological order/nonergodicity with broken $U(1)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases have been a central focus of condensed-matter physics for over 50 years. Along with many experimental applications, they have provided much intellectual interest due to their characterization via some form of topological ordering, as opposed to the symmetry-breaking ordering of conventional continuous phase transitions. This distinction is most subtle in the case of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition as its experimental realizations appear to break U(1) symmetry at low temperature. It also presents two further paradoxes: i) its prototypical short-range interacting planar XY spin model behaves as an emergent long-range interacting electrolyte; ii) its topological ordering is not accompanied by a topological nonergodicity within the BKT picture. This review paper addresses these three interconnected questions. We review a series of papers that demonstrate that U(1) symmetry is indeed broken, but within a broader framework than that traditionally used to characterize broken symmetry. We discuss recovery of this symmetry by breaking velocity-symmetry in a deterministic Markov process. We then expand on a modern field theory of the emergent electrolyte that maps directly from the spin field to an emergent lattice electric field governed by an augmented electrostatic Boltzmann distribution. This local model of electrolyte physics resolves both the short-range-long-range paradox and the question of topological nonergodicity - as in contrast with the BKT picture, it describes global topological defects and their nonergodic freezing by the topological ordering. It also connects the broken U(1) symmetry with the topological ordering - providing a comprehensive framework for broken symmetry at the transition. We introduce long-time topological stability as a measure of topological nonergodicity - within a general framework for weakly broken ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Topology of the Visibility Graph of Sandpiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the higher- and lower-order connectivity aspects of the visibility graph representation of sandpile models, focusing on the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld (BTW) model. By converting the time series of avalanche events into visibility graphs, we investigate the structural properties that emerge at different scales of connectivity. Specifically, we utilize persistent homology and simplicial complex theory to identify higher-order topological features. Analyzing the statistics of degree and betweenness centralities reveal that the resulting graph is a scale-free network with the degree exponent of $\gamma_k=2.50\pm 0.02$ and betweenness exponent of $\gamma_b=1.585\pm 0.008$. The analysis of the simplexes show that the distribution function of one, two and three dimensional simplexes are power-law with the exponents of $\gamma_{\sigma_1}=0.795\pm 0.006$, $\gamma_{\sigma_2}=0.602\pm 0.009$ and $\gamma_{\sigma_3}=0.422\pm 0.008$ respectively. This power-law behavior is also seen in the homology group analysis, for the Betti numbers, the exponents of which are reported in the paper. The persistent entropy of life time of $d$ dimensional holes is analyzed indicating that it increases logarithmically in terms of the network size $N$ for $d=0,1$ and $2$.</description>

      <title>Analytical results for the distribution of first return times of non-backtracking random walks on configuration model networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analytical results for the distribution of first return (FR) times of non-backtracking random walks (NBWs) on undirected configuration model networks consisting of $N$ nodes with degree distribution $P(k)$. We focus on the case in which the network consists of a single connected component. Starting from a random initial node $i$ at time $t=0$, an NBW hops into a random neighbor of $i$ at time $t=1$ and at each subsequent step it continues to hop into a random neighbor of its current node, excluding the previous node. We calculate the tail distribution $P ( T_{\rm FR} &gt; t )$ of first return times from a random node to itself. It is found that $P ( T_{\rm FR} &gt; t )$ is given by a discrete Laplace transform of the degree distribution $P(k)$. This result exemplifies the relation between structural properties of a network, captured by the degree distribution, and properties of dynamical processes taking place on the network. Using the tail-sum formula, we calculate the mean first return time ${\mathbb E}[ T_{\rm FR} ]$. Surprisingly, ${\mathbb E}[ T_{\rm FR} ]$ coincides with the result obtained from the Kac's lemma that applies to classical random walks (RWs). We also calculate the variance ${\rm Var}(T_{\rm FR})$, which accounts for the variability of first return times between different NBW trajectories. We apply this formalism to random regular graphs, Erdos-R\'enyi networks and configuration model networks with exponential and power-law degree distributions and obtain closed-form expressions for $P ( T_{\rm FR} &gt; t )$ as well as its mean and variance. These results provide useful insight on the advantages of NBWs over classical RWs in network exploration, sampling and search processes.</description>

      <title>Emergent short-range repulsion for attractively coupled active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that heterogeneity in self-propulsion speed leads to the emergence of effective short-range repulsion among active particles coupled via strong attractive potentials. Taking the example of two harmonically coupled active Brownian particles, we analytically compute the stationary distribution of the distance between them in the strong coupling regime, i.e., where the coupling strength is much larger than the rotational diffusivity of the particles. The effective repulsion in this regime is manifest in the emergence of a minimum distance between the particles, proportional to the difference in their self-propulsion speeds. Physically, this distance of the closest approach is associated to the orientations of the particles being parallel to each other. We show that the physical scenario remains qualitatively similar for any long-range coupling potential, which is attractive everywhere. Moreover, we show that, for a collection of $N$ particles interacting via pairwise attractive potentials, a short-range repulsion emerges for each pair of particles with different self-propulsion speeds. Finally, we show that our results are robust and hold irrespective of the specific active dynamics of the particles.</description>

      <title>Network Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renormalization group (RG) is a powerful theoretical framework developed to consistently transform the description of configurations of systems with many degrees of freedom, along with the associated model parameters and coupling constants, across different levels of resolution. It also provides a way to identify critical points of phase transitions and study the system's behaviour around them by distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant details, the latter being unnecessary to describe the emergent macroscopic properties. In traditional physical applications, the RG largely builds on the notions of homogeneity, symmetry, geometry and locality to define metric distances, scale transformations and self-similar coarse-graining schemes. More recently, various approaches have tried to extend RG concepts to the ubiquitous realm of complex networks where explicit geometric coordinates do not necessarily exist, nodes and subgraphs can have very different properties, and homogeneous lattice-like symmetries are absent. The strong heterogeneity of real-world networks significantly complicates the definition of consistent renormalization procedures. In this review, we discuss the main attempts, the most important advances, and the remaining open challenges on the road to network renormalization.</description>

      <title>1d Ising model with $1/r^{1.99}$ interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the 1d Ising model with long-range interactions decaying as $1/r^{1+s}$. The critical model corresponds to a family of 1d conformal field theories (CFTs) whose data depends nontrivially on $s$ in the range $1/2\leq s\leq 1$. The model is known to be described by a generalized free field with quartic interaction, which is weakly coupled near $s=1/2$ but strongly coupled near the short-range crossover at $s=1$. We propose a dual description which becomes weakly coupled at $s=1$. At $s=1$, our model becomes an exactly solvable conformal boundary condition for the 2d free scalar. We perform a number of consistency checks of our proposal and calculate the perturbative CFT data around $s=1$ analytically using both 1) our proposed field theory and 2) the analytic conformal bootstrap. Our results show complete agreement between the two methods.</description>

      <title>Toolkit for General 2d Scalar Potential in LCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present efficient algorithms for obtaining the Hamiltonian in Lightcone Conformal Truncation (LCT) for a 2d scalar field with a generic potential. We apply this method to the sine-Gordon and sinh-Gordon models in $1+1d$, and find precise agreement with integrability results when the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the deforming cosine/cosinh potential is in the range $ \Delta \leq 1$. The agreement provides additional evidence for a recent conjecture for how to compute the effective lightcone Hamiltonian in this class of models. In addition, to high precision, we provide the first direct confirmation for the conjectured self-duality of the sinh-Gordon model ($\Delta &lt; 0)$, which relates $\Delta \leftrightarrow 4/\Delta$. As the dimension approaches the upper limit $\Delta=1$ from below, we show analytically that the Hamiltonian matrix elements exactly reproduce those of a free Majorana fermion, demonstrating how bosonization is manifested in the LCT basis. We comment on the possible extension of the approach to $\Delta &gt; 1$.</description>

      <title>Coherent information as a mixed-state topological order parameter of fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction protects quantum information against decoherence provided the noise strength remains below a critical threshold. This threshold marks the critical point for the decoding phase transition. Here we connect this transition in the toric code to a topological phase transition in disordered Majorana fermions at high temperatures. A quantum memory in the error correctable phase is captured by the presence of a Majorana zero mode, trapped in vortex defects associated with twisted boundary conditions. These results are established by expressing the coherent information, which measures the amount of recoverable quantum information in a given noisy code, in terms of a mixed-state topological order parameter of fermions. Our work hints at a broader connection of the robustness of quantum information in stabilizer codes and mixed-state topological phase transitions in symmetry protected fermion matter.</description>

      <title>Brickwall One-Loop Determinant: Spectral Statistics &amp; Krylov Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon -- a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon -- within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.</description>

Abstract: All isometrically invariant Markov (strictly local) fields on binary assignments are induced by energy functions that can be represented as linear combinations of area, perimeter, and Euler characteristic. This class of model includes the Ising model, both ferro- and antiferro-magnetic, with and without a field, as well as the "triplet" Ising model We determine the low-temperature behavior for this class of model, and construct a phase diagram of that behavior. In particular, we identify regions with three geometric phases, regions with a single unique phase, and coexistence lines between them.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian delocalization in 1D via emergent compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potential disorder in 1D leads to Anderson localization of the entire spectrum. Upon sacrificing hermiticity by adding non-reciprocal hopping, the non-Hermitian skin effect competes with localization. We find another route for delocalization, which involves imaginary potential disorder. While an entirely random potential generally still leads to localization, imposing minimal spatial structure to the disorder can protect delocalization: it endows the concomitant transfer matrix with an SU(2) structure, whose compactness in turn translates into an infinite localization length. The fraction of delocalized states can be tuned by the choice of boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of hydrodynamics in a Galilean quantum Hall crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamic effective field theory for Galilean-invariant quantum Hall systems with spontaneously broken translational symmetry. Neglecting the role of energy conservation in a low-temperature regime, the hydrodynamic mode is a magnetophonon with quartic attenuation: $\omega\sim \pm k^2-\mathrm{i} k^z$ with $z=4$. However, this linear response theory is unstable, and flows to a non-trivial dynamical universality class with $z\approx 3$. We observe this scaling in numerical simulations of many-body classical Hamiltonian dynamics, in a model of an electronic crystal in the lowest Landau level. Observing this magnetophonon decay rate in a quantum Hall crystal represents a promising setting to detect an analogue of a "fractonic dynamical universality class" in a solid-state system, e.g. using microwave impedance microscopy.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking in mixed states emerging from the quantum Ising model under multiple decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Specific types of decoherence applied to typical quantum many-body states can induce a novel kind of mixed state accompanying characteristic symmetry orders, which has no counterparts in pure many-body states. We study phenomena generated by interplay between two types of decoherence applied to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We show that in the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decoherence can be described by filtering operation applied to matrix product states (MPS) defined in the doubled Hilbert system. The filtering operation induces specific deformation of the MPS, which approximates the ground state of a certain parent Hamiltonian in the doubled Hilbert space. In the present case, such a parent Hamiltonian is the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, having a rich phase diagram with a critical lines and quantum phase transitions. By investigating the deformed MPS, we find various types of mixed states emergent from the ground states of the TFIM, and clarify phase transitions between them. In that study, strong and weak $Z_2$ symmetries play an important role, for which we introduce efficient order parameters, such as R\'{e}nyi-2 correlators, entanglement entropy, etc., in the doubled Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolving Normalising Flows for Lattice Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a renormalisation group inspired normalising flow that combines benefits from traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and standard normalising flows to sample lattice field theories. Specifically, we use samples from a coarse lattice field theory and learn a stochastic map to the targeted fine theory. The devised architecture allows for systematic improvements and efficient sampling on lattices as large as $128 \times 128$ in all phases when only having sampling access on a $4\times 4$ lattice. This paves the way for reaping the benefits of traditional MCMC methods on coarse lattices while using normalising flows to learn transformations towards finer grids, aligning nicely with the intuition of super-resolution tasks. Moreover, by optimising the base distribution, this approach allows for further structural improvements besides increasing the expressivity of the model.</description>

      <title>Exact g-function without strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to compute exact $g$-function for integrable quantum field theories with non-diagonal scattering S-matrices. The approach is based on an integrable lattice regularization of the quantum field theory. The exact $g$-function is encoded in the overlap of the integrable boundary state and the ground state on the lattice, which can be computed exactly by Bethe ansatz. In the continuum limit, after subtracting the contribution proportional to the volume of the closed channel, we obtain the exact $g$-function, given in terms of the counting function which is the solution of a nonlinear integral equation. The resulting $g$-function contains two parts, the scalar part, which depends on the boundary parameters and the ratio of Fredholm determinants, which is universal. This approach bypasses the difficulties of dealing with magnetic excitations for non-diagonal scattering theories in the framework of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. We obtain numerical and analytical results of the exact $g$-function for the prototypical sine-Gordon theory with various integrable boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>DiFfRG: A Discretisation Framework for functional Renormalisation Group flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DiFfRG (Discretisation Framework for functional Renormalisation Group flows), a comprehensive computational C++ framework for solving functional Renormalisation Group flows in very general truncation schemes. Its central features are threefold: Firstly, the use of Finite Element Methods (FEM) for efficient, easy to set up and quantitatively reliable computations of field dependences. Secondly, the (simultaneous) setup of large, fully momentum-dependent vertex expansions. Thirdly, efficient time-discretisation methods, incorporating insights from studies of solving theories which exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking, going hand in hand with shocks and an exponential increase of the information flow velocity in field space. The framework provides a Mathematica package for automatic code generation of flow equations, finite and zero temperature integration routines with support for GPU hardware and extensive parallelisation capabilities. Detailed examples and tutorials are provided and discussed herein which showcase and introduce the framework to the user. We illustrate the capabilities of DiFfRG with four examples, with the complete codes fully included: finite temperature O(N) theory, a Quark-Meson model, SU(3) Yang-Mills theory and four-Fermi flows in the QCD phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Powering a quantum clock with a non-equilibrium steady state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose powering a quantum clock with the non-thermal resources offered by the stationary state of an integrable quantum spin chain, driven out of equilibrium by a quench in a parameter of our choice. Analyzing the bias conditions of the clock, we establish a direct connection with the negativity of the steady-state response function. Using experimentally relevant examples of quantum spin chains, we suggest crossing a phase transition point is crucial for optimal performance. The coupling takes place through a global observable and, even in this case, the battery lifespan is found to be extensive in its size.</description>

      <title>Thermal Pure States for Systems with Antiunitary Symmetries and Their Tensor Network Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal pure state algorithms, which employ pure quantum states representing thermal equilibrium states instead of statistical ensembles, are useful both for numerical simulations and for theoretical analysis of thermal states. However, their inherently large entanglement makes it difficult to represent efficiently and limits their use in analyzing large systems. Here, we propose a new tensor network algorithm for constructing thermal pure states for systems with certain antiunitary symmetries, such as time-reversal or complex conjugate symmetry. Our method utilizes thermal pure states that, while exhibiting volume-law entanglement, can be mapped to tensor network states through simple transformations. Furthermore, our approach does not rely on random sampling and thus avoids statistical uncertainty. Moreover, we can compute not only thermal expectation values of local observables but also thermodynamic quantities. We demonstrate the validity and utility of our method by applying it to the one-dimensional XY model and the two-dimensional Ising model on a triangular lattice. Our results suggest a new class of variational wave functions for volume-law states that are not limited to thermal equilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Full distribution of the ground-state energy of potentials with weak disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the full distribution $P(E)$ of the ground-state energy of a single quantum particle in a potential $V(\boldsymbol{x}) = V_0(\boldsymbol{x}) + \sqrt{\epsilon} \, v_1(\boldsymbol{x})$, where $V_0(\boldsymbol{x})$ is a deterministic ``background'' trapping potential and $v_1(\boldsymbol{x})$ is the disorder. We consider arbitrary trapping potentials $V_0(\boldsymbol{x})$ and white-noise disorder $v_1(\boldsymbol{x})$, in arbitrary spatial dimension $d$. In the weak-disorder limit $\epsilon \to 0$, we find that $P(E)$ scales as $P(E) \sim e^{-s(E)/\epsilon}$. The large-deviation function $s(E)$ is obtained by calculating the most likely configuration of $V(\boldsymbol{x})$ conditioned on a given ground-state energy $E$. For infinite systems, we obtain $s(E)$ analytically in the limits $E \to \pm \infty$ and $E \simeq E_0$ where $E_0$ is the ground-state energy in the absence of disorder. We perform explicit calculations for the case of a harmonic trap $V_0(\boldsymbol{x}) \propto x^2$ in dimensions $d\in\left\{ 1,2,3\right\}$. Next, we calculate $s(E)$ exactly for a finite, periodic one-dimensional system with a homogeneous background $V_0(x)=0$. We find that, remarkably, the system exhibits a sudden change of behavior as $E$ crosses a critical value $E_c &lt; 0$: At $E&gt;E_c$, the most likely configuration of $V(x)$ is homogeneous, whereas at $E &lt; E_c$ it is inhomogeneous, thus spontaneously breaking the translational symmetry of the problem. As a result, $s(E)$ is nonanalytic: Its second derivative jumps at $E=E_c$. We interpret this singularity as a second-order dynamical phase transition.</description>

      <title>Markov spin models for image generation : explicit large deviations with respect to the number of pixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the discrete-time or the continuous-time Markov spin models for image generation when each pixel $n=1,..,N$ can take only two values $S_n=\pm 1$, the finite-time forward propagator depends on the initial and on the final configurations of the $N$ spins only via a single global variable, namely the extensive overlap that counts the number of spins that have the same value or not in the two configurations. The joint probability distribution of the overlap and of the magnetization during the forward noising dynamics can be written for any finite number $N$ of pixels and in the limit $N \to + \infty$ to extract the large deviations properties. The consequences for the backward reconstructive dynamics are then analyzed for various initial conditions, namely (i) a single image (ii) a mixture of two images (iii) when the initial condition corresponds to the Curie-Weiss mean-field ferromagnetic model in the microcanonical ensemble, as a simple analog of the manifold-hypothesis concerning continuous generative diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Deviation from maximal entanglement for mid-spectrum eigenstates of local Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.01173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a spin chain governed by a local Hamiltonian, we consider a microcanonical ensemble in the middle of the energy spectrum and a contiguous subsystem whose length is a constant fraction of the system size. We prove that if the bandwidth of the ensemble is greater than a certain constant, then the average entanglement entropy (between the subsystem and the rest of the system) of eigenstates in the ensemble deviates from the maximum entropy by at least a positive constant. This result highlights the difference between the entanglement entropy of mid-spectrum eigenstates of (chaotic) local Hamiltonians and that of random states. We also prove that the former deviates from the thermodynamic entropy at the same energy by at least a positive constant.</description>

      <title>Computable Cross Norm in Tensor Networks and Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Computable Cross Norm (CCNR) was recently discussed in Ref.~\cite{Yin:2022toc} as a measure of multipartite entanglement in a condensed matter context. In this short note, we point out that it is closely related to the $(2,n)$-R\'enyi reflected entropy, which has been studied in the context of AdS/CFT. We discuss the calculation of the CCNR in random tensor networks as well as holographic CFTs. The holographic dual involves a backreacted entanglement wedge cross section in a geometry sourced by R\'enyi-2 cosmic branes. We perform explicit calculations for two intervals in a hyperbolic random tensor network as well the vacuum state of a 2D holographic CFT, and analyze the occurence of a connected-to-disconnected phase transition. The example illustrates the validity of the proposal for analytic continuation in holography for arbitrary values of R\'enyi parameter $n$. We comment on a symmetry-resolved generalization of this quantity.</description>

      <title>Ramp from Replica Trick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15873v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the spectral form factor of the modular Hamiltonian $K=-\ln\rho_A$ associated to the reduced density matrix of a Haar random state. A ramp is demonstrated and we find an analytic expression for its slope. Our method involves an application of the replica trick, where we first calculate the correlator $&lt;\text{tr}\rho_A^n\;\text{tr}\rho_A^m&gt;$ at large bond dimension and then analytically continue the indices $n,m$ from integers to arbitrary complex numbers. We use steepest descent methods at large modular times to extract the ramp. The large bond dimension limit of the replicated partition function is dominated by a sum over \emph{annular non-crossing permutations}. We explored the similarity between our results and calculations of the spectral form factor in low dimensional gravitational theories where the ramp is determined by the double trumpet geometry. We find there is an underlying resemblance in the two calculations, when we interpret the annular non-crossing permutations as representing a discretized version of the double trumpet. Similar results are found for an equilibrated pure state in place of the Haar random state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the hydrostatic stress of electrons strongly confined in a quasi-2D quantum well in the presence of a strong perpendicular and weak in-plane magnetic field. This introduces anisotropy into the stress tensor which is inconsistent with the notion of the quantum Hall droplet as a simple two-dimensional electron fluid. We show that the breaking of rotational symmetry is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an anisotropic ground state stress tensor, and that the anisotropic stress originates primarily from quantum effects. We demonstrate this by decomposing the semiclassical trajectories of electrons in the system onto planes in phase space which must be rotated relative to the plane of the fluid to decouple the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Work extraction is one of the most central processes in quantum thermodynamics. However, the prior analysis of optimal extractable work has been restricted to a limited operational scenario where complete information about the initial state is given. Here, we introduce a general framework of black box work extraction, which addresses the inaccessibility of information on the initial state. We show that the optimal extractable work in the black box setting is completely characterized by the performance of a composite hypothesis testing task, a fundamental problem in information theory.We employ this general relation to reduce the asymptotic black box work extraction to the quantum Stein's lemma in composite hypothesis testing, allowing us to provide their exact characterization in terms of the Helmholtz free energy. We also show a new quantum Stein's lemma motivated in this physical setting, where a composite hypothesis contains a certain correlation. Our work exhibits the importance of information about the initial state and gives a new interpretation of the quantities in the composite quantum hypothesis testing, encouraging the interplay between the physical settings and the information theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a novel construction scheme for generating quantum analogs of classical stochastic processes has been introduced. Here, we use this scheme in order to generate a large class of self-contained quantum extensions of a classical Markov chain process using symmetry operations. We show that the relaxation processes unfold very differently for the different quantum extensions. This is supported by monitoring the coherence, the probability of reaching the equilibrium, the decay of the number of domain walls and the purity. Unexpectedly, we find a rather ambiguous relation between the coherence measure based on the L1-norm and the speed of the relaxation process. Finally we find that the finite size scaling of the coherence measure exists for both short and long times and the value of the critical exponent is different for the short and long time.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion in the Square Soft Lorentz Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate and analyze anomalous diffusion properties of point-like particles in a two-dimensional system with circular scatterers arranged in a square lattice and governed by smooth potentials, referred to as the square soft Lorentz gas. Our numerical simulations reveal a rich interplay of normal and anomalous diffusion depending on the system parameters. To describe diffusion in normal regimes, we develop a unit cell hopping model that, in the single-hop limit, recovers the Machta-Zwanzig approximation and converges toward the numerical diffusion coefficient as the number of hops increases. Anomalous diffusion is characterized by quasiballistic orbits forming Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser islands in phase space, alongside a complex tongue structure in parameter space defined by the interscatterer distance and potential softness. The distributions of the particle displacement vector show notable similarities to both analytical and numerical results for a hard-wall square Lorentz gas, exhibiting Gaussian behavior in normal diffusion and long tails due to quasiballistic orbits in anomalous regimes. Our work thus provides a catalog of key dynamical system properties that characterize the intricate changes in diffusion when transitioning from hard billiards to soft potentials.</description>

      <title>Quantum trails and memory effects in the phase space of chaotic quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstates of a chaotic system can be enhanced along underlying unstable periodic orbits in so-called quantum scars, making it more likely for a particle launched along one such orbits to be found still there at long times. Unstable periodic orbits are however a negligible part of the phase space, and a question arises regarding the structure of the wavefunction elsewhere. Here, we address this question and show that a weakly-dispersing dynamics of a localized wavepacket in phase space leaves a "quantum trail" on the eigenstates, that is, makes them vary slowly when moving along a trajectories in phase space, even if not periodic. The quantum trails underpin a remarkable dynamical effect: for a system initialized in a localized wavepacket, the long-time phase-space distribution is enhanced along the short-time trajectory, which can result in ergodicity breaking. We provide the general intuition for these effects and prove them in the stadium billiard, for which an unwarping procedure allows to visualize the phase space on the two-dimensional space of the page.</description>

Abstract: The conversion of thermal energy into work is usually more efficient in the slow-driving regime, where the power output is vanishingly small. Efficient work extraction for fast driving protocols remains an outstanding challenge at the nanoscale, where fluctuations play a significant role. In this Letter, we use a quantum-dot Szilard engine to extract work from thermal fluctuations with maximum efficiency over two decades of driving speed. We design and implement a family of optimised protocols ranging from the slow- to the fast-driving regime, and measure the engine's efficiency as well as the mean and variance of its power output in each case. These optimised protocols exhibit significant improvements in power and efficiency compared to the naive approach. Our results also show that, when optimising for efficiency, boosting the power output of a Szilard engine inevitably comes at the cost of increased power fluctuations.</description>
