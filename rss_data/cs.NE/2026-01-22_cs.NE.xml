      <title>A full process algebraic representation of Ant Colony Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a process algebra capable of specifying parallelized Ant Colony Optimization algorithms in full detail: PA$^2$CO. After explaining the basis of three different ACO algorithms (Ant System, MAX-MIN Ant System, and Ant Colony System), we formally define PA$^2$CO and use it for representing several types of implementations with different parallel schemes. In particular fine-grained and coarse-grained specifications, each one taking advantage of parallel executions at different levels of system granularity, are formalized.</description>

      <title>GEGO: A Hybrid Golden Eagle and Genetic Optimization Algorithm for Efficient Hyperparameter Tuning in Resource-Constrained Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is a critical yet computationally expensive step in training neural networks, particularly when the search space is high dimensional and nonconvex. Metaheuristic optimization algorithms are often used for this purpose due to their derivative free nature and robustness against local optima. In this work, we propose Golden Eagle Genetic Optimization (GEGO), a hybrid metaheuristic that integrates the population movement strategy of Golden Eagle Optimization with the genetic operators of selection, crossover, and mutation.
  The main novelty of GEGO lies in embedding genetic operators directly into the iterative search process of GEO, rather than applying them as a separate evolutionary stage. This design improves population diversity during search and reduces premature convergence while preserving the exploration behavior of GEO.
  GEGO is evaluated on standard unimodal, multimodal, and composite benchmark functions from the CEC2017 suite, where it consistently outperforms its constituent algorithms and several classical metaheuristics in terms of solution quality and robustness. The algorithm is further applied to hyperparameter tuning of artificial neural networks on the MNIST dataset, where GEGO achieves improved classification accuracy and more stable convergence compared to GEO and GA. These results indicate that GEGO provides a balanced exploration-exploitation tradeoff and is well suited for hyperparameter optimization under constrained computational settings.</description>

      <title>Proximal Policy Optimization with Evolutionary Mutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a widely used reinforcement learning algorithm known for its stability and sample efficiency, but it often suffers from premature convergence due to limited exploration. In this paper, we propose POEM (Proximal Policy Optimization with Evolutionary Mutations), a novel modification to PPO that introduces an adaptive exploration mechanism inspired by evolutionary algorithms. POEM enhances policy diversity by monitoring the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the current policy and a moving average of previous policies. When policy changes become minimal, indicating stagnation, POEM triggers an adaptive mutation of policy parameters to promote exploration. We evaluate POEM on four OpenAI Gym environments: CarRacing, MountainCar, BipedalWalker, and LunarLander. Through extensive fine-tuning using Bayesian optimization techniques and statistical testing using Welch's t-test, we find that POEM significantly outperforms PPO on three of the four tasks (BipedalWalker: t=-2.0642, p=0.0495; CarRacing: t=-6.3987, p=0.0002; MountainCar: t=-6.2431, p&lt;0.0001), while performance on LunarLander is not statistically significant (t=-1.8707, p=0.0778). Our results highlight the potential of integrating evolutionary principles into policy gradient methods to overcome exploration-exploitation tradeoffs.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning from One Cancer to Another via Deep Learning Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised deep learning models often achieve excellent performance within their training distribution but struggle to generalize beyond it. In cancer histopathology, for example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) may classify cancer severity accurately for cancer types represented in its training data, yet fail on related but unseen types. Although adenocarcinomas from different organs share morphological features that might support limited cross-domain generalization, addressing domain shift directly is necessary for robust performance. Domain adaptation offers a way to transfer knowledge from labeled data in one cancer type to unlabeled data in another, helping mitigate the scarcity of annotated medical images.
  This work evaluates cross-domain classification performance among lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas. A ResNet50 trained on any single adenocarcinoma achieves over 98% accuracy on its own domain but shows minimal generalization to others. Ensembling multiple supervised models does not resolve this limitation. In contrast, converting the ResNet50 into a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) substantially improves performance on unlabeled target domains. A DANN trained on labeled breast and colon data and adapted to unlabeled lung data reaches 95.56% accuracy.
  We also examine the impact of stain normalization on domain adaptation. Its effects vary by target domain: for lung, accuracy drops from 95.56% to 66.60%, while for breast and colon targets, stain normalization boosts accuracy from 49.22% to 81.29% and from 78.48% to 83.36%, respectively. Finally, using Integrated Gradients reveals that DANNs consistently attribute importance to biologically meaningful regions such as densely packed nuclei, indicating that the model learns clinically relevant features and can apply them to unlabeled cancer types.</description>

      <title>From Observation to Prediction: LSTM for Vehicle Lane Change Forecasting on Highway On/Off-Ramps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On and off-ramps are understudied road sections even though they introduce a higher level of variation in highway interactions. Predicting vehicles' behavior in these areas can decrease the impact of uncertainty and increase road safety. In this paper, the difference between this Area of Interest (AoI) and a straight highway section is studied. Multi-layered LSTM architecture to train the AoI model with ExiD drone dataset is utilized. In the process, different prediction horizons and different models' workflow are tested. The results show great promise on horizons up to 4 seconds with prediction accuracy starting from about 76% for the AoI and 94% for the general highway scenarios on the maximum horizon.</description>

      <title>Online Operator Design in Evolutionary Optimization for Flexible Job Shop Scheduling via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Customized static operator design has enabled widespread application of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), but their search effectiveness often deteriorates as evolutionary progresses. Dynamic operator configuration approaches attempt to alleviate this issue, but they typically rely on predefined operator structures and localized parameter control, lacking sustained adaptive optimization throughout evolution. To overcome these limitations, this work leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perceive evolutionary dynamics and enable operator-level meta-evolution. The proposed framework, LLMs for online operator design in Evolutionary Optimization, named LLM4EO, comprises three components: knowledge-transfer-based operator design, evolution perception and analysis, and adaptive operator evolution. Firstly, operators are initialized by leveraging LLMs to distill and transfer knowledge from well-established operators. Then, search behaviors and potential limitations of operators are analyzed by integrating fitness performance with evolutionary features, accompanied by suggestions for improvement. Upon stagnation of population evolution, an LLM-driven meta-operator dynamically optimizes gene selection of operators by prompt-guided improvement strategies. This approach achieves co-evolution of solutions and operators within a unified optimization framework, introducing a novel paradigm for enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of EAs. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks of flexible job shop scheduling problem demonstrate that LLM4EO accelerates population evolution and outperforms tailored EAs.</description>
