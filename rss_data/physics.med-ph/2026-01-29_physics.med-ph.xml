      <title>Multicenter Comparison of Radionuclide Calibrators and SPECT/CT Protocols for Quantitative 177Lu Imaging in Clinical Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Following the clinical success of 177Lu-based therapies for neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer, accurate quantification of 177Lu using radionuclide calibrators (RNCs) and 177Lu-SPECT/CT is gaining importance as prerequisite for accurate treatment delivery and dosimetry. However, the lack of standardization can introduce inter-system variability, compromising multi-center clinical trials. This study aimed to assess the accuracy and variability of 177Lu measurements using RNCs and SPECT/CT across different systems and hospitals. Methods: A uniform cylindrical phantom and a NEMA phantom with hot spheres were prepared using traceable activities and imaged at 8 different hospitals using 13 SPECT/CT systems (9 conventional and 4 3D CZT). Acquisitions and reconstructions were performed using both site-specific and standardized protocols. The cylindrical phantom images were used to establish image calibration factors (ICFs), the NEMA images to evaluate image quality by calculating recovery coefficients (RCs). Both were used to evaluate quantitative SPECT accuracy. In parallel, two vials were measured to test RNC accuracy. Results: RNC measurements differed up to 11% between centers, while SPECT quantification differed up to 20% and 58% for the cylindrical and NEMA phantoms respectively. While ICFs were consistent for systems of the same type, image quality varied strongly when using clinical protocols. Standardized reconstruction reduced variability for each system type, regardless of acquisition protocol, but differences between system types persisted when harmonizing acquisition and reconstruction. Conclusion: Current 177Lu measurement practices yield significant variability in quantification and image quality. Harmonization efforts should prioritize standardized calibration and reconstruction protocols to improve multicenter reproducibility of quantitative 177Lu-SPECT/CT.</description>

      <title>Advances in ion-doping of Ca-Mg silicate bioceramics for bone tissue engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of bioceramics as hard tissue substitutes is extensive due to their excellent biocompatible and osteogenic behaviors. Among various bioceramics, Ca-Mg silicates are unique from the viewpoints of osteoinductive and mechanical properties, as well as their outstanding osteoconductive and angiogenic behaviors owing to the release of Si, Ca and Mg. Despite these distinct advantages, different compositions of these bioceramics still require mechanical and biological enhancements for further applications. For this purpose, doping with some ions like F-, Sr2+, Cu2+, Eu2+, Ba+, Ce3+ and some alkali cations has been proved to be a valued approach. This review attempts to bring together areas for the performance improvement of the further researched Ca-Mg silicates (i.e., diopside, akermanite, bredigite and monticellite) and the alteration of these compositions via ion-doping. It is concluded that a correct choice of dopants incorporated at the optimal concentration makes these silicates ideal bone substitutes competing or even superior to calcium phosphates (apatites) and bioglasses which are known as the most prominent bioceramics.</description>

      <title>Controlled drug delivery from chitosan-coated heparin-loaded nanopores anodically grown on nitinol shape-memory alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitinol (NiTi shape-memory alloy) is an interesting candidate in various medical applications like dental, orthopedic, and cardiovascular devices, owing to its unique mechanical behaviors and proper biocompatibility. The aim of this work is the local controlled delivery of a cardiovascular drug, heparin, loaded onto nitinol treated by electrochemical anodizing and chitosan coating. In this regard, the structure, wettability, drug release kinetics, and cell cytocompatibility of the specimens were analyzed in vitro. The two-stage anodizing process successfully developed a regular nanoporous layer of Ni-Ti-O on nitinol, which considerably decreased the sessile water contact angle and induced hydrophilicity. The application of the chitosan coatings controlled the release of heparin mainly by a diffusional mechanism, where the drug release mechanisms were evaluated by the Higuchi, first-order, zero-order, and Korsmeyer-Pepass models. Human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs) viability assay also showed the non-cytotoxicity of the samples, so that the best performance was found for the chitosan-coated samples. It is concluded that the designed drug delivery systems are promising for cardiovascular, particularly stent applications.</description>

      <title>A Practical Computational Hemolysis Model Incorporating Biophysical Properties of the Red Blood Cell Membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Hemolysis is a key issue in the design of blood-handling medical devices. Computational prediction of this phenomenon is challenging due to the complex multiscale nature of blood. As a result, conventional approaches often fail to predict hemolysis accurately, commonly showing deviations of multiple orders of magnitude compared to experimental data. More accurate models are typically computationally expensive and thus impractical for real-world applications. This work aims to fill this gap by presenting accurate yet simple and efficient computational hemolysis models.
  Methods: Hemolysis modeling relies on two key components: a red blood cell model and a hemoglobin release model. In this work, we compare three red blood cell models: a common stress-based model (Bludszuweit), a simple strain-based model based on the Kelvin-Voigt constitutive law, and a more complex tensor-based model (TTM). Further, we compare two hemoglobin release models: the widely used power-law approach and a biophysical pore formation model.
  Results: We evaluate these models in two benchmark cases: the FDA blood pump and the FDA nozzle. In both benchmarks, the simple strain-based model combined with the pore formation model achieves absolute predictions of hemolysis within the standard deviation of experimental measurements. In contrast, stress-based power law models deviate by several orders of magnitude.
  Conclusion: The strain-based pore modeling approach takes into account the biophysical properties of red blood cell membranes, in particular their viscoelastic deformation behavior and hemoglobin release through membrane pores. This leads to significantly improved hemolysis predictions in a framework that can easily be integrated into common CFD workflows.</description>

      <title>A Learning-based Framework for Spatial Impulse Response Compensation in 3D Photoacoustic Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a promising imaging modality that combines the advantages of optical contrast with ultrasound detection. Utilizing ultrasound transducers with larger surface areas can improve detection sensitivity. However, when computationally efficient analytic reconstruction methods that neglect the spatial impulse responses (SIRs) of the transducer are employed, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images will be compromised. Although optimization-based reconstruction methods can explicitly account for SIR effects, their computational cost is generally high, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) applications. To address the need for accurate but rapid 3D PACT image reconstruction, this study presents a framework for establishing a learned SIR compensation method that operates in the data domain. The learned compensation method maps SIR-corrupted PACT measurement data to compensated data that would have been recorded by idealized point-like transducers. Subsequently, the compensated data can be used with a computationally efficient reconstruction method that neglects SIR effects. Two variants of the learned compensation model are investigated that employ a U-Net model and a specifically designed, physics-inspired model, referred to as Deconv-Net. A fast and analytical training data generation procedure is also a component of the presented framework. The framework is rigorously validated in virtual imaging studies, demonstrating resolution improvement and robustness to noise variations, object complexity, and sound speed heterogeneity. When applied to in-vivo breast imaging data, the learned compensation models revealed fine structures that had been obscured by SIR-induced artifacts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of learned SIR compensation in 3D PACT imaging.</description>

      <title>TIARA: a fast gamma-ray detector for range monitoring in Proton Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a novel gamma-ray detection system (TIARA) for range monitoring in Particle Therapy. The system employs Cherenkov-based gamma-ray detection modules arranged around the target or patient, operated in time coincidence with a fast plastic beam monitor (described in a separate paper). This work focuses on the design and comprehensive characterization of the gamma-ray detection module. It consists of a monolithic PbF$_2$ crystal (2 $\times$ 1.5 $\times$ 1.5 cm$^{3}$) coupled to a 2 $\times$ 2 SiPM matrix from Hamamatsu. A series of beam tests at different clinical facilities (MEDICYC and ProteusOne in France, CNAO in Italy) enabled the determination of the detector time resolution under various conditions, with values ranging from 222 to 283 ps FWHM (Full Width Half Maximum). Monte Carlo simulations including the optical response of PbF$_2$ allowed for the determination of the detection efficiency as a function of particle type and energy. For the final TIARA prototype, which will be composed of 30 modules, an overall detection efficiency of 0.45% is expected. Comparison with experimental data confirmed that the modules are effectively insensitive to neutrons, yielding an excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with an estimated SNR of 17 for a module placed at 25 cm from the 148 MeV proton beam axis. These features translate into high range accuracy: while the performance varies with beam energy and irradiation conditions, a range accuracy of 3.3 mm at 2$\sigma$ significance level was achieved at low intensity with 63 MeV protons at MEDICYC, for a small irradiation spot of $\mathbf{\sim}$10$\mathbf{^{7}}$ protons.</description>

      <title>Energy-Threshold Bias Calculator: A Physics-Model Based Adaptive Correction Scheme for Photon-Counting CT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon-counting detector based computed tomography (PCCT) has greatly advanced in recent years. However, spectral inconsistency, referring to inter-pixel variations in detected counts per energy bin, can easily leads to ring or band artifacts and inaccuracies in CT reconstructed images. This work proposes a novel physics-model based method to correct for spectral inconsistency by modeling it through two terms: (1) a fixed spectral skew term (energy threshold-independent filtration function) determined at a given energy threshold, and (2) a variable energy-threshold bias term that can be directly calculated by using our spectral model as the threshold changes. After the two terms being computed out in the calibration stage, they will be incorporated into our spectral model to adaptively generate the spectral correction vectors as well as the material decomposition vectors if needed, pixel-by-pixel for PCCT projection data. Using a minimum set of parameters with explicit physics meaning, such an energy-threshold bias calculator (ETB-Cal) has advantages of computational efficiency, robustness in implementation, and convenience with no need of X-ray fluorescence materials in calibration. To validate our method, both numerical simulations and physical experiments using multiple phantoms were carried out on a tabletop PCCT system, with preliminary results showing a significant reduction in non-uniformity, from 29.3 to 5.8 HU for Gammex multi-energy phantom versus no correction (comparatively, 8.3 HU was achieved by a polynomial-involving model-based approach with no explicit modeling and calculating of energy threshold bias but more calibration data required), and from 27.9 to 3.2 HU for the Kyoto head phantom.</description>

      <title>Quantification of dual-state 5-ALA-induced PpIX fluorescence: Methodology and validation in tissue-mimicking phantoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantification of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence in human brain tumours has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes in neuro-oncology, but represents a formidable imaging challenge. Protoporphyrin is a biological molecule which interacts with the tissue micro-environment to form two photochemical states in glioma. Each exhibits markedly different quantum efficiencies, with distinct but overlapping emission spectra that also overlap with tissue autofluorescence. Fluorescence emission is known to be distorted by the intrinsic optical properties of tissue, coupled with marked intra-tumoural heterogeneity as a hallmark of glioma tumours. Existing quantitative fluorescence systems are developed and validated using simplified phantoms that do not simultaneously mimic the complex interactions between fluorophores and tissue optical properties or micro-environment. Consequently, existing systems risk introducing systematic errors into PpIX quantification when used in tissue. In this work, we introduce a novel pipeline for quantification of PpIX in glioma, which robustly differentiates both emission states from background autofluorescence without reliance on a priori spectral information, and accounts for variations in their quantum efficiency. Unmixed PpIX emission forms are then corrected for wavelength-dependent optical distortions and weighted for accurate quantification. Significantly, this pipeline is developed and validated using novel tissue-mimicking phantoms replicating the optical properties of glioma tissues and photochemical variability of PpIX fluorescence in glioma. Our workflow achieves strong correlation with ground-truth PpIX concentrations (R2 = 0.918+-0.002), demonstrating its potential for robust, quantitative PpIX fluorescence imaging in clinical settings.</description>
