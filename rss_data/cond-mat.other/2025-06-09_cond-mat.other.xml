      <title>Twist-Angle-Controlled Anomalous Gating in Bilayer Graphene/BN Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalous gating effects-such as gate ineffectiveness and pronounced hysteresis-have been observed in graphene-based systems encapsulated in boron nitride (BN) and linked to a possible ferroelectric state. However, their origin, stability, and reproducibility remain under debate. Here, we present charge transport experiments in dual-gated, dynamically rotatable van der Waals heterostructures based on bilayer graphene encapsulated in BN. Remarkably, the angular degree of freedom acts as an ON/OFF switch for the anomalous gating response. We show that the angular alignment between the two BN layers -- not the presence of a moir\'e superlattice with graphene -- is the key parameter governing these effects. The relevant alignment between the two BN layers, to observe the anomalous gating effect at room temperature, lies between 15 deg and 45 deg, with no evidence of the expected 60 deg periodicity. Both gate ineffectiveness and hysteresis are highly sensitive to small angular changes, which we classify into three distinct regimes. Our results clarify the conditions necessary to reproduce these phenomena and pave the way for theoretical investigation of their microscopic origins.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Phonon Characteristics of Gallium Oxide Single Crystals Investigated with Brillouin-Mandelstam Light Scattering Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an investigation of the bulk and surface acoustic phonons in gallium oxide ultra-wide bandgap single crystals along various crystallographic directions using Brillouin-Mandelstam spectroscopy. Pronounced anisotropy in the acoustic phonon dispersion and velocities was observed across different crystal orientations. The measured average acoustic phonon velocities for the crystallographic directions of interest are 5,250 m/s and 4,990 m/s. The surface acoustic phonons propagate approximately twice as slowly as the bulk acoustic phonons. Our results suggest that the anisotropy of heat conduction in gallium oxide results from the difference in phonon velocities rather than the phonon lifetime. The obtained information for bulk and surface acoustic phonons can be used for developing accurate theoretical models of phonon scattering and optimization of thermal and electrical transport in this technologically important ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor.</description>

      <title>Unusual Electron-Phonon Interactions in Highly Anisotropic Two-Dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) represent a fundamental cornerstone of condensed matter physics, commanding persistent attention due to their pivotal role in driving novel quantum phenomena within low-dimensional materials. Here, we unveil unusual anisotropic electron-phonon coupling behaviors in quasi-one-dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ nano-flakes through a powerful combination of angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy directly visualize the pronounced quasi-one-dimensional atomic chains within the crystal structure, establishing a structural foundation for the observed anisotropic interactions. Our Raman investigations reveal remarkable polarization-dependent responses in $A_g$ phonon modes that deviate significantly from conventional behavior, which our theoretical analyses attribute to complex anisotropic electron-photon and electron-phonon interactions. Temperature-dependent Raman measurements further uncover an intriguing phonon decay mechanism involving both three- and four-phonon processes, with the latter showing significant contributions in some modes - a possible manifestation of strong anisotropic electron-phonon interactions. Beyond revealing $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ as an exceptional platform for exploring anisotropic EPIs, this work demonstrates that integrating angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy with DFPT calculations offers a powerful methodology for investigating electron-phonon interactions in emerging low-dimensional quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Ground states of classical spin polygons: Rigorous results and examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the lowest energy configurations (LECs) of classical spin polygons characterized by arbitrary couplings between neighboring spin sites. Our study shows that these ground states exhibit either collinear or coplanar arrangements, which allows us to determine the precise boundaries between these two phases. By simultaneously applying a spin flip and a bond inversion, we simplify the LEC problem and reduce it to a specific scenario with predominantly ferromagnetic (FM) bonds and a single antiferromagnetic (AFM) bond. Hence, competing interactions are always present, but, nevertheless, in the well-defined ranges of the system parameters the collinear LEC is realized. The difference angles between neighboring spins within the LEC can be captured by a single Lagrange parameter. We analytically investigate its dependence on the AFM bond and arrive at revealing results. Similarly, we can analyze the energy of the LEC, which shows a pronounced maximum as a function of AFM bond. To illustrate our findings, we give various examples that clearly demonstrate these results.</description>

      <title>Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: I. Calculation of steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15428v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previously obtained expressions describing the intensity of stationary fluorescence emitted by a multicomponent solution were significantly improved by using matrix calculus. Then, using a similar technique, new expressions describing the decay of the fluorescence intensity of the multicomponent system after pulsed excitation were found. In both of these cases, the effects of the internal filter, the effects of multistep radiative transfer of excitation energy, the possibility of radiative back-transfer, as well as the possibility of changes in the quantum yield of individual components due to radiationless transfer of excitation energy were taken into account. The cases of one-, two- and three-component systems were discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>How to build transfer matrices, one wave at a time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to build the closed-form expression of transfer matrices for wave propagation in layered media. The key is to represent the propagation across the piece-wise constant medium as a superposition of a finite number of paths ($2^{N-1}$ paths for a medium with $N$ layers), each one of them contributing a certain phase change (corresponding to signed sums of the phase change in each individual layer) and amplitude change (corresponding to the pattern of transmission and/or reflection associated to each path). The outlined technique is combinatorial in nature: it begins with the linear governing equations in frequency domain, whose fundamental solution is known, then it enumerates the finite number of paths across the overall system, then computes their associated phase and amplitude change, and finally adds all the possible paths to find the final result. Beyond providing physical insight, this ''path-by-path'' construction can also circumvent the need for transfer matrix numerical multiplication in many practical applications, potentially enabling substantial computational savings.</description>
