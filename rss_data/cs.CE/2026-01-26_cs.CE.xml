      <title>Distributional Computational Graphs: Error Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a general framework of distributional computational graphs: computational graphs whose inputs are probability distributions rather than point values. We analyze the discretization error that arises when these graphs are evaluated using finite approximations of continuous probability distributions. Such an approximation might be the result of representing a continuous real-valued distribution using a discrete representation or from constructing an empirical distribution from samples (or might be the output of another distributional computational graph). We establish non-asymptotic error bounds in terms of the Wasserstein-1 distance, without imposing structural assumptions on the computational graph.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Quantum Computing for Energy Materials: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing high-performance materials is critical for diverse energy applications to increase efficiency, improve sustainability and reduce costs. Classical computational methods have enabled important breakthroughs in energy materials development, but they face scaling and time-complexity limitations, particularly for high-dimensional or strongly correlated material systems. Quantum computing (QC) promises to offer a paradigm shift by exploiting quantum bits with their superposition and entanglement to address challenging problems intractable for classical approaches. This perspective discusses the opportunities in leveraging QC to advance energy materials research and the challenges QC faces in solving complex and high-dimensional problems. We present cases on how QC, when combined with classical computing methods, can be used for the design and simulation of practical energy materials. We also outline the outlook for error-corrected, fault-tolerant QC capable of achieving predictive accuracy and quantum advantage for complex material systems.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Probabilistic Interpolation for GEDI Biomass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable wall-to-wall biomass mapping from NASA's GEDI mission requires interpolating sparse LiDAR observations across heterogeneous landscapes. While machine learning approaches like Random Forest and XGBoost are standard for this task, they treat spatial predictions of GEDI observations from multispectral or SAR remote sensing data as independent without adapting to the varying difficulty of heterogeneous landscapes. We demonstrate these approaches generally fail to produce calibrated prediction intervals. We identify that this stems from conflating ensemble variance with aleatoric uncertainty and ignoring local spatial context.
  To resolve this, we introduce Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs), a probabilistic meta-learning framework that explicitly conditions predictions on local observation sets and geospatial foundation model embeddings. Unlike static ensembles, ANPs learn a flexible spatial covariance function, allowing uncertainty estimates to expand in complex landscapes and contract in homogeneous areas. We validate this approach across five distinct biomes ranging from Tropical Amazonian forests to Boreal and Alpine ecosystems, demonstrating that ANPs achieve competitive accuracy while maintaining near-ideal uncertainty calibration. We demonstrate the operational utility of the method through few-shot adaptation, where the model recovers most of the performance gap in cross-region transfer using minimal local data. This work provides a scalable, theoretically rigorous alternative to ensemble variance for continental scale earth observation.</description>

      <title>Interpretable and flexible non-intrusive reduced-order models using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops an interpretable, non-intrusive reduced-order modeling technique using regularized kernel interpolation. Existing non-intrusive approaches approximate the dynamics of a reduced-order model (ROM) by solving a data-driven least-squares regression problem for low-dimensional matrix operators. Our approach instead leverages regularized kernel interpolation, which yields an optimal approximation of the ROM dynamics from a user-defined reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We show that our kernel-based approach can produce interpretable ROMs whose structure mirrors full-order model structure by embedding judiciously chosen feature maps into the kernel. The approach is flexible and allows a combination of informed structure through feature maps and closure terms via more general nonlinear terms in the kernel. We also derive a computable a posteriori error bound that combines standard error estimates for intrusive projection-based ROMs and kernel interpolants. The approach is demonstrated in several numerical experiments that include comparisons to operator inference using both proper orthogonal decomposition and quadratic manifold dimension reduction.</description>

      <title>RONOM: Reduced-Order Neural Operator Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent partial differential equations are ubiquitous in physics-based modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios, such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification. Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, three numerical examples are presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard vector-to-vector neural networks can achieve comparable performance in input generalization and achieves superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal super-resolution scenarios and ROM-based approaches for learning on time-dependent data.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Flow Matching for Symmetry-Breaking Bifurcation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking. Deterministic machine learning models are unable to capture this multiplicity, averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In this work, we formalize the use of generative AI, specifically flow matching, as a principled way to model the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our approach builds on existing techniques by combining flow matching with equivariant architectures and an optimal-transport-based coupling mechanism. We generalize equivariant flow matching to a symmetric coupling strategy that aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of systems, from simple conceptual systems to physical problems such as buckling beams and the Allen--Cahn equation. The results demonstrate that the approach accurately captures multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations. Moreover, our results demonstrate that flow matching significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods. This offers a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Markovian Reeb Graphs for Simulating Spatiotemporal Patterns of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning, epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb Graphs, a novel framework that transforms Reeb graphs from a descriptive analysis tool into a generative model for spatiotemporal trajectories. Our approach captures individual and population-level Patterns of Life (PoLs) and generates realistic trajectories that preserve baseline behaviors while incorporating stochastic variability by embedding probabilistic transitions within the Reeb graph structure. We present two variants: Sequential Reeb Graphs (SRGs) for individual agents and Hybrid Reeb Graphs (HRGs) that combine individual with population PoLs, evaluated on the Urban Anomalies and Geolife datasets using five mobility statistics. Results demonstrate that HRGs achieve strong fidelity across metrics while requiring modest trajectory datasets without specialized side information. This work establishes Markovian Reeb Graphs as a promising framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across urban environments.</description>

      <title>On the relationship between MESP and 0/1 D-Opt and their upper bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish strong connections between two fundamental nonlinear 0/1 optimization problems coming from the area of experimental design, namely maximum entropy sampling and 0/1 D-Optimality. The connections are based on maps between instances, and we analyze the behavior of these maps. Using these maps, we transport basic upper-bounding methods between these two problems, and we are able to establish new domination results and other inequalities relating various basic upper bounds. Further, we establish results relating how different branch-and-bound schemes based on these maps compare. Additionally, we observe some surprising numerical results, where bounding methods that did not seem promising in their direct application to real-data MESP instances, are now useful for MESP instances that come from 0/1 D-Optimality.</description>
