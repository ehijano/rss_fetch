      <title>Symmetry-preserving neural networks in lattice field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis deals with neural networks that respect symmetries and presents the advantages in applying them to lattice field theory problems. The concept of equivariance is explained, together with the reason why such a property is crucial for the network to preserve the desired symmetry. The benefits of choosing equivariant networks are first illustrated for translational symmetry on a complex scalar field toy model. The discussion is then extended to gauge theories, for which Lattice Gauge Equivariant Convolutional Neural Networks (L-CNNs) are specifically designed ad hoc. Regressions of physical observables such as Wilson loops are successfully solved by L-CNNs, whereas traditional architectures which are not gauge symmetric perform significantly worse. Finally, we introduce the technique of neural gradient flow, which is an ordinary differential equation solved by neural networks, and propose it as a method to generate lattice gauge configurations.</description>

      <title>Improved Ground State Estimation in Quantum Field Theories via Normalising Flow-Assisted Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid variational framework that enhances Neural Quantum States (NQS) with a Normalising Flow-based sampler to improve the expressivity and trainability of quantum many-body wavefunctions. Our approach decouples the sampling task from the variational ansatz by learning a continuous flow model that targets a discretised, amplitude-supported subspace of the Hilbert space. This overcomes limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and autoregressive methods, especially in regimes with long-range correlations and volume-law entanglement. Applied to the transverse-field Ising model with both short- and long-range interactions, our method achieves comparable ground state energy errors with state-of-the-art matrix product states and lower energies than autoregressive NQS. For systems up to 50 spins, we demonstrate high accuracy and robust convergence across a wide range of coupling strengths, including regimes where competing methods fail. Our results showcase the utility of flow-assisted sampling as a scalable tool for quantum simulation and offer a new approach toward learning expressive quantum states in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Impact on $L$-observables of a new combined analysis of $B_{d,s}\to K^{(*)}$ form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of a combined analysis of $B_{d,s}\to K^{(*)}$ form factors on a set of $L$-observables. The $L$-observables are constructed from ratios of branching fractions in $B_{s}\to VV,PP,PV$ versus $B_d \to VV,PP,PV$ decays with $P=K^0,\bar{K}^0$ and $V=K^{*0},\bar{K}^{*0}$, thereby partially reducing their hadronic uncertainties. We show the change of the Standard Model predictions of the $L$-observables under different determinations of the ratio of the relevant form factors (with correlations) including lattice QCD data and a novel light-cone sum rule analysis. In addition, we provide precise results for all $B_{d,s} \to K^{(*)}$ form factors in machine-readable files. We find that the inclusion of our up-to-date results, as well as the use or omission of lattice QCD data for the form factors, has a significant impact on the $L$-observables. We also discuss how the New Physics interpretation is affected by the updated form factors and present revised predictions for the mechanism identified in our analysis of $B \to VP$ decays, now employing more suitable new experimental observables defined in this paper.</description>

      <title>Sign-Problem-Free Nuclear Quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods offer exact solutions for quantum many-body systems but face severe limitations in fermionic systems like atomic nuclei due to the sign problem.While sign-problem-free QMC algorithms exist, they have been confined to simple models with limited predictive power for real nuclei.Here we overcome this barrier by developing a novel lattice nuclear force that is rigorously sign-problem-free for even-even nuclei. This interaction achieves a standard deviation of $\sigma = 2.932$ MeV from experimental binding energies for 76 even-even nuclei ($N,Z \leq 28$), matching state-of-the-art phenomenological mean-field models.Key innovations include the first sign-problem-free implementation of spin-orbit coupling for shell evolutions and an efficient QMC-optimized framework for global parameter fitting.Using this approach, we compute binding energies from $^4$He to $^{132}$Sn, symmetric nuclear matter saturation, and reveal novel spin-orbit-driven clustering in light nuclei. This work transforms sign-problem-free QMC into a scalable and predictive nuclear structure tool, establishing a non-perturbative foundation for \textit{ab initio} calculations extending to heavy nuclei.</description>

      <title>Connecting dilaton thermal fluctuation with the Polyakov loop at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the character of the deconfinement phase transition is one of the fundamental challenges in particle physics. In this work, we derive a formula for the expectation value of the Polyakov loop -- the order parameter of the deconfinement phase transition -- in pure $\mathrm{SU(N_{\mathrm{c}})}$ gauge systems at finite temperatures starting from the Coleman\textendash Weinberg-type effective potential encoding the trace anomaly of QCD. Our results are in good agreement with the Lattice QCD data and can effectively describe the large-$N_{\mathrm{c}}$ behaviors of the expectation value of the Polyakov loop. Notably, our findings predict the strongest first-order deconfinement phase transition as $N_{\mathrm{c}} \to +\infty$. Furthermore, to establish a relation between the dilaton field and the Polyakov loop, we also derive the scale transformation rule for temperature based on quantum statistical mechanics. The results of this work may shed a light on the connection between deconfinement phase transition and evolution of scale symmetry in the thermal system.</description>

      <title>Global QCD analysis of spin PDFs in the proton with high-$x$ and lattice constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive global QCD analysis of spin-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs), combining all available data on inclusive and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), as well as inclusive weak boson and jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions, simultaneously extracting spin-averaged PDFs and fragmentation functions. Including recent Jefferson Lab DIS data at high $x$, together with subleading power corrections to the leading twist framework, allows us to verify the stability of the PDFs for $W^2 \geq 4$ GeV$^2$ and quantify the uncertainties on the spin structure functions more reliably. We explore the use of new lattice QCD data on gluonic pseudo Ioffe-time distributions, which, together with jet production and high-$x$ DIS data, improve the constraints on the polarized gluon PDF. The expanded kinematic reach afforded by the data into the high-$x$ region allows us to refine the bounds on higher twist contributions to the spin structure functions, and test the validity of the Bjorken sum rule.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. This work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new venues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Second order fluctuations of conserved charges in external magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first-principles lattice QCD investigation of second-order fluctuations of and correlations among conserved charges -- baryon number (B), electric charge (Q), and strangeness (S) -- in the presence of external magnetic fields. Our study employs lattice simulations of (2+1)-flavor QCD with physical pion masses using highly improved staggered fermions (HISQ) on $48^3 \times 12$ and $32^3 \times 8$ lattices, covering a wide range of magnetic field strengths up to $eB \simeq 0.8$ GeV$ ^2$. We identify clear signals of magnetic field-induced modifications to these fluctuations and correlations, with the baryon-electric charge correlation, $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$, exhibiting particularly strong sensitivity to the magnetic field. To bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observables, we implement systematic kinematic cuts that emulate detector acceptances of the STAR and ALICE experiments within the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model and construct proxy observables for fluctuations measurable in heavy-ion collision experiments. Our findings highlight $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ as a promising ``magnetometer" for probing the presence of magnetic fields in QCD matter. Furthermore, we explore experimentally relevant ratios involving $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$, demonstrating their potential in mitigating volume effects and enhancing sensitivity to magnetic fields in collision environments. Additionally, we assess the limitations of the HRG model at strong magnetic fields, revealing deviations that indicate nontrivial modifications to hadronic degrees of freedom. These results offer new insights into the interplay between thermal and magnetic effects in the QCD phase diagram and provide experimentally relevant guidance for the detection of magnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm for group manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is a reliable and versatile algorithm for addressing the sign problem. It resolves the ergodicity issues commonly encountered in Lefschetz thimble-based approaches at a low computational cost. In this article, as a first step toward applying WV-HMC to lattice QCD, we extend the algorithm to cases where the configuration space is a group manifold. The key idea is to formulate the algorithm using a phase-space integral over the tangent bundle of the worldvolume, which naturally carries a symplectic structure. The validity of this novel algorithm is demonstrated using the one-site model with a purely imaginary coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Generalized Parton Distributions from Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI/ML informed Symbolic Regression is the next stage of scientific modeling. We utilize a highly customizable symbolic regression package ``PySR" to model the $x$ and $t$ dependence of the flavor isovector combination $H_{u-d}(x,t,\xi)$ at $\xi=0$. These PySR models were trained on GPD results provided by both Lattice QCD and phenomenological sources GGL, GK, and VGG. We demonstrate, for the first time, the consistency and systematic convergence of Symbolic Regression by quantifying the disparate models through their Taylor expansion coefficients. In addition to PySR penalizing models with higher complexity and mean-squared error, we implement schemes that test specific physics hypotheses, including force-factorized $x$ and $t$ dependence and Regge behavior in PySR GPDs. We show that PySR can identify factorizing GPD sources based on their response to the Force-Factorized model. Knowing the precise behavior of the GPDs, and their uncertainties in a wide range in $x$ and $t$, crucially impacts our ability to concretely and quantitatively predict hadronic spatial distributions and their derived quantities.</description>
