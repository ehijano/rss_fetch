      <title>Weak Diffeomorphisms and Extremals for Scalar Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar conservation laws in one space variable allow a Lagrangian (particle path) formulation. The Lagrangian trajectory in the infinite-dimensional group of diffeomorphisms on the physical space can be written as a system of conservation laws. The relation between solutions of the Cauchy problem for the conservation law and solutions of the corresponding Cauchy problem on the diffeomorphism group extends to weak solutions of the coresponding problems. The correspondence between particle paths and transport equations is analogous to that between a Lie group and the corresponding Lie algebra.
  This paper establishes that for scalar conservation laws the particle paths are extremals of an action functional on the space of diffeomorphisms; that is, they are geodesics in some metric. In some examples of systems of conservation laws, including the physical example of isentropic gas dynamics in one space dimension, diffeomorphism representations also exist and may be interpreted as extremals of action functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Cauchy's problem of the compressible Euler system with damping and establish the global-in-time well-posedness in $L^p$-type critical Besov spaces for $1\leq p&lt;2$. To achieve it, a new product estimate is established in $L^2$-$L^p$ hybrid Besov spaces.</description>

      <title>Global three-dimensional subsonic Euler flows past an axisymmetric obstacle with large vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence and uniqueness of subsonic solutions to the steady Euler flows past a smooth, axisymmetric obstacle. Specifically, for a broad class of prescribed positive axial velocities in the upstream, the subsonic Euler flow exists provided that the upstream density exceeds a critical threshold. The non-degeneracy of the axial velocity is rigorously established by combining the strong maximum principle with a refined continuity argument. The asymptotic behavior of the flow is obtained from uniform integral estimates for the difference between the flow and the upstream state. In addition, this result accommodates flows with large vorticity under a structural condition, thereby differing from previous results in the two-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Uniform Stability of Oscillatory Shocks for KdV-Burgers Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the viscous-dispersive shock profile with infinite oscillations of the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers (KdVB) equation. First, we establish detail structures of the shock wave, including the rate at which the local extrema converge to the left end state towards the left far field. Then, by exploiting the structural properties of the shock, we show the $L^2$ contraction property of the shock profile under arbitrarily large perturbations, up to a time-dependent shift. This result implies both time-asymptotic stability and uniform stability with respect to the viscosity and dispersion coefficients. This uniformity yields zero viscosity-dispersion limits.</description>

      <title>Circle-like concentrated solutions for two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the normalized solutions of the following two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) system
  \begin{equation}\left\{ \begin{split}
  -\Delta u + (\lambda+P(x))u &amp;= \alpha u^3 +\beta uv^2, &amp;&amp; \text{in } \mathbb{R}^2,\\-\Delta v + (\lambda+Q(x))v &amp;= \gamma v^3 +\beta u^2 v, &amp;&amp; \text{in } \mathbb{R}^2, \end{split} \right.\end{equation}
  with $L^2$-constraint $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^2}(u^2+v^2)\,dx = 1.$$ For any $\alpha&gt;0$, $\gamma &gt; 0$ and $\ \beta \in (-\sqrt{\alpha\gamma},0)\cup(0,\min \{\alpha,\gamma\})\cup \left(\max \{\alpha,\gamma\} , + \infty\right)$, we establish the existence of synchronized solutions concentrating on high-dimensional subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ by employing a finite-dimensional reduction method combined with some local Pohozaev identities. More precisely, we construct vector radial solutions that concentrate on circles when $ \frac{\alpha + \gamma - 2\beta}{\alpha\gamma - \beta^2}$ tends to zero. Our results fill the blank in the system for high-dimensional concentrated normalized solutions.</description>

      <title>Generically sharp decay and blowing up at infinity for a weak null wave system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system of semilinear wave equations satisfying the weak null condition, which can be regarded as a simplified model for the Einstein vacuum equations. The main objective is to establish precise pointwise decay estimates, as both lower and upper bounds of decay, for small data solutions. Specifically, we show that the difference between the solution and its leading-order term is dominated by lower-order terms that decay faster in the retarded time variable $u=t-r$. Moreover, we prove that these pointwise decay estimates are sharp for a generic class of small initial data decaying sufficiently fast.
  As applications of these estimates, we demonstrate that the energy of one component of the solution admits a lower bound that generically grows to infinity as $t\to +\infty$, which can be interpreted as ``blowing up at infinity." Furthermore, we verify that this component generically exhibits an energy cascade from high to low frequencies.</description>

      <title>The regularity of the boundary of vortex patches for the quasi-geostrophic shallow-water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the persistence of boundary smoothness of vortex patches for the quasi-geostrophic shallow-water (QGSW) equations. The QGSW equations generalize the Euler equations by including an additional parameter, the Rossby radius $\varepsilon^{-1}$, which modifies the relationship between the streamfunction and the (potential) vorticity. In addition, we prove that solutions of the QGSW equations converge locally in time to the corresponding Euler solutions as $\varepsilon \to 0$ in little H\"older spaces.</description>

      <title>Long finite time bubble trees for two co-rotational wave maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the energy critical Wave Maps equation from $\mathbb{R}^{2+1}$ into $\mathbb{S}^2$, restricted to the $k=2$ co-rotational setting, admits arbitrarily large numbers of concentrating concentric $n$ bubble profiles. For any $n\in\mathbb{N}$, we construct an $n$-bubble solution concentrating at scales $\lambda_1(t)\gg \lambda_2(t)\gg \ldots\gg \lambda_n(t)$, where $\lambda_n(t)=t^{-1}\vert \log t\vert^\beta$, and $\lambda_j(t)\gtrsim \exp( \int_t^{t_0} \lambda_{j+1}(s)ds)$, for any $j&lt;n$. Here $\beta&gt;\tfrac32$ is a parameter that can be chosen arbitrarily. This shows that, as far as finite time blow-up case is concerned, the entirety of cases postulated in the soliton resolution theorem indeed occur, provided the concentric collapsing bubbles have alternating signs.</description>

      <title>Long-time propagation of coherent states in a normally hyperbolic setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to find asymptotics for the evolution of coherent states (or Gaussian wavepackets with standard deviation $\sqrt{h}$) under semiclassical Schr\"odinger's equation for a given Hamiltonian. These results extend the work of Combescure and Robert, in which the evolution of coherent states can be approximated in the limit $h\to 0$ with deformed Gaussian wavepackets called squeezed coherent states. The description with squeezed states holds for times $t$ that can go to infinity as $h\to 0$, under the constraint $|t|\leq |\log h|/(6\lambda_0)$ where $\lambda_0$ is the maximal Lyapunov exponent of the classical dynamics. The breakdown of this approximation at time $|\log h|/(6\lambda_0)$ is related to the bending of evolved wavepackets: once propagated states spread at a scale $h^{1/3}$, squeezed states no longer provide an appropriate description. To obtain a representation of propagated states valid up to times $|t|\leq C|\log h|$ with a larger $C$ (for instance, up to Ehrenfest's time $|\log h|/(2\lambda_0)$ where spreading on macroscopic scales is allowed), we make additional assumptions on the flow $\Phi_t$ associated to the classical dynamics, imposing constraints on directions of elongation. Namely, we work in a neighborhood of a normally hyperbolic $\Phi_t$-invariant submanifold $K$, on which the dynamics is considered as slow in comparison with its transverse directions, along which $\Phi_t$ is assumed to be hyperbolic. In this context, we describe the propagated state as a WKB state in transverse directions and a squeezed state along $K$. This description emphasizes the fact that propagated states should no longer be thought of as microlocalized on a point, but rather on an isotropic submanifold (corresponding to transverse unstable directions). Guillemin, Uribe, and Wang presented a similar class of wavefunctions microlocalized on an isotropic submanifold.</description>

      <title>Orbital stability of monostable waves for reaction-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stability of monostable waves for reaction-diffusion systems. When the solution is initially close to a fast wave profile in optimal topology, we prove convergence to a shifted profile. The proof relies on explicit resolvent kernels estimates, allowing to handle weakly localized perturbations. It allows phase shift construction even when the translational eigenvalue is not associated to a zero of the Evans function.
  We further discuss distinction between Evans and Fourier eigenmodes when the marginal group velocity are directed towards the wave interface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlocal energy corresponding to the $p$-oscillation of the unit normal vector for hypersurfaces, or the unit tangent vector for curves. The energy satisfies geometric inequalities with optimal constants $c(n,p)$ and $C(n,p)$ which are determined by a variational problem over the probability measures on the sphere. The extremal measures for such problem depend critically on the value of $p$. We prove existence of optimal sets for this energy under perimeter and volume constraint, and characterize their shape.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a class of non-local equations that are weakly dispersive perturbations of the inviscid Burgers equation, which includes the Fornberg-Whitham equation as a special case. We precise the known results on finite time blow-up (shock formation) by constructing a blowup solution which displays a `shock-like' singularity (called wave breaking) at one single point. Moreover, this solution converges asymptotically in the self-similar variables to a stable self-similar solution of the inviscid Burgers equation, and also possesses a H\"{o}lder $C^{1/3}$ regularity at the blowup point.</description>

      <title>Blow-Up Theory and Liouville-Type Theorem for Solutions of a Class of Generalized Camassa-Holm-Kadomtsev-Petviashvili Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the blow-up behavior and Liouville-type theorems of solutions to a class of generalized Camassa-Holm-Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (CH-KP) equations with a generally smooth nonlinear term $g(u)$. First, using the continuation method, we establish a blow-up criterion that is independent of the regularity index of initial data. Under the assumption that $ g'(u)$ is uniformly bounded, we prove the blow-up theorem and a weighted blow-up result by means of characteristic lines, a priori estimates and the Riccati inequality. Moreover, we extend these blow-up results to the setting where $g'(u)$ is polynomially controlled, which includes typical nonlinearities such as $ g(u)=\kappa u+3u^2 $ for the classical CH-KP equations. Furthermore, a Liouville-type uniqueness theorem is established under the condition $g(u) \geq \gamma u^2$ with $u \neq 0$, $g(u)&gt;\gamma u^2$.</description>

      <title>Unique Determination of Variable Order in Subdiffusion from a Single Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inverse problem of recovering a spatially dependent variable order in a time-fractional diffusion model from the boundary flux measurement generated by a single boundary excitation. It arises in the identification of heterogeneous media in anomalous diffusion processes. In this work, we establish several new uniqueness results for the inverse problem in the case of piecewise constant variable orders, without any monotonicity condition. The analysis follows a new approach that combines properties of harmonic functions, a linearization technique in the Laplace domain, and tools from complex, asymptotic, and geometrical analysis. In addition, we weaken the regularity assumptions on the problem data and extend the analysis of previous contributions to higher-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>A Single Equation Explains Go-or-Grow Dynamics in Cyclic Hypoxia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a minimal mathematical framework to describe the go-or-grow dynamics of tumor cells comprising two phenotypically distinct populations. One population is migratory and undergoes linear diffusion, while the other proliferates in an oxygen-dependent manner. The local oxygen concentration governs transitions between these phenotypes. We then ask whether these two coupled phenotype-specific equations can be reduced to a single mixed-phenotype equation under cyclic hypoxia. We establish a connection between the minimal go-or-grow model with distinct phenotypic populations and a reduced model describing a single-cell population with oxygen-dependent diffusion and proliferation in the fast-phenotypic-switching regime. This theoretical reduction is validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Local Invariant Structures in the Dynamics of Capillary Water Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical experiments show that a capillary water jet is exponentially unstable under long-wave perturbations, while remaining stable under short-wave perturbations. Measurements further indicate that the exponential growth rate in the long-wave regime agrees quantitatively with the classical predictions of Rayleigh and Plateau. This phenomenon is known as the \emph{Rayleigh-Plateau instability}. In this paper, we provide a mathematical justification of these experimental observations. The motion of the water jet is modeled by an irrotational Eulerian free-boundary system governed by surface tension. We prove that the (un)stable directions in the linearized system, corresponding to long-wave perturbations, are indeed tangent to an (un)stable invariant manifold of the full nonlinear system. On the other hand, the elliptic directions, corresponding to short-wave perturbations, are indeed tangent to a center invariant set in a generalized sense. These results give a positive answer to the question raised by Lin-Zeng concerning the existence of invariant manifolds for Eulerian free-boundary systems. The major methodological contribution is the construction of ``paradifferential propagator" corresponding to linear paradifferential hyperbolic systems along elliptic directions, making Lyapunov-Perron type arguments applicable. The method effectively balances the loss of regularity in quasilinear problems and can be generalized to a broader class of PDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the solution to the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations arising from a sum of Dirac masses in a particular co-rotating configuration. This configuration consists of a polygonal vortex crystal with or without a central vortex. By exploiting the symmetries and stability properties of the system, we describe and control the solution up to sub-diffusive time scales, prior to the expected onset of vortex merging.</description>

      <title>Low-Mach-number limit of a compressible two-phase flow system with algebraic closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse a bi-fluid isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes system with barotropic pressure laws in a two-phase framework with equal pressure and single velocity. We focus on the rigorous analysis of the low Mach number limit under well-prepared initial data. Our main result shows that, as the Mach number tends to zero, the partial densities converge to constant states while the velocity field converges to a divergence-free vector field, and we recover the incompressible non-homogenous fluid system. The volume fractions remain nontrivial and are transported by the limit flow. Our method is based on the introduction of suitable modulated quantities and a novel relative entropy functional adapted to the two-phase structure. The key novelty lies in an original comparison of L1 and L2 norms of the partial densities, exploiting the special structure of the bi-fluid system, together with a variant of Csiszar-Kullback- Pinsker inequality. It allows us to rigorously justify the convergence of weak solutions of the compressible system toward solutions of the corresponding incompressible limit system in the low Mach number regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider conformally flat Lipschitz viscosity solutions to the $\sigma_k$-Yamabe equation in the negative cone which admit smooth hypersurface singularities. Under natural regularity assumptions (that are satisfied by solutions to the $\sigma_k$-Loewner-Nirenberg problem on annuli, for example), we first prove that the trace and normal derivatives of such a solution along the hypersurface satisfy a certain PDE. For $k=2$, we also show that the hypersurface is minimal with respect to the Lipschitz solution and address some questions related to the formal expansion of the solution near the hypersurface.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in the weakly coupled 4D Anderson Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the weak coupling limit of the Anderson Hamiltonian in the critical dimension $d=4$. In a perturbative sense, we prove Gaussian fluctuations about the Green's function of the Laplacian. The fluctuations are described by an explicit effective variance, up to a critical value of the coupling constant at which we expect a phase transition in the structure of the fluctuations. The proof is based on a combinatorial analysis of Feynman diagrams, and on a detailed study of the BPHZ renormalisation of the model. We characterise the limiting distribution in terms of primitive blow-ups, and prove that no Laplacian renormalisation is present. Our approach seems applicable to a broad class of equations.</description>

      <title>Calibrations for the Sasaki volume on odd spheres and the no-gap problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each odd sphere $S^{n}$ with $n=2m+1\ge 5$, we consider the Sasaki volume functional $\mathrm{Vol}^S(V)=\int_{S^{n}}\sqrt{\det(I+(\nabla V)^{\top}(\nabla V))}\,d\mathrm{vol}$ on smooth unit tangent vector fields $V$. Using the Brito--Chacon--Naveira calibration $\omega=a\wedge\Theta$ on the unit tangent bundle $E=UTS^{n}$, we establish the universal calibrated lower bound $\mathrm{Vol}^S(V)\ge c(m;1)\,\mathrm{vol}(S^{n})$, where $c(m;1)=4^{m}/\binom{2m}{m}$. In the relaxed (integral-current) setting, we show that the section-constrained stable mass in $E$ equals the calibration value and is attained by an $\omega$-calibrated mass-minimizing integral $n$-cycle in the section class.
  We also analyze the equality case on smooth graphs. If a smooth graph is $\omega$-calibrated on an open set, then it satisfies the rigidity system $\nabla_V V=0$ and $\nabla_X V=\lambda X$ for all $X\perp V$, hence is locally a radial distance-gradient field. In particular, for $m\ge 2$ there is no smooth unit field on $S^n$ whose graph is $\omega$-calibrated everywhere.
  Finally, we construct an explicit smooth recovery sequence (presented in detail for $S^5$ and then extended to all odd dimensions) and prove a uniform nonvanishing estimate for the polar-shell normalization in the patching construction. As a consequence, $\inf_{V}\,\mathrm{Vol}^S(V)=c(m;1)\,\mathrm{vol}(S^{n})$, so there is no Lavrentiev gap.</description>

Abstract: We consider perturbations of the one-dimensional cubic Schr\"odinger equation, under the form $i \, \partial_t \psi + \partial_x^2 \psi + |\psi|^2 \psi - g( |\psi|^2 ) \psi = 0$. Under hypotheses on the function g that can be easily verified in some cases, we show that the linearized problem around a solitary wave does not have internal mode (nor resonance) and we prove the asymptotic stability of these solitary waves, for small frequencies.</description>

      <title>Low Regularity of Self-Similar Solutions of Two-Dimensional Riemann problems with Shocks for the Isentropic Euler system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with the low regularity of self-similar solutions of two-dimensional Riemann problems for the isentropic Euler system. We establish a general framework for the analysis of the local regularity of such solutions for a class of two-dimensional Riemann problems for the isentropic Euler system, which includes the regular shock reflection problem, the Prandtl reflection problem, the Lighthill diffraction problem, and the four-shock Riemann problem. We prove that the velocity is not in $H^1$ in the subsonic domain for the self-similar solutions of these problems in general. This indicates that the self-similar solutions of the Riemann problems with shocks for the isentropic Euler system are of much more complicated structure than those for the Euler system for potential flow; in particular, the velocity is not necessarily continuous in the subsonic domain. The proof is based on a regularization of the isentropic Euler system to derive the transport equation for the vorticity, a renormalization argument extended to the case of domains with boundary, and DiPerna-Lions-type commutator estimates.</description>

      <title>An alternative solvability criterion for the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation and an application to the mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09806v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an alternative condition for the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation that applies to non-mean convex domains. We introduce a structural condition, obtained from a second-order ordinary differential equation, which allows the construction of explicit boundary barriers and it can also be applied to unbounded domains. In the setting of Hadamard manifolds, this condition relates the geometry of the domain to the admissible boundary data in a direct way.
  In Euclidean space, the condition leads to solvability under geometric hypotheses of a different nature from those in the classical Jenkins-Serrin theory, and in some configurations it applies where the Jenkins-Serrin method does not. A central point of the present approach is that the geometric restrictions and the boundary data enter independently.
  The same barrier construction can be used for graphical mean curvature flow. This yields short-time existence with prescribed boundary values even when the boundary of the domain is not mean convex. When mean convexity is present, one recovers the classical graphical setting.</description>

      <title>On the classical solution for the steady triple-deck equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions to the steady Triple-Deck equations, which describe incompressible boundary layer flow over localized roughness at high Reynolds numbers.
  The triple-deck theory was developed to overcome the Goldstein singularity in classical Prandtl boundary layer theory, capturing the interaction between the viscous sublayer, main layer, and upper layer when surface roughness of height $O({\rm Re}^{-\frac58})$ is present. The key ingredients of this paper include: (1) A decomposition separating roughness effects from nonlinear difficulties;
  (2) A novel Green's function using Airy functions that overcomes low-frequency singularities via the non-vanishing property of $\sqrt{3}Ai(z)+Bi(z)$;
  (3) The introduction of weighted Sobolev norms $\norm{|\p_x|^{\frac{1}{18}}y^{\frac16}\omega}_{L^2}$ of the vorticity yielding $M$-independent estimates for displacement $A$.
  As a byproduct, local uniqueness of Couette flow is established when $F=0$.</description>

Abstract: We consider hypothetical solutions of 3D Euler which blow up in finite time in a self-similar fashion. We prove that if the initial data has finite kinetic energy, then the similarity exponent $\gamma$ which governs the rate of zooming in must be larger than $2/5$. If a smooth globally self-similar blowup profile exists, and this profile satisfies an outgoing property, we prove that $\gamma \geq 1/2$. For axisymmetric solutions, we establish the bound $\gamma\geq 1/2$ in more general settings, including ones in which the outgoing property is not present.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and Regularity of the Integral Invariant Model from Linear Scalar Transport Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An integral invariant model derived from the coupling of the transport equation and its adjoint equation is investigated.Despite extensive research on the numerical implementation of this model,no studies have yet explored the well-posedness and regularity of the model itself.To address this gap,firstly, a comprehensive mathematical definition is formulated as a Cauchy initial value problem for the integral invariant model.This formulation preserves essential background information derived from relevant numerical algorithms.In the above definition,we directly evolve the time-dependent test function $\psi(\mathbf{x},t)$ through explicit construction rather than solving the adjoint equation,which enables reducing the required regularity of the test function $\Psi(\mathbf{x})$ from $C^1(\Omega)$ to $L^2(\Omega)$,contributing to stability proof. The challenge arising from the mismatch of integration domains on both sides of the model's equivalent form is overcome through the compact support property of test functions. For any arbitrary time instant $t^{*}\in[0,T]$,an abstract function $\mathcal{U}(\lambda)$ taking values in the Banach space $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is initially constructed on the entire space $\mathbb{R}^d$ via the Riesz representation theorem.Subsequently,this function is properly restricted to the time-dependent bounded domain $\widetilde{\Omega}(t)$ through multiplication by the characteristic function. The existence of this model's solution in $L^{1}([0,T],L^2(\widetilde{\Omega}(t)))$ is then rigorously established.Furthermore,by judiciously selecting test functions $\Psi$, the stability of the integral invariant model is proved, from which the uniqueness naturally follows.Finally, when the initial value \(\widetilde{U}_0 \in L^{2}(\widetilde{\Omega}(0))\),the temporal integrability of the model over $[0,T]$ can be enhanced to \(L^{\infty}([0,T],L^2(\widetilde{\Omega}(t)))\).</description>

      <title>Shape optimization of metastable states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The definition of metastable states is an ubiquitous task in the design and analysis of molecular simulation, and is a crucial input in a variety of acceleration methods for the sampling of long configurational trajectories.
  Although standard definitions based on local energy minimization procedures can sometimes be used, these definitions are typically suboptimal, or entirely inadequate when entropic effects are significant, or when the lowest energy barriers are quickly overcome by thermal fluctuations.
  In this work, we propose an approach to the definition of metastable states, based on the shape-optimization of a local separation of timescale metric directly linked to the efficiency of a class of accelerated molecular dynamics algorithms.
  To realize this approach, we derive analytic expressions for shape-variations of Dirichlet eigenvalues for a class of operators associated with reversible elliptic diffusions, and use them to construct a local ascent algorithm, explicitly treating the case of multiple eigenvalues.
  We propose two methods to make our method tractable in high-dimensional systems: one based on dynamical coarse-graining, the other on recently obtained low-temperature shape-sensitive spectral asymptotics.
  We validate our method on a benchmark biomolecular system, showcasing a significant improvement over conventional definitions of metastable states.</description>

Abstract: Assuming $A$ has maximal $L^p$-regularity, this paper investigates perturbations of $A$ by time-dependent operators $B$ that are unbounded and satisfy a critical $L^q$-integrability condition in time. We establish two main results. The first proves maximal $L^p$-regularity for the critical endpoint case, generalizing previous work by Pr\"uss and Schnaubelt (2001). The second develops a weighted maximal regularity theory for mixed-scale perturbations, motivated by the linearized skeleton equations appearing in large deviations theory for stochastic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Real Bers embedding on the line: Fisher-Rao linearization, Schwarzian curvature, and scattering coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a real-analytic counterpart of the Bers embedding for the Fr\'echet Lie group $\Diff^{-\infty}(\R)$ of decay-controlled diffeomorphisms of the line, and establish its connection to $L^p$ Fisher-Rao geometry on densities. For $p\in[1,\infty)$, the $p$-root map $\varphi\mapsto p(\varphi'^{1/p}-1)$ isometrically linearizes the homogeneous $\dot W^{1,p}$ Finsler metric on $\Diff^{-\infty}(\R)$, yielding explicit geodesics and a canonical flat connection whose Eulerian geodesic equation is the generalized Hunter-Saxton equation; for $p=\infty$, logarithmic coordinates $\varphi\mapsto\log\varphi'$ provide a global isometry and the Schwarzian derivative emerges as the projective curvature. We construct a real Bers map $\beta^{-\infty}\colon\Diff^{-\infty}(\R)/\Aff(\R)\to W^{\infty,1}(\R)$ via this Schwarzian, prove it is a Fr\'echet-smooth injective immersion whose linearization admits a tame right inverse given by an explicit Volterra operator, and characterize its image through Sturm-Liouville spectral theory. We introduce an $L^p$-Schwarzian family $S_p$ that interpolates between affine and projective cocycles, establish full asymptotic expansions as $p\to\infty$ in Fr\'echet and Orlicz-Sobolev scales, and extend the Bers embedding to Orlicz diffeomorphism groups. Through the Jacobian correspondence, these structures transfer to a manifold of densities asymptotic to Lebesgue measure, where the nonlinear Eulerian transport reduces to a pointwise Riccati law and the Schwarzian becomes the score curvature governing Fisher information. The compact-manifold $L^p$ Fisher-Rao linearization of Bauer, Bruveris, Harms, and Michor is recalled as a guiding framework.</description>
