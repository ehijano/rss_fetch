      <title>Probing the hollowing transition of a shell-shaped BEC with collective excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the hollowing transition of a shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate using collective excitations. The shell is created using an immiscible dual-species BEC mixture, with its hollowness controlled by tuning the repulsive interspecies interaction via a Feshbach resonance. Our results reveal two distinct monopole modes in which the two condensates oscillate either in-phase or out-of-phase. The spectrum of the out-of-phase mode exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the interspecies interaction, providing a clear signature of the topology change from a filled to a hollow condensate. Furthermore, we find that the critical point of the hollowing transition depends strongly on the number ratio of the two species. Our findings provide a detailed understanding of the topology change in shell-shaped quantum gases and pave the way for future study of quantum many-body phenomena in curved spaces.</description>

      <title>Three-body Physics in the Impurity Limit of 39K Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loss spectroscopy is a key tool for investigating systems where important system parameters are linked to intrinsic resonant loss processes. We investigate three-body loss processes of impurity atoms embedded in a medium of a Bose-Einstein Condensate close to a Feshbach resonance. In this case, the loss processes occur faster than the measurement duration, impeding a direct time-resolved measurement. Here, we discuss how an even faster two-body loss process can be used to probe the system. The time-dependent number of atoms in the medium is reconstructed from such measurements, allowing for a measurement of the three-body loss rate coefficient $L_3$ and its scaling with scattering length. Moreover, the medium atom number is reconstructed from spectroscopic loss measurements. This allows for a comparison of the medium densities based on both the extracted loss rates and the spectroscopically reconstructed atom number. Finally, the number of lost medium atoms per loss event is evaluated and found to exceed 2 at strong interactions, which is attributed to secondary collisions in the medium. These investigations establish the use of a fast loss mechanism as a new tool in the field and provide quantitative measurements of three-body losses at large interaction strengths.</description>

      <title>From Light-Cone to Supersonic Propagation of Correlations by Competing Short- and Long-Range Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Universality of a Squeezing Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate phase transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of power-law interacting spin-1/2 bilayer XXZ models, which have recently been shown to allow generation of entanglement in the form of two-mode squeezing. We find a transition between a phase characterized by Heisenberg limited squeezing and a partially collective phase. We identify universal scaling of the squeezing dynamics in terms of system parameters and a divergent time-scale, establishing these as distinct dynamical phases. Our work demonstrates a novel dynamical phase transition with potential applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation in cold-atomic, molecular or Rydberg platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetars, highly magnetized neutron stars, host superconducting and superfluid phases. We develop a minimal model that captures the interplay between neutron superfluidity, proton superconductivity, and electromagnetic fields using the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson, Ginzburg-Landau, and Maxwell equations. Our numerical simulations show that strong rotation enhances the net magnetic field inside the magnetar, suppresses superconductivity there, and amplifies the field near the surface. We explain this by a theory that makes testable predictions, including gravitational-wave signatures.</description>

      <title>qReduMIS: A Quantum-Informed Reduction Algorithm for the Maximum Independent Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement a quantum-informed reduction algorithm for the maximum independent set problem that integrates classical kernelization techniques with information extracted from quantum devices. Our larger framework consists of dedicated application, algorithm, and hardware layers, and easily generalizes to the maximum weight independent set problem. In this hybrid quantum-classical framework, which we call qReduMIS, the quantum computer is used as a co-processor to inform classical reduction logic about frozen vertices that are likely (or unlikely) to be in large independent sets, thereby opening up the reduction space after removal of targeted subgraphs. We systematically assess the performance of qReduMIS based on experiments with up to 231 qubits run on Rydberg quantum hardware available through Amazon Braket. Our experiments show that qReduMIS can help address fundamental performance limitations faced by a broad set of (quantum) solvers including Rydberg quantum devices. We outline implementations of qReduMIS with alternative platforms, such as superconducting qubits or trapped ions, and we discuss potential future extensions.</description>

      <title>From time crystals to time quasicrystals: Exploring novel phases in transverse field Ising chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time crystals (TCs) and time quasicrystals (TQCs) represent novel phases of matter that arise from the breaking of time translational symmetry in periodically and quasiperiodically driven quantum systems. In this study, we explore the formation of a TQC phase within the disordered quantum Ising chain model under a transverse field (ITF). Notably, TQCs demonstrate robust subharmonic responses at multiple incommensurate frequencies, unlike traditional TCs which respond at a single frequency. Our analysis reveals that the TQC phase exhibits stable magnetization responses even in the presence of interaction perturbations and imperfections in the quasiperiodic driving fields. Employing exact diagonalization techniques, we find that increasing the chain length further stabilizes both TC and TQC phases. These results suggest promising pathways for experimental realization of TQCs in cold atomic systems and quantum simulators, opening avenues for deeper investigation into these intriguing dynamical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Strongly-Interacting Regime of Effective Multi-Body Interactions in a Trapped Ultracold Atom System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A two-body interaction or force between quantum particles is ubiquitous in nature, and the microscopic description in terms of the bare two-body interaction is the basis for quantitatively describing interacting few- and many-body systems. Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range, we experimentally reveal the behaviors of few-atom systems in a strongly interacting regime. Our results, for which perturbative calculations do not provide proper explanations, serve as a valuable and precise benchmark for theoretical approaches to strongly interacting few-body systems. As one important illustration, we obtain a clear signature of an effective four-body interaction evidenced by the binding energies of four and more atoms. This work is an important step for our deeper understanding of strongly interacting few-body systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Polar-Core Spin Vortices in Inhomogeneous Spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the easy-plane phase, a ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate is magnetized in a plane transverse to the applied Zeeman field. This phase supports polar-core spin vortices (PCVs), which consist of phase windings of transverse magnetization. Here we show that spin-changing collisions cause a PCV to accelerate down density gradients in an inhomogeneous condensate. The dynamics is well-described by a simplified model adapted from scalar systems, which predicts the dependence of the dynamics on trap tightness and quadratic Zeeman energy. In a harmonic trap, a PCV accelerates radially to the condensate boundary, in stark contrast to the azimuthal motion of vortices in a scalar condensate. In a trap that has a local potential maximum at the centre, the PCV exhibits oscillations around the trap centre, which persist for a remarkably long time. The oscillations coincide with the emission and reabsorption of axial spin waves, which reflect off the condensate boundary.</description>

      <title>Space-time first-order correlations of an open Bose-Hubbard model with incoherent pump and loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the correlation properties in the steady state of driven-dissipative interacting bosonic systems in the quantum regime, as for example non-linear photonic cavities. Specifically, we consider the Bose-Hubbard model on a periodic chain and with spatially homogeneous one-body loss and pump within the Markovian approximation. The steady state is non-thermal and is formally equivalent to an infinite-temperature state with finite chemical potential set by the dissipative parameters. While there is no effect of interactions on the steady state, we observe a nontrivial behaviour of the space-time two-point correlation function, obtained by exact diagonalisation. In particular, we find that the decay width of the propagator is not only renormalised at increasing interactions, as it is the case of a single non-linear resonator, but also at increasing hopping strength. Furthermore, we numerically predict at large interactions a plateau value of the decay rate which goes beyond perturbative results in the interaction strength. We then compute the full spectral function, finding that it contains both a dispersive free-particle like dispersion at low energy and a doublon branch at energy corresponding to the on-site interactions. We compare with the corresponding calculation for the ground state of a closed quantum system and show that the driven-dissipative nature -- determining both the steady state and the dynamical evolution -- changes the low-lying part of the spectrum, where noticeably, the dispersion is quadratic instead of linear at small wavevectors. Finally, we compare to a high temperature grand-canonical equilibrium state and show the difference with respect to the open system stemming from the additional degree of freedom of the dissipation that allows one to vary the width of the dispersion lines.</description>

      <title>Phases and dynamics of quantum droplets in the crossover to two-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the ground states and dynamics of ultracold atomic droplets in the crossover region from three to two dimensions by solving the two-dimensional and the quasi two-dimensional extended Gross-Pitaevskii equations numerically and with a variational approach. By systematically comparing the droplet properties, we determine the validity regions of the pure two-dimensional description, and therefore the dominance of the logarithmic nonlinear coupling, as a function of the sign of the averaged mean-field interactions and the size of the transverse confinement. One of our main findings is that droplets become substantially extended upon transitioning from negative-to-positive averaged mean-field interactions. This is accompanied by a significant reduction of their binding energies which are approximately inversely proportional to the square of their size. To explore fundamental dynamical properties in the crossover region, we study interaction quenches and show that the droplets perform a periodic breathing motion for modest quench strengths, while larger quench amplitudes lead to continuous expansion exhibiting density ring structures. We also showcase that it is possible to form complex bulk and surface density patterns in anisotropic geometries following the quench. Since we are working with realistic parameters, our results can directly facilitate future experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Effects of gravity on supersolid order in bubble-trapped bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unveiling the principles behind self-organization in quantum systems is of paramount importance, both intrinsically and practically, in view of foreseeable technological applications. Recently, increasing attention is being paid to atomic systems in curved geometries, which are a promising platform for the discovery of new emergent phenomena. A notable example is that of a gas of ultracold atoms loaded into a thin spherical shell, according to a protocol introduced by Zobay and Garraway more than twenty years ago. However, gravity prevents a dilute assembly of atoms from uniformly spreading throughout the shell, which explains why experiments on the condensation and superfluidity of bubble-trapped gases are usually conducted in space under microgravity conditions. In this paper, we focus instead on strongly-interacting quantum particles in a bubble trap, choosing the cluster supersolid of soft-core bosons as testbed. To study the impact of gravity on supersolid order, we consider a gedanken experiment in which the strength of gravity relative to the core repulsion is gradually enhanced. Using path integral Monte Carlo simulations, we trace the parallel evolution of system structure and superfluidity at low temperature, finding that the latter is sizeable only when gravity is a small perturbation or, at the other extreme, so strong that particles are all gathered in one cluster at the bottom of the trap. Finally, we assess the relevance of gravity for the equilibrium behavior of ultracold Rydberg-dressed atoms in a bubble trap, concluding that in some cases clues of the supersolid phase in the absence of gravity could be found even in a laboratory on Earth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy correction at the edge of the mean-field stability regime is known to give rise to beyond mean-field structures in a wide variety of systems. In this work, we analytically derive the LHY energy for two-, three- and four-component one-dimensional bosonic short-range interacting mixtures across the mean-field stability regime. For varying intercomponent attraction in the two-component setting, quantitative deviations from the original LHY treatment emerge being imprinted in the droplet saturation density and width. On the other hand, for repulsive interactions an unseen early onset of phase-separation occurs for both homonuclear and heteronuclear mixtures. Closed LHY expressions for the fully-symmetric three- and four-component mixtures, as well as for mixtures comprised of two identical components coupled to a third independent component are provided and found to host a plethora of mixed droplet states. Our results are expected to inspire future investigations in multicomponent systems for unveiling exotic self-bound states of matter and unravel their nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Periodically driven (Floquet) systems can exhibit possibilities beyond what can be obtained in equilibrium. Both in Floquet systems and in the related problems of discrete-time quantum walks and quantum cellular automata, a basic distinction arises among unitary time evolution operators: while all physical operators are local, not all are locally generated (i.e., generated by some local Hamiltonian). In this paper, we define the notion of equivalence up to a locally generated unitary in all Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes. We then classify noninteracting unitaries in all dimensions on this basis by showing that equivalence up to a locally generated unitary is identical to homotopy equivalence.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16975</link>

Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) describes the properties of diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in the eigenenergy basis. In this work, we propose a relation between (i) the singular behaviour of the off-diagonal part of ETH at small energy differences, and (ii) the smooth profile of the diagonal part of ETH as a function of the energy density. We establish this connection from the decay of the autocorrelation functions of local operators, which is constrained by the presence of local conserved quantities whose evolution is described by hydrodynamics. We corroborate our predictions with numerical simulations of two non-integrable spin-1 Ising models, one diffusive and one super-diffusive, which we perform using dynamical quantum typicality up to 18 spins.</description>

      <title>Engineering Bosonic Codes with Quantum Lattice Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic codes offer a hardware-efficient approach to encoding and protecting quantum information with a single continuous-variable bosonic system. In this paper, we introduce a new universal quantum gate set composed of only one type of gate element, which we call the quantum lattice gate, to engineer bosonic code states for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We develop a systematic framework for code state engineering based on the Floquet Hamiltonian engineering, where the target Hamiltonian is constructed directly from the given target state(s). We apply our method to three basic code state engineering processes, including single code state preparation, code space embedding and code space transformation. We explore the application of our method to automatic quantum error correction against single-photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource and the quantum lattice gate can be implemented on a sub-nanosecond timescale.</description>
