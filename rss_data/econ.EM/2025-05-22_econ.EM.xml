      <title>The Impact of Research and Development (R&amp;D) Expenditures on the Value Added in the Agricultural Sector of Iran</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the impact of research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures on the value added of the agricultural sector in Iran was investigated for the period 1971-2021. For data analysis, the researchers utilized the ARDL econometric model and EViews software. The results indicated that R&amp;D expenditures, both in the short and long run, have a significant positive effect on the value added in the agricultural sector. The estimated elasticity coefficient for R&amp;D expenditures in the short run was 0.45 and in the long run was 0.35, indicating that with a 1 percent increase in research and development expenditures, the value added in the agricultural sector would increase by 0.45 percent in the short run and by 0.35 percent in the long run. Moreover, variables such as capital stock, number of employees in the agricultural sector, and working days also had a significant and positive effect on the value added in the agricultural sector.</description>

      <title>Bubble Detection with Application to Green Bubbles: A Noncausal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to detect bubbles based on mixed causal and noncausal processes and their tail process representation during explosive episodes. Departing from traditional definitions of bubbles as nonstationary and temporarily explosive processes, we adopt a perspective in which prices are viewed as following a strictly stationary process, with the bubble considered an intrinsic component of its non-linear dynamics. We illustrate our approach on the phenomenon referred to as the "green bubble" in the field of renewable energy investment.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Decision-Making under Model Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, I investigate the dynamic decision problem with a finite parameter space when the functional form of conditional expected rewards is misspecified. Traditional algorithms, such as Thompson Sampling, guarantee neither an $O(e^{-T})$ rate of posterior parameter concentration nor an $O(T^{-1})$ rate of average regret. However, under mild conditions, we can still achieve an exponential convergence rate of the parameter to a pseudo truth set, an extension of the pseudo truth parameter concept introduced by White (1982). I further characterize the necessary conditions for the convergence of the expected posterior within this pseudo-truth set. Simulations demonstrate that while the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the parameters fails to converge under misspecification, the algorithm's average regret remains relatively robust compared to the correctly specified case. These findings suggest opportunities to design simple yet robust algorithms that achieve desirable outcomes even in the presence of model misspecifications.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Distributional Dynamics for Repeated Cross-Sectional and Intra-Period Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to investigate the dynamics of state distributions, which accommodate both cross-sectional distributions of repeated panels and intra-period distributions of a time series observed at high frequency. In our approach, densities of the state distributions are regarded as functional elements in a Hilbert space, and are assumed to follow a functional autoregressive model. We propose an estimator for the autoregressive operator, establish its consistency, and provide tools and asymptotics to analyze the forecast of state density and the moment dynamics of state distributions. We apply our methodology to study the time series of distributions of the GBP/USD exchange rate intra-month returns and the time series of cross-sectional distributions of the NYSE stocks monthly returns. Finally, we conduct simulations to evaluate the density forecasts based on our model.</description>

      <title>SplitWise Regression: Stepwise Modeling with Adaptive Dummy Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capturing nonlinear relationships without sacrificing interpretability remains a persistent challenge in regression modeling. We introduce SplitWise, a novel framework that enhances stepwise regression. It adaptively transforms numeric predictors into threshold-based binary features using shallow decision trees, but only when such transformations improve model fit, as assessed by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This approach preserves the transparency of linear models while flexibly capturing nonlinear effects. Implemented as a user-friendly R package, SplitWise is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that it consistently produces more parsimonious and generalizable models than traditional stepwise and penalized regression techniques.</description>

      <title>Distributional Difference-in-Differences Models with Multiple Time Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Researchers are often interested in evaluating the impact of a policy on the entire (or specific parts of the) distribution of the outcome of interest. In this paper, I provide a method to recover the whole distribution of the untreated potential outcome for the treated group in non-experimental settings with staggered treatment adoption by generalizing the existing quantile treatment effects on the treated (QTT) estimator proposed by Callaway and Li (2019). Besides the QTT, I consider different approaches that anonymously summarize the quantiles of the distribution of the outcome of interest (such as tests for stochastic dominance rankings) without relying on rank invariance assumptions. The finite-sample properties of the estimator proposed are analyzed via different Monte Carlo simulations. Despite being slightly biased for relatively small sample sizes, the proposed method's performance increases substantially when the sample size increases.</description>

      <title>Design-Based Inference under Random Potential Outcomes via Riesz Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01324v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a design-based framework for causal inference that accommodates random potential outcomes, thereby extending the classical Neyman-Rubin model in which outcomes are treated as fixed. Each unit's potential outcome is modelled as a structural mapping $\tilde{y}_i(z, \omega)$, where $z$ denotes the treatment assignment and \(\omega\) represents latent outcome-level randomness. Inspired by recent connections between design-based inference and the Riesz representation theorem, we embed potential outcomes in a Hilbert space and define treatment effects as linear functionals, yielding estimators constructed via their Riesz representers. This approach preserves the core identification logic of randomised assignment while enabling valid inference under stochastic outcome variation. We establish large-sample properties under local dependence and develop consistent variance estimators that remain valid under weaker structural assumptions, including partially known dependence. A simulation study illustrates the robustness and finite-sample behaviour of the estimators. Overall, the framework unifies design-based reasoning with stochastic outcome modelling, broadening the scope of causal inference in complex experimental settings.</description>
