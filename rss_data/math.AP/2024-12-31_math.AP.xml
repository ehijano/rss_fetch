      <title>Chemotaxis and Reactions in Anomalous Diffusion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemotaxis and reactions are fundamental processes in biology, often intricately intertwined. Chemotaxis, in particular, can be crucial in maintaining and accelerating a reaction. In this work, we extend the investigation initiated by kiselev et al. [17] by examining the impact of chemotactic attraction on reproduction and other processes in the context of anomalous diffusion of gamete densities. For that, we consider a partial differential equation, with a single density function, that includes advection, chemotaxis, absorbing reaction, and diffusion, incorporating the fractional Laplacian $\Lambda^\alpha$. The inclusion of the fractional Laplacian is motivated by experimental evidence supporting the efficacy of anomalous diffusion models, particularly in scenarios with sparse targets. The fractional Laplacian accommodates the nonlocal nature of superdiffusion processes, providing a more accurate representation than traditional diffusion models. Our proposed model represents a step forward in refining mathematical descriptions of cellular behaviors influenced by chemotactic cues.</description>

      <title>Spectral convergence for the Reissner-Mindlin system in arbitrary dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the convergence of the resolvent of the Reissner-Mindlin system in any dimension $N \geq 2$, with any of the physically relevant boundary conditions, to the resolvent of the biharmonic operator with suitably defined boundary conditions in the vanishing thickness limit. Moreover, given a thin domain $\Omega_\delta$ in ${\mathbb R}^N$ with $1 \leq d &lt; N$ thin directions, we prove that the resolvent of the Reissner-Mindlin system with free boundary conditions converges to the resolvent of a suitably defined Reissner-Mindlin system in the limiting domain $\Omega \subset {\mathbb{R}}^{N-d}$ as $\delta \to 0^+$. In both cases, the convergence is in operator norm, implying therefore the convergence of all the eigenvalues and spectral projections. In the thin domain case, we formulate a conjecture on the rate of convergence in terms of $\delta$, which is verified in the case of the cylinder $\Omega \times B_d(0, \delta)$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the spatial differentiability of weak solutions to nonstationary Stokes equations in divergence form with variable viscosity coefficients having $L_2$-Dini mean oscillations. As a corollary, we derive local spatial Schauder estimates for such equations if the viscosity coefficient belongs to $C^\alpha_x$. Similar results also hold for strong solutions to nonstationary Stokes equations in nondivergence form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the motion of an incompressible viscous fluid on a sphere, incorporating the effects of the Coriolis force. We demonstrate that global solutions exist for any divergence-free initial condition with finite kinetic energy. Furthermore, we show that each solution converges at an exponential rate to a state that is aligned with the rotation of the sphere.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal approximation of an anisotropic cross-diffusion system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localisation limits and nonlocal approximations of degenerate parabolic systems have experienced a renaissance in recent years. However, only few results cover anisotropic systems. This work addresses this gap by establishing the nonlocal-to-limit for a specific anisotropic cross-diffusion system encountered in population dynamics featuring phase-separation phenomena, i.e., internal layers between different species. A critical element of the proof is an entropy dissipation identity, which we show to hold for any weak solution.</description>

      <title>Optimal domains for the Cheeger inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the existence of an optimal domain $\Omega_{opt}$ for the shape optimization problem $$\max\Big\{\lambda_q(\Omega)\ :\ \Omega\subset D,\ \lambda_p(\Omega)=1\Big\},$$ where $q&lt;p$ and $D$ is a prescribed bounded subset of ${\bf R}^d$. Here $\lambda_p(\Omega)$ (respectively $\lambda_q(\Omega)$) is the first eigenvalue of the $p$-Laplacian $-\Delta_p$ (respectively $-\Delta_q$) with Dirichlet boundary condition on $\partial\Omega$. This is related to the existence of optimal sets that minimize the generalized Cheeger ratio $${\mathcal F}_{p,q}(\Omega)=\frac{\lambda_p^{1/p}(\Omega)}{\lambda_q^{1/q}(\Omega)}.$$</description>

      <title>Break of radial symmetry for a class of attractive-repulsive interaction energy minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Break of radial symmetry for interaction energy minimizers is a phenomenon where a radial interaction potential whose associated energy minimizers are never radially symmetric. Numerically, it has been frequently observed for various types of interaction potentials, however, rigorous justification of this phenomenon was only done in very limited cases. We propose a new approach to prove the break of radial symmetry, by using a lower bound for the energy in the class of radial probability measures, combining with the construction of a probability measure whose energy is lower than this lower bound. In particular, we prove that for a class of interaction potentials that are repulsive at short distance and attractive at long distance, every energy minimizer is necessarily a H\"older continuous function which is not radially symmetric.</description>

      <title>Parabolic equations with concave non-linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the existence and uniqueness of positive mild solutions for the semilinear parabolic equations of the form $u_t+\mathcal{L}u=f+h\cdot G(u)$, where $h$ is a positive function and $G$ a positive concave function (for example, $G(u)=u^\alpha$ for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$). In contrast with the case of convex $G$, where the Fujita exponent appears, and only existence of a positive solution for special data is achieved, in this concave case we obtain the existence and uniqueness for any positive data. The method relies on proving the existence and uniqueness of solutions for a certain class of Hammerstein-Volterra-type integral equations with a concave non-linear term, in the very general setting of arbitrary measure spaces. As a consequence, we obtain results for the existence and uniqueness of mild solutions to semilinear parabolic equations with concave nonlinearities under rather general assumptions on $f, h$ and $G$, in a variety of settings: e.g. for $\mathcal{L}$ being the Laplacian on complete Riemannian manifolds (e.g., symmetric spaces of any rank) or H\"ormander sum of squares on general Lie groups. We also study the corresponding equations in the presence of a damping term, in which case assumptions can be relaxed even further.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and relaxation for solutions of the Fokker-Planck-Alignment equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove global existence of weak solutions, their regularization, and global relaxation to Maxwellian for a broad class of Fokker-Planck-Alignment models which appear in collective dynamics. The main feature of these results, as opposed to previously known ones, is the lack of regularity or no-vacuum requirements on the initial data. With a particular application to the classical kinetic Cucker-Smale model, we demonstrate that any bounded data with finite energy, $(1+ |v|^2) f_0 \in L^1$, $f_0 \in L^\infty$, and finite higher moment $|v|^q f\in L^2$, $q \gg 2$, gives rise to a global instantly smooth solution, satisfying entropy equality and relaxing exponentially fast.
  The results are achieved through the use of a new thickness-based renormalization, which circumvents the problem of degenerate diffusion in non-perturbative regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a half-space Bernstein theorem for Allen-Cahn equation. More precisely, we show that every solution $u$ of the Allen-Cahn equation in the half-space $\overline{\mathbb{R}^n_+}:=\{(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)\in\mathbb{R}^n:\,x_1\geq 0\}$ with $|u|\leq 1$, boundary value given by the restriction of a one-dimensional solution on $\{x_1=0\}$ and monotone condition $\partial_{x_n}u&gt;0$ as well as limiting condition $\lim_{x_n\to\pm\infty}u(x',x_n)=\pm 1$ must itself be one-dimensional, and the parallel flat level sets and $\{x_1=0\}$ intersect at the same fixed angle in $(0, \frac{\pi}{2}]$.</description>

      <title>Uniform boundedness and blow-up rate of solutions in non-scale-invariant superlinear heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For superlinear heat equations with the Dirichlet boundary condition, the $L^\infty$ estimates of radially symmetric solutions are studied. In particular, the uniform boundedness of global solutions and the non-existence of solutions with type II blow-up are proved. For the space dimension greater than $9$, our results are shown under the condition that an exponent representing the growth rate of a nonlinear term is between the Sobolev exponent and the Joseph-Lundgren exponent. In the case where the space dimension is greater than $2$ and smaller than $10$, our results are applicable for nonlinear terms growing extremely faster than the exponential function.</description>

      <title>Operator estimates in homogenization of L\'evy-type operators with periodic coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper deals with homogenization of self-adjoint operators in $L_2(\mathbb R^d)$ of the form $$ ({\mathbb A}_\eps u) (\x) = \int_{\R^d} \mu(\x/\eps, \y/\eps) \frac{\left( u(\x) - u(\y) \right)}{|\x - \y|^{d+\alpha}}\,d\y, $$ where $0&lt; \alpha &lt; 2$, and $\eps&gt;0$ is a small parameter. It is assumed that the function $\mu(\x,\y)$ is $\Z^d$-periodic in each variable, $\mu(\x,\y)=\mu(\y,\x)$ for all $\x$ and $\y$, and $0&lt; \mu_- \leqslant \mu(\x,\y) \leqslant \mu_+&lt; \infty$. Under these assumptions we show that the resolvent $({\mathbb A}_\eps + I)^{-1}$ converges, as $\eps\to0$, in the operator norm in $L_2(\R^d)$ to the resolvent $({\mathbb A}^0 + I)^{-1}$ of the limit operator ${\mathbb A}^0$ given by $$ ({\mathbb A}^0 u) (\x) = \int_{\R^d} \mu^0 \frac{\left( u(\x) - u(\y) \right)}{|\x - \y|^{d+\alpha}}\,d\y, $$ where $\mu^0$ is the mean value of $\mu(\x,\y)$. We also show that the operator norm of the discrepancy $\|({\mathbb A}_\eps + I)^{-1} - (\A^0 + I)^{-1}\|_{L_2(\mathbb R^d)\to L_2(\mathbb R^d)}$ can be estimated by $O(\eps^\alpha)$, if $0&lt; \alpha &lt; 1$, by $O(\eps (1 + | \operatorname{ln} \eps|)^2)$, if $ \alpha =1$, and by $O(\eps^{2- \alpha})$, if $1&lt; \alpha &lt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov stability and exponential phase-locking of Schr\"odinger-Lohe quantum oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the well known Schr\"odinger-Lohe model for quantum synchronization with non-identical natural frequencies. The main results are related to the characterization and convergence to phase-locked states for this quantum system. The results of this article are four-fold. Via a characterization of the fixed points of the system of correlations, we uncover a direct correspondence to the fixed points of the classical Kuramoto model. Depending on the coupling strength, $\kappa$, relative to natural frequencies, $\Omega_j$, a Lyapunov function is revealed which drives the system to the phase-locked state exponentially fast. Explicit bounds on the asymptotic configurations are granted via a parametric analysis. Finally, linear stability (instability) of the fixed points is provided via an eigenvalue perturbation argument.
  Although the Lyapunov and linear stability are related, their arguments and results are of a different nature. The Lyapunov stability provides a specific value $\kappa(\Omega_j)$, where for $\kappa&gt;\kappa(\Omega_j)$, there exists a set of initial data, quantitatively defined, such that the system relaxes to the fixed point at a quantitatively defined exponential rate. While the linear stability is given by analysis of the Jacobian of the fixed points for values of $\kappa$ large, considering $\varepsilon=\frac{1}{\kappa}$ as the perturbation parameter. Under certain assumptions this provides stability for a wider range of $\kappa$ than that which is given in the Lyapunov argument.</description>

      <title>Regime dependent infection propagation fronts in an SIS model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence of traveling front solutions in a diffusive classical SIS epidemic model and the SIS model with a saturating incidence in the size of the susceptible population. We investigate the situation where both susceptible and infected populations move around at a comparable rates, but small compared to the spatial scale. In this case, we show that traveling front solutions exist for each fixed positive speed. In the regime where the infected population diffuses slower than the susceptible population, we show the existence of traveling wave solutions for each fixed positive speed and describe their structure and dependence on the wave speed which as it is varied from 0 to infinity. In the regime where the infected population diffuses faster than the susceptible population, we derive a bound for the speeds of the fronts in this regime in which the infection propagates as a front. Moreover, for the classical SIS model we show that there is a case when the spread of the disease is governed by the Burgers-FKPP equation.</description>

      <title>Local ultrametric approximation of graph distance based Laplacian diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The error estimation for eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a small positive symmetric perturbation on the spectrum of a graph Laplacian is related to Gau{\ss} hypergeometric functions. Based on this, a heuristic polynomial-time algorithm for finding an optimal locally ultrametric approximation of a graph-distance power Laplacian matrix via the Vietoris-Rips graph based on the graph distance function is proposed. In the end, the error in the solution to the graph Laplacian heat equation given by extension to a locally p-adic equation is estimated.</description>

      <title>Envelope presentation of Hamilton-Jacobi equations from spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, [arXiv:2311.08980] demonstrated that, if it exists, the limit free energy of possibly non-convex spin glass models must be determined by a characteristic of the associated infinite-dimensional non-convex Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we investigate a similar theme purely from the perspective of PDEs. Specifically, we study the unique viscosity solution of the aforementioned equation and derive an envelope-type representation formula for the solution, in the form proposed by Evans in [doi:10.1007/s00526-013-0635-3]. The value of the solution is expressed as an average of the values along characteristic lines, weighted by a non-explicit probability measure. The technical challenges arise not only from the infinite dimensionality but also from the fact that the equation is defined on a closed convex cone with an empty interior, rather than on the entire space. In the introduction, we provide a description of the motivation from spin glass theory and present the corresponding results for comparison with the PDE results.</description>

      <title>Global smooth solutions to the irrotational Euler-Riesz system in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the global dynamics of the Euler--Riesz system in three dimensions, focusing on the well-posedness and large-time behavior of solutions near equilibrium. The system generalizes classical interactions by incorporating the Riesz interactions $\nabla (-\Delta)^{-\sigma/2}(\rho - 1)$. We show that the system admits a global smooth solution for small irrotational initial perturbations. Specifically, we establish that if the initial data is sufficiently small, the solution remains regular globally in time and decays over time at a rate dependent on $\sigma$.</description>

      <title>An accurate approach to determining the spatiotemporal vehicle load on bridges based on measured boundary slopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel mathematical model is developed to evaluate the spatiotemporal vehicle loads on long bridges from slope measurements made at the ends of a bridge based on Euler-Bernoulli beam model with internal and external damping. The mathematical modelling of this phenomena leads to the inverse source problem of determining the spatiotemporal vehicle load $F(x,t)$ in the variable coefficient Euler-Bernoulli equation $\rho_A(x)u_{tt}+\mu(x) u_{t}+(r(x)u_{xx})_{xx}+(\kappa(x)u_{xxt})_{xx}=F(x,t)$, $(x,t)\in \Omega_T:=(0,\ell)\times (0,T)$ subject to the "simply supported" boundary conditions $u(0,t)=(r(x)u_{xx}+(\kappa(x)u_{xxt})_{x=0}=0$, $u(\ell,t)=(r(x)u_{xx}+(\kappa(x)u_{xxt})_{x=\ell}=0$, from the both measured outputs: $\theta_1(t):=u_x(0,t)$ and $\theta_2(t):=u_x(\ell,t)$, that is, the measured boundary slopes. It is shown that the input-output maps $(\Phi F)(t):=u_x(0,t;F)$, $(\Psi F)(t):=u_x(\ell,t;F)$, $F \in \mathcal{F}\subset L^2(\Omega_T)$, corresponding to the inverse problem, are compact and Lipschitz continuous. Then Tikhonov functional $J(F)=\Vert \Phi F-\theta_1 \Vert_{L^2(0,T)}^2+\Vert \Psi F-\theta_2 \Vert_{L^2(0,T)}^2$ is introduced to prove the existence of a quasi-solution to the inverse problem. An explicit gradient formula for the Fr\'{e}chet derivative of the Tikhonov functional is derived. The Lipschitz continuity of the Fr\'{e}chet gradient, which guarantees the monotonicity of iterations in gradient methods, has been proven.</description>

      <title>On globally smooth oscillating solutions of non-strictly hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of non-strictly hyperbolic systems of quasilinear equations with oscillatory solutions of the Cauchy problem, globally smooth in time in some open neighborhood of the zero stationary state, is found. For such systems, the period of oscillation of solutions does not depend on the initial point of the Lagrangian trajectory. The question of the possibility of constructing these systems in a physical context is also discussed, and non-relativistic and relativistic equations of cold plasma are studied from this point of view.</description>

      <title>On the convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convective Brinkman--Forchheimer equations or the Navier--Stokes equations with damping in bounded or periodic domains $\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, $2\leq d\leq 4$ are considered in this work. The existence and uniqueness of a global weak solution in the Leray-Hopf sense satisfying the energy equality to the system: $$\partial_t\boldsymbol{u}-\mu \Delta\boldsymbol{u}+(\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{u}+\alpha\boldsymbol{u}+\beta|\boldsymbol{u}|^{r-1}\boldsymbol{u}+\nabla p=\boldsymbol{f},\ \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0,$$ (for all values of $\beta&gt;0$ and $\mu&gt;0$, whenever the absorption exponent $r&gt;3$ and $2\beta\mu \geq 1$, for the critical case $r=3$) is proved. We exploit the monotonicity as well as the demicontinuity properties of the linear and nonlinear operators and the Minty-Browder technique in the proofs. Finally, we discuss the existence of global-in-time strong solutions to such systems in periodic domains.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the large time behavior of solutions to the two-dimensional viscous Burgers equation $u_t+uu_x+uu_y=\Delta u$, toward a non-self-similar rarefaction wave of inviscid Burgers equation with two initial constant states, seperated by a curve $y=\varphi(x)$, and prove that the above 2D non-self-similar rarefaction wave is time-asymptotically stable. Furthermore, we also get the decay rate. Both the rarefaction wave strength and the initial perturbation can be large.</description>

      <title>The selection problem for a new class of perturbations of Hamilton-Jacobi equations and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a perturbation problem given by the equation: \begin{equation*} H(x, d_xu_\lambda, \lambda u_\lambda(x))+\lambda V(x,\lambda)=c \quad \text{in $M$}, \end{equation*} where $M$ is a closed manifold and $\lambda&gt;0$ is a perturbation parameter. The Hamiltonian $H(x,p,u):T^*M\times \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ satisfies certain convexity, superlinearity, and monotonicity conditions. $\lambda V(\cdot,\lambda):M\to\mathbb{R}$ converges to zero as $\lambda\to 0$. First, we study the asymptotic behavior of the viscosity solution $u_\lambda:M\to\mathbb{R}$ as $\lambda$ approaches zero. This perturbation problem explores the combined effects of both the vanishing discount process and potential perturbations, leading to a new selection principle that extends beyond the classical vanishing discount approach. Additionally, we apply this principle to Hamilton-Jacobi equations with $u$-independent Hamiltonians, resulting in the introduction of a new solution operator. This operator provides new insights into the variational characterization of viscosity solutions and Mather measures.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow structure for some nonlocal diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ``nonlocal diffusion equations'' of the form \[ \partial_{t}\frac{d\rho_{t}}{d\pi}(x)+\int_{X}\left(\frac{d\rho_{t}}{d\pi}(x)-\frac{d\rho_{t}}{d\pi}(y)\right)\eta(x,y)d\pi(y)=0\qquad(\dagger) \] where $X$ is either $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ or $\mathbb{T}^{d}$, $\pi$ is a probability distribution on $X$, and $\eta(x,y)$ is a ``transition kernel'' which may be singular as $x\rightarrow y$. For a suitable notion of weak solutions which we discuss below, we show that solutions to these nonlocal diffusion equations can be interpreted as gradient flows of the relative entropy with respect to a certain nonlocal Wasserstein-type metric defined in terms of $\eta$ and $\pi$. These ``nonlocal Wasserstein metrics'' endow the space of probability measures on $X$ with a formal Riemannian structure, thereby providing for us a nonlocal analogue of the \emph{Otto calculus} originally developed in the context of the 2-Wasserstein metric. The class of equations $(\dagger)$ includes a family of ``nonlocal Fokker-Planck equations'', which are thus identified as nonlocal Wasserstein gradient flows of the relative entropy, analogously with the usual Fokker-Planck equation and the $W_{2}$ metric.
  The gradient flow structure we provide allows us to deduce: existence and uniqueness of solutions to ($\dagger$) in a suitable class of weak solutions; stability of solutions in the sense of evolutionary $\Gamma$-convergence, with respect to perturbations of initial condition, reference measure $\pi$, and transition kernel $\eta$; sufficient conditions for exponential convergence to equilibrium, in terms of a nonlocal analogue of the log-Sobolev inequality; as well as the consistency of a finite-volume-type spatial discretization scheme in the $\mathbb{T}^{d}$ case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Cauchy problems associated to elliptic operators acting on vector-valued functions and coupled up to the first-order. We prove pointwise estimates for the spatial derivatives of the semigroup associated to these problems in the space of bounded and continuous functions over $\R^d$. Consequently, we deduce relevant regularity results both in H\"older and Zygmund spaces and in Sobolev and Besov spaces.</description>

      <title>The semilinear heat inequality with Morrey initial data on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to obtain estimates for nonnegative solutions of the differential inequality $$\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} - \Delta\right) u \leq A u^p + B u $$ with small initial data in borderline Morrey norms over a Riemannian manifold with bounded geometry. We obtain $L^\infty$ estimates assuming $$\|u(\cdot,0)\|_{M^{q, \frac{2q}{p-1}}} + \sup_{0 \leq t &lt; T} \|u(\cdot, t) \|_{L^s} &lt; \delta,$$ where $1 &lt; q \leq q_c := \frac{n(p-1)}{2}$ and $1 \leq s \leq q_c$. Assuming also a bound on $\|u(\cdot, 0)\|_{M^{q', \lambda'}}$, where either $q' &gt; q$ or $\lambda' &lt; \frac{2q}{p-1}$, we get an improved estimate near the initial time. These results have applications to geometric flows in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Gradient catastrophes and an infinite hierarchy of H\"older cusp-singularities for 1D Euler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an infinite hierarchy of finite-time gradient catastrophes for smooth solutions of the 1D Euler equations of gas dynamics with non-constant entropy. Specifically, for all integers $n\geq 1$, we prove that there exist classical solutions, emanating from smooth, compressive, and non-vacuous initial data, which form a cusp-type gradient singularity in finite time, in which the gradient of the solution has precisely $C^{0,\frac{1}{2n+1}}$ H\"older-regularity. We show that such Euler solutions are codimension-$(2n-2)$ stable in the space the Sobolev space $W^{2n+2,\infty}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a bounded domain $\O$ and $f$ of zero integral, the existence of a vector fields $\u$ vanishing on $\partial\O$ and satisfying $\d\u=f$ has been widely studied because of its connection with many important problems. It is known that for $f\in L^p(\O)$, $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, there exists a solution $\u\in W^{1,p}_0(\O)$, and also that an analogous result is not true for $p=1$ or $p=\infty$. The goal of this paper is to prove results for Hardy spaces when $\frac{n}{n+1}&lt;p\le 1$, and in the other limiting case, for bounded mean oscillation and Lipschitz spaces. As a byproduct of our analysis we obtain a Korn inequality for vector fields in Hardy-Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the theory of viscosity solutions for second-order, degenerate elliptic PDEs, the Ishii-Lions method is a commonly used strategy, and the theorem of sums is the main analytical tool. As noted by Porretta and Priola, uniformly elliptic PDEs admit a version of the theorem of sums without the squared term due to a compactness argument. Here, we introduce a larger class of PDEs for which the compactness argument holds.</description>

      <title>A Lorentz invariant formulation of artificial viscosity for the relativistic Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vanishing (artificial) viscosity method has played a fundamental role in the theory of classical shock waves, both by providing a mollified limit that identifies the correct physical (Lax admissible) shock waves, and as a guiding principle in the design of numerical difference schemes for simulating shock waves. However, for relativistic fluid flow, the underlying dissipation mechanism based on the Euclidean Laplace operator violates Lorentz invariance (and hence the speed of light bound) -- the fundamental principle of Special Relativity. In this paper we introduce a simple dissipation mechanism for the relativistic Euler equations which is Lorentz invariant and consistent with the laws of Special Relativity. To establish basic consistency of the model for the study of shock waves, we prove existence and decay of Fourier Laplace mode solutions (implying dissipation), and we prove that 1-D shock profiles (viscous travelling wave approximations) exist if and only if the approximated shock waves are Lax admissible. Our analysis of shock profiles reveals an interesting simplification over classical artificial viscosity, leading to a one dimensional fixed point problem, due to the speed of light bound of Relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the nonlinear Dirac equation with scalar self-interaction (the Soler model) in three spatial dimensions, we consider the linearization at solitary wave solutions and find the invariant spaces which correspond to different spherical harmonics, thus achieving the radial reduction of the spectral stability analysis. We apply the same technique to the bi-frequency solitary waves (which are generically present in the Soler model) and show that they can also possess linear stability properties similar to those of one-frequency solitary waves.</description>

      <title>Wall-chamber decompositions for generalized Monge-Amp\`ere equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Monge-Amp\`ere equations form a large class of PDE including Donaldson's J-equation, inverse Hessian equations, some supercritical deformed Hermitian-Yang Mills equations, and some Z-critical equations. Solvability of these equations is characterized by numerical criteria involving intersection numbers over all subvarieties, and in this paper, we aim to characterize algebraically what happens when these nonlinear Nakai-Moishezon type criteria fail. As a main result, we show that under mild positivity assumptions, there is a finite number of subvarieties violating the Nakai type criterion, and such subvarieties are moreover rigid in a suitable sense. This gives first effective solvability criteria for these familes of PDE, thus improving on work of Gao Chen, Datar-Pingali, Song and Fang-Ma. As an application, we obtain first examples in higher dimension of polarized compact K\"ahler manifolds exhibiting a natural PDE analog of Bridgeland's locally finite wall-chamber decomposition.</description>

Abstract: Kerr stability for small angular momentum has been proved in the series of works by Klainerman-Szeftel, Giorgi-Klainerman-Szeftel and Shen. Some of the most basic conclusions of the result, concerning various physical quantities on the future null infinity are derived in the work of Klainerman-Szeftel. Further important conclusions were later derived in An-He-Shen and Chen-Klainerman. In this paper, based on the existence and uniqueness results for GCM spheres by Klainerman-Szeftel, we establish the existence of a canonical foliation on the future null infinity for which the null energy, linear momentum, center of mass and angular momentum are well defined and satisfy the expected physical laws of gravitational radiation. The rigid character of this foliation eliminates the usual ambiguities related to these quantities in the physics literature. We also show that under the initial assumption of Klainerman-Szeftel, the center of mass of the black hole has a large deformation (recoil) after the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Voltage laws in nanodomains revealed by asymptotics and simulations of electro-diffusion equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the local voltage distribution within nanophysiological domains, driven by ionic currents through membrane channels, is crucial for studying cellular activity in modern biophysics, yet it presents significant experimental and theoretical challenges. Theoretically, the complexity arises from the difficulty of solving electro-diffusion equations in three-dimensional domains. Currently, there are no methods available for obtaining asymptotic computations or approximated solutions of nonlinear equations, and numerically, it is challenging to explore solutions across both small and large spatial scales. In this work, we develop a method to solve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations with ionic currents entering and exiting through two narrow, circular window channels located on the boundary. The inflow through the first window is composed of a single cation, while the outflow maintains a constant ionic density satisfying local electro-neutrality conditions. Employing regular expansions and Green's function representations, we derive the ionic profiles and voltage drops in both small and large charge regimes. We explore how local surface curvature and window channels size influence voltage dynamics and validate our theoretical predictions through numerical simulations, assessing the accuracy of our asymptotic computations. These novel relationships between current, voltage, concentrations and geometry can enhance the characterization of physiological behaviors of nanodomains.</description>

      <title>An inverse obstacle scattering problem with random sources in the time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work considers a time domain inverse acoustic obstacle scattering problem due to randomly distributed point sources. Motivated by the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff identity in the frequency domain, we propose to relate the time domain measurement data due to random sources to an approximate data set given by the subtraction of two scattered wave fields. We propose a time domain linear sampling method for the approximate data set and show how to tackle the measurement data due to random sources. An imaging functional is built based on the linear sampling method, which reconstructs the support of the unknown scattering object using directly the time domain measurements. The functional framework is based on the Laplace transform, which relates the mapping properties of Laplace domain factorized operators to their counterparts in the time domain. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the capability of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove parabolic versions of several known gap theorems in classical Yang-Mills theory. On an $\mathrm{SU}(r)$-bundle of charge $\kappa$ over the 4-sphere, we show that the space of all connections with Yang-Mills energy less than $4 \pi^2 \left( |\kappa| + 2 \right)$ deformation-retracts under Yang-Mills flow onto the space of instantons, allowing us to simplify the proof of Taubes's path-connectedness theorem. On a compact quaternion-K\"ahler manifold with positive scalar curvature, we prove that the space of pseudo-holomorphic connections whose $\mathfrak{sp}(1)$ curvature component has small Morrey norm deformation-retracts under Yang-Mills flow onto the space of instantons. On a nontrivial bundle over a compact manifold of general dimension, we prove that the infimum of the scale-invariant Morrey norm of curvature is positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new results on quantum tunneling between deep potential wells, in the presence of a strong constant magnetic field. We construct a family of double well potentials containing examples for which the low-energy eigenvalue splitting vanishes, and hence quantum tunneling is eliminated. Further, by deforming within this family, the magnetic ground state can be made to transition from symmetric to anti-symmetric. However, for typical double wells in a certain regime, tunneling is not suppressed, and we provide a lower bound for the eigenvalue splitting.</description>

      <title>Perfect stationary solutions of reaction-diffusion equations on lattices and regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion equations on infinite graphs can have an infinite number of stationary solutions. These solutions are generally described as roots of a countable system of algebraic equations. As a generalization of periodic stationary solutions we present perfect stationary solutions, a special class of solutions with finite range in which the neighborhood values are determined precisely by the value of the central vertex. The focus on the solutions which attain a finite number of values enables us to rewrite the countable algebraic system to a finite one. In this work, we define the notion of perfect stationary solutions and show its elementary properties. We further present results from the theory of perfect colorings in order to prove the existence of the solutions in the square, triangular and hexagonal grids; as a byproduct, the existence of uncountable number of two-valued stationary solutions on these grids is shown. These two-valued solutions can form highly aperiodic and highly irregular patterns. Finally, an application to a bistable reaction-diffusion equation on a square grid is presented.</description>

Abstract: Diffusive limit from the Boltzmann equation to the incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system was established for the celebrated Maxwell boundary condition in the framework of renormalized solutions by Saint-Raymond2009 and Jiang-Masmoudi2017. We establish the same limit in the framework of strong solutions for the whole range of $\alpha\in [0,1]$ by two noval approaches: (1) developing a new one-bounce $L^\infty$ estimate of specular reflection for $\varepsilon \ll 1$; (2) discovering a new dissipation mechanism for the average of macroscopic components for the almost specular case $\lim_{\varepsilon \to 0}\frac{\alpha}{\varepsilon}=0$, where $\varepsilon$ is the Knudsen number and $\alpha$ is the accommodation coefficient.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of solutions of certain semilinear heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11307v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a semilinear heat equation involving a forcing term which depends only on the space variable. To start with, the existence of a local mild solution is proved through an application of the Banach fixed-point theorem. With the help of carefully defined test functions, we then prove the nonexistence of global weak solutions. The most crucial step is to find the function $d(x)$ used in our proofs, which seems to depends only upon the considered vector fields. This leads to lower bounds for a possible critical Fujita-type exponent. The same function $d(x)$ could lead to a potential norm function which would be most suitable while working with these vector fields. Section 4 is the attraction of this paper in which we apply our approach to all of the vector fields discussed by Biagi, Bonfiglioli and Bramanti, giving rise to Grushin-type and Engel-type PDOs, and more. An upper bound for the blow-up time of local solutions is also provided in each of these cases.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the long-time behavior of solutions to a Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system with chemotaxis effects and a solution-dependent mass source term. The fluid velocity satisfies the Navier-Stokes system, the phase field variable satisfies a convective Cahn-Hilliard equation with a singular potential (e.g., the Flory-Huggins type), the nutrient density satisfies an advection-diffusion-reaction. For the initial boundary value problem in 2D, we prove the existence of the global attractor in a suitable phase space. Furthermore, we obtain the existence of an exponential attractor, and it can be implied that the global attractor is of finite fractal dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10592v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a weak formulation of the non-parametric prescribed mean curvature equation with measure data and show the existence and several properties of $BV$ solutions under natural assumptions on the prescribed measure. Our approach does not rely on approximate or viscosity-type solutions. It requires combining various ingredients, including Anzellotti's pairing theory for divergence-measure fields and its recent developments, a refinement of Anzellotti-Giaquinta approximation, and convex duality theory. We also prove a Gamma-convergence result valid for suitable smooth approximations of the prescribed measure, and a maximum principle for continuous weak solutions. We finally construct some examples of non-uniqueness, showing at the same time the need for the continuity assumption in the maximum principle and an unexpected feature of weak solutions.</description>

Abstract: The paper deals with the problem of the energy conservation for the weak solutions to the compressible Primitive Equations (CPE) system with degenerate viscosity. The sufficient conditions on the regularity of weak solutions for the energy equality are obtained even for the case when the solutions may include vacuum. In this paper, we show two theorems, the first one gives regularity in the classical isotropic Sobolev and Besov spaces. The second one states regularity in the anisotropic spaces. We obtain new regularity results in the second theorem due to the special structure of CPE system, which are in contrast to compressible Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a class of Stein-Weiss type inequality with partial variable weight functions on the upper half space using a weighted Hardy type inequality. Overcoming the impact of weighted functions, the existence of extremal functions is proved via the concentration compactness principle, whereas Riesz rearrangement inequality is not available. Moreover, the cylindrical symmetry with respect to $t$-axis and the explicit forms on the boundary of all nonnegative extremal functions are discussed via the method of moving planes and method of moving spheres, as well as, regularity results are obtained by the regularity lift lemma and bootstrap technique. As applications, we obtain some weighted Sobolev inequalities with partial variable weight function for Laplacian and fractional Laplacian.</description>

  and derive the final blowup profile
  $ u(r,T) \sim c_d \frac{|\log r|^\frac{d-2}{d}}{r^2} \quad \textup{as}\;\; r \to 0, \;\; c_d &gt; 0.$
  To our knowledge this provides a new blowup solution for the Keller-Segel system, rigorously answering a question by Brenner, Constantin, Kadanoff, Schenkel, and Venkataramani (Nonlinearity, 1999).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that condition $\operatorname{Sub_r}(\Psi)$ on the subprincipal symbol is sufficient for local solvability of linear pseudodifferential operators of real subprincipal type. These are the operators having real principal symbol, which is of principal type and vanishes of second order on an involutive manifold where the subprincipal symbol is of principal type. Condition $\operatorname{Sub_r}(\Psi)$ is a condition on the sign changes of the imaginary part of the subprincipal symbol, which has previously been shown by the author to be necessary for local solvability of linear pseudodifferential operators of real subprincipal type. In the appendix, we study the local solvability of quasilinear second order partial differential operators of real principal type.</description>

      <title>Pogorelov type estimates for $(n-1)$-Hessian equations and related rigidity theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish Pogorelov type $C^2$ estimates for admissible solutions to the Dirichlet problem of $(n-1)$-Hessian equation based on a concavity inequality, which is inspired by the Lu-Tsai's work on the global curvature estimates for the $n-1$ curvature equation. As an application, we apply such estimates to obtain a rigidity theorems for admissible solutions of $(n-1)$-Hessian equation only under quadratic growth conditions. This result gives a positive answer to a open problem for $k$-Hessian equation, which is proposed by Chang-Yuan, in case $k=n-1$.</description>

      <title>Measures in the dual of $BV$: perimeter bounds and relations with divergence-measure fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06224v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze some properties of the measures in the dual of the space $BV$, by considering (signed) Radon measures satisfying a perimeter bound condition, which means that the absolute value of the measure of a set is controlled by the perimeter of the set itself, and whose total variations also belong to the dual of $BV$. We exploit and refine the results of [25](Phuc, Torres 2017), in particular exploring the relation with divergence-measure fields and proving the stability of the perimeter bound from sets to $BV$ functions under a suitable approximation of the given measure. As an important tool, we obtain a refinement of Anzellotti-Giaquinta approximation for $BV$ functions, which is of separate interest in itself and, in the context of Anzellotti's pairing theory for divergence-measure fields, implies a new way of approximating $\lambda$-pairings, as well as new bounds for their total variation. These results are also relevant due to their application in the study of weak solutions to the non-parametric prescribed mean curvature equation with measure data, which is explored in a subsequent work.</description>

      <title>A blow up solution of the Navier-Stokes equations with a critical force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A forced solution $v$ of the Navier-Stokes equation in any open domain with no slip
  boundary condition is constructed. The scaling factor of the forcing term is the
  critical order $-2$. The velocity, which is smooth until its final blow up moment,
  is in the energy space through out. Since most physical forces from a point source
  in nature are regarded as order $-2$, such as Coulomb force, Yukawa force, this
  result indicates possible singularity formation under these kind of forces. The result
  even holds for some log subcritical forces or some forces in the standard critical space $L^\infty_t
  L^{3/2}_x$, including the explicit force: $F=- \delta \frac{e^{-|x|^2}}{(|x|^2 + T-t) \,[1+ | \ln (|x|^2 + T-t)|]} (1, 0, 0) $ for any small $\delta&gt;0$. The result can also be considered as a step in Scheffer's plan.</description>

      <title>Gaussian fluctuations for interacting particle systems with singular kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.13201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic behavior of the fluctuations for the empirical measures of interacting particle systems with singular kernels. We prove that the sequence of fluctuation processes converges in distribution to a generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our result considerably extends classical results to singular kernels, including the Biot-Savart law. The result applies to the point vortex model approximating the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation and the 2D Euler equation. We also obtain Gaussianity and optimal regularity of the limiting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The method relies on the martingale approach and the Donsker-Varadhan variational formula, which transfers the uniform estimate to some exponential integrals. Estimation of those exponential integrals follows by cancellations and combinatorics techniques and is of the type of large deviation principle.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Li-Yau gradient bound on Compact Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.08933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(\M^n, g)$ be a $n$ dimensional, complete ( compact or noncompact) Riemannian manifold whose Ricci curvature is bounded from below by a constant $-K \le 0$. Let $u$ be a positive solution of the heat equation on $\M^n \times (0, \infty)$. The well known Li-Yau gradient bound states that $$ t \left(\frac{|\nabla u|^2}{u^2} - \alpha\frac{\pa_t u}{u}\right) \leq \frac{n\alpha^2}{2} + t \frac{n\alpha^2K}{2(\alpha-1)},\quad \forall \alpha&gt;1, t&gt;0. $$ The bound with $\alpha =1$ is sharp if $K=0$. If $-K &lt; 0$, the bound tends to infinity if $\alpha=1$. In over 30 years, several sharpening of the bounds have been obtained with $\alpha$ replaced by several functions $\alpha=\alpha(t)&gt;1$ but not equal to $1$. An open question (\cite{CLN}, \citeLX} etc) asks if a sharp bound can be reached. In this short note, we observe that for all complete compact manifolds one can take $\alpha=1$. Thus a sharp bound, up to computable constants, is found in the compact case. This result also seems to sharpen Theorem 1.4 in \cite{LY} for compact manifolds with convex boundaries. In the noncompact case one can not take $\alpha=1$ even for the hyperbolic space. An example is also given, which shows that there does not exist an optimal function of time only $\alpha=\alpha(t)$ for all noncompact manifolds with Ricci lower bound, giving a negative answer to the open question in the noncompact case.</description>

      <title>Finite-difference least square methods for solving Hamilton-Jacobi equations using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10758v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple algorithm to approximate the viscosity solution of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations by means of an artificial deep neural network. The algorithm uses a stochastic gradient descent-based method to minimize the least square principle defined by a monotone, consistent numerical scheme. We analyze the least square principle's critical points and derive conditions that guarantee that any critical point approximates the sought viscosity solution. The use of a deep artificial neural network on a finite difference scheme lifts the restriction of conventional finite difference methods that rely on computing functions on a fixed grid. This feature makes it possible to solve HJ equations posed in higher dimensions where conventional methods are infeasible. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm through numerical studies on various canonical HJ equations across different dimensions, showcasing its potential and versatility.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity for locally monotone stochastic evolution equations with L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish general conditions for stochastic evolution equations with locally monotone drift and degenerate additive L\'evy noise in variational formulation resulting in the existence of a unique invariant probability measure for the associated ergodic Markovian Feller semigroup. We prove improved moment estimates for the solutions and the $e$-property of the semigroup. Examples include the stochastic incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations, shear thickening stochastic power-law fluid equations, the stochastic heat equation, as well as, stochastic semilinear equations such as the 1D stochastic Burgers equation.</description>
