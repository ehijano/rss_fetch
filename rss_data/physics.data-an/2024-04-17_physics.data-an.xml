      <title>Can AI Understand Our Universe? Test of Fine-Tuning GPT by Astrophysical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ChatGPT has been the most talked-about concept in recent months, captivating both professionals and the general public alike, and has sparked discussions about the changes that artificial intelligence (AI) will bring to the world. As physicists and astrophysicists, we are curious about if scientific data can be correctly analyzed by large language models (LLMs) and yield accurate physics. In this article, we fine-tune the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) model by the astronomical data from the observations of galaxies, quasars, stars, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and the simulations of black holes (BHs), the fine-tuned model demonstrates its capability to classify astrophysical phenomena, distinguish between two types of GRBs, deduce the redshift of quasars, and estimate BH parameters. We regard this as a successful test, marking the LLM's proven efficacy in scientific research. With the ever-growing volume of multidisciplinary data and the advancement of AI technology, we look forward to the emergence of a more fundamental and comprehensive understanding of our universe. This article also shares some interesting thoughts on data collection and AI design. Using the approach of understanding the universe - looking outward at data and inward for fundamental building blocks - as a guideline, we propose a method of series expansion for AI, suggesting ways to train and control AI that is smarter than humans.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent autocorrelation for finite-area bias correction in roughness measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scan line levelling, a ubiquitous and often necessary step in AFM data processing, can cause a severe bias on measured roughness parameters such as mean square roughness or correlation length. Although bias estimates have been formulated, they aimed mainly at assessing the severity of the problem for individual measurements. Practical bias correction methods are still missing. This work exploits the observation that the bias of autocorrelation function (ACF) can be expressed in terms of the function itself, permitting a self-consistent formulation. From this two correction approaches are developed, both with the aim to obtain convenient formulae which can be easily applied in practice. The first modifies standard analytical models of ACF to incorporate, in expectation, the bias and thus actually match the data the models are used to fit. The second inverts the relation between true and estimated ACF to realise a model-free correction. Both are tested using simulated and experimental data and found effective.</description>

      <title>Applying Machine Learning Methods to Laser Acceleration of Protons: Lessons Learned from Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16036v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers in the field of ultra-intense laser science are beginning to embrace machine learning methods. In this study we consider three different machine learning methods -- a two-hidden layer neural network, Support Vector Regression and Gaussian Process Regression -- and compare how well they can learn from a synthetic data set for proton acceleration in the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration regime. The synthetic data set was generated from a previously published theoretical model by Fuchs et al. 2005 that we modified. Once trained, these machine learning methods can assist with efforts to maximize the peak proton energy, or with the more general problem of configuring the laser system to produce a proton energy spectrum with desired characteristics. In our study we focus on both the accuracy of the machine learning methods and the performance on one GPU including the memory consumption. Although it is arguably the least sophisticated machine learning model we considered, Support Vector Regression performed very well in our tests.</description>
