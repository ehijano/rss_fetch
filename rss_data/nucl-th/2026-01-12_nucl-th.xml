      <title>Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mass models on a 3D mesh: V. The N2LO extension of the Skyrme EDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present BSkG5, the latest entry in the Brussels-Skyrme-on-a-Grid (BSkG) series and the first large-scale nuclear structure model based on next-to-next-to-leading order (N2LO) Skyrme energy density functional (EDF). By extending the traditional Skyrme EDF ansatz with central terms containing up to four gradients, we are able to combine an excellent global description of nuclear ground state properties with a stiff equation of state for pure neutron matter that is consistent with all astronomical observations of neutron stars. More precisely, the new model matches the accuracy of earlier BSkG models but with two parameters less: we achieve root-mean-square deviations of 0.649 MeV for 2457 atomic masses, 0.0267 fm for 810 charge radii, and 0.43 MeV for 45 primary fission barriers of actinide nuclei. We demonstrate that the complexities of N2LO EDFs are not insurmountable, even for demanding many-body calculations.</description>

      <title>Constraining Hamiltonians from chiral effective field theory with neutron-star data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-messenger observations of neutron stars (NSs) and their mergers have placed strong constraints on the dense-matter equation of state (EOS). The EOS, in turn, depends on microscopic nuclear interactions that are described by nuclear Hamiltonians. These Hamiltonians are commonly derived within chiral effective field theory (EFT). Ideally, multi-messenger observations of NSs could be used to directly inform our understanding of EFT interactions, but such a direct inference necessitates millions of model evaluations. This is computationally prohibitive because each evaluation requires us to calculate the EOS from a Hamiltonian by solving the quantum many-body problem with methods such as auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC), which provides very accurate and precise solutions but at a significant computational cost. Additionally, we need to solve the stellar structure equations for each EOS which further slows down each model evaluation by a few seconds. In this work, we combine emulators for AFDMC calculations of neutron matter, built using parametric matrix models, and for the stellar structure equations, built using multilayer perceptron neural networks, with the \texttt{PyCBC} data-analysis framework to enable a direct inference of coupling constants in an EFT Hamiltonian using multi-messenger observations of NSs. We find that astrophysical data can provide informative constraints on two-nucleon couplings despite the high densities probed in NS interiors.</description>

      <title>Near-threshold heavy quarkonium photoproduction in a light-front spectator model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The near-threshold photo- and electroproduction of heavy vector quarkonia off the proton provides direct access to its gluonic structure. In particular, the cross section for $J/\Psi$ photoproduction near threshold is governed by the proton's gluon gravitational form factors (GFFs). In this work, we employ the generalized parton distribution framework together with gluon GFFs calculated in a light-front gluon-spectator model inspired by soft-wall AdS/QCD to predict both the differential and total cross sections for near-threshold $J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon$ photoproductions. Our results for $J/\Psi$ photoproduction show good agreement with recent experimental data from the $J/\Psi$-007 and GlueX Collaborations at Jefferson Lab, as well as with earlier measurements from SLAC and Cornell.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Ionization by Schwarzschild Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are theorized to form from the collapse of overdensities in the very early Universe. PBHs in the asteroid-mass range $10^{17} \, {\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} \, {\rm g}$ could serve as all or most of the dark matter today, but are particularly difficult to detect due to their modest rates of Hawking emission and sub-micron Schwarzschild radii. We consider whether the steep gradients of a PBH's gravitational field could generate tidal forces strong enough to disrupt atoms and nuclei. Such phenomena may yield new observables that could uniquely distinguish a PBH from a macroscopic object of the same mass. We first consider the gravitational ionization of ambient neutral hydrogen and evaluate prospects for detecting photon radiation from the recombination of ionized atoms. During the present epoch, this effect would be swamped by Hawking radiation -- which would itself be difficult to detect for PBHs at the upper end of the asteroid-mass window. We then consider the gravitational ionization and heating of neutral hydrogen immediately following recombination at $z\simeq1090$, and identify a broad class of PBH distributions with typical mass $5\times10^{21}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23}\, {\rm g}$ within which gravitational interactions would have been the dominant form of energy deposition to the medium. We also identify conditions under which tidal forces from a transiting PBH could overcome the strong nuclear force, either by dissociating deuterons, which would be relevant during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), or by inducing fission of heavy nuclei. We find that gravitational dissociation of deuterons dominates photodissociation rates due to Hawking radiation for PBHs with masses $10^{14}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{16}\,{\rm g}$. We additionally identify the phenomenon of gravitationally induced fission of heavy nuclei via tidal deformation.</description>

      <title>Recombination of $B_c$ mesons in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11511v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy heavy-ion collisions have been suggested as a favorable environment for the production of $B_c$ mesons, due to a much larger abundance of charm and bottom quarks compared to elementary reactions. Motivated by recent CMS data for $B_c^+$ production in Pb-Pb($5.02\,$TeV) collisions at the LHC, we deploy a previously developed transport approach for charmonia and bottomonia to evaluate the kinetics of $B_c$ mesons throughout the fireball formed in these reactions. The main inputs to our approach are two transport parameters: the $B_c$'s reaction rate and equilibrium limit. Both quantities are determined by previous calculations via a combination of charm and bottom sectors. In-medium binding energies of $B_c$ mesons are calculated from a thermodynamic $T$-matrix with a lattice-QCD constrained potential, and figure in their inelastic reaction rates. Temperature-dependent equilibrium limits include charm- and bottom-quark fugacities based on their initial production. We compute the centrality dependence of inclusive $B_c$ production and transverse-momentum ($p_T$) spectra using two different recombination models, instantaneous coalescence and resonance recombination. The main uncertainty in the resulting nuclear modification factors, $R_{\rm AA}$, is currently associated with the $B_c$ cross section in elementary $pp$ collisions, caused by the uncertainty in the branching ratio for the $B_c^-\to J/\psi\mu^-\bar \nu$ decay. Our results indicate a large enhancement of the $R_{\rm AA}$ at low $p_T$, with significant regeneration contributions up to $p_T\simeq\,20\,$GeV. Comparisons to CMS data are carried out but firm conclusions will require a more accurate value of the branching ratio, or alternative channels to measure the $B_c$ production in $pp$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Charmonium Transport in Ultra-Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an update on our semi-classical transport approach for quarkonium production in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, focusing on $J/\psi$ and $\psi(2S)$ mesons in 5.02 TeV Pb-Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at both forward and mid-rapidity. In particular, we employ the most recent charm-production cross sections reported in pp collisions, which are pivotal for the magnitude of the regeneration contribution, and their modifications due to cold-nuclear-matter (CNM) effects. Multi-differential observables are calculated in terms of nuclear modification factors as a function of centrality, transverse momentum, and rapidity, including the contributions from bottom-decay feeddown. For our predictions for $\psi(2S)$ production, the mechanism of sequential regeneration relative to the more strongly bound $J/\psi$ meson plays an important role in interpreting recent ALICE data.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative quarkonium dissociation rates in strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy quarks and quarkonia are versatile probes of the transport properties of the hot QCD medium produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions (URHICs). A robust description of heavy-flavor transport coefficients requires a microscopic approach that treats the open and hidden heavy-flavor sectors on the same footing. Here, we employ the quantum many-body $T$-matrix formalism to evaluate the dissociation rates of heavy quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The basic ingredient is the heavy-light $T$-matrix, which utilizes a nonperturbative driving kernel constrained by lattice-QCD data. Its resummation in a ladder series provides a much enhanced interaction strength compared to previously used perturbative coupling to the quasiparticle partons in the QGP. The in-medium quarkonium properties, particularly their temperature-dependent binding energies, are evaluated self-consistently using the same interaction kernel, including interference effects (also referred to as the imaginary part of the heavy-quark potential) as well as off-shell parton spectral functions. We systematically investigate the interplay of these effects and elaborate on the connections to the dipole approximation used in effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Reaction Rates for Charged-Particle Induced Reactions on Proton-Rich Nuclides</title>

Abstract: Astrophysical reaction rates for reactions with proton-rich isotopes of Ne to Bi from stability to the proton dripline were calculated with an updated version of the SMARAGD statistical model (Hauser-Feshbach) code. Here, the focus was on reactions with protons or $\alpha$ particles as required for nucleosynthesis in proton-rich matter. For completeness, also neutron-induced reactions are provided for the same set of targets. Some comments on dependencies of rates on various nuclear properties and on the appropriate way to compare to experiments are given. The new rate set for charged-particle induced reactions provides a better description of experimental data than previously widely used rates, especially for reactions involving $\alpha$ particles.</description>

      <title>Charge dependence of mesons with flavored contact-interaction couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective interaction models of quantum chromodynamics, based on quark degrees of freedom, have been successfully employed to compute the properties of a large array of ground and excited meson and baryon states, along with their electromagnetic form factors, distribution functions and thermal behavior. Amongst them, the contact-interaction model, while non-renormalizable, implements confinement, satisfies Lorentz covariance and correctly describes chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking pattern. Original studies focused on the light hadron sector in the isospin limit and were thereafter extended to heavy mesons and baryons. The strong effective couplings, as well as infrared and ultraviolet regulators, are flavor-dependent model parameters adjusted to reproduce hadronic observables. In contrast, in this study we combine SU(4) flavor-symmetry breaking couplings, obtained from one-loop vacuum polarization amplitudes in the presence of background constituent quark currents, with the contact-interaction model. This allows us to reduce the number of mass-dimensioned parameters and to consistently relate all flavored couplings to a single mass scale, while the masses and weak decay constants of the pions, kaons, $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are in good agreement with average reference values. Allowing for realistic isospin breaking, $m_d/m_u = 1.7$, in conjunction with the effect of the flavored couplings, leads to a mass splitting, $m_{\pi^+}- m_{\pi^0} \approx 0.3$ MeV, that agrees with lattice QCD values. For the kaons, the mass difference is $m_{K^0}- m_{K^\pm} \approx 2.3$ MeV, whereas $m_{D^\pm} - m_{D^0} \approx 0.5$ MeV and the $\eta_c$ is 6\% lighter than the experimental mass.</description>

      <title>Interactions of the deuteron with a hadronic medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interactions of the deuteron with light mesons during the hadronic phase in heavy-ion collisions. We treat the deuteron as a weakly bound state and employ the quasi-free approximation to describe the $d\pi$ interaction. The underlying elementary $N\pi$ amplitudes are described by a hybrid effective model, combining the non-resonant background from chiral perturbation theory with resonant contributions via Breit-Wigner parameterizations. These amplitudes are used to calculate the vacuum and thermally-averaged cross-sections for deuteron dissociation and production, namely, $d + \pi \rightarrow N + N' + \pi$ and the corresponding inverse reaction. We then use these cross sections in a rate equation to estimate the time evolution of the deuteron multiplicity. For the initial conditions we consider two models: the statistical hadronization model and the coalescence model, where the deuteron is treated as a hadronic molecule. Our findings suggest that the final deuteron yield does not retain a memory of its initial production mechanism.</description>

      <title>On the Cooling of Compact Stars in Light of the HESS J1731-347 Remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses on the central compact object in the HESS J1731-347 supernova remnant reported not only surprising structural properties (mass $M$ and radius $R$), but also an interesting thermal evolution. More precisely, it has been estimated that $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}M_\odot$ and $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km (at the $1\sigma$ level), while a redshited surface temperature of $153^{+4}_ {-2}$ keV at an age of 2-6 kyrs has been reported. In the present work, we conduct an in-depth investigation on the possible nature (hadronic, hybrid, quark) of this compact object by attempting to not only explain its mass and radius but also the corresponding estimations for its temperature and age. In the case of hybrid stars we also examine possible effects of the symmetry energy on the activation of different neutrino emitting process, and hence on the resulting cooling curves. We found that the reported temperature and age may be compatible to hadronic stellar configurations regardless of whether pairing effects are included. In the scenario of hybrid stars, we found that the strange quark matter core has to be in a superconducting state in order to reach an agreement with the observational constraints. In addition, the hadronic phase must be soft enough so that the direct Urca process is not activated. Furthermore, we have shown that the considered cooling constraints can be reconciled within the framework of strange stars. However, quark matter has to be in a superconducting state and the quark direct Urca process needs to be blocked.</description>
