      <title>Privacy-Preserving Edge Speech Understanding with Tiny Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust speech recognition systems rely on cloud service providers for inference. It needs to ensure that an untrustworthy provider cannot deduce the sensitive content in speech. Sanitization can be done on speech content keeping in mind that it has to avoid compromising transcription accuracy. Realizing the under utilized capabilities of tiny speech foundation models (FMs), for the first time, we propose a novel use: enhancing speech privacy on resource-constrained devices. We introduce XYZ, an edge/cloud privacy preserving speech inference engine that can filter sensitive entities without compromising transcript accuracy. We utilize a timestamp based on-device masking approach that utilizes a token to entity prediction model to filter sensitive entities. Our choice of mask strategically conceals parts of the input and hides sensitive data. The masked input is sent to a trusted cloud service or to a local hub to generate the masked output. The effectiveness of XYZ hinges on how well the entity time segments are masked. Our recovery is a confidence score based approach that chooses the best prediction between cloud and on-device model. We implement XYZ on a 64 bit Raspberry Pi 4B. Experiments show that our solution leads to robust speech recognition without forsaking privacy. XYZ with &lt; 100 MB memory, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) speech transcription performance while filtering about 83% of private entities directly on-device. XYZ is 16x smaller in memory and 17x more compute efficient than prior privacy preserving speech frameworks and has a relative reduction in word error rate (WER) by 38.8-77.5% when compared to existing offline transcription services.</description>

      <title>ComplexDec: A Domain-robust High-fidelity Neural Audio Codec with Complex Spectrum Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs have been widely adopted in audio-generative tasks because their compact and discrete representations are suitable for both large-language-model-style and regression-based generative models. However, most neural codecs struggle to model out-of-domain audio, resulting in error propagations to downstream generative tasks. In this paper, we first argue that information loss from codec compression degrades out-of-domain robustness. Then, we propose full-band 48~kHz ComplexDec with complex spectral input and output to ease the information loss while adopting the same 24~kbps bitrate as the baseline AuidoDec and ScoreDec. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate the out-of-domain robustness of ComplexDec trained using only the 30-hour VCTK corpus.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Convolutional Audio Models are Flexible Acoustic Feature Learners: A Domain Specificity and Transfer-Learning Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have emerged as powerful tools that can leverage large quantities of unlabeled audio data to pre-train robust representations that support strong performance on diverse downstream tasks. Up to now these have mostly been developed separately for speech and non-speech applications. Here, we explored the domain specificity of a convolutional model's pre-training data relative to different downstream speech and non-speech tasks using a self-supervised pre-training approach (BYOL-A). We found that these pre-trained models (regardless of whether they were pre-trained on speech data, non-speech data or both) enabled good performance on nearly all downstream tasks, beating or nearly matching the performance of popular domain-specific models. Only small domain-specificity advantages were observed between the different pre-training datasets. The popular domain-specific models used as baselines performed very well in their target domains, but generally faltered outside of them. Together, these results demonstrate that SSL methods can be a powerful way to learn flexible representations for domain specific data without labels. These models can be a powerful resource for later transfer learning, fine-tuning or data exploration applications when the downstream data are similar, but also perhaps when there may be a domain mismatch.</description>

      <title>Automated Extraction of Spatio-Semantic Graphs for Identifying Cognitive Impairment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for analyzing linguistic content from picture descriptions for assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment often overlook the participant's visual narrative path, which typically requires eye tracking to assess. Spatio-semantic graphs are a useful tool for analyzing this narrative path from transcripts alone, however they are limited by the need for manual tagging of content information units (CIUs). In this paper, we propose an automated approach for estimation of spatio-semantic graphs (via automated extraction of CIUs) from the Cookie Theft picture commonly used in cognitive-linguistic analyses. The method enables the automatic characterization of the visual semantic path during picture description. Experiments demonstrate that the automatic spatio-semantic graphs effectively differentiate between cognitively impaired and unimpaired speakers. Statistical analyses reveal that the features derived by the automated method produce comparable results to the manual method, with even greater group differences between clinical groups of interest. These results highlight the potential of the automated approach for extracting spatio-semantic features in developing clinical speech models for cognitive impairment assessment.</description>

      <title>Adapter-Based Multi-Agent AVSR Extension for Pre-Trained ASR Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to Audio-Visual Speech Recognition that builds on a pre-trained Whisper model. To infuse visual information into this audio-only model, we extend it with an AV fusion module and LoRa adapters, one of the most up-to-date adapter approaches. One advantage of adapter-based approaches, is that only a relatively small number of parameters are trained, while the basic model remains unchanged. Common AVSR approaches train single models to handle several noise categories and noise levels simultaneously. Taking advantage of the lightweight nature of adapter approaches, we train noise-scenario-specific adapter-sets, each covering individual noise-categories or a specific noise-level range. The most suitable adapter-set is selected by previously classifying the noise-scenario. This enables our models to achieve an optimum coverage across different noise-categories and noise-levels, while training only a minimum number of parameters.
  Compared to a full fine-tuning approach with SOTA performance our models achieve almost comparable results over the majority of the tested noise-categories and noise-levels, with up to 88.5% less trainable parameters. Our approach can be extended by further noise-specific adapter-sets to cover additional noise scenarios. It is also possible to utilize the underlying powerful ASR model when no visual information is available, as it remains unchanged.</description>

      <title>CTC-DRO: Robust Optimization for Reducing Language Disparities in Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern deep learning models often achieve high overall performance, but consistently fail on specific subgroups. Group distributionally robust optimization (group DRO) addresses this problem by minimizing the worst-group loss, but it fails when group losses misrepresent performance differences between groups. This is common in domains like speech, where the widely used connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss scales with input length and varies with linguistic and acoustic properties, leading to spurious differences between group losses. We present CTC-DRO, which addresses the shortcomings of the group DRO objective by smoothing the group weight update to prevent overemphasis on consistently high-loss groups, while using input length-matched batching to mitigate CTC's scaling issues. We evaluate CTC-DRO on the task of multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) across five language sets from the ML-SUPERB 2.0 benchmark. CTC-DRO consistently outperforms group DRO and CTC-based baseline models, reducing the worst-language error by up to 65.9% and the average error by up to 47.7%. CTC-DRO can be applied to ASR with minimal computational costs, and offers the potential for reducing group disparities in other domains with similar challenges.</description>

      <title>Sound Judgment: Properties of Consequential Sounds Affecting Human-Perception of Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positive human-perception of robots is critical to achieving sustained use of robots in shared environments. One key factor affecting human-perception of robots are their sounds, especially the consequential sounds which robots (as machines) must produce as they operate. This paper explores qualitative responses from 182 participants to gain insight into human-perception of robot consequential sounds. Participants viewed videos of different robots performing their typical movements, and responded to an online survey regarding their perceptions of robots and the sounds they produce. Topic analysis was used to identify common properties of robot consequential sounds that participants expressed liking, disliking, wanting or wanting to avoid being produced by robots. Alongside expected reports of disliking high pitched and loud sounds, many participants preferred informative and audible sounds (over no sound) to provide predictability of purpose and trajectory of the robot. Rhythmic sounds were preferred over acute or continuous sounds, and many participants wanted more natural sounds (such as wind or cat purrs) in-place of machine-like noise. The results presented in this paper support future research on methods to improve consequential sounds produced by robots by highlighting features of sounds that cause negative perceptions, and providing insights into sound profile changes for improvement of human-perception of robots, thus enhancing human robot interaction.</description>

      <title>Investigation of perceptual music similarity focusing on each instrumental part</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an investigation of perceptual similarity between music tracks focusing on each individual instrumental part based on a large-scale listening test towards developing an instrumental-part-based music retrieval. In the listening test, 586 subjects evaluate the perceptual similarity of the audio tracks through an ABX test. We use the music tracks and their stems in the test set of the slakh2100 dataset. The perceptual similarity is evaluated based on four perspectives: timbre, rhythm, melody, and overall. We have analyzed the results of the listening test and have found that 1) perceptual music similarity varies depending on which instrumental part is focused on within each track; 2) rhythm and melody tend to have a larger impact on the perceptual music similarity than timbre except for the melody of drums; and 3) the previously proposed music similarity features tend to capture the perceptual similarity on timbre mainly.</description>

      <title>Pruning-aware Loss Functions for STOI-Optimized Pruned Recurrent Autoencoders for the Compression of the Stimulation Patterns of Cochlear Implants at Zero Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cochlear implants (CIs) are surgically implanted hearing devices, which allow to restore a sense of hearing in people suffering from profound hearing loss. Wireless streaming of audio from external devices to CI signal processors has become common place. Specialized compression based on the stimulation patterns of a CI by deep recurrent autoencoders can decrease the power consumption in such a wireless streaming application through bit-rate reduction at zero latency.
  While previous research achieved considerable bit-rate reductions, model sizes were ignored, which can be of crucial importance in hearing-aids due to their limited computational resources. This work investigates maximizing objective speech intelligibility of the coded stimulation patterns of deep recurrent autoencoders while minimizing model size. For this purpose, a pruning-aware loss is proposed, which captures the impact of pruning during training. This training with a pruning-aware loss is compared to conventional magnitude-informed pruning and is found to yield considerable improvements in objective intelligibility, especially at higher pruning rates. After fine-tuning, little to no degradation of objective intelligibility is observed up to a pruning rate of about 55\,\%. The proposed pruning-aware loss yields substantial gains in objective speech intelligibility scores after pruning compared to the magnitude-informed baseline for pruning rates above 45\,\%.</description>

      <title>StyleSinger: Style Transfer for Out-of-Domain Singing Voice Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10741v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Style transfer for out-of-domain (OOD) singing voice synthesis (SVS) focuses on generating high-quality singing voices with unseen styles (such as timbre, emotion, pronunciation, and articulation skills) derived from reference singing voice samples. However, the endeavor to model the intricate nuances of singing voice styles is an arduous task, as singing voices possess a remarkable degree of expressiveness. Moreover, existing SVS methods encounter a decline in the quality of synthesized singing voices in OOD scenarios, as they rest upon the assumption that the target vocal attributes are discernible during the training phase. To overcome these challenges, we propose StyleSinger, the first singing voice synthesis model for zero-shot style transfer of out-of-domain reference singing voice samples. StyleSinger incorporates two critical approaches for enhanced effectiveness: 1) the Residual Style Adaptor (RSA) which employs a residual quantization module to capture diverse style characteristics in singing voices, and 2) the Uncertainty Modeling Layer Normalization (UMLN) to perturb the style attributes within the content representation during the training phase and thus improve the model generalization. Our extensive evaluations in zero-shot style transfer undeniably establish that StyleSinger outperforms baseline models in both audio quality and similarity to the reference singing voice samples. Access to singing voice samples can be found at https://aaronz345.github.io/StyleSingerDemo/.</description>

Abstract: Speaker anonymization is an effective privacy protection solution that conceals the speaker's identity while preserving the linguistic content and paralinguistic information of the original speech. To establish a fair benchmark and facilitate comparison of speaker anonymization systems, the VoicePrivacy Challenge (VPC) was held in 2020 and 2022, with a new edition planned for 2024. In this paper, we describe our proposed speaker anonymization system for VPC 2024. Our system employs a disentangled neural codec architecture and a serial disentanglement strategy to gradually disentangle the global speaker identity and time-variant linguistic content and paralinguistic information. We introduce multiple distillation methods to disentangle linguistic content, speaker identity, and emotion. These methods include semantic distillation, supervised speaker distillation, and frame-level emotion distillation. Based on these distillations, we anonymize the original speaker identity using a weighted sum of a set of candidate speaker identities and a randomly generated speaker identity. Our system achieves the best trade-off of privacy protection and emotion preservation in VPC 2024.</description>

      <title>GTSinger: A Global Multi-Technique Singing Corpus with Realistic Music Scores for All Singing Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13832v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality and multi-task singing datasets significantly hinders the development of diverse controllable and personalized singing tasks, as existing singing datasets suffer from low quality, limited diversity of languages and singers, absence of multi-technique information and realistic music scores, and poor task suitability. To tackle these problems, we present GTSinger, a large global, multi-technique, free-to-use, high-quality singing corpus with realistic music scores, designed for all singing tasks, along with its benchmarks. Particularly, (1) we collect 80.59 hours of high-quality singing voices, forming the largest recorded singing dataset; (2) 20 professional singers across nine widely spoken languages offer diverse timbres and styles; (3) we provide controlled comparison and phoneme-level annotations of six commonly used singing techniques, helping technique modeling and control; (4) GTSinger offers realistic music scores, assisting real-world musical composition; (5) singing voices are accompanied by manual phoneme-to-audio alignments, global style labels, and 16.16 hours of paired speech for various singing tasks. Moreover, to facilitate the use of GTSinger, we conduct four benchmark experiments: technique-controllable singing voice synthesis, technique recognition, style transfer, and speech-to-singing conversion. The corpus and demos can be found at http://aaronz345.github.io/GTSingerDemo/. We provide the dataset and the code for processing data and conducting benchmarks at https://huggingface.co/datasets/GTSinger/GTSinger and https://github.com/AaronZ345/GTSinger.</description>

      <title>TCSinger: Zero-Shot Singing Voice Synthesis with Style Transfer and Multi-Level Style Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15977v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-shot singing voice synthesis (SVS) with style transfer and style control aims to generate high-quality singing voices with unseen timbres and styles (including singing method, emotion, rhythm, technique, and pronunciation) from audio and text prompts. However, the multifaceted nature of singing styles poses a significant challenge for effective modeling, transfer, and control. Furthermore, current SVS models often fail to generate singing voices rich in stylistic nuances for unseen singers. To address these challenges, we introduce TCSinger, the first zero-shot SVS model for style transfer across cross-lingual speech and singing styles, along with multi-level style control. Specifically, TCSinger proposes three primary modules: 1) the clustering style encoder employs a clustering vector quantization model to stably condense style information into a compact latent space; 2) the Style and Duration Language Model (S\&amp;D-LM) concurrently predicts style information and phoneme duration, which benefits both; 3) the style adaptive decoder uses a novel mel-style adaptive normalization method to generate singing voices with enhanced details. Experimental results show that TCSinger outperforms all baseline models in synthesis quality, singer similarity, and style controllability across various tasks, including zero-shot style transfer, multi-level style control, cross-lingual style transfer, and speech-to-singing style transfer. Singing voice samples can be accessed at https://aaronz345.github.io/TCSingerDemo/.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation for Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous research has shown that the principal singular vectors of a pre-trained model's weight matrices capture critical knowledge. In contrast, those associated with small singular values may contain noise or less reliable information. As a result, the LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach, which does not constrain the use of the spectral space, may not be effective for tasks that demand high representation capacity. In this study, we enhance existing PEFT techniques by incorporating the spectral information of pre-trained weight matrices into the fine-tuning process. We investigate spectral adaptation strategies with a particular focus on the additive adjustment of top singular vectors. This is accomplished by applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to the pre-trained weight matrices and restricting the fine-tuning within the top spectral space. Extensive speaker verification experiments on VoxCeleb1 and CN-Celeb1 demonstrate enhanced tuning performance with the proposed approach. Code is released at https://github.com/lizhepolyu/SpectralFT.</description>

      <title>A Universal Identity Backdoor Attack against Speaker Verification based on Siamese Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speaker verification has been widely used in many authentication scenarios. However, training models for speaker verification requires large amounts of data and computing power, so users often use untrustworthy third-party data or deploy third-party models directly, which may create security risks. In this paper, we propose a backdoor attack for the above scenario. Specifically, for the Siamese network in the speaker verification system, we try to implant a universal identity in the model that can simulate any enrolled speaker and pass the verification. So the attacker does not need to know the victim, which makes the attack more flexible and stealthy. In addition, we design and compare three ways of selecting attacker utterances and two ways of poisoned training for the GE2E loss function in different scenarios. The results on the TIMIT and Voxceleb1 datasets show that our approach can achieve a high attack success rate while guaranteeing the normal verification accuracy. Our work reveals the vulnerability of the speaker verification system and provides a new perspective to further improve the robustness of the system.</description>

      <title>ViolinDiff: Enhancing Expressive Violin Synthesis with Pitch Bend Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling the natural contour of fundamental frequency (F0) plays a critical role in music audio synthesis. However, transcribing and managing multiple F0 contours in polyphonic music is challenging, and explicit F0 contour modeling has not yet been explored for polyphonic instrumental synthesis. In this paper, we present ViolinDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based synthesis framework. For a given violin MIDI file, the first stage estimates the F0 contour as pitch bend information, and the second stage generates mel spectrogram incorporating these expressive details. The quantitative metrics and listening test results show that the proposed model generates more realistic violin sounds than the model without explicit pitch bend modeling. Audio samples are available online: daewoung.github.io/ViolinDiff-Demo.</description>

      <title>InfantCryNet: A Data-driven Framework for Intelligent Analysis of Infant Cries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the meaning of infant cries is a significant challenge for young parents in caring for their newborns. The presence of background noise and the lack of labeled data present practical challenges in developing systems that can detect crying and analyze its underlying reasons. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven framework, "InfantCryNet," for accomplishing these tasks. To address the issue of data scarcity, we employ pre-trained audio models to incorporate prior knowledge into our model. We propose the use of statistical pooling and multi-head attention pooling techniques to extract features more effectively. Additionally, knowledge distillation and model quantization are applied to enhance model efficiency and reduce the model size, better supporting industrial deployment in mobile devices. Experiments on real-life datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 4.4% in classification accuracy. The model compression effectively reduces the model size by 7% without compromising performance and by up to 28% with only an 8% decrease in accuracy, offering practical insights for model selection and system design.</description>

      <title>The Codec Language Model-based Zero-Shot Spontaneous Style TTS System for CoVoC Challenge 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the zero-shot spontaneous style TTS system for the ISCSLP 2024 Conversational Voice Clone Challenge (CoVoC). We propose a LLaMA-based codec language model with a delay pattern to achieve spontaneous style voice cloning. To improve speech intelligibility, we introduce the Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) strategy in the language model to strengthen conditional guidance on token prediction. To generate high-quality utterances, we adopt effective data preprocessing operations and fine-tune our model with selected high-quality spontaneous speech data. The official evaluations in the CoVoC constrained track show that our system achieves the best speech naturalness MOS of 3.80 and obtains considerable speech quality and speaker similarity results.</description>

      <title>Potential Applications of Artificial Intelligence for Cross-language Intelligibility Assessment of Dysarthric Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This commentary introduces how artificial intelligence (AI) can be leveraged to advance cross-language intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech. Method: We propose a conceptual framework consisting of a universal model that captures language-universal speech impairments and a language-specific intelligibility model that incorporates linguistic nuances. Additionally, we identify key barriers to cross-language intelligibility assessment, including data scarcity, annotation complexity, and limited linguistic insights, and present AI-driven solutions to overcome these challenges. Conclusion: Advances in AI offer transformative opportunities to enhance cross-language intelligibility assessment for dysarthric speech by balancing scalability across languages and adaptability by languages.</description>

      <title>MIDI-GPT: A Controllable Generative Model for Computer-Assisted Multitrack Music Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and release MIDI-GPT, a generative system based on the Transformer architecture that is designed for computer-assisted music composition workflows. MIDI-GPT supports the infilling of musical material at the track and bar level, and can condition generation on attributes including: instrument type, musical style, note density, polyphony level, and note duration. In order to integrate these features, we employ an alternative representation for musical material, creating a time-ordered sequence of musical events for each track and concatenating several tracks into a single sequence, rather than using a single time-ordered sequence where the musical events corresponding to different tracks are interleaved. We also propose a variation of our representation allowing for expressiveness. We present experimental results that demonstrate that MIDI-GPT is able to consistently avoid duplicating the musical material it was trained on, generate music that is stylistically similar to the training dataset, and that attribute controls allow enforcing various constraints on the generated material. We also outline several real-world applications of MIDI-GPT, including collaborations with industry partners that explore the integration and evaluation of MIDI-GPT into commercial products, as well as several artistic works produced using it.</description>

      <title>AudioGenX: Explainability on Text-to-Audio Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-audio generation models (TAG) have achieved significant advances in generating audio conditioned on text descriptions. However, a critical challenge lies in the lack of transparency regarding how each textual input impacts the generated audio. To address this issue, we introduce AudioGenX, an Explainable AI (XAI) method that provides explanations for text-to-audio generation models by highlighting the importance of input tokens. AudioGenX optimizes an Explainer by leveraging factual and counterfactual objective functions to provide faithful explanations at the audio token level. This method offers a detailed and comprehensive understanding of the relationship between text inputs and audio outputs, enhancing both the explainability and trustworthiness of TAG models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AudioGenX in producing faithful explanations, benchmarked against existing methods using novel evaluation metrics specifically designed for audio generation tasks.</description>
