      <title>3SUM in Preprocessed Universes: Faster and Simpler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the 3SUM problem in the \emph{preprocessed universes} setting. We present an algorithm that, given three sets $A$, $B$, $C$ of $n$ integers, preprocesses them in quadratic time, so that given any subsets $A' \subseteq A$, $B' \subseteq B$, $C' \subseteq C$, it can decide if there exist $a \in A'$, $b \in B'$, $c \in C'$ with $a+b=c$ in time $O(n^{1.5} \log n)$.
  In contrast to both the first subquadratic $\tilde{O}(n^{13/7})$-time algorithm by Chan and Lewenstein (STOC 2015) and the current fastest $\tilde{O}(n^{11/6})$-time algorithm by Chan, Vassilevska Williams, and Xu (STOC 2023), which are based on the Balog--Szemer\'edi--Gowers theorem from additive combinatorics, our algorithm uses only standard 3SUM-related techniques, namely FFT and linear hashing modulo a prime. It is therefore not only faster but also simpler.
  Just as the two previous algorithms, ours not only decides if there is a single 3SUM solution but it actually determines for each $c \in C'$ if there is a solution containing it. We also modify the algorithm to still work in the scenario where the set $C$ is unknown at the time of preprocessing. Finally, even though the simplest version of our algorithm is randomized, we show how to make it deterministic losing only polylogarithmic factors in the running time.</description>

      <title>The Parameterized Complexity Landscape of the Unsplittable Flow Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the well-established problem of finding an optimal routing of unsplittable flows in a graph. While by now there is an extensive body of work targeting the problem on graph classes such as paths and trees, we aim at using the parameterized paradigm to identify its boundaries of tractability on general graphs. We develop novel algorithms and lower bounds which result in a full classification of the parameterized complexity of the problem with respect to natural structural parameterizations for the problem -- notably maximum capacity, treewidth, maximum degree, and maximum flow length. In particular, we obtain a fixed-parameter algorithm for the problem when parameterized by all four of these parameters, establish XP-tractability as well as W[1]-hardness with respect to the former three and latter three parameters, and all remaining cases remain paraNP-hard.</description>

      <title>Faster Approximation Algorithms for Restricted Shortest Paths in Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the restricted shortest paths problem, we are given a graph $G$ whose edges are assigned two non-negative weights: lengths and delays, a source $s$, and a delay threshold $D$. The goal is to find, for each target $t$, the length of the shortest $(s,t)$-path whose total delay is at most $D$. While this problem is known to be NP-hard [Garey and Johnson, 1979] $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate algorithms running in $\tilde{O}(mn)$ time [Goel et al., INFOCOM'01; Lorenz and Raz, Oper. Res. Lett.'01] given more than twenty years ago have remained the state-of-the-art for directed graphs. An open problem posed by [Bernstein, SODA'12] -- who gave a randomized $m\cdot n^{o(1)}$ time bicriteria $(1+\varepsilon, 1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for undirected graphs -- asks if there is similarly an $o(mn)$ time approximation scheme for directed graphs.
  We show two randomized bicriteria $(1+\varepsilon, 1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms that give an affirmative answer to the problem: one suited to dense graphs, and the other that works better for sparse graphs. On directed graphs with a quasi-polynomial weights aspect ratio, our algorithms run in time $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ and $\tilde{O}(mn^{3/5})$ or better, respectively. More specifically, the algorithm for sparse digraphs runs in time $\tilde{O}(mn^{(3 - \alpha)/5})$ for graphs with $n^{1 + \alpha}$ edges for any real $\alpha \in [0,1/2]$.</description>

      <title>Parallel Cluster-BFS and Applications to Shortest Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breadth-first Search (BFS) is one of the most important graph processing subroutines, especially to compute the unweighted distance. Many applications may require running BFS from multiple sources. Sequentially, when running BFS on a cluster of nearby vertices, a known optimization is to use bit-parallelism. Given a subset of vertices with size $k$ and the distance between any pair of them is no more than $d$, BFS can be applied to all of them in a total work of $O(dk/w+1)$, where $w$ is the length of a word in bits. We will refer to this approach as cluster-BFS (C-BFS). Such an approach has been studied and shown effective both in theory and in practice in the sequential setting. However, it remains unknown how this can be combined with thread-level parallelism for C-BFS.
  In this paper, we focus on designing efficient parallel C-BFS based on BFS to answer unweighted distance queries. Our solution combines the strengths of bit-level parallelism and thread-level parallelism, and achieves significant speedup over the plain sequential solution. We also apply our algorithm to real-world applications. In particular, we identified another application (landmark-labeling for the approximate distance oracle) that can take advantage of parallel C-BFS. Under the same memory budget, our new solution improves accuracy and/or time on all the 18 tested graphs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Robust Estimation under Local and Global Corruptions: Stronger Adversary and Smaller Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic robust statistics has traditionally focused on the contamination model where a small fraction of the samples are arbitrarily corrupted. We consider a recent contamination model that combines two kinds of corruptions: (i) small fraction of arbitrary outliers, as in classical robust statistics, and (ii) local perturbations, where samples may undergo bounded shifts on average. While each noise model is well understood individually, the combined contamination model poses new algorithmic challenges, with only partial results known. Existing efficient algorithms are limited in two ways: (i) they work only for a weak notion of local perturbations, and (ii) they obtain suboptimal error for isotropic subgaussian distributions (among others). The latter limitation led [NGS24, COLT'24] to hypothesize that improving the error might, in fact, be computationally hard. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that information theoretically optimal error can indeed be achieved in polynomial time, under an even \emph{stronger} local perturbation model (the sliced-Wasserstein metric as opposed to the Wasserstein metric). Notably, our analysis reveals that the entire family of stability-based robust mean estimators continues to work optimally in a black-box manner for the combined contamination model. This generalization is particularly useful in real-world scenarios where the specific form of data corruption is not known in advance. We also present efficient algorithms for distribution learning and principal component analysis in the combined contamination model.</description>

      <title>EFX Exists for Three Types of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of finding an envy-free allocation of indivisible goods among multiple agents. EFX, which stands for envy-freeness up to any good, is a well-studied relaxation of the envy-free allocation problem and has been shown to exist for specific scenarios. For instance, EFX is known to exist when there are only three agents [Chaudhury et al, EC 2020], and for any number of agents when there are only two types of valuations [Mahara, Discret. Appl. Math 2023].
  We show that EFX allocations exist for any number of agents when there are at most three types of additive valuations.</description>

      <title>EFX Allocations and Orientations on Bipartite Multi-graphs: A Complete Picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the fundamental problem of fairly allocating a set of indivisible items among agents having valuations that are represented by a multi-graph -- here, agents appear as the vertices and items as the edges between them and each vertex (agent) only values the set of its incident edges (items). The goal is to find a fair, i.e., envy-free up to any item (EFX) allocation. This model has recently been introduced by Christodoulou et al. (EC'23) where they show that EFX allocations always exist on simple graphs for monotone valuations, i.e., where any two agents can share at most one edge (item). A natural question arises as to what happens when we go beyond simple graphs and study various classes of multi-graphs?
  We answer the above question affirmatively for the valuation class of bipartite multi-graphs and multi-cycles. Our main positive result is that EFX allocations always exist on bipartite multi-graphs for agents with additive valuations, thereby joining in the few sets of scenarios where EFX allocations are known to exist for an arbitrary number of agents. We also show that EFX allocations can be computed in polynomial time if the number of edges between any two agents in the given bipartite multi-graph is a constant. Next, we study EFX orientations (i.e., allocations where every item is allocated to one of its two endpoint agents) and give a complete picture of when they exist for bipartite multi-graphs dependent on two parameters -- the number of edges shared between any two agents and the diameter of the graph. Finally, we prove that it is NP-complete to determine whether a given fair division instance on a bipartite multi-graph admits an EFX orientation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the complexity of covariance matrix estimation for Gibbs distributions based on dependent samples from a Markov chain. We show that when $\pi$ satisfies a Poincar\'e inequality and the chain possesses a spectral gap, we can achieve similar sample complexity using MCMC as compared to an estimator constructed using i.i.d. samples, with potentially much better query complexity. As an application of our methods, we show improvements for the query complexity in both constrained and unconstrained settings for concrete instances of MCMC. In particular, we provide guarantees regarding isotropic rounding procedures for sampling uniformly on convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Almost Ramanujan Expanders from Arbitrary Expanders via Operator Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an efficient algorithm that transforms any bounded degree expander graph into another that achieves almost optimal (namely, near-quadratic, $d \leq 1/\lambda^{2+o(1)}$) trade-off between (any desired) spectral expansion $\lambda$ and degree $d$. Furthermore, the algorithm is local: every vertex can compute its new neighbors as a subset of its original neighborhood of radius $O(\log(1/\lambda))$. The optimal quadratic trade-off is known as the Ramanujan bound, so our construction gives almost Ramanujan expanders from arbitrary expanders.
  The locality of the transformation preserves structural properties of the original graph, and thus has many consequences. Applied to Cayley graphs, our transformation shows that any expanding finite group has almost Ramanujan expanding generators. Similarly, one can obtain almost optimal explicit constructions of quantum expanders, dimension expanders, monotone expanders, etc., from existing (suboptimal) constructions of such objects. Another consequence is a "derandomized" random walk on the original (suboptimal) expander with almost optimal convergence rate. Our transformation also applies when the degree is not bounded or the expansion is not constant.
  We obtain our results by a generalization of Ta-Shma's technique in his breakthrough paper [STOC 2017], used to obtain explicit almost optimal binary codes. Specifically, our spectral amplification extends Ta-Shma's analysis of bias amplification from scalars to matrices of arbitrary dimension in a very natural way. Curiously, while Ta-Shma's explicit bias amplification derandomizes a well-known probabilistic argument (underlying the Gilbert--Varshamov bound), there seems to be no known probabilistic (or other existential) way of achieving our explicit ("high-dimensional") spectral amplification.</description>

      <title>Recursive lattice reduction -- A framework for finding short lattice vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a recursive lattice reduction framework for finding short non-zero vectors or dense sublattices of a lattice. The framework works by recursively searching for dense sublattices of dense sublattices (or their duals) with progressively lower rank. When the procedure encounters a recursive call on a lattice $L$ with relatively low rank, we simply use a known algorithm to find a shortest non-zero vector in $L$.
  This new framework is complementary to basis reduction algorithms, which similarly work to reduce an $n$-dimensional lattice problem with some approximation factor $\gamma$ to a lower-dimensional exact lattice problem in some lower dimension $k$, with a tradeoff between $\gamma$, $n$, and $k$. Our framework provides an alternative and arguably simpler perspective. For example, our algorithms can be described at a high level without explicitly referencing any specific basis of the lattice, the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, or even projection (though, of course, concrete implementations of algorithms in this framework will likely make use of such things).
  We present a number of instantiations of our framework. Our main concrete result is an efficient reduction that matches the tradeoff achieved by the best-known basis reduction algorithms. This reduction also can be used to find dense sublattices with any rank $\ell$ satisfying $\min\{\ell,n-\ell\} \leq n-k+1$, using only an oracle for SVP in $k$ dimensions, with slightly better parameters than what was known using basis reduction.
  We also show a simple reduction with the same tradeoff for finding short vectors in quasipolynomial time, and a reduction from finding dense sublattices of a high-dimensional lattice to this problem in lower dimension. Finally, we present an automated search procedure that finds algorithms in this framework that (provably) achieve better approximations with fewer oracle calls.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a data structure for counting pattern occurrences in texts compressed with any run-length context-free grammar. Our structure uses space proportional to the grammar size and counts the occurrences of a pattern of length $m$ in a text of length $n$ in time \(O(m\log^{2+\epsilon} n)\), for any constant \(\epsilon &gt; 0\). This closes an open problem posed by Christiansen et al.~[ACM TALG 2020] and enhances our abilities for computation over compressed data; we give an example application.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Approximating All Norms for Massively Parallel Correlation Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the simultaneous approximation model for the correlation clustering problem introduced by Davies, Moseley, and Newman[DMN24]. The objective is to find a clustering that minimizes given norms of the disagreement vector over all vertices.
  We present an efficient algorithm that produces a clustering that is simultaneously a $63.3$-approximation for all monotone symmetric norms. This significantly improves upon the previous approximation ratio of $6348$ due to Davies, Moseley, and Newman[DMN24], which works only for $\ell_p$-norms.
  To achieve this result, we first reduce the problem to approximating all top-$k$ norms simultaneously, using the connection between monotone symmetric norms and top-$k$ norms established by Chakrabarty and Swamy [CS19]. Then we develop a novel procedure that constructs a $12.66$-approximate fractional clustering for all top-$k$ norms. Our $63.3$-approximation ratio is obtained by combining this with the $5$-approximate rounding algorithm by Kalhan, Makarychev, and Zhou[KMZ19].
  We then demonstrate that with a loss of $\epsilon$ in the approximation ratio, the algorithm can be adapted to run in nearly linear time and in the MPC (massively parallel computation) model with poly-logarithmic number of rounds.
  By allowing a further trade-off in the approximation ratio to $(359+\epsilon)$, the number of MPC rounds can be reduced to a constant.</description>

      <title>Querying in Constant Expected Time with Learned Indexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03851v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learned indexes leverage machine learning models to accelerate query answering in databases, showing impressive practical performance. However, theoretical understanding of these methods remains incomplete. Existing research suggests that learned indexes have superior asymptotic complexity compared to their non-learned counterparts, but these findings have been established under restrictive probabilistic assumptions. Specifically, for a sorted array with $n$ elements, it has been shown that learned indexes can find a key in $O(\log(\log n))$ expected time using at most linear space, compared with $O(\log n)$ for non-learned methods.
  In this work, we prove $O(1)$ expected time can be achieved with at most linear space, thereby establishing the tightest upper bound so far for the time complexity of an asymptotically optimal learned index. Notably, we use weaker probabilistic assumptions than prior research, meaning our work generalizes previous results. Furthermore, we introduce a new measure of statistical complexity for data. This metric exhibits an information-theoretical interpretation and can be estimated in practice. This characterization provides further theoretical understanding of learned indexes, by helping to explain why some datasets seem to be particularly challenging for these methods.</description>

  (i) Assuming $|\psi\rangle$ is a phase state, i.e., $|\psi\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum \limits_{x \in \{0,1\}^n} {f(x)}|x\rangle$ where $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{-1,1\}$, then we give a $\textsf{poly}(1/\varepsilon_1)$ sample and $n\cdot \textsf{poly}(1/\varepsilon_1)$ time algorithm for every $\varepsilon_1 &gt; 0$ and $\varepsilon_2 \leq \textsf{poly}(\varepsilon_1)$, for tolerant testing stabilizer states.
  (ii) For arbitrary quantum states $|\psi\rangle$, assuming a conjecture in additive combinatorics, we give a $\textsf{poly}(1/\varepsilon_1)$-sample and $n\cdot \textsf{poly}(1/\varepsilon_1)$-time algorithm for this task for every $\varepsilon_1&gt;0$ and $\varepsilon_2\leq 2^{-\textsf{poly}(1/\varepsilon_1)}$
  Our proof includes a new definition of Gowers norm for quantum states, an inverse theorem for the Gowers-$3$ norm of states and new bounds on stabilizer covering for structured subsets of Paulis using results in additive combinatorics.</description>
