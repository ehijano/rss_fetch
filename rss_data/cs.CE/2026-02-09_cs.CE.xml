      <title>A Fast and Generalizable Fourier Neural Operator-Based Surrogate for Melt-Pool Prediction in Laser Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity simulations of laser welding capture complex thermo-fluid phenomena, including phase change, free-surface deformation, and keyhole dynamics, however their computational cost limits large-scale process exploration and real-time use. In this work we present the Laser Processing Fourier Neural Operator (LP-FNO), a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) based surrogate model that learns the parametric solution operator of various laser processes from multiphysics simulations generated with FLOW-3D WELD (registered trademark). Through a novel approach of reformulating the transient problem in the moving laser frame and applying temporal averaging, the system results in a quasi-steady state setting suitable for operator learning, even in the keyhole welding regime. The proposed LP-FNO maps process parameters to three-dimensional temperature fields and melt-pool boundaries across a broad process window spanning conduction and keyhole regimes using the non-dimensional normalized enthalpy formulation. The model achieves temperature prediction errors on the order of 1% and intersection-over-union scores for melt-pool segmentation over 0.9. We demonstrate that a LP-FNO model trained on coarse-resolution data can be evaluated on finer grids, yielding accurate super-resolved predictions in mesh-converged conduction regimes, whereas discrepancies in keyhole regimes reflect unresolved dynamics in the coarse-mesh training data. These results indicate that the LP-FNO provides an efficient surrogate modeling framework for laser welding, enabling prediction of full three-dimensional fields and phase interfaces over wide parameter ranges in just tens of milliseconds, up to a hundred thousand times faster than traditional Finite Volume multi-physics software.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Noisy Real-World Corpora for Foundation Model Pre-Training via Quality-Aware Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current tokenization methods process sequential data without accounting for signal quality, limiting their effectiveness on noisy real-world corpora. We present QA-Token (Quality-Aware Tokenization), which incorporates data reliability directly into vocabulary construction. We make three key contributions: (i) a bilevel optimization formulation that jointly optimizes vocabulary construction and downstream performance, (ii) a reinforcement learning approach that learns merge policies through quality-aware rewards with convergence guarantees, and (iii) an adaptive parameter learning mechanism via Gumbel-Softmax relaxation for end-to-end optimization. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates consistent improvements: genomics (6.7 percentage point F1 gain in variant calling over BPE), finance (30% Sharpe ratio improvement). At foundation scale, we tokenize a pretraining corpus comprising 1.7 trillion base-pairs and achieve state-of-the-art pathogen detection (94.53 MCC) while reducing token count by 15%. We unlock noisy real-world corpora, spanning petabases of genomic sequences and terabytes of financial time series, for foundation model training with zero inference overhead.</description>

      <title>Predicting the fatigue life of asphalt concrete using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asphalt concrete's (AC) durability and maintenance demands are strongly influenced by its fatigue life. Traditional methods for determining this characteristic are both resource-intensive and time-consuming. This study employs artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict AC fatigue life, focusing on the impact of strain level, binder content, and air-void content. Leveraging a substantial dataset, we tailored our models to effectively handle the wide range of fatigue life data, typically represented on a logarithmic scale. The mean square logarithmic error was utilized as the loss function to enhance prediction accuracy across all levels of fatigue life. Through comparative analysis of various hyperparameters, we developed a machine-learning model that captures the complex relationships within the data. Our findings demonstrate that higher binder content significantly enhances fatigue life, while the influence of air-void content is more variable, depending on binder levels. Most importantly, this study provides insights into the intricacies of using ANNs for modeling, showcasing their potential utility with larger datasets. The codes developed and the data used in this study are provided as open source on a GitHub repository, with a link included in the paper for full access.</description>

      <title>Influence of coronary plaque morphology on local mechanical states and associated in-stent restenosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-stent restenosis (ISR) after percutaneous coronary intervention is a multi-factorial process. Specific morphological lesion characteristics were observed to contribute to the occurrence of ISR. Local mechanical factors, such as stresses and strains, are known to influence tissue adaptation after stent implantation. However, the influence of morphological features on those local mechanical states and, hence, on the occurrence of ISR remains understudied. This work explores how local mechanical quantities relate to ISR by evaluating the stress distributions in the artery wall during and after stent implantation for morphology-informed lesion examples. We perform computational simulations of the stenting procedure with physics-based patient-specific coronary artery models. Different morphologies are assessed using the spatial plaque composition information from high-resolution coronary computed tomography angiography data. In the sample cases, elevated local tensile stresses were consistently found at sites corresponding to ISR. We found that specific morphological characteristics like circumferential or asymmetric block calcifications result in higher stresses in the surrounding tissue. These findings show that for the observed connection between plaque morphology and ISR, the local mechanical state may represent a relevant link. This study provides a mechanistic, illustrative insight for the examined cases. Future work with larger cohorts and systematic follow-up can establish statistically robust associations.</description>

      <title>MDAgent2: Large Language Model for Code Generation and Knowledge Q&amp;A in Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02075v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for understanding atomic-scale behaviors in materials science, yet writing LAMMPS scripts remains highly specialized and time-consuming tasks. Although LLMs show promise in code generation and domain-specific question answering, their performance in MD scenarios is limited by scarce domain data, the high deployment cost of state-of-the-art LLMs, and low code executability. Building upon our prior MDAgent, we present MDAgent2, the first end-to-end framework capable of performing both knowledge Q&amp;A and code generation within the MD domain. We construct a domain-specific data-construction pipeline that yields three high-quality datasets spanning MD knowledge, question answering, and code generation. Based on these datasets, we adopt a three stage post-training strategy--continued pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL)--to train two domain-adapted models, MD-Instruct and MD-Code. Furthermore, we introduce MD-GRPO, a closed-loop RL method that leverages simulation outcomes as reward signals and recycles low-reward trajectories for continual refinement. We further build MDAgent2-RUNTIME, a deployable multi-agent system that integrates code generation, execution, evaluation, and self-correction. Together with MD-EvalBench proposed in this work, the first benchmark for LAMMPS code generation and question answering, our models and system achieve performance surpassing several strong baselines.This work systematically demonstrates the adaptability and generalization capability of large language models in industrial simulation tasks, laying a methodological foundation for automatic code generation in AI for Science and industrial-scale simulations.

      <title>Collective Noise Filtering in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex networks are powerful representations of complex systems across scales and domains, and the field is experiencing unprecedented growth in data availability. However, real-world network data often suffer from noise, biases, and missing data in edge weights, which undermine the reliability of downstream network analyses. Standard noise filtering approaches, whether treating individual edges one-by-one or assuming a uniform global noise level, are suboptimal, because in reality both signal and noise can be heterogeneous and correlated across multiple edges. As a solution, we introduce the Network Wiener Filter, a principled method for collective edge-level noise filtering that leverages both network structure and noise characteristics, to reduce error in the observed edge weights and to infer missing edge weights. We demonstrate the broad practical efficacy of the Network Wiener Filter in two distinct settings, the genetic interaction network of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae and the Enron Corpus email network, noting compelling evidence of successful noise suppression in both applications. With the Network Wiener Filter, we advocate for a shift toward error-aware network science, one that embraces data imperfection as an inherent feature and learns to navigate it effectively.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Matrix Decomposition and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11337v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sole aim of this book is to give a self-contained introduction to concepts and mathematical tools in Bayesian matrix decomposition in order to seamlessly introduce matrix decomposition techniques and their applications in subsequent sections. However, we clearly realize our inability to cover all the useful and interesting results concerning Bayesian matrix decomposition and given the paucity of scope to present this discussion, e.g., the separated analysis of variational inference for conducting the optimization. We refer the reader to literature in the field of Bayesian analysis for a more detailed introduction to the related fields.
  This book is primarily a summary of purpose, significance of important Bayesian matrix decomposition methods, e.g., real-valued decomposition, nonnegative matrix factorization, Bayesian interpolative decomposition, and the origin and complexity of the methods which shed light on their applications. The mathematical prerequisite is a first course in statistics and linear algebra. Other than this modest background, the development is self-contained, with rigorous proof provided throughout.</description>

      <title>Physics vs Distributions: Pareto Optimal Flow Matching with Physics Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-constrained generative modeling aims to produce high-dimensional samples that are both physically consistent and distributionally accurate, a task that remains challenging due to often conflicting optimization objectives. Recent advances in flow matching and diffusion models have enabled efficient generative modeling, but integrating physical constraints often degrades generative fidelity or requires costly inference-time corrections. Our work is the first to recognize the trade-off between distributional and physical accuracy. Based on the insight of inherently conflicting objectives, we introduce Physics-Based Flow Matching (PBFM) a method that enforces physical constraints at training time using conflict-free gradient updates and unrolling to mitigate Jensen's gap. Our approach avoids manual loss balancing and enables simultaneous optimization of generative and physical objectives. As a consequence, physics constraints do not impede inference performance. We benchmark our method across three representative PDE benchmarks. PBFM achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off, competitive inference speed, and generalizes to a wide range of physics-constrained generative tasks, providing a practical tool for scientific machine learning.
