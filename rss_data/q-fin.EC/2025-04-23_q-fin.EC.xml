      <title>The economic value of transport infrastructure in the UK: an input output analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport infrastructure systems operate in, and are shaped by, the specific context in which they are expected to perform and contribute to the system-of-systems that support civilised life; they must strive to be sustainable and resilient. However, transport, one of the economic infrastructures, is viewed narrowly in political circles as a vehicle for economic prosperity: political focus falls on the economic pillar of sustainability. One perennial challenge concerns the inclusion of social and environmental value into such performance judgements. A deep understanding of system interdependencies is essential when comparing input output tables (a top down approach) with cost benefit analysis (CBA, a bottom up approach). CBA works best when there is adequate information to calculate a monetary value for all economic, social, and environmental outcomes, whereas input output tables are most effective when environmental and social value are kept distinct from economic value and where the beneficial economic impacts extend across multiple sectors (CBA is inadequate in this regard). This research uses the World Input Output Database and principal component analysis to develop a model to capture this complex accounting process.In recognising how past interdependencies inform future development, this study s model provides new insights into indirect economic value creation within infrastructure systems.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Establishing Belt and Road Node Cities on the Development of Digital Inclusive Finance Across Chinese Provinces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domestic and foreign scholars have conducted many studies on the influencing factors of digital inclusive finance, but few studies on the impact of the "Belt and Road" and the establishment of node cities on digital inclusive finance. Therefore, it is necessary to study the impact of the establishment of node cities in the "Belt and Road" on the development of digital inclusive finance. This paper mainly uses descriptive analysis and literature analysis to summarize and analyze the development status of China's digital inclusive finance and relevant theoretical research on the development of the "Belt and Road" Initiative, and analyzes and collates the background knowledge needed for the demonstration from the aspects of the development status of China's digital inclusive finance and the impact of digital inclusive finance on the economy. In this process, referring to the relevant economic theories, the theoretical model of this paper is proposed and the influence machine analysis is carried out.
  Empirically, this paper selects the development level of digital inclusive finance in 31 provinces in China from 2011 to 2020 as the explained variable, takes the establishment of "Belt and Road" node cities as a quasi-natural experiment, and verifies the promoting effect of the establishment of "Belt and Road" node cities on the development of digital inclusive finance in provinces through the differential differential method. And verify whether the level of Internet development is a mediating variable. The empirical results show that the establishment of node cities in the "Belt and Road" does promote the development of digital inclusive finance in provinces with the level of Internet development as an intermediary variable.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Sentiment Insights from X Using VADER, DistilBERT, and Web-Scraped Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the age of social media, understanding public sentiment toward major corporations is crucial for investors, policymakers, and researchers. This paper presents a comprehensive sentiment analysis system tailored for corporate reputation monitoring, combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to accurately interpret public opinion in real time. The methodology integrates a hybrid sentiment detection framework leveraging both rule-based models (VADER) and transformer-based deep learning models (DistilBERT), applied to social media data from multiple platforms. The system begins with robust preprocessing involving noise removal and text normalization, followed by sentiment classification using an ensemble approach to ensure both interpretability and contextual accuracy. Results are visualized through sentiment distribution plots, comparative analyses, and temporal sentiment trends for enhanced interpretability. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in public sentiment across major corporations, with companies like Amazon (81.2) and Samsung (45.8) receiving excellent sentiment scores, while Microsoft (21.7) and Walmart (21.9) exhibit poor sentiment profiles. These findings demonstrate the utility of our multi-source sentiment framework in providing actionable insights regarding corporate public perception, enabling stakeholders to make informed strategic decisions based on comprehensive sentiment analysis.</description>

      <title>Demand for LLMs: Descriptive Evidence on Substitution, Market Expansion, and Multihoming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper documents three stylized facts about the demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) using data from OpenRouter, a prominent LLM marketplace. First, new models experience rapid initial adoption that stabilizes within weeks. Second, model releases differ substantially in whether they primarily attract new users or substitute demand from competing models. Third, multihoming, using multiple models simultaneously, is common among apps. These findings suggest significant horizontal and vertical differentiation in the LLM market, implying opportunities for providers to maintain demand and pricing power despite rapid technological advances.</description>

      <title>FinTextSim: Enhancing Financial Text Analysis with BERTopic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in information availability and computational capabilities have transformed the analysis of annual reports, integrating traditional financial metrics with insights from textual data. To extract valuable insights from this wealth of textual data, automated review processes, such as topic modeling, are crucial. This study examines the effectiveness of BERTopic, a state-of-the-art topic model relying on contextual embeddings, for analyzing Item 7 and Item 7A of 10-K filings from S&amp;P 500 companies (2016-2022). Moreover, we introduce FinTextSim, a finetuned sentence-transformer model optimized for clustering and semantic search in financial contexts. Compared to all-MiniLM-L6-v2, the most widely used sentence-transformer, FinTextSim increases intratopic similarity by 81% and reduces intertopic similarity by 100%, significantly enhancing organizational clarity. We assess BERTopic's performance using embeddings from both FinTextSim and all-MiniLM-L6-v2. Our findings reveal that BERTopic only forms clear and distinct economic topic clusters when paired with FinTextSim's embeddings. Without FinTextSim, BERTopic struggles with misclassification and overlapping topics. Thus, FinTextSim is pivotal for advancing financial text analysis. FinTextSim's enhanced contextual embeddings, tailored for the financial domain, elevate the quality of future research and financial information. This improved quality of financial information will enable stakeholders to gain a competitive advantage, streamlining resource allocation and decision-making processes. Moreover, the improved insights have the potential to leverage business valuation and stock price prediction models.</description>

      <title>The Formation of Production Networks: How Supply Chains Arise from Simple Learning with Minimal Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a model where firms determine the price at which they sell their differentiable goods, the volume that they produce, and the inputs (types and amounts) that they purchase from other firms. A steady-state production network emerges endogenously without resorting to assumptions such as equilibrium or perfect knowledge about production technologies. Through a simple version of reinforcement learning, firms with heterogeneous technologies cope with uncertainty and maximize profits. Due to this learning process, firms can adapt to shocks such as demand shifts, suppliers/clients closure, productivity changes, and production technology modifications; effectively reshaping the production network. To demonstrate the potential of this model, we analyze the upstream and downstream impact of demand and productivity shocks.</description>

      <title>Hedonic Prices and Quality Adjusted Price Indices Powered by AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop empirical models that efficiently process large amounts of unstructured product data (text, images, prices, quantities) to produce accurate hedonic price estimates and derived indices. To achieve this, we generate abstract product attributes (or ``features'') from descriptions and images using deep neural networks. These attributes are then used to estimate the hedonic price function. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we apply the models to Amazon's data for first-party apparel sales, and estimate hedonic prices. The resulting models have a very high out-of-sample predictive accuracy, with $R^2$ ranging from $80\%$ to $90\%$. Finally, we construct the AI-based hedonic Fisher price index, chained at the year-over-year frequency, and contrast it with the CPI and other electronic indices.</description>

      <title>Building floorspace and stock measurement: A review of global efforts, knowledge gaps, and research priorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite a substantial body of research-evidenced by our analysis of 2,628 peer-reviewed papers-global building floorspace data remain fragmented, inconsistent, and methodologically diverse. The lack of high-quality and openly accessible datasets poses major challenges to accurately assessing building carbon neutrality. This review focuses on global building floorspace, especially its nexus with energy and emissions. The key research areas include energy modeling, emissions analysis, building retrofits, and life cycle assessments. Each measurement approach-top-down, bottom-up, and hybrid-has its own limitations: top-down methods provide broad estimates but low accuracy, whereas bottom-up approaches are more precise but data intensive. Our simulations reveal a surge in floorspace growth across emerging economies-most notably in India, Indonesia, and Africa-with India's per capita floorspace projected to triple by 2070. We emphasize the need for a high-resolution global floorspace imagery database to compare energy efficiency, track decarbonization progress, and assess renovation impacts while promoting building sufficiency and accelerating the transition to net-zero building systems.</description>
