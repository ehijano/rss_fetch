      <title>{\sigma}/{\pi} character of H-bonding in water clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen bonds are typically treated as sufficiently localized directional intermolecular bonds, in which dispersion and electrostatic contributions can be distinguished. However, being formed chiefly due to the overlapping of p orbitals of electronegative atoms, the corresponding electronic bonds are characterized by both {\sigma}- and {\pi}-kind binding, the former determining the directionality of bonds, while the latter, the coupling of molecules and the collective effects in H-bond networks. The latter contribution was never considered previously and is predetermined by overlapping pre-lone pair orbitals of oxygen atoms. This is manifested in the peculiarities of the electron density distribution, which are quantified based on the analysis of magnetic shielding tensors of oxygen and bridge hydrogen nuclei and illustrated by the shapes of cluster orbitals of water aggregates.</description>

      <title>Third density and acoustic virial coefficients of helium isotopologues from ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improved two-body and three-body potentials for helium have been used to calculate from first principles the third density and acoustic virial coefficients for both $^4$He and $^3$He. For the third density virial coefficient $C(T)$, uncertainties have been reduced by a factor of 4--5 compared to the previous state of the art; the accuracy of first-principles $C(T)$ now exceeds that of the best experiments by more than two orders of magnitude. The range of calculations has been extended to temperatures as low as 0.5~K. For the third acoustic virial coefficient $\gamma_a(T)$, we applied the Schlessinger Point Method, which can calculate $\gamma_a$ and its uncertainty based on the $C(T)$ data, overcoming some limitations of direct path-integral calculation. The resulting $\gamma_a$ are calculated at temperatures down to 0.5~K; they are consistent with available experimental data but have much smaller uncertainties. The first-principles data presented here will enable improvement of primary temperature and pressure metrology based on gas properties.</description>
