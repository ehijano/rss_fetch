      <title>Stablecoin Design with Adversarial-Robust Multi-Agent Systems via Trust-Weighted Signal Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic stablecoins promise decentralized monetary stability by maintaining a target peg through programmatic reserve management. Yet, their reserve controllers remain vulnerable to regime-blind optimization, calibrating risk parameters on fair-weather data while ignoring tail events that precipitate cascading failures. The March 2020 Black Thursday collapse, wherein MakerDAO's collateral auctions yielded $8.3M in losses and a 15% peg deviation, exposed a critical gap: existing models like SAS systematically omit extreme volatility regimes from covariance estimates, producing allocations optimal in expectation but catastrophic under adversarial stress.
  We present MVF-Composer, a trust-weighted Mean-Variance Frontier reserve controller incorporating a novel Stress Harness for risk-state estimation. Our key insight is deploying multi-agent simulations as adversarial stress-testers: heterogeneous agents (traders, liquidity providers, attackers) execute protocol actions under crisis scenarios, exposing reserve vulnerabilities before they manifest on-chain. We formalize a trust-scoring mechanism T: A -&gt; [0,1] that down-weights signals from agents exhibiting manipulative behavior, ensuring the risk-state estimator remains robust to signal injection and Sybil attacks.
  Across 1,200 randomized scenarios with injected Black-Swan shocks (10% collateral drawdown, 50% sentiment collapse, coordinated redemption attacks), MVF-Composer reduces peak peg deviation by 57% and mean recovery time by 3.1x relative to SAS baselines. Ablation studies confirm the trust layer accounts for 23% of stability gains under adversarial conditions, achieving 72% adversarial agent detection. Our system runs on commodity hardware, requires no on-chain oracles beyond standard price feeds, and provides a reproducible framework for stress-testing DeFi reserve policies.</description>

      <title>The Compound BSDE Method: A Fully Forward Method for Option Pricing and Optimal Stopping Problems in Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the Compound BSDE method, a fully forward, deep-learning-based approach for solving a broad class of problems in financial mathematics, including optimal stopping. The method is based on a reformulation of option pricing problems in terms of a system of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), which offers a new perspective on the numerical treatment of compound options and optimal stopping problems such as Bermudan option pricing. Building on the classical deep BSDE method for a single BSDE, we develop an algorithm for compound BSDEs and establish its convergence properties. In particular, we derive an a posteriori error estimate for the proposed method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the approach, and illustrate its effectiveness for high-dimensional option pricing and optimal stopping problems.</description>
