      <title>Dynamics of motions and deformations of an arbitrary geometry flexural floe in ocean waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive mathematical framework for modeling the coupled hydroelastic dynamics of sea-ice floes of arbitrary shape and non-uniform thickness under linear ocean wave forcing. We simultaneously incorporate four dominant rigid-body motions (heave, surge, roll, pitch) and the complete spectrum of flexural deformation modes within a unified Green function formulation. The water flow is modeled using potential theory with Laplace's equation, while the floe obeys a generalized Kirchhoff-Love plate equation with spatially varying flexural rigidity. We formulate the coupled fluid-structure interaction problem through kinematic velocity-matching conditions and dynamic pressure-continuity conditions at the ice-water interface. The elastic eigenproblem with free-edge boundary conditions yields a complete orthogonal basis of deformation modes, accounting for added mass effects through modified natural frequencies. By decomposing the velocity potential into partial potentials associated with incident waves, scattered waves, rigid motions, and elastic modes, we reduce the problem to a system of Fredholm integral equations of the second kind for surface density functions on all boundary segments. The solution methodology employs single-layer potential representations with fundamental Green functions for Laplace's equation. We present explicit formulations for all boundary conditions in compact tensor form, provide asymptotic analysis for the spectrum of non-uniform thickness floes, and discuss resonance phenomena arising from the interaction between incident wave frequency and natural vibration modes.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Dynamical Modeling of Extrusion Based 3D Printing Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trade off between model fidelity and computational cost remains a central challenge in the computational modeling of extrusion based 3D printing, particularly for real time optimization and control. Although high fidelity simulations have advanced considerably for offline analysis, dynamical modeling tailored for online, control oriented applications is still significantly underdeveloped. In this study, we propose a reduced order dynamical flow model that captures the transient behavior of extrusion based 3D printing. The model is grounded in physics based principles derived from the Navier Stokes equations and further simplified through spatial averaging and input dependent parameterization. To assess its performance, the model is identified via a nonlinear least squares approach using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation data spanning a range of printing conditions and subsequently validated across multiple combinations of training and testing scenarios. The results demonstrate strong agreement with the CFD data within the nozzle, the nozzle substrate gap, and the deposited layer regions. Overall, the proposed reduced order model successfully captures the dominant flow dynamics of the process while maintaining a level of simplicity compatible with real time control and optimization.</description>

      <title>Vortices, turbulence, and center of pressure in flow over pitching swept wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the center of pressure (CoP) movement of rigid pitching swept wings based on prior measurements by (Zhu, Breuer, 2023}. The wings analyzed feature sweep angles of $0^{\circ}$, $10^{\circ}$, and $20^{\circ}$, and are subjected to large amplitude sinusoidal pitching instabilities below a critical torsional spring stiffness. The CoP location is determined from time-resolved force and moment measurements, revealing minimal variation in the cross-chord direction but significant spanwise and chord-wise movement, varied by sweep angle. The trajectory of the CoP varies with sweep angle due to the evolving strength and dynamics of the leading edge and tip vortices. The Force Moment Partitioning Method (FMPM) is applied to stereo Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) data to identify contributions from wing kinematics, vortex structures, and viscous effects. This approach elucidates the roles of leading edge and tip vortices, as well as the periodic and stochastic components of the flow field, in influencing the net forces and moments.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional gravity-capillary standing waves: computation, resonance and instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical study of three-dimensional gravity-capillary standing waves by using cubic and quintic truncated Hamiltonian formulations and the Craig-Sulem expansion of the Dirichlet-Neumann operator (DNO). The resulting models are treated as triply periodic boundary-value problems and solved via a spatio-temporal collocation method without executing initial-value calculations. This approach avoids the numerical stiffness associated with surface tension and numerical instabilities arising from time integration. We reduce the number of unknowns significantly by exploiting the spatio-temporal symmetries for three types of symmetric standing waves. Comparisons with existing asymptotic and numerical results illustrate excellent agreement between the models and the full potential-flow formulation. We investigate typical bifurcations and standing waves that feature square, hexagonal, and more complex flower-like patterns under the three-wave resonance. These solutions are generalisations of the classical Wilton ripples. Temporal simulations of the computed three-dimensional standing waves exhibit perfect periodicity and reveal an instability mechanism based on the reported oblique instability in two-dimensional standing waves.</description>

      <title>Taiji Patterns Swirled Out of Magnetic Liquid Metal Fluids under Rotating Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While magnetic fluids are well known for their rich ferrohydrodynamic behaviors, prior researches on dynamic droplet morphologies have largely been confined to the nonconducting matters. From an alternative, the electrically conductive magnetic liquid metals offer ever larger space for explorations meanwhile also incubate intriguing mysteries that had not been understood before. Here, we disclosed a group of rather profound fluidic phenomena happening on the magnetic liquid metals with sizes spanning from millimeter to centimeter scales when subject to the impact of a rotating magnet pair. We conceived that the identified flow patterns highly resemble that of the Chinese Taiji diagrams widely known as a classical theory to describe all things genesis and transformation, indicating the kaleidoscopic variations and intrinsic clues between modern magnetic liquid metal physics and the nature rules lying behind the ancient Eastern philosophy. Through systematically tuning the droplet volume, magnetic field strength, and magnet rotational speed, we achieved precise control over the liquid metal fluidic morphologies such as ellipses, dumbbells, toroidal rings, and Yin-Yang symbols, and quantified their dependence on the prescribed experimental conditions. Following the routes to construct the Taiji eight diagrams and their derivatives, we classified the disclosed flow patterns into eight representative schemes and three phase diagrams were plotted to characterize the fluidic patterns of the magnetic droplets correspondingly. The underlying mechanisms of magnetic liquid metal flow separation and coalescence were further interpreted from an energy perspective. These findings suggest enormous experimental insights and a theoretical framework for advancing fundamental magnetohydrodynamics and related engineering practices.</description>

      <title>Spreading dynamics of drops on a solid surface submerged in different outer fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypothesis: Surrounding fluids affect critically drop wetting dynamics in many applications involving viscous environments. Although macroscopic effects of outer fluid viscosity on contact line motion have been documented, the extent to which the outer fluid modulates internal flow pattern is still not well understood, largely due to experimental challenges. It is hypothesized that the external fluid exerts a dominant effect on the internal flow fields and energy dissipation, thereby altering dynamic contact angle evolution and overall wetting behavior. Elucidating this coupling mechanism is essential for advancing our understanding of multiphase spreading in complex fluid systems.
  Experiments: We investigate the spreading of Newtonian and non-Newtonian shear-thinning aqueous drops in air versus in oil, using high-speed imaging and custom-built micro-PIV. Internal velocity and viscosity fields are measured to quantitatively relate internal flow evolution to contact line motion. Dynamic contact angle was measured and analyzed using composite model incorporating hysteresis and pinning. Scaling laws were derived to compare spreading dynamics under different outer fluid viscosities and substrate wettabilities.
  Findings: In air, capillary waves trigger Laplace pressure gradients that drive rapid, outward internal flow as well as fast contact line motion. In contrast, viscous oils suppress wave formation and generate recirculating vortices, resulting in a significantly slower spreading process dominated by viscous drag. Despite power-law spreading in both cases, the governing timescales reflect fundamentally different mechanisms: inertial forces within the drop dominate in air, whereas external fluid viscosity controls the spreading dynamics in oil. A unified scaling incorporating outer-fluid viscosity and equilibrium contact angle gathers diverse data onto a master curve.  These results underscore the central role played by outer-fluid induced internal flow in governing wetting dynamics.</description>

      <title>Layering Theory of Liquids at Solid Interfaces: Interfacial Layering Oscillator Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural organization of liquids near solid interfaces profoundly influences phenomena such as wettability, nanofluidic transport, and interfacial heat transfer. This study introduces the Interfacial Layering Oscillator Model (ILOM), a concise, semi-phenomenological framework that accurately captures the oscillatory density profiles of liquids adjacent to planar solid surfaces. By deriving a second-order differential equation rooted in classical statistical mechanics and calibrated with molecular dynamics simulations, ILOM predicts the amplitude, decay rate, and wavelength of interfacial density layering with exceptional computational efficiency. This versatile model applies to both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces and extends to liquids beyond water, including methanol, providing valuable insights into critical interfacial properties that advance nanoscale fluid mechanics and material design.</description>

      <title>High-velocity optothermal whirlpool actuation at the air-water interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a meniscus lifted above a free water surface by an optical fiber delivering near infrared radiation, the upper confinement of the heated buoyant liquid amplifies the surface temperature gradient, driving particularly strong thermocapillary effects. When the temperature gradient within the meniscus becomes very large, the stationary convection flow destabilizes in a periodic pattern of surface hydrothermal waves. We show that these light fueled waves can be controlled to a large extent by acting on the system parameters, and harnessed to propel buoyant macroparticles along stable closed trajectories at exceptionally high speeds. With 20 mW of input power at 1550 nm, we observe fast linear oscillations of 0.1 to 1 mm particles with peak velocities up to 2 cm/s and a whirlpool-like stable orbital motion with rotation rate up to 600 rpm, the largest reported so far for optothermal actuation. These findings establish a new efficient method for contactless actuation on liquid surfaces with direct application in microfluidics and in the realization of efficient light powered micromotors. At the same time, the proposed fiber meniscus configuration provides a simple and adaptable platform for studying optothermal fluid instabilities and for generating and controlling surface thermocapillary waves.</description>

      <title>A Molecular Gas Dynamics Study of Hypersonic Boundary Layer Second Mack Mode Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A flat-plate laminar boundary layer is simulated at Mach 6 and unit Reynolds number of 1.1e7 using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method to capture and analyze spontaneous second-mode instability growth. Power spectral density (PSD) analysis identifies dominant frequencies of 200-400 kHz, in line with linear stability theory (LST) predictions. Near-wall perturbations remain confined within the unstable regions known from linear theory. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) of unsteady flowfield snapshots reveals wave packets of spatially coherent modes having wavelengths and phase speeds characteristic of the acoustic second mode; their growth and decay occur exclusively within LST-predicted unstable bounds. Targeted interaction with these flow instabilities is demonstrated for an acoustic vibrating surface (AVS), where forcing at the unstable frequency of 300 kHz results in amplified waves downstream, while at the stable frequency of 500 kHz AVS-induced disturbances are damped. This further emphasizes the ability of the present kinetic simulations to capture and describe linear perturbations at high Reynolds numbers and suggests that DSMC will be a useful tool for understanding theoretically founded control of laminar-turbulent transition in hypersonic boundary layers.</description>

      <title>Oscillating electroosmotic flow in channels and capillaries with modulated wall charge distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrolyte-filled channels with modulated wall charge distribution subjected to an applied DC electric field, form time-independent vortices whose sense of circulation is determined by the field direction [Physical Review Letters $ \mathbf{75}, 755, (1995)$]. In this paper we show that an electrolyte in a channel or cylindrical capillary subjected to an external \emph{alternating} (AC) electric field gives rise to various laminar flow structures, including vortices whose sense of circulation changes with the period of oscillation of the applied AC field. The introduction of a period of oscillation lifts certain degeneracies associated with its time-independent counterpart. Although, in general, the mass flux vanishes, the charge flux is nonzero. The flow is accompanied by a longitudinal (oscillating) advective current that displays hysteresis accompanied by a diverging and negative self-similar conductance that depends on the applied voltage [Nano Letters $\mathbf{10}, 2674, (2010)$]. We show that this behavior can be interpreted with respect to a ``memory retention time'', that depends on frequency, viscosity and the Debye length and could thus form the impetus for investigating control protocols of signal carriers.</description>

      <title>Capillary Filling Dynamics in Polygonal Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of capillary filling in tubes of regular polygon cross-section. Using Onsager variational principle, we derive a coupled ordinary differential equation and partial differential equation, which respectively describe time evolution of the bulk flow and the saturation profile of the finger flow. We obtain both numerical solution and self-similar solution to the coupled equations, and the results indicate that the bulk flow and the finger flow both follow the $t^{1/2}$ time-scaling. We show that due to the coupling effect of the finger flow, the prefactor for the bulk flow is smaller than that of the Lucas-Washburn prediction. The reduction effect is more pronounced when the side number $n$ of the regular-polygon is small, while as $n$ increases, the prefactor approaches Lucas-Washburn prediction.</description>

      <title>On the Markovian assumption in near-wall turbulence: The case of particle resuspension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the validity of the Markovian assumption in modeling near-wall turbulence by analyzing the detachment of micron-sized particles from the viscous sublayer. By coupling direct numerical simulations with a fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we demonstrate that while wall shear stress events follow Poissonian occurrence statistics, their internal dynamics exhibit strong temporal persistence (Hurst exponent $H \approx 0.84$), indicating non-Markovian memory. We reveal that the successful predictions of Markovian resuspension models stems from their free parameter acting as a phenomenological surrogate for flow memory. We further identify a critical regime transition governed by a wall shear stress events decay rate, $\lambda$. We identify a strong intermittency regime ($\lambda &lt; 0.2$), where coherent structures exhibit extended temporal correlations that cannot be mimicked by white noise. Conversely, rapid decays ($\lambda &gt; 0.2$) generate quasi-random fluctuations that justify the Markovian approximation. These findings offer a new perspective on the physical validity of classical stochastic modeling in wall-bounded flows.</description>

      <title>The Persistent Clock of Turbulent Thermal Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale circulation (LSC) of turbulent convection is a prominent feature of its dynamics and forms the basis for descriptive theories. We show, using experimental and numerical results from thermal convection in a cylindrical cell, that the LSC possesses a persistent internal `clock': its pulsating velocity as a function of time is described by a constant value of the parameter U/(lf) where U is the mean velocity, f the pulsation frequency, and l the characteristic length scale. By introducing a narrow sidewall barrier, we can trip the LSC, forming a pair of interconnected rolls stacked above and below the barrier. They independently exhibit the same value for the ratio U/(lf), even for vertically asymmetric pairs, indicating signs of synchrony. Thus, this parameter establishes a direct connection between plume-shedding dynamics and the flow topology.</description>

      <title>Particle Image Velocimetry Refinement via Consensus ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is an imaging technique in experimental fluid dynamics that quantifies flow fields around bluff bodies by analyzing the displacement of neutrally buoyant tracer particles immersed in the fluid. Traditional PIV approaches typically depend on tuning parameters specific to the imaging setup, making the performance sensitive to variations in illumination, flow conditions, and seeding density. On the other hand, even state-of-the-art machine learning methods for flow quantification are fragile outside their training set. In our experiments, we observed that flow quantification would improve if different tunings (or algorithms) were applied to different regions of the same image pair. In this work, we parallelize the instantaneous flow quantification with multiple algorithms and adopt a consensus framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, seamlessly incorporating priors such as smoothness and incompressibility. We perform several numerical experiments to demonstrate the benefits of this approach. For instance, we achieve a decrease in end-point-error of up to 20% of a dense-inverse-search estimator at an inference rate of 60Hz, and we show how this performance boost can be increased further with outlier rejection. Our method is implemented in JAX, effectively exploiting hardware acceleration, and integrated in Flow Gym, enabling (i) reproducible comparisons with the state-of-the-art, (ii) testing different base algorithms, (iii) straightforward deployment for active fluids control applications.</description>

      <title>Integrating Uncertainty Quantification into Computational Fluid Dynamics Models of Coronary Arteries Under Steady Flow</title>

Abstract: Computational models are continuously integrated in the clinical space, where they support clinicians in disease diagnosis, prognosis, and prevention strategies. While assisting in clinical space, these computational models frequently use deterministic approaches, where the inherent (aleatoric) variability of input parameters is ignored. This questions the credibility and often hinders the clinical adoption of these computational models. Therefore, in this study, we introduced uncertainty quantification in the computational fluid dynamics models of the left main coronary artery to analyze the influence of input hemodynamics parameters on wall shear stress (WSS). UncertainSCI was used, where an emulator was built using polynomial chaos expansion between the input parameters and the output quantity of interest, and the output sensitivities and statistics were directly extracted from the emulator. The uncertainty-informed framework was first applied to an analytical solution of the Navier-Stokes equation (Poiseuille flow) and then to a patient-specific model of the left main coronary artery. Different input hemodynamics parameters are considered, such as pressure, viscosity, density, velocity, and radius, whereas wall shear stress was considered as our output quantity of interest. The results suggest that velocity dominated the variability in WSS in the analytical model (~79%), whereas viscosity dominated in the patient-specific model (~59%). The results further suggest that out of all the Sobol indices interactions, unary interactions were the most dominant ones, contributing ~93.2% and ~99% for the analytical and patient-specific model, respectively. This study will enhance confidence in computational models, facilitating their adoption in the clinical space to improve decision-making for coronary artery disease diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic permeability of fluctuating porous membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we examine how porosity fluctuations affect the hydrodynamic permeability of a porous matrix or membrane. We introduce a fluctuating Darcy model, which couples the Navier-Stokes equation to the space- and time-dependent porosity fluctuations via a Darcy friction term. Using a perturbative approach, a Dyson equation for hydrodynamic fluctuations is derived and solved to express the permeability in terms of the matrix fluctuation spectrum. Surprisingly, the model reveals strong modifications of the fluid permeability in fluctuating matrices compared to static ones. Applications to various matrix excitation models - breathing matrix, phonons, active forcing - highlight the significant influence of matrix fluctuations on fluid transport, offering insights for optimizing membrane design for separation applications.</description>

      <title>On the risk of fatigue failure of structural elements exposed to bottom wave slamming -- Impulse response regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to investigate whether fatigue damage induced by bottom wave slamming can be a failure mode important to consider when sizing a marine structural element. The body exposed to wave impacts is assumed to have a shape and structural arrangement such that the duration of wave-impact loads is short relative to the structure's vibratory response time. In this dynamical regime, fatigue is found to be a potentially important failure mechanism: accounting for the risk of failure due to fatigue damage may result in design constraints that are significantly more conservative than those based on the risk of ultimate strength exceedance. The role of fatigue damage depends on the elevation of the body. It is predominant for low elevations, for which slamming events are frequent. Since this study aims to provide general insight, the specific details of the body, such as its shape and structural arrangement, are not specified. Instead, a general framework is used for the analysis. The way forward to address a specific case study, possibly including the effects of forward and seakeeping motions, is briefly explained.</description>

      <title>Compressible and immiscible fluids with arbitrary density ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the water-air system, the bulk density ratio is as high as about 1000; no model can fully tackle such a high density ratio system. In the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations, the density $\rho$ within the water-air interface is assumed to be a constant based on the Boussinesq approximation namely $\rho (\mathrm{d} \mathbf u/\mathrm{d} t)$, which does not account for the true momentum evolution $\mathrm{d} (\rho \mathbf u)/\mathrm{d} t$ ($\mathbf u$-fluid velocity). Here, we present an alternative theory for the density evolution equations of immiscible fluids in computational fluid dynamics, differing from the concept of Navier-Stokes and Euler equations. Our derivation is built upon the physical principle of energy minimization from the aspect of thermodynamics. The present results provide a generalization of Bernoulli's principle for energy conservation and a general formulation for the sound speed. The present model can be applied for immiscible fluids with arbitrarily high density ratios, thereby, opening a new window for computational fluid dynamics both for compressible and incompressible fluids.</description>

      <title>Wave energy converters as offshore wind farm guardians: a pathway to resilient ocean systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximizing the durability and reliability of offshore wind farms is essential for the clean energy transition. In this work, we demonstrate how wave energy converter (WEC) farms can shelter offshore wind farms from cyclic wave loading, resulting in significant reductions in turbine fatigue damage. Using experimentally validated hydrodynamic models, we show that WEC arrays can reduce wave-induced fatigue damage on the turbines by up to 25%, potentially lowering required monopile diameters and extending turbine lifetimes. This damage reduction propagates to the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of the wind farm, targeting cost reductions in nearly 50% of the total system costs. Additionally, WEC farms can benefit from this co-location by sharing siting costs, operation and maintenance teams, and mooring and transmission cables with the offshore wind farm. This work supports resilient, cost-effective offshore renewables for global deployment.</description>

      <title>Simulating The Urban Canopy's Impact on Wind-Driven Natural Ventilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The urban canopy affects wind in complex ways, making it challenging to predict wind-driven natural ventilation and cooling in buildings. Using large eddy simulations of coupled outdoor and indoor airflow, we study how the surrounding urban canopy and wind angle influence ventilation rates through four ventilation configurations: cross, corner, dual-room, and single-sided. Flow visualizations demonstrate how both large-scale flow patterns and local interference effects can influence ventilation rates by 50-85%. In general, lower density canopies give higher ventilation rates and wind angles that align with a direct path between two openings also lead to higher ventilation rates. However, interference effects from surrounding buildings can significantly change the local wind speed and direction, thus also changing ventilation rates. The magnitude of these interference effects depends on both the wind angle and surrounding building geometries. The effect of wind angle is less pronounced in a higher density canopy, where the urban canopy geometry more strongly guides the flow. The results demonstrate that the canopy's effect on ventilation rates is much more complex than those suggested by existing natural ventilation parameterizations.</description>

      <title>Slantwise convection and heat transport in icy moon oceans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ocean heat transport on icy moons shapes the ice shell topography, a primary observable of these moons. Two key processes control the heat transport: baroclinic instability driven by surface buoyancy contrasts and convective instability driven by heating from the core. However, global ocean simulations cannot accurately resolve convection under realistic icy moon conditions and instead often use Earth-based convective parameterizations, which capture only vertical convective mixing and cannot represent rotation-aligned slantwise convection on icy moons. We use high-resolution convection-resolving simulations to investigate ocean heat transport by slantwise convection in a parameter regime relevant to icy moons, isolated from baroclinic instability. Total heat transport follows the Coriolis-Inertial-Archimedean scaling with an added latitude dependence. The vertical transport increases with latitude, and the meridional transport is poleward. These results indicate that slantwise convection redistributes heat toward the poles, favoring a poleward-thinning ice shell, qualitatively consistent with Enceladus's observed ice thickness distribution.</description>
