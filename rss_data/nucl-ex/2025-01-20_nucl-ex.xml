      <title>Neutrinoless double-beta decay search with the LEGEND experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double-beta decay is a nuclear decay, given as $(A,Z) \rightarrow (A, Z+2) +2e^{-}$, with deep consequences for the understanding of our universe. A strong experimental program is underway to search for this transition with many proposed experiments using different technologies. In this article the LEGEND experiment, which uses $^{76}$Ge as the isotope of interest, will be described. We will discuss both the first stage, LEGEND-200, which is now taking data at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso of INFN in Italy, and the future stage, LEGEND-1000. LEGEND-200 has analyzed a first sample of data (48.3 kg$\cdot$yr) collected from March 2023 to February 2024 with a background index not far away from its goal of 2$\times$10$^{-4}$ cnts/(keV$\cdot$kg$\cdot$yr). Combining the LEGEND-200 data with those of \textsc{Gerda}\ and \textsc{Majorana Demonstrator}\ one obtains a sensitivity on the half-life of 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay in $^{76}$Ge of $T_{1/2} &gt; $ 2.8 $\times$ 10$^{26}$ yr at 90\% C.L. and a limit on $T_{1/2} &gt; $ 1.9 $\times$ 10$^{26}$ yr at 90\% C.L.</description>

      <title>Monitoring lead-acid battery function using operando neutron radiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating batteries while they operate allows researchers to track the inner electrochemical processes involved in working conditions. This study describes the first neutron radiography investigation of a lead-acid battery. A custom-designed neutron friendly lead-acid cell and casing is developed and studied operando during electrochemical cycling, in order to observe the activity within the electrolyte and at the electrodes. This experimental work is coupled with Monte Carlo simulations of neutron transmittance. Details of cell construction, data collection and data analysis are presented. This work highlights the potential of neutron imaging for tracking battery function and outlines opportunities for further development.</description>

      <title>Solar neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar neutrinos, generated abundantly by thermonuclear reactions in the solar interior, offer a unique tool for studying astrophysics and particle physics. The observation of solar neutrinos has led to the discovery of neutrino oscillation, a topic currently under active research, and it has been recognized by two Nobel Prizes. In this pedagogical introduction to solar neutrino physics, we will guide readers through several key questions: How are solar neutrinos produced? How are they detected? What is the solar neutrino problem, and how is it resolved by neutrino oscillation? This article also presents a brief overview of the theory of solar neutrino oscillation, the experimental achievements, new physics relevant to solar neutrinos, and the prospects in this field.</description>

      <title>Direct mass measurements of neutron-rich zinc and gallium isotopes: an investigation of the formation of the first r-process peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prediction of isotopic abundances resulting from the rapid neutron capture process (r-process) requires high-precision mass measurements. Using TITAN's on-line time-of-flight spectrometer, first time mass measurements are performed for $^{83}$Zn and $^{86}$Ga. These measurements reduced uncertainties, and are used to calculate isotopic abundances near the first r-process abundance peak using astrophysical conditions present during a binary neutron star (BNS) merger. Good agreement in abundance across a range of trajectories is found when comparing to several metal-poor stars while also strongly deviating from the solar r-process pattern. These findings point to a high degree of sensitivity to the electron fraction of a BNS merger on the final elemental abundance pattern for certain elements near the first r-process peak while others display universality. We find that small changes in electron fraction can produce distinct abundance patterns that match those of metal-poor stars with different classifications.</description>

      <title>The Auger-Meitner Radioisotope Microscope: an instrument for characterization of Auger electron multiplicities and energy distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a new instrument, the Argonne Auger Radioisotope Microscope (ARM), capable of characterizing the Auger electron emission of radionuclides, including candidates relevant in nuclear medicine. Our approach relies on event-by-event ion-electron coincidence, time-of-flight, and spatial readout measurement to determine correlated electron multiplicity and energy distributions of Auger decays. We present a proof-of-principle measurement with the ARM using X-ray photoionization of stable krypton beyond the K-edge and identify a bifurcation in the electron multiplicity distribution depending on the emission of K-LX electrons. Extension of the ARM to the characterization of radioactive sources of Auger electron emissions is enabled by the combination of two recent developments: (1) cryogenic buffer gas beam technology to introduce Auger emitters into the detection region with well-defined initial conditions, and (2) large-area micro-channel plate detectors with multi-hit detection capabilities to simultaneously detect multiple electrons emitted in a single decay.
  The ARM will generate new experimental data on Auger multiplicities that can be used to benchmark atomic relaxation and decay models. This data will provide insight into the low-energy regime of Auger electrons where intensity calculations are most challenging and experimental data is limited. In particular, accurate multiplicity data of the low-energy regime can be used to inform oncological dosimetry models, where electron energies less than 500 eV are known to be most effective in damaging DNA and cell membranes.</description>
