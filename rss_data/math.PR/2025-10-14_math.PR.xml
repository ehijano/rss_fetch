      <title>On the Fourier dimension of fractional Brownian graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we prove that the Fourier dimension of the graph $G(B)$ of a fractional Brownian motion $B$ with Hurst parameter $H\in(0,1/2)$ is equal to 1. This finishes to solve a conjecture by Fraser and Sahlsten. It also yields an exact formula for the gap $\dim_{\rm H}(G(B)) - \dim_{\rm F}(G(B))$ between the Hausdorff dimension and the Fourier dimension of $G(B)$. The proof is based on an intricate combinatorics procedure for multiple integrals related to the covariance function of the fractional Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Sparse graphs and their Benjamini-Schramm limits: a spectral tour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse graphs with bounded average degree form a rich class of discrete structures where local geometry strongly influences global behavior. The Benjamini-Schramm (BS) convergence offers a natural framework to describe their asymptotic local structure. In this note, we survey spectral aspects of BS convergence and their applications, with a focus on random Schreier graphs and covering graphs. We review some recent progress on the spectral decomposition of the local operators on graphs. We discuss the behavior of extreme eigenvalues and the growing role of strong convergence in distribution, which rules out spectral outliers. We also give a new application of strong convergence to the typical graph distance between vertices in Schreier graphs</description>

      <title>The generalized Zagreb index for non-plane and plane recursive trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zagreb index, which is defined as the sum of squares of degrees of the nodes of a tree, was studied in previous works by martingale techniques for random non-plane recursive trees and classes of random trees which are close to random plane recursive trees. These techniques are not easily amended to the generalized Zagreb index, which is defined similar but with squares replaced by higher powers. In this paper, we use the moment transfer approach to (i) obtain the first-order asymptotics of moments and to (ii) prove limit laws for the (suitable normalized) generalized Zagreb index for random non-plane and plane recursive trees; for the former, we show that for all higher powers the limit law is normal, for the latter, we show for cubes and fourth powers that its a non-normal law.</description>

      <title>On extremes for Gaussian subordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates extreme value theory for processes obtained by applying transformations to stationary Gaussian processes, also called subordinated Gaussian processes. The main contributions are as follows. First, we refine the method of \cite{sly2008nonstandard} to allow the covariance of the underlying Gaussian process to decay more slowly than any polynomial rate, nearly matching Berman's condition. Second, we extend the theory to a multivariate setting, where both the subordinated process and the underlying Gaussian process may be vector-valued, and the transformation is finite-dimensional. In particular, we establish the weak convergence of a point process constructed from the subordinated Gaussian process, from which a multivariate extreme value limit theorem follows. A key observation that facilitates our analysis, and may be of independent interest, is the following: any bivariate random vector derived from the transformations of two jointly Gaussian vectors with a non-unity canonical correlation always remains extremally independent. This observation also motivates us to introduce and discuss a notion we call m-extremal-dependence, which extends the classical concept of m-dependence. Moreover, we relax the restriction to finite-dimensional transforms, extending the results to infinite-dimensional settings via an approximation argument. As an illustration, we establish a limit theorem for a multivariate moving maxima process driven by regularly varying innovations that arise from subordinated Gaussian processes with potentially long memory.</description>

      <title>Reweighting metric measure spaces and Onsager-Machlup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a metric measure space $M:=(X,d,\mu)$ the Onsager-Machlup (OM) functional is a real valued function that has been seen as a generalized notion of a probability density function. The effect of reweighting the measure on OM functionals has been studied, however analogous reweightings of the metric to the best of our knowledge remain open. In this short note, we prove a transformation formula for OM functionals on geodesic metric measure spaces under reweighting of both the metric and the measure.</description>

      <title>Matrix Random Walks and the Lima Bean Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A matrix random walk is a stochastic process of the form $B_k = (I+A_1)\cdots(I+A_k)$ where $A_j$ are independent ``step'' matrices in $\mathrm{M}_N(\mathbb{C})$. With the right entry-covariance, a rescaled matrix random walk converges to Brownian motion $B(t)$ on a matrix Lie group. In this paper, we study the eigenvalues of such rescaled matrix random walks, as $N\to\infty$ and $k\to\infty$.
  The standard Brownian motion $W(t)$ on $\mathrm{M}_N(\mathbb{C})$ has independent Gaussian entries at each $t$. It is bi-invariant: mutiplying on the left or right by a unitary does not change the distribution. We prove that the empirical eigenvalue distribution of any matrix random walk $B_k$ with bi-invariant steps $A_j$ and initial distribution converges (for fixed $k$ as $N\to\infty$) to a probability measure on $\mathbb{C}$: the Brown measure of the free probability $\ast$-distribution limit $b_k$ of the random walk. If the steps $A_j$ are identically distributed with normalized Hilbert--Schmidt norm $\|A_j\|_2 = t$, the limit law of eigenvalues is supported on a compact ``lima bean'' shaped region. We explicitly compute the limit measure and region, and characterize their phase transitions as $t$ evolves.
  We prove that the Brown measure of $b_k$ converges as $k\to\infty$, to the Brown measure of the free multiplicative Brownian motion, assuming only that the steps are bi-invariant and normalized in Hilbert--Schmidt norm. Thus the Brownian motion is the universal limit of rescaled matrix random walks, under very general assumptions on the distribution of steps.</description>

      <title>A central limit theorem for unbalanced step-reinforced random walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of unbalanced step-reinforced random walks that unifies the elephant random walk, the positively step-reinforced random walk, and the negatively step-reinforced random walk. By establishing a connection with bond percolation on random recursive trees, these processes can be represented as randomly weighted sums of independent and identically distributed random variables. We first derive normal and stable central limit theorems for such randomly weighted sums, and then apply these results to obtain a unified central limit theorem for unbalanced step-reinforced random walks.</description>

      <title>A new $1/(1-\rho)$-scaling bound for multiserver queues via a leave-one-out technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bounding the queue length in a multiserver queue is a central challenge in queueing theory. Even for the classic $GI/GI/n$ queue with homogeneous servers, it is highly non-trivial to derive a simple and accurate bound for the steady-state queue length that holds across all scaling regimes. A recent breakthrough by Li and Goldberg (2025) establishes bounds that scale as $1/(1-\rho)$ for any load $\rho &lt; 1$ and number of servers $n$, which is the correct scaling in many well-known scaling regimes, including classic heavy-traffic, Halfin-Whitt and Nondegenerate-Slowdown. However, their bounds entail large constant factors and a highly intricate proof, suggesting room for further improvement.
  In this paper, we present a new $1/(1-\rho)$-scaling bound for the $GI/GI/n$ queue. Our bound, while restricted to the light-tailed case and the first moment of the queue length, has a more interpretable and often tighter leading constant. Our proof is relatively simple, utilizing a modified $GI/GI/n$ queue, the stationarity of a quadratic test function, and a novel leave-one-out coupling technique.
  Finally, we also extend our method to $GI/GI/n$ queues with fully heterogeneous service-time distributions.</description>

      <title>General mean-field BSDEs with integrable terminal values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates $L^{1}$ solutions for mean-field backward stochastic differential equations (MFBSDEs) under different weak assumptions in both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional settings, whose generator $f(\omega,t,y,z,\mu)$ depends not only on the solution process $(Y,Z)$ but also on the law of $(Y,Z)$. In the one-dimensional case where $f$ depends on the law of $Y$, we show with the help of a test function method and a localization procedure that such type of equations with an integrable terminal condition admits an $L^{1}$ solution, when the generator $f(\omega,t,y,z,\mu)$ has a one-sided linear growth in $(y,\mu)$, and an iterated-logarithmically sub-linear growth in $z$. Furthermore, by leveraging the additional extended monotonicity in $y$ and an iterated-logarithmically uniform continuity in $z$ of the generator $f(\omega,t,y,z,\mu)$ together with a strengthened nondecreasing condition in $\mu$, we derive a comparison theorem for $L^{1}$ solutions, which immediately leads to the uniqueness of the $L^{1}$ solutions. Next, we establish the existence and the uniqueness of $L^{1}$ solutions for multi-dimensional mean-field BSDEs with integrable parameters in which the generator $f(\omega,t,y,z,\mu)$ depends on $\mu=\mathbb{P}_{Y}$ and satisfies a one-sided Osgood condition as well as a general growth condition in $y$, a Lipschitz continuity as well as a sublinear growth condition in $z$, and a Lipschitz condition in $\mu$. Finally, the solvability of $L^{1}$ solutions for general MFBSDEs is studied, where the generator $f(\omega,t,y,z,\mu)$ depends on both the solution process $(Y,Z)$ and its joint law $\mathbb{P}_{(Y,Z)}$.</description>

      <title>Infinite-time ruin probability of a multivariate renewal risk model with Brownian perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the multivariate risk model with common renewal process among the lines of business, and Brownian perturbations. Assuming that the integrated tail distribution of claims is multivariate subexponential, we establish an asymptotic relation for the infinite-time ruin probability. A more explicit expression is given in case of claim distribution from multivariate regular variation. The results indicate the insensitivity of the asymptotic behavior of the ruin probability with respect to Brownian perturbations. Furthermore, we show that a multivariate distribution with finite expectation, that belongs to the class of multivariate dominatedly varying and long-tailed distributions, possesses integrated tail distribution from the class of multivariate subexponential distributions, which makes easier the checking of conditions in the theorem.</description>

Abstract: We prove a sharpness result for the dynamics of finite-range Interacting Particle Systems (IPS) on $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb Z^d}$. Starting from an IPS that is monotone, ergodic, and which admits the all-zero configuration as an absorbing state, we prove that there exists an arbitrarily small perturbation of the dynamics which leads to an \emph{exponentially} ergodic IPS. This extends the sharpness result previously established for (discrete-time) probabilistic cellular automata in \cite{Har} to the continuous-time setting of IPS.</description>

      <title>Observer-Based Source Localization in Tree Infection Networks via Laplace Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of localizing the source of infection in an undirected, tree-structured network under a susceptible-infected outbreak model. The infection propagates with independent random time increments (i.e., edge-delays) between neighboring nodes, while only the infection times of a subset of nodes can be observed. We show that a reduced set of observers may be sufficient, in the statistical sense, to localize the source and characterize its identifiability via the joint Laplace transform of the observers' infection times. Using the explicit form of these transforms in terms of the edge-delay probability distributions, we propose scale-invariant least-squares estimators of the source. We evaluate their performance on synthetic trees and on a river network, demonstrating accurate localization under diverse edge-delay models. To conclude, we highlight overlooked technical challenges for observer-based source localization on networks with cycles, where standard spanning-tree reductions may be ill-posed.</description>

      <title>Robust Exploratory Stopping under Ambiguity in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a continuous-time robust reinforcement learning framework for optimal stopping problems under ambiguity. In this framework, an agent chooses a stopping rule motivated by two objectives: robust decision-making under ambiguity and learning about the unknown environment. Here, ambiguity refers to considering multiple probability measures dominated by a reference measure, reflecting the agent's awareness that the reference measure representing her learned belief about the environment would be erroneous. Using the $g$-expectation framework, we reformulate an optimal stopping problem under ambiguity as an entropy-regularized optimal control problem under ambiguity, with Bernoulli distributed controls to incorporate exploration into the stopping rules. We then derive the optimal Bernoulli distributed control characterized by backward stochastic differential equations. Moreover, we establish a policy iteration theorem and implement it as a reinforcement learning algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm across different levels of ambiguity and exploration.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10370v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the type A, BC, and D root systems, we determine equivalent conditions between the coefficients of an exponential holomorphic function and the asymptotic values taken by the Dunkl bilinear form when one of its entries is the function. We establish these conditions over the $|\theta N| \rightarrow\infty$ regime for the type A and D root systems and over the $|\theta_0 N|\rightarrow \infty, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system. We also generalize existing equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type A root system and over the $\theta_0 N\rightarrow c_0\in\mathbb{C}, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c_1\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system and prove new equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type D root system. Furthermore, we determine the asymptotics of the coefficients of the Bessel functions over the regimes that we have mentioned.</description>

      <title>Martingale Optimal Transport and Martingale Schr\"odinger Bridges for Calibration of Stochastic Volatility Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the calibration of stochastic volatility models (SVMs for short), we study continuous-time formulations of martingale optimal transport and martingale Schr\"odinger bridge problems. We establish duality formulas and also provide alternative proofs, via different techniques, of duality results previously established in the mathematical finance literature. Applications include calibration of SVMs to SPX options, as well as joint calibration to both SPX and VIX options.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Macdonald's Jack Hypergeometric Series ${}_pF_q(x;\alpha)$ and ${}_pF_q(x,y;\alpha)$ via Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a widely circulated manuscript from the 1980s, now available on the arXiv, I.~G.~Macdonald introduced certain multivariable hypergeometric series ${}_pF_q(x)= {}_pF_q(x;\alpha)$ and ${}_pF_q(x,y)= {}_pF_q(x,y;\alpha)$ in one and two sets of variables $x=(x_1,\dots x_n)$ and $y=(y_1,\dots y_n)$. These two series are defined by explicit expansions in terms of Jack polynomials $J^{(\alpha)}_\lambda$, and for $\alpha=2$ they specialize to the hypergeometric series of matrix arguments studied by Herz (1955) and Constantine (1963) that admit analogous expansions in terms of zonal polynomials.
  In this paper we determine explicit partial differential equations that characterize ${}_pF_q$, thereby answering a question posed by Macdonald. More precisely, for each $n,p,q$ we construct three differential operators $\mathcal A=\mathcal A^{(x,y)}$, $\mathcal B=\mathcal B^{(x)}$, $\mathcal C=C^{(x)}$, and we show that ${}_pF_q(x,y)$ and ${}_pF_q(x)$ are the unique series solutions of the equations $\mathcal A(f)=0$ and $\mathcal C(f)=0$, respectively, subject to certain symmetry and boundary conditions. We also prove that the equation $\mathcal B(f)=0$ characterizes ${}_pF_q(x)$, but only after one restricts the domain of $\mathcal B$ to the set of series satisfying an additional stability condition with respect to $n$.
  Special cases of the operators $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$ have been constructed previously in the literature, but only for a small number of pairs $(p,q)$, namely for $p \leq 3$ and $q \leq 2$ in the zonal case by Muirhead (1970), Constantine--Muirhead (1972), and Fujikoshi (1975); and for $p \leq 2$ and $q \leq 1$ in the general Jack case by Macdonald (1980s), Yan (1992), Kaneko (1993), and Baker--Forrester (1997). However the operator $\mathcal C$ seems to be new even for these special cases.</description>

      <title>Optimal Policy Characterization for a Class of Multi-Dimensional Ergodic Singular Stochastic Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ergodic singular stochastic control problems, a decision-maker can instantaneously adjust the evolution of a state variable using a control of bounded variation, with the goal of minimizing a long-term average cost functional. The cost of control is proportional to the magnitude of adjustments. This paper characterizes the optimal policy and the value in a class of multi-dimensional ergodic singular stochastic control problems. These problems involve a linearly controlled one-dimensional stochastic differential equation, whose coefficients, along with the cost functional to be optimized, depend on a multi-dimensional uncontrolled process Y. We first provide general verification theorems providing an optimal control in terms of a Skorokhod reflection at Y-dependent free boundaries, which emerge from the analysis of an auxiliary Dynkin game. We then fully solve two two-dimensional optimal inventory management problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to establish a connection between multi-dimensional ergodic singular stochastic control and optimal stopping, and to exploit this connection to achieve a complete solution in a genuinely two-dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Random Cayley Graphs of Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.02801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the random Cayley graph of a finite Abelian group $G$ with respect to $k$ generators chosen uniformly at random, with $1 \ll \log k \ll \log |G|$. Draw a vertex $U \sim \operatorname{Unif}(G)$.
  We show that the graph distance $\operatorname{dist}(\mathsf{id},U)$ from the identity to $U$ concentrates at a particular value $M$, which is the minimal radius of a ball in $\mathbb Z^k$ of cardinality at least $|G|$, under mild conditions. In other words, the distance from the identity for all but $o(|G|)$ of the elements of $G$ lies in the interval $[M - o(M), M + o(M)]$. In the regime $k \gtrsim \log |G|$, we show that the diameter of the graph is also asymptotically $M$. In the spirit of a conjecture of Aldous and Diaconis (1985), this $M$ depends only on $k$ and $|G|$, not on the algebraic structure of $G$.
  Write $d(G)$ for the minimal size of a generating subset of $G$. We prove that the order of the spectral gap is $|G|^{-2/k}$ when $k - d(G) \asymp k$ and $|G|$ lies in a density-$1$ subset of $\mathbb N$ or when $k - 2 d(G) \asymp k$. This extends, for Abelian groups, a celebrated result of Alon and Roichman (1994).
  The aforementioned results all hold with high probability over the random Cayley graph.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for Almost All Random Walks on Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.02809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the random Cayley graph of a finite group $G$ with respect to $k$ generators chosen uniformly at random, with $1 \ll \log k \ll \log |G|$; denote it $G_k$. A conjecture of Aldous and Diaconis (1985) asserts, for $k \gg \log |G|$, that the random walk on this graph exhibits cutoff. Further, the cutoff time should be a function only of $k$ and $|G|$, to sub-leading order. This was verified for all Abelian groups in the '90s. We extend the conjecture to $1 \ll k \lesssim \log |G|$. We establish cutoff for all Abelian groups under the condition $k - d(G) \gg 1$, where $d(G)$ is the minimal size of a generating subset of $G$, which is almost optimal. The cutoff time is described (abstractly) in terms of the entropy of random walk on $\mathbb Z^k$. This abstract definition allows us to deduce that the cutoff time can be written as a function only of $k$ and $|G|$ when $d(G) \ll \log |G|$ and $k - d(G) \asymp k \gg 1$; this is not the case when $d(G) \asymp \log |G| \asymp k$. For certain regimes of $k$, we find the limit profile of the convergence to equilibrium. Wilson (1997) conjectured that $\mathbb Z_2^d$ gives rise to the slowest mixing time for $G_k$ amongst all groups of size at most $2^d$. We give a partial answer, verifying the conjecture for nilpotent groups. This is obtained via a comparison result of independent interest between the mixing times of nilpotent $G$ and a corresponding Abelian group $\overline G$, namely the direct sum of the Abelian quotients in the lower central series of $G$. We use this to refine a celebrated result of Alon and Roichman (1994): we show for nilpotent $G$ that $G_k$ is an expander provided $k - d(\overline G) \gtrsim \log |G|$. As another consequence, we establish cutoff for nilpotent groups with relatively small commutators, including high-dimensional special groups, such as Heisenberg groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.04793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study independent long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ where the vertices $u$ and $v$ are connected with probability asymptotic to $\frac{\beta}{\|u-v\|^{2d}}$ for $\|u-v\|_\infty\geq 2$ and with probability 1 for $\|u-v\|_\infty=1$, where $\beta \geq 0$ is a parameter. It is proven in [5] that there exists an exponent $\theta=\theta(d,\beta) \in \left(0,1\right]$ such that the graph distance between the origin $\mathbf{0}$ and $x \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ scales like $\|x\|^{\theta}$. We prove that this exponent $\theta(d,\beta)$ is continuous and strictly decreasing as a function in $\beta$. Furthermore, we show that $\theta(d,\beta)=1-\beta+o(\beta)$ for small $\beta$ in dimension $d=1$.</description>

Abstract: We consider dynamic boundary conditions involving non-local operators. Our analysis includes a detailed description of such operators together with their relations with random times and random (additive) functionals. We provide some new characterizations for the boundary behaviour of the Brownian motion based on the interplay between non-local operators and boundary value problems. Our main focus is on Feller-Wentzell diffusions with jumps (resetting/restart). We first consider the instructive case of the real line, then we extend our results on star graphs with trapping points or repulsive vertices.</description>

Abstract: We study the eigenvector mass distribution of an $N\times N$ Wigner matrix on a set of coordinates $I$ satisfying $| I | \ge c N$ for some constant $c &gt;0$. For eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues at the spectral edge, we show that the sum of the mass on these coordinates converges to a Gaussian in the $N \rightarrow \infty$ limit, after a suitable rescaling and centering. The proof proceeds by a two moment matching argument. We directly compare edge eigenvector observables of an arbitrary Wigner matrix to those of a Gaussian matrix, which may be computed explicitly.</description>

      <title>Fluid limits for interacting queues in sparse dynamic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13054v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a network of $n$ single-server queues where tasks arrive independently at each server at rate $\lambda_n$. The servers are connected by a graph that is resampled at rate $\mu_n$ in a way that is symmetric with respect to the servers, and each task is dispatched to the shortest queue in the graph neighborhood where it appears. We aim to gain insight in the impact of the dynamic network structure on the load balancing dynamics in terms of the occupancy process which describes the empirical distribution of the number of tasks across the servers. This process evolves on the underlying dynamic graph, and its dynamics depend on the number of tasks at each individual server and the neighborhood structure of the graph. We establish that this dependency disappears in the limit as $n \to \infty$ when $\lambda_n / n \to \lambda$ and $\mu_n \to \infty$, and prove that the limit of the occupancy process is given by a system of differential equations that depends solely on $\lambda$ and the limiting degree distribution of the graph. We further show that the stationary distribution of the occupancy process converges to an equilibrium of the differential equations, and derive properties of this equilibrium that reflect the impact of the degree distribution. Our focus is on truly sparse graphs where the maximum degree is uniformly bounded across $n$, which is natural in load balancing systems.</description>

      <title>Occupied Processes: Going with the Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07936v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stochastic process $X$ becomes \textit{occupied} when it is enlarged with its occupation flow $\mathcal{O}$, which tracks the time spent by the path at each level. Crucially, the occupied process $(\mathcal{O},X)$ enjoys a Markov structure when $X$ is Markov. We develop a novel It\^o calculus for occupied processes that lies midway between Dupire's functional It\^o calculus and the classical version. We derive a surprisingly simple It\^o formula and, through Feynman-Kac, unveil a broad class of path-dependent PDEs where $\mathcal{O}$ plays the role of time. The space variable, given by the current value of $X$, remains finite-dimensional, thereby paving the way for standard elliptic PDE techniques and numerical methods. In the financial applications, we demonstrate that occupation flows provide unified Markovian lifts for exotic options and variance instruments, allowing financial institutions to price and manage derivatives books with a single numerical solver. We then explore avenues in financial modeling where volatility is driven by the occupied process. In particular, we propose the local occupied volatility (LOV) model which not only calibrates to European vanilla options but also offers the flexibility to capture stylized facts of volatility or fit other instruments. We also present an extension of forward variance models that leverages the entire forward occupation surface.</description>

      <title>Sharp local propagation of chaos for mean field particles with $W^{-1,\infty}$ kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two methods to obtain $O(1/N^2)$ local propagation of chaos bounds for $N$ diffusive particles in $W^{-1,\infty}$ mean field interaction. This extends the recent finding of Lacker [Probab. Math. Phys., 4(2):377-432, 2023] to the case of singular interactions. The first method is based on a hierarchy of relative entropies and Fisher informations, and applies to the 2D viscous vortex model in the high temperature regime. Time-uniform local chaos bounds are also shown in this case. In the second method, we work on a hierarchy of $L^2$ distances and Dirichlet energies, and derive the desired sharp estimates for the same model in short time without restrictions on the temperature.</description>

Abstract: In this article we use a covariance function that arises from limit of fluctuations of the rescaled occupation time process of a branching particle system, to introduce a family of weighted long-range dependence Gaussian processes. In particular, we consider two subfamilies for which we show that the process is not a semimartingale, that the processes exhibit long-range dependence and have long-range memory of logarithmic order. Finally, we illustrate that this family of processes is useful for modeling real world data.</description>

Abstract: Given a reaction-advection-diffusion system modelling the sulphation phenomenon, we derive a single regularised non-conservative and path-dependent nonlinear partial differential equation and propose a probabilistic interpretation via a non-Markovian McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation coupled with a Feynman-Kac-type equation. We discuss the well-posedness of such a stochastic model, and establish the propagation of chaos property for the associated interacting particle system.</description>

      <title>Average-case matrix discrepancy: satisfiability bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a sequence of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$, and a margin $\Delta &gt; 0$, we investigate whether it is possible to find signs $(\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n) \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ such that the operator norm of the signed sum satisfies $\|\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \mathbf{W}_i\|_{\rm op} \leq \Delta$. Kunisky and Zhang (2023) recently introduced a random version of this problem, where the matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. This model can be seen as a random variant of the celebrated Matrix Spencer conjecture and as a matrix-valued analog of the symmetric binary perceptron in statistical physics. In this work, we establish a satisfiability transition in this problem as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \tau &gt; 0$. First, we prove that the expected number of solutions with margin $\Delta=\kappa \sqrt{n}$ has a sharp threshold at a critical $\tau_1(\kappa)$: for $\tau &lt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the problem is typically unsatisfiable, while for $\tau &gt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the average number of solutions is exponentially large. Second, combining a second-moment method with recent results from Altschuler (2023) on margin concentration in perceptron-type problems, we identify a second threshold $\tau_2(\kappa)$, such that for $\tau&gt;\tau_2(\kappa)$ the problem admits solutions with high probability. In particular, we establish that a system of $n = \Theta(d^2)$ Gaussian random matrices can be balanced so that the spectrum of the resulting matrix macroscopically shrinks compared to the semicircle law. Finally, under a technical assumption, we show that there exists values of $(\tau,\kappa)$ for which the number of solutions has large variance, implying the failure of the second moment method. Our proofs rely on establishing concentration and large deviation properties of correlated Gaussian matrices under spectral norm constraints.</description>

      <title>Multi-type branching processes with immigration generated by point processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the pivotal work of Sevastyanov, who considered branching processes with homogeneous Poisson immigration, much has been done to understand the behaviour of such processes under different types of branching and immigration mechanisms. Recently, the case where the times of immigration are generated by a non-homogeneous Poisson process was considered in depth. In this work, we try to demonstrate how one can use the framework of point processes in order to go beyond the Poisson process. As an illustration, we show how to transfer techniques from the case of Poisson immigration to the case where it is spanned by a determinantal point process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locally Markov walks are natural generalizations of classical Markov chains, where instead of a particle moving independently of the past, it decides where to move next depending on the last action performed at the current location. We introduce the concept of locally Markov walks and we describe their stationary distribution and recurrent states, and we prove several properties such as irreducibility and ergodicity. For a particular locally Markov walk - the uniform unicycle walk on the complete graph - we investigate the mixing time and we prove that it exhibits cutoff.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the random connection model on hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^d$ in dimension $d=2,3$. Vertices of the spatial random graph are given as a Poisson point process with intensity $\lambda&gt;0$. Upon variation of $\lambda$ there is a percolation phase transition: there exists a critical value $\lambda_c&gt;0$ such that for $\lambda&lt;\lambda_c$ all clusters are finite, but infinite clusters exist for $\lambda&gt;\lambda_c$. We identify certain critical exponents that characterize the clusters at (and near) $\lambda_c$, and show that they agree with the mean-field values for percolation. We derive the exponents through isoperimetric properties of critical percolation clusters rather than via a calculation of the triangle diagram.</description>

      <title>Optimal Structure of Signal Networks for Efficient Information Aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical framework to study signal networks, in which nodes can be active or inactive, and their activation or deactivation is driven by external signals and the states of the nodes to which they are connected via links. The focus is on determining the optimal number of key nodes (= highly connected and structurally important nodes) required to represent the global activation state of the network accurately. Motivated by neuroscience, medical science, and social science examples, we describe the node dynamics as a continuous-time inhomogeneous Markov process. Under mean-field and homogeneity assumptions, appropriate for large scale-free and disassortative signal networks, we derive differential equations characterising the global activation behaviour and compute the expected hitting time to network triggering. Analytical and numerical results show that two or three key nodes are typically sufficient to approximate the overall network state well, balancing sensitivity and robustness. Our findings provide insight into how natural systems can efficiently aggregate information by exploiting minimal structural components.</description>

      <title>Schramm-Loewner evolution contains a topological Sierpi\'nski carpet when $\kappa$ is close to 8</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE$_\kappa$) for $\kappa \in (4,8)$, which is the regime where the curve is self-intersecting but not space-filling. We show that there exists $\delta_0&gt;0$ such that for $\kappa \in (8 - \delta_0,8)$, the range of an SLE$_\kappa$ curve almost surely contains a topological Sierpi\'nski carpet. Combined with a result of Ntalampekos (2021), this implies that in this parameter range, SLE$_\kappa$ is almost surely conformally non-removable, and the conformal welding problem for SLE$_\kappa$ does not have a unique solution. Our result also implies that for $\kappa \in (8 - \delta_0,8)$, the adjacency graph of the complementary connected components of the SLE$_\kappa$ curve is disconnected.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for the Swendsen-Wang dynamics on the complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the speed of convergence of the Swendsen-Wang (SW) dynamics for the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model on the $n$-vertex complete graph, known as the mean-field model. The SW dynamics was introduced as an attractive alternative to the local Glauber dynamics, often offering faster convergence rates to stationarity in a variety of settings. A series of works have characterized the asymptotic behavior of the speed of convergence of the mean-field SW dynamics for all $q \ge 2$ and all values of the inverse temperature parameter $\beta &gt; 0$. In particular, it is known that when $\beta &gt; q$ the mixing time of the SW dynamics is $\Theta(\log n)$. We strengthen this result by showing that for all $\beta &gt; q$, there exists a constant $c(\beta,q) &gt; 0$ such that the mixing time of the SW dynamics is $c(\beta,q) \log n + \Theta(1)$. This implies that the mean-field SW dynamics exhibits the cutoff phenomenon in this temperature regime, demonstrating that this Markov chain undergoes a sharp transition from ''far from stationarity'' to ''well-mixed'' within a narrow $\Theta(1)$ time window. The presence of cutoff is algorithmically significant, as simulating the chain for fewer steps than its mixing time could lead to highly biased samples.</description>

      <title>Coagulation-Fragmentation Duality of Infinitely Exchangeable Partitions from Coupled Mixed Poisson Species Sampling Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jim Pitman's~(1999) celebrated coagulation-fragmentation duality for the PD($\alpha$,$\theta$) family of laws of Pitman and Marc Yor~(1997) has resisted generalization beyond its canonical setting. We resolve this by introducing a novel, four-part coupled process built upon the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), a framework developed for modeling microbiome species sampling. This approach yields a tractable generalization of the duality in two fundamental directions: to processes driven by arbitrary subordinators and to the previously uncharacterised multi-group ($J \ge 1$) setting, providing explicit laws for both.
  The static, fixed-time partitions are revealed to be a single projection of an inherently dynamic system. This new construction simultaneously defines: (i) the fine-grained partition, (ii) its coagulation operator, (iii) a forward-in-time system of coupled, time-homogeneous fragmentation processes in the sense of Jean Bertoin~(2006), and (iv) a dual, backward-in-time structured coalescent that drives simultaneous, across-group merger events. All four components are governed by a unified compositional structure, yielding their exact compound Poisson representations. The hallmark of this work is its circumvention of direct, and often intractable, analysis on mass and integer partition spaces. By shifting the problem to this transparent framework, the generalized duality emerges as a natural consequence of the architecture itself.</description>

      <title>Persistence probabilities for fractionally integrated fractional Brownian noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10265v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main objective of this study is fractionally integrated fractional Brownian noise, I(t/a,H) where a&gt;0 is the 'multiplicity' of integration, and H is the Hurst parameter . The subject of the analysis is the persistence exponent e(a,H) that determines the power-law asymptotic of probability that the process will not exceed a fixit level in a growing time interval (0,T). In the important cases (a=1,H) and (a=2,H=1/2) these exponents are well known. To understand the problematic exponents e(2,H), we consider the (a,H) parameters from the maximum (for the task) area G= (a+H&gt;1,0&lt;H&lt;1) ). We prove the decrease of the exponents with increasing 'a' and describe their behavior near the boundary of G, including infinity. The discovered identity of the exponents with the parameters (a,H) and (a+2H-1,1-H) actually refutes the long-standing hypothesis that e(2,H)=H(1-H). Our results are based on well known the continuity lemma for the persistence exponents and on a generalization of Slepian's lemma for a family of Gaussian processes smoothly dependent on a parameter.</description>

      <title>Cutoff Phenomenon for Inhomogeneous Nonlinear Recombination in Arbitrary Finite Product Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the cutoff phenomenon for a general class of the discrete-time nonlinear recombination models. This system models the evolution of a probability measure on a finite product space $S^n$ representing the state of spins on $n$ sites. Although its stationary distribution has a product structure, and its evolution is Markovian, the dynamics of the model is nonlinear. Consequently, the estimation of the mixing time becomes a highly non-trivial task. The special case with two spins and homogeneous stationary measure was considered in Caputo, Labb\'e, and Lacoin [The Annals of Applied Probability 35:1164-1197, 2025], where the cutoff phenomenon for the mixing behavior has been verified. In this article, we extend this result to the general case with finite spins and inhomogeneous stationary measure by developing a novel algebraic representation for the density fluctuation of the system with respect to its stationary state.</description>

      <title>Pathwise Patching: A Geometric Construction of Quasi-Sure Solutions to G-SDEs and the Fundamental Role of the Path Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a rigorous geometric framework for constructing quasi-sure solutions to stochastic differential equations under model uncertainty. Departing from classical measure-specific approaches, we develop a pathwise patching methodology that explicitly builds a universal solution directly on the path space. We prove that whenever an SDE admits a unique strong solution under each probability measure in a family $\mathscr{P}$, our method yields a universally adapted process that serves as the unique quasi-sure solution to the corresponding G-SDE. The construction leverages the pathwise uniqueness property of solutions, which guarantees that the definitions on the "good sets" of different measures can be consistently patched together into a single canonical object. Our work establishes the theoretical foundation for a path-centric perspective in stochastic analysis, demonstrating that probability measures serve as filters that select plausible paths rather than define the solution itself. This approach provides enhanced conceptual clarity and mathematical rigor, offering a unified framework for interpreting advanced theories such as G-expectation and paving the way for robust computational methods in quantitative finance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove central limit theorems, Berry-Esseen type theorems, almost sure invariance principles, large deviations and Livsic type regularity for partial sums of the form $S_n=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}f_j(...,X_{j-1},X_j,X_{j+1},...)$, where $(X_j)$ is an inhomogeneous Markov chain satisfying some mixing assumptions and $f_j$ is a sequence of sufficiently regular functions. Even though the case of non-stationary chains and time dependent functions $f_j$ is more challenging, our results seem to be new already for stationary Markov chains. They also seem to be new for non-stationary Bernoulli shifts (that is when $(X_j)$ are independent but not identically distributed). This paper is the first one in a series of two papers. In \cite{Work} we will prove local limit theorems including developing the related reduction theory in the sense of \cite{DolgHaf LLT, DS}.</description>

      <title>On the Hausdorff measure of sets of non-Lyapunov behaviour, and a Jarnik-type theorem for random Schroedinger operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.14662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the growth of the norms of transfer matrices of ergodic discrete Schr\"odinger operators in one dimension. It is known that the set of energies at which the rate of exponential growth is slower than prescribed by the Lyapunov exponent is residual in the part of the spectrum at which the Lyapunov exponent is positive. On the other hand, this exceptional set is of vanishing Hausdorff measure with respect to any gauge function $\rho(t)$ such that $\rho(t)/t$ is integrable at zero. Here we show that this condition on $\rho(t)$ can not in general be improved: for operators with independent, identically distributed potentials of sufficiently regular distribution, the set of energies at which the rate of exponential growth is arbitrarily slow has infinite Hausdorff measure with respect to any gauge function $\rho(t)$ such that $\rho(t)/t$ is non-increasing and not integrable at zero. The main technical ingredient, possibly of independent interest, is a Jarn\'ik-type theorem describing the Hausdorff measure of the set of real numbers well approximated by the eigenvalues of the Schr\"odinger operator. The proof of this result relies on the theory of Anderson localisation and on the mass transference principle of Beresnevich--Velani.</description>

We additionally prove a new approximation result, showing that the total variation distance between random P\'olya trees and random unlabelled trees tends to zero when the number of vertices tends to infinity. In order to demonstrate that our approach is not restricted to trees we extend our results to tree-like classes of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lie--Trotter product formula is a foundational approximation for the quantum partition function, yet obtaining rigorous error bounds for the unbounded Hamiltonians common in physics remains a significant challenge. This paper provides a quantitative error analysis for this approximation across two key systems. For a particle in a smooth, periodic potential, we establish an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal O(1/N^2)$ for both the partition function and thermal averages, where $N$ is the number of imaginary time steps. We then extend this analysis to the more challenging case of a confining potential on $\mathbb R$, proving a nearly optimal rate of $\mathcal O((\log N+1)^{\frac32}/N^2)$. The derived error bounds provide a firm mathematical foundation for the high-order accuracy of path integral simulations in quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>New global Carleman estimates and null controllability for forward/backward semi-linear parabolic SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13455v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the null controllability for parabolic SPDEs involving both the state and the gradient of the state. To start with, an improved global Carleman estimate for linear forward (resp. backward) parabolic SPDEs with general random coefficients and square-integrable source terms is derived. Based on this, we further develop a new global Carleman estimate for linear forward (resp. backward) parabolic SPDEs with source terms in the Sobolev space of negative order, which enables us to deal with the global null controllability for linear backward (resp. forward) parabolic SPDEs with gradient terms. As a byproduct, a special weighted energy-type estimate for the controlled system that explicitly depends on the parameters $\lambda,\mu$ and the weighted function $\theta$ is obtained, which makes it possible to extend the previous linear null controllability to semi-linear backward (resp. forward) parabolic SPDEs by applying the fixed-point argument in an appropriate Banach space.</description>

      <title>Almost sure convergence rates of adaptive increasingly rare Markov chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider adaptive increasingly rare Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, which are adaptive MCMC methods, where the adaptation concerning the "past'' happens less and less frequently over time. Under a contraction assumption with respect to a Wasserstein-like function we deduce upper bounds of the convergence rate of Monte Carlo sums taking a renormalisation factor into account that is "almost'' the one that appears in a law of the iterated logarithm. We demonstrate the applicability of our results by considering different settings, among which are those of simultaneous geometric and uniform ergodicity. All proofs are carried out on an augmented state space, including the classical non-augmented setting as a special case. In contrast to other adaptive MCMC limit theory, some technical assumptions, like diminishing adaptation, are not needed.</description>

      <title>Contracting isometries and differentiability of the escape rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable group whose action on a metric space $X$ involves a contracting isometry. This setting naturally encompasses groups acting on Gromov hyperbolic spaces, Teichm{\"u}ller space, Culler-Vogtmann Outer space and CAT(0) spaces. We discuss continuity and differentiability of the escape rate of random walks on $G$. For relatively hyperbolic groups, CAT(-1) groups and CAT(0) cubical groups, we further discuss analyticity of the escape rate. Finally, assuming that the action of $G$ on $X$ is weakly properly discontinuous (WPD), we discuss continuity of the asymptotic entropy of random walks on $G$.</description>

      <title>Nonconcave Robust Utility Maximization under Projective Determinacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a general robust utility maximization problem in a discrete-time frictionless market. The investor is assumed to have a possibly infinite, random, nonconcave, and nondecreasing utility function defined on the whole real line. She also faces model ambiguity on her beliefs about the market, which is modelled through a set of priors. We assume that the utility and the prices are projective functions of the path, while the graphs of the local priors are projective sets. Our other assumptions are stated on a prior-by-prior basis and correspond to generally accepted assumptions in the literature on markets without ambiguity. Under the set-theoretic axiom of Projective Determinacy (PD), our main result is the existence of an optimal investment strategy when the utility function is also upper-semicontinuous.
  We further provide several counterexamples justifying our assumptions.</description>

      <title>Measure estimation on a manifold explored by a diffusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the observation of a diffusion path $(X_t)_{t\in [0,T]}$ on a compact connected $d$-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M}$ without boundary, we consider the problem of estimating the stationary measure $\mu$ of the process. Wang and Zhu (2023) showed that for the Wasserstein metric $\mathcal{W}_2$ and for $d\geq 5$, the convergence rate of $T^{-1/(d-2)}$ is attained by the occupation measure of the path $(X_t)_{t\in [0,T]}$ when $(X_t)_{t\in [0,T]}$ is a Langevin diffusion. We extend their result in several directions. First, we show that the rate of convergence holds for a large class of diffusion paths, whose generators are uniformly elliptic. Second, the regularity of the density $p$ of the stationary measure $\mu$ with respect to the volume measure of $\mathcal{M}$ can be leveraged to obtain faster estimators: when $p$ belongs to a Sobolev space of order $\ell\geq 2$, smoothing the occupation measure by convolution with a kernel yields an estimator whose rate of convergence is of order $T^{-(\ell+1)/(2\ell+d-2)}$. We further show that this rate is the minimax rate of estimation for this problem.</description>

Abstract: We consider the strong numerical approximation for a fourth-order stochastic nonlinear SPDE driven by space-time white noise on $2$-dimensional torus. We consider its full discretisation with a spectral Galerkin scheme in space and Euler scheme in time. We show the convergence with almost spatial rate $1$ and $1$-temporal rate obtained mainly via \it{stochastic sewing} technique.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of the largest eigenvalue for deformed GOE/GUE random matrices via replica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the probability distribution function $P(\lambda)$ of the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\rm max}$ of $N \times N$ random matrices of the form $H + V$, where $H$ belongs to the GOE/GUE ensemble and $V$ is a full rank deterministic diagonal perturbation. This model is related to spherical spin glasses and semi-discrete directed polymers. In the large $N$ limit, using the replica method introduced in Ref. \cite{TrivializationUs2014}, we obtain the rate function ${\cal L}(\lambda)$ which describes the upper large deviation tail $P(\lambda) \sim e^{- \beta N {\cal L}(\lambda) }$. We also obtain the moment generating function $\langle e^{N s {\lambda}_{\max} } \rangle \sim e^{N \phi(s)}$ and the overlap of the optimal eigenvector with the perturbation $V$. For suitable $V$, a transition generically occurs in the rate functions. For the GUE it has a direct interpretation as a localisation transition for tilted directed polymers with competing columnar and point disorder. Although in a different form, our results are consistent with those obtained recently by Mc Kenna in \cite{McKenna2021}. Finally, we consider briefly the quadratic optimisation problem in presence of an additional random field and obtain its large deviation rate function, although only within the replica symmetric phase.</description>

      <title>Functional inequalities on the biased and restricted cube: an induction approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop new discrete functional inequalities on the hypercube via the induction-by-restrictions method. This method reduces high-dimensional inequalities to explicit low-dimensional analytic verifications and has recently proved effective for many discrete functional inequalities. We establish two results along this framework. First, we prove a sharp $p$-biased edge-isoperimetric inequality for real-valued increasing functions, which recovers the classic biased edge-isoperimetric inequality for increasing sets and identifies increasing subcubes as the extremizers. This result also admits a probabilistic interpretation in terms of maximizing the mean first exit time of biased random walks. Second, we give an inductive proof of a Poincar\'e inequality on increasing subsets of the cube that was recently established by Fei and Ferreira Pinto Jr, yielding an $O(n^2)$ upper bound on the mixing time of censored random walks, improving upon previous bounds.</description>

      <title>Mean-field approximation, Gibbs relaxation, and cross estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the propagation of chaos and relaxation to Gibbs equilibrium for a system of $N$ classical Brownian particles with weak mean-field interactions. It is well known that propagation of chaos holds uniformly in time with rate $O(N^{-1})$ and that Gibbs relaxation holds uniformly in $N$ with exponential rate $O(e^{-ct})$. We go one step further by establishing a cross estimate that simultaneously captures both effects: the joint deviation between chaos propagation and Gibbs relaxation is of order $O(N^{-1}e^{-ct})$. In particular, for translation-invariant systems, this yields an accelerated propagation of chaos, with the mean-field approximation error at the level of the one-particle density improving from $O(N^{-1})$ to $O(N^{-1}e^{-ct})$. Our approach relies on a detailed analysis of the BBGKY hierarchy for correlation functions, and applies to both underdamped and overdamped Langevin dynamics with merely bounded interaction forces. In addition, we obtain new quantitative results on Gibbs relaxation and provide partial extensions beyond the weak interaction regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallel Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols are suggested to improve the safety guarantees, transaction throughput and confirmation latencies of Nakamoto consensus. In this work, we first consider the existing parallel PoW protocols and develop hard-coded incentive attack structures. Our theoretical results and simulations show that the existing parallel PoW protocols are more vulnerable to incentive attacks than the Nakamoto consensus, e.g., attacks have smaller profitability threshold and they result in higher relative rewards. Next, we introduce a voting-based semi-parallel PoW protocol that outperforms both Nakamoto consensus and the existing parallel PoW protocols from most practical perspectives such as communication overheads, throughput, transaction conflicts, incentive compatibility of the protocol as well as a fair distribution of transaction fees among the voters and the leaders. We use state-of-the-art analysis to evaluate the consistency of the protocol and consider Markov decision process (MDP) models to substantiate our claims about the resilience of our protocol against incentive attacks.</description>

Abstract: A random rooted graph is said to be sofic if it is the Benjamini-Schramm limit of a sequence of finite graphs. Given any finite graph $H$, we prove that every one-ended, unimodular random rooted graph that does not have H as a minor must be sofic. The hypothesis regarding the number of ends can be dropped under the additional assumption that the graph is quasi-transitive.</description>

Abstract: The scientific process is a means to turn the results of experiments into knowledge about the world in which we live. Much research effort has been directed toward automating this process. To do this, one needs to formulate the scientific process in a precise mathematical language. This paper outlines one such language. What is presented here is hardly new. The material is based on great thinkers from times past well as more modern contributions. The novel contributions of this paper are: A new general data processing inequality, a bias variance decomposition for canonical losses, streamlined proofs of the Blackwell-Sherman-Stein and Randomization theorems. means of calculating deficiency through linear programming.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a coordinate-invariant geometric formulation of the GENERIC stochastic differential equation, unifying reversible Hamiltonian and irreversible dissipative dynamics within a differential-geometric framework. Our construction builds on the classical GENERIC or metriplectic formalism, extending it to manifolds by introducing a degenerate Poisson structure, a degenerate co-metric, and a volume form satisfying a unimodularity condition. The resulting equation preserves a particular Boltzmann-type measure, ensures almost-sure conservation of energy, and reduces to the deterministic GENERIC/metriplectic formulation in the zero-noise limit. This geometrization separates system-specific quantities from the ambient space, clarifies the roles of the underlying structures, and provides a foundation for analytic and numerical methods, as well as future extensions to quantum and coarse-grained systems.</description>

      <title>Martingale Projections and Quantum Decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce so-called super/sub-martingale projections as a family of endomorphisms defined on unions of Polish spaces. Such projections allow us to identify martingales as collections of transformations that relate path-valued random variables to each other under conditional expectations. In this sense, super/sub-martingale projections are random functionals that (i) are boundedness preserving and (ii) satisfy a conditional expectation criterion similar to that of the classical martingale theory. As an application to the theory of open quantum systems, we prove (a) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a supermartingale projection on the density matrix gives rise to decoherence, and (b) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a submartingale projection gives rise an increase in Shannon-Wiener information. It follows (c) that martingale projections in an open quantum system give rise both to quantum decoherence and to information gain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a primal-dual dynamical formulation of the multi-marginal optimal transport problem for (semi-)convex cost functions. Even in the two-marginal setting, this formulation applies to cost functions not covered by the classical dynamical approach of Benamou-Brenier. Our dynamical formulation yields a convex optimization problem, enabling the use of convex optimization tools to find quasi-Monge solutions of the static multi-marginal problem for translation-invariant costs. We illustrate our results numerically with proximal splitting methods.</description>

Abstract: We study the martingale optimal transport problem with state-dependent trading frictions and develop a geometric and duality framework extending from the one time-step to the multi-marginal setting. Building on the left-monotone structure of frictionless MOT (Beiglb\"ock and Juillet, Ann. Probab., 2016; Henry-Labord\`ere and Touzi, Finance Stoch., 2016; Beiglb\"ock et al., Ann. Probab., 2017), we introduce a convex frictional cost combining proportional bid-ask spreads and quadratic liquidity impacts. The framework extends the martingale Spence-Mirrlees condition to nonlinear frictions and establishes a frictional monotonicity principle.
  At each time step, the joint distribution between consecutive asset prices exhibits a bi-atomic, monotone geometry: conditional on the current price, the next price lies on one of two monotone branches representing upward and downward rebalancing. A no-transaction region, or trade band, arises where maintaining the position is optimal, while outside the band, transitions follow two monotone graphs whose endpoints satisfy an equal-slope condition balancing continuation value and marginal trading cost.
  The framework extends dynamically via a recursive identity, ensuring stability and convergence to the frictionless left-curtain limit, and applies to model-independent pricing and robust hedging of path-dependent derivatives.</description>

      <title>Existence of martingale solutions for a stochastic weighted mean curvature flow of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with a stochastic mean curvature flow of graphs with extra force over a periodic domain of any dimension. Based on compact embedding method of variational SPDE, we prove the existence of martingale solution. Moreover, we derive the small perturbation limit of the stochastic weighted mean curvature flow.</description>
