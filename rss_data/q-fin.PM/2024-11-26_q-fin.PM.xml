      <title>Research on Optimal Portfolio Based on Multifractal Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing optimal portfolio selection for investors has always been one of the hot topics in academia. In view of the traditional portfolio model could not adapt to the actual capital market and can provide erroneous results. This paper innovatively constructs a mean-detrended cross-correlation portfolio model (M-DCCP model), This model is designed to embed detrended cross-correlation between different simultaneously recorded time series in the presence of nonstationary into the reward-risk criterion. We illustrate the model's effectiveness by selected five composite indexes (SSE 50, CSI 300, SSE 500, CSI 1000 and CSI 2000) in China A-share market. The empirical results show that compared with traditional mean-variance portfolio model (M-VP model), the M-DCCP model is more conducive for investors to construct optimal portfolios under the different fluctuation exponent preference and time scales preference, so as to improve portfolio's performance.</description>

      <title>Predictive Power of LLMs in Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the movement of the stock market and other assets has been valuable over the past few decades. Knowing how the value of a certain sector market may move in the future provides much information for investors, as they use that information to develop strategies to maximize profit or minimize risk. However, market data are quite noisy, and it is challenging to choose the right data or the right model to create such predictions. With the rise of large language models, there are ways to analyze certain data much more efficiently than before.
  Our goal is to determine whether the GPT model provides more useful information compared to other traditional transformer models, such as the BERT model. We shall use data from the Federal Reserve Beige Book, which provides summaries of economic conditions in different districts in the US. Using such data, we then employ the LLM's to make predictions on the correlations. Using these correlations, we then compare the results with well-known strategies and determine whether knowing the economic conditions improves investment decisions. We conclude that the Beige Book does contain information regarding correlations amongst different assets, yet the GPT model has too much look-ahead bias and that traditional models still triumph.</description>
