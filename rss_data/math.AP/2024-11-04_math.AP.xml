      <title>Inviscid fluid interacting with a nonlinear two-dimensional plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a moving boundary problem that consists of a system of equations modeling an inviscid fluid interacting with a two-dimensional nonlinear Koiter plate at the boundary. We derive a priori estimates needed to prove the local-in-time existence of solutions. We use the Arbitrary Lagrange Euler (ALE) coordinates to fix the domain and obtain careful estimates for the nonlinear Koiter plate, ALE velocity, and pressure {without any viscoelastic smoothing}. For the nonlinear Koiter plate, higher order energy estimates are obtained, whereas estimates for the ALE pressure are obtained by setting up an elliptic problem. For the ALE velocity, the bounds are obtained through div-curl estimates by estimating the ALE vorticity. We then extend our results in two directions: (1) to include fractional Sobolev spaces and (2) to incorporate the normalized second fundamental form.</description>

      <title>Ill-posedness of $2\frac12$D electron MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the electron magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in the context where the 3D magnetic field depends only on the two horizontal plane variables. Initial data is constructed in the Sobolev space $H^\beta$ with $3&lt;\beta&lt;4$ such that the solution to this electron MHD system either escapes the space or develops norm inflation in $\dot H^\beta$ at an arbitrarily short time.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Diffusion in Anisotropic and Non-uniform Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhanced diffusion, which describes the accelerated spread of passive scalars due to the interaction between advection and molecular diffusion, has been extensively studied in simplified geometries, such as uniform shear and radial flows. However, many real-world applications occur in complex, anisotropic domains where standard assumptions do not hold. This paper extends the theory of enhanced diffusion to anisotropic and non-uniform geometries, where scaling in the \(x\)- and \(y\)-directions follows distinct, power-law relationships, and the velocity field exhibits spatially varying regularity. We define a generalized framework for anisotropic diffusion enhancement and rigorously derive new scaling laws for diffusion rates in these settings. Specifically, we show that in a domain with anisotropic scaling functions \( f(x) \sim |x|^p \) and \( g(y) \sim |y|^q \), the enhanced diffusion rate \( r(\kappa) \) for a passive scalar satisfies \( r(\kappa) = C \kappa^{\frac{pq}{p+q+2}} \), where \( C \) depends on the regularity and scaling properties of the domain but remains independent of the diffusivity \( \kappa \). This theoretical result is validated through detailed proofs leveraging stochastic process techniques and variance estimation. Our findings offer a new perspective on the role of domain geometry and anisotropy in diffusion processes, with potential applications in environmental science, engineering, and beyond. This framework lays the groundwork for future studies in both theoretical and applied settings, enabling a deeper understanding of transport phenomena in complex domains.</description>

      <title>On sharp constants in higher order Adams-Cianchi inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main results of this paper are the establishment of sharp constants for several families of critical Sobolev embeddings. These inequalities were pioneered by David R. Adams, while the sharp constant in the first order case is due to Andrea Cianchi. We also prove a trace improvement of an inequality obtained independently by K. Hansson and H. Brezis and S. Wainger.</description>

      <title>A miscellanea of qualitative and symmetry properties of the solutions to the two-phase Serrin's problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the solutions to the two-phase Serrin's problem, an overdetermined boundary value problem motivated by shape optimization. Specifically, we study the torsional rigidity of composite beams, where two distinct materials interact, and examine the properties of the optimal configurations (critical shapes) under volume constraints. We first show that such a shape optimization problem admits no local minimizers. Then, using the method of moving planes, we show that the solutions exhibit no extended or narrow branches ("tentacles") away from the core. We then show that the outer boundary of a solution cannot exhibit flat parts and that the only configuration whose outer boundary contains a portion of a sphere is the one given by concentric balls. Finally, we establish that concentric balls are the only admissible configurations that solve the two-phase Serrin's problem for two distinct sets of conductivity values.</description>

Abstract: We provide an observability inequality in terms of a measurable set for general Gevrey regular functions. As an application, we establish an observability estimate from a measurable set for sums of Laplace eigenfunctions in a compact and connected boundaryless Riemannian manifold that belongs to the Gevrey class.

      <description>arXiv:2411.00449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a nonlinear system involving a generalized tempered fractional $p$-Laplacian in $B_{1}(0)$: \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \partial_tu(x,t)+(-\Delta-\lambda_{f})_{p}^{s}u(x,t)=g(t,u(x,t)), &amp;(x,t)\in B_{1}(0)\times[0,+\infty),\\ u(x)=0,&amp;(x,t)\in B_{1}^{c}(0)\times[0,+\infty), \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $0&lt;s&lt;1$, $p&gt;2,\ n\geq2$. We establish Hopf's lemma for parabolic equations involving a generalized tempered fractional $p$-Laplacian. Hopf's lemma will become powerful tools in obtaining qualitative properties of solutions for nonlocal parabolic equations..</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness for a fourth-order nonlinear dispersive system on the 1D torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the initial value problem for a system of one-dimensional fourth-order dispersive partial differential equations on the torus with nonlinearity involving derivatives up to second order. This paper gives sufficient conditions on the coefficients of the system for the initial value problem to be time-locally well-posed in Sobolev spaces with high regularity. The proof is based on the energy method combined with the idea of a gauge transformation and the technique of Bona-Smith type parabolic regularization. The sufficient conditions can been found in connection with geometric analysis on a fourth-order geometric dispersive partial differential equation for curve flows on a compact locally Hermitian symmetric space.</description>

      <title>Global solvability of a model for tuberculosis granuloma formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a nonlinear system of partial differential equations modelling the formation of granuloma during tuberculosis infections and prove the global solvability of the homogeneous Neumann problem for \begin{align*}
  \begin{cases}
  u_t = D_u \Delta u - \chi_u \nabla \cdot (u \nabla v) - \gamma_u uv - \delta_u u + \beta_u, \\
  v_t = D_v \Delta v + \rho_v v - \gamma_v uv + \mu_v w,\\
  w_t = D_w \Delta w + \gamma_w uv - \alpha_w wz - \mu_w w,\\
  z_t = D_z \Delta z - \chi_z \nabla \cdot (z \nabla w) + \alpha_z f(w)z - \delta_z z
  \end{cases} \end{align*} in bounded domains in the classical and weak sense in the two- and three-dimensional setting, respectively.
  In order to derive suitable a~priori estimates, we study the evolution of the well-known energy functional for the chemotaxis-consumption system both for the $(u, v)$- and the $(z, w)$-subsystem. A key challenge compared to "pure" consumption systems consists of overcoming the difficulties raised by the additional, in part positive, terms in the second and third equations. This is inter alia achieved by utilising a dissipative term of the (quasi-)energy functional, which may just be discarded in simpler consumption systems.</description>

      <title>Spatial profiles of a reaction-diffusion epidemic model with nonlinear incidence mechanism and varying total population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic reaction-diffusion model with no-flux boundary conditions and varying total population. The interaction of the susceptible and infected people is describe by the nonlinear transmission mechanism of the form $S^qI^p$, where $0&lt;p\le 1$ and $q&gt;0$. In [39], we have studied a model with a constant total population. In the current paper, we extend our analysis to a model with a varying total population, incorporating birth and death rates. We investigate the asymptotic profiles of the endemic equilibrium when the dispersal rates of susceptible and/or infected individuals are small. Our work is motivated by disease control strategies that limit population movement. To illustrate the main findings, we conduct numerical simulations and provide a discussion of the theoretical results from the view of disease control. We will also compare the results for the models with constant or varying total population.</description>

      <title>A few finite and infinite identities involving Pochhammer and $q$- Pochhammer symbols obtained via analytical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present several identities with a form of polynomials or rational functions that involve Pochhammer and $q$-Pochhammer symbols and $q$-binomials (i.e. Gauss polynomials). All these identities were obtained by some analytical methods based on infinite expansions of the ratio of densities in a Fourier series of polynomials orthogonal with respect to the density in the denominator. The aim of the paper is clear. We want a unified approach to justify many known and unknown identities. The purpose of studying these identities is to simplify calculations occurring while dealing with Pochhammer and $q$-Pochhammer symbols. Additional possible applications of the results presented in the paper are applications within the Combinatorics and the transformation formulae of hypergeometric and basic hypergeometric functions.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Equation for the Lorenz Curve: Dynamics of incomplete moments of probability distributions arising from Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fokker-Planck equations (forward Kolmogorov equations) evolve probability densities in time from an initial condition. For distributions over the real line, these evolution equations can sometimes be transformed into dynamics over the incomplete zeroth and first moments. We call this perspective the Lorenz dynamics of the system after the Lorenz curve description of distributions of wealth. This offers the benefit of presenting the dynamics over a compact domain. The integral transformation is motivated and then stated for a general class of Fokker-Planck equations. Following this, the transformed equation is solved for the heat equation and some variants thereof. Finally, some equations arising from the application of kinetic theory to idealized economic systems are transformed and analyzed in this new light.</description>

      <title>Formation of stationary periodic patterns in a model of two competing populations with chemotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the classical models in mathematical biology is the Lotka-Volterra competition model, describing the dynamics of two populations competing for resources. Two possible regimes in this system are given by their coexistence or extinction of a weaker population. In a distributed system with diffusive spatial coupling, travelling fronts occur, corresponding to transitions between stationary states. In this work we will consider the competition model extended by extra interaction between involved populations which is given by chemotactic coupling, namely, assuming that one species produces a chemical agent which causes the taxis of another species. It is known that in a one-species model (i.e. Keller-Segel model) production of chemoattractor results in formation of stationary periodic (or Turing-type) patterns. In this work, we will investigate conditions for the formation of stationary periodic patterns in a two-species competition model with chemotaxis. We show that in this system periodic patterns can emerge in the course of Turing-type instability (classical way) or from a stable steady state, corresponding to the extinction of one of the species, due to a finite, or over-threshold, amplitude disturbance. We study the characteristics of emerging periodic pattern, such as its amplitude and wavelength, by means of Fourier analysis. We also perform computational simulations to verify our analytical results.</description>

Abstract: In the asymptotic limit of a large diffusivity ratio, certain two-component reaction-diffusion (RD) systems can admit localized spike solutions on a 1-D finite domain in a far-from-equilibrium nonlinear regime. It is known that two distinct bifurcation mechanisms can occur which generate spike patterns of increased spatial complexity as the domain half-length L slowly increases; so-called spike nucleation and spike self-replication. Self-replication is found to occur via the passage beyond a saddle-node bifurcation point that can be predicted through linearization around the inner spike profile. In contrast, spike nucleation occurs through slow passage beyond the saddle-node of a nonlinear boundary-value problem defined in the outer region away from the core of a spike. Here, by treating L as a static parameter, precise conditions are established within the semi-strong interaction asymptotic regime to determine which occurs, conditions that are confirmed by numerical simulation and continuation. For the Schnakenberg and Brusselator RD models, phase diagrams in parameter space are derived that predict whether spike self-replication or spike nucleation will occur first as L is increased, or whether no such instability will occur. For the Gierer-Meinhardt model with a non-trivial activator background, spike nucleation is shown to be the only possible spike-generating mechanism. From time-dependent PDE numerical results on an exponentially slowly growing domain, it is shown that the analytical thresholds derived from the asymptotic theory accurately predict critical values of L where either spike self-replication or spike-nucleation will occur. The global bifurcation mechanism for transitions to patterns of increased spatial complexity is further elucidated by superimposing time-dependent PDE simulation results on the numerically computed solution branches of spike equilibria.</description>

      <title>On the required number of electrodes for uniqueness and convex reformulation in an inverse coefficient problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a computer-assisted proof for uniqueness and global reconstruction for the inverse Robin transmission problem, where the corrosion function on the boundary of an interior object is to be determined from current-voltage measurements on the boundary of an outer domain. We consider the shunt electrode model where, in contrast to the standard Neumann boundary condition, the applied electrical current is only partially known. The aim is to determine the corrosion coefficient with a finite number of measurements.
  In this paper, we present a numerically verifiable criterion that ensures unique solvability of the inverse problem, given a desired resolution. This allows us to explicitly determine the required number and position of the required electrodes. Furthermore, we will present an error estimate for noisy data. By rewriting the problem as a convex optimisation problem, our aim is to develop a globally convergent reconstruction algorithm.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Polynomials with Their Computational Costs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the effectiveness of two polynomial methods in solving non-linear time and space fractional partial differential equations. We first outline the general methodology and then apply it to five distinct experiments. The proposed method, noted for its simplicity, demonstrates a high degree of accuracy. Comparative analysis with existing techniques reveals that our approach yields more precise solutions. The results, presented through graphs and tables, indicate that He's and Daftardar-Jafari polynomials significantly enhance accuracy. Additionally, we provide an in-depth discussion on the computational costs associated with these polynomials. Due to its straightforward implementation, the proposed method can be extended for application to a broader range of problems.</description>

      <title>Transformation of Stochastic Recursions and Critical Phenomena in the Analysis of a Class of Mean Flow Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates, via methods from the theory of probability on trees, critical phenomena in stochastic cascade models of Yule type, and applies these methods to the problem of uniqueness and nonuniqueness of solutions of particular mean flow equations. For linear equations, Feller's classic discovery of the relationship between critical stochastic explosion phenomena for Markov processes and uniqueness and nonuniqueness of solutions to the associated Kolmogorov equation partly illustrates the spirit of the present paper. New methods are introduced to explore the effects that stochastic critical phenomena, such as stochastic explosion, hyperexplosion, t-leaf percolation, have on their corresponding mean flow equations. These methods are illustrated in the context of two non-local differential equations that are related by linearization, the pantograph and the $\alpha$-Riccati equations. In particular, stochastic recursions, stochastic Picard iterations and transformation of solutions processes associated with these equations, are used to establish a `one-to-many principle' for their solutions. The development also includes an application of Feller's classical theory of jump Markov processes to a certain class of pantograph equations that appears to be new.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal $H$-convergence for topologically nontrivial domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.12315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of nonlocal $H$-convergence is extended to domains with nontrivial topology, that is, domains with non-vanishing harmonic Dirichlet and/or Neumann fields. If the space of harmonic Dirichlet (or Neumann) fields is infinite-dimensional, there is an abundance of choice of pairwise incomparable topologies generalising the one for topologically trivial $\Omega$. It will be demonstrated that if the domain satisfies the Maxwell's compactness property the corresponding natural version of the corresponding (generalised) nonlocal $H$-convergence topology has no such ambiguity. Moreover, on multiplication operators the nonlocal $H$-topology coincides with the one induced by (local) $H$-convergence introduced by Murat and Tartar. The topology is used to obtain nonlocal homogenisation results including convergence of the associated energy for electrostatics. The derived techniques prove useful to deduce a new compactness criterion relevant for nonlinear static Maxwell problems.</description>

      <title>The stochastic primitive equations with non-isothermal turbulent pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the primitive equations with $\textit{non}$-isothermal turbulent pressure and transport noise. They are derived from the Navier-Stokes equations by employing stochastic versions of the Boussinesq and the hydrostatic approximations. The temperature dependence of the turbulent pressure can be seen as a consequence of an additive noise acting on the small vertical dynamics. For such a model we prove global well-posedness in $H^1$ where the noise is considered in both the It\^{o} and Stratonovich formulations. Compared to previous variants of the primitive equations, the one considered here presents a more intricate coupling between the velocity field and the temperature. The corresponding analysis is seriously more involved than in the deterministic setting. Finally, the continuous dependence on the initial data and the energy estimates proven here are new, even in the case of isothermal turbulent pressure.</description>

      <title>Wrinkling of an elastic sheet floating on a liquid sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A thin circular elastic sheet floating on a drop-like liquid substrate gets deformed due to incompatibility between the curved substrate and the planar sheet. We adopt a variational viewpoint by minimizing the non-convex membrane energy plus a higher-order convex bending energy. Being interested in thin sheets, we expand the minimum of the energy in terms of a small thickness $h$, and identify the first two terms of this expansion. The leading order term comes from a minimization of a family of one-dimensional ``relaxed'' problems, while for the next-order term we only identify its scaling law. This generalizes the previous work [P. Bella and R.V. Kohn. Wrikling of a thin circular sheet bonded to a spherical substrate, Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. A, 375(2017). arXiv:1611.01781] to the physically relevant case of a liquid substrate.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study the convergence to equilibrium for a (potentially) degenerate nonlinear and nonlocal McKean-Vlasov equation. We show that the solution to this equation is related to the solution of a linear degenerate and/or defective Fokker-Planck equation and employ recent sharp convergence results to obtain an easily computable (and many times sharp) rates of convergence to equilibrium for the equation in question.</description>

Abstract: We investigate some of the effects of the lack of compactness in the critical Folland-Stein-Sobolev embedding in very general (possible non-smooth) domains, by proving via De Giorgi's $\Gamma$-convergence techniques that optimal functions for a natural subcritical approximations of the Sobolev quotient concentrate energy at one point. In the second part of the paper, we try to restore the compactness by extending the celebrated Global Compactness result to the Heisenberg group via a completely different approach with respect to the original one by Struwe [37].</description>

Abstract: We investigate maximal potential energy dissipation as a selection criterion for subsolutions (coarse grained solutions) in the setting of the unstable Muskat problem. We show that both, imposing this criterion on the level of convex integration subsolutions, and the strategy of Otto based on a relaxation via minimizing movements, lead to the same nonlocal conservation law. Our main result shows that this equation admits an entropy solution for unstable initial data with an analytic interface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16012v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Landau-Coulomb equation is an important model in plasma physics featuring both nonlinear diffusion and reaction terms. In this manuscript we focus on the diffusion operator within the equation by dropping the potentially nefarious reaction term altogether. We show that the diffusion operator in the Landau-Coulomb equation provides a much stronger L^1 to L^\infty rate of regularization than its linear counterpart, the Laplace operator. The result is made possible by a nonlinear functional inequality of Gressman, Krieger, and Strain together with a De Giorgi iteration. This stronger regularization rate illustrates the importance of the nonlinear nature of the diffusion in the analysis of the Landau equation and raises the question of determining whether this rate also happens for the Landau-Coulomb equation itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global second order H\"{o}lder regularity for Stokes systems can be obtained by global Schauder estimates, which are actually a priori estimates and were established by Solonnikov [20] and [23] with appropriate compatible conditions. This paper will investigate the corresponding interior regularity which unfortunately may fail in general from Serrin's counterexample (cf. [19]). However, we discover interior $C^{2,\alpha}$ regularity for velocity and interior $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity for pressure in spatial variables, and furthermore, for curl of velocity, we find its gradient belongs to $C^{\alpha, \frac{\alpha}2}$, that is, possesses H\"{o}lder continuity in both space and time directions. The interesting phenomenon here is that no continuity in time variable is assumed for both the coefficients and the righthand side terms. The estimates for velocity and its curl are achieved pointwisely and the results are sharp indicated by a counterexample.</description>

Abstract: Hysteresis in the relation between the capillary pressure and the moisture content in unsaturated porous media, which is due to surface tension at the liquid-gas interface, exhibits strong degeneracy in the resulting mass balance equation. Solutions to such degenerate equations have been recently constructed by the method of convexification. We show here that the convexification argument works even if the permeability coefficient depends on the hysteretic saturation. The problem of uniqueness remains open in this case.</description>

Abstract: Large time dynamics of reaction-diffusion systems modeling some irreversible reaction networks are investigated. Depending on initial masses, these networks possibly possess boundary equilibria, where some of the chemical concentrations are completely used up. In the absence of these equilibria, we show an explicit convergence to equilibrium by a modified entropy method, where it is shown that reactions in a measurable set with positive measure is sufficient to combine with diffusion and to drive the system towards equilibrium. When the boundary equilibria are present, we show that they are unstable (in Lyapunov sense) using some bootstrap instability technique from fluid mechanics, while the nonlinear stability of the positive equilibrium is proved by exploiting a spectral gap of the linearized operator and the uniform-in-time boundedness of solutions.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation of double eigenvalues for Aharonov-Bohm operators with a moving pole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study double eigenvalues of Aharonov-Bohm operators with Dirichlet boundary conditions in planar domains containing the origin. We focus on the behavior of double eigenvalues when the potential's circulation is a fixed half-integer number and the operator's pole is moving on straight lines in a neighborhood of the origin. We prove that bifurcation occurs if the pole is moving along straight lines in a certain number of cones with positive measure. More precise information is given for symmetric domains; in particular, in the special case of the disk, any eigenvalue is double if the pole is located at the centre, but there exists a whole neighborhood where it bifurcates into two distinct branches.</description>

      <title>Onset of pattern formation for the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the solution of a stochastic Allen-Cahn equation $\frac{\partial u_\eps }{\partial t}=\frac 12 \frac{\partial^2 u_\eps }{\partial x^2}+ u_\eps -u_\eps^3+\sqrt\eps\, \dot W$, with Dirichlet boundary conditions on a suitably large space interval $[-L_\eps , L_\eps]$, starting from the identically zero function, and where $\dot W$ is a space-time white noise. Our main goal is the description, in the small noise limit, of the onset of the phase separation, with the emergence of spatial regions where $u_\eps$ becomes close $1$ or $-1$. The time scale and the spatial structure are determined by a suitable Gaussian process that appears as the solution of the corresponding linearized equation. This issue has been initially examined by De Masi et al. [Ann. Probab. {\bf 22}, (1994), 334-371] in the related context of a class of reaction-diffusion models obtained as a superposition of a speeded up stirring process and a spin flip dynamics on $\{-1,1\}^{\mathbb{Z}_\eps}$, where $\mathbb{Z}_\eps=\mathbb{Z}$ modulo $\lfloor\eps^{-1}L_\eps\rfloor$.</description>

      <title>Convergent analysis of algebraic multigrid method with data-driven parameter learning for non-selfadjoint elliptic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the practical GADI-HS iteration as a smoother in algebraic multigrid (AMG) method for solving second-order non-selfadjoint elliptic problem. Additionally, we prove the convergence of the derived algorithm and introduce a data-driven parameter learing method called Gaussian process regression (GPR) to predict optimal parameters. Numerical experimental results show that using GPR to predict parameters can save a significant amount of time cost and approach the optimal parameters accurately.</description>
