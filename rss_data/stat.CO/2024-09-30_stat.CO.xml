      <title>GephiForR: An R package for creating Gephi-style network visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces GephiForR, an R package designed to replicate Java-based Gephi's key plotting tools in R. The package is accessible to those with minimal R experience and, in particular, implements ForceAtlas2, the key layout feature developed for Gephi by Jacomy et al. (2014). The most significant advancement is the ability to pass previous positions into ForceAtlas2 as baselines, a particularly useful feature for plotting the evolution of network layouts for time series data. GephiForR is especially suited for networks of less than 1000 nodes, simply because R's dependence on single-thread computation means that larger networks take longer to compute, but the package can handle these larger networks as well. I demonstrate the package's capabilities through various examples and comparisons with existing tools and Gephi itself, assessing performance and speed.</description>

      <title>A model-constrained Discontinuous Galerkin Network (DGNet) for Compressible Euler Equations with Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time accurate solutions of large-scale complex dynamical systems are critically needed for control, optimization, uncertainty quantification, and decision-making in practical engineering and science applications, particularly in digital twin contexts. In this work, we develop a model-constrained discontinuous Galerkin Network (DGNet) approach, an extension to our previous work [Model-constrained Tagent Slope Learning Approach for Dynamical Systems], for compressible Euler equations with out-of-distribution generalization. The core of DGNet is the synergy of several key strategies: (i) leveraging time integration schemes to capture temporal correlation and taking advantage of neural network speed for computation time reduction; (ii) employing a model-constrained approach to ensure the learned tangent slope satisfies governing equations; (iii) utilizing a GNN-inspired architecture where edges represent Riemann solver surrogate models and nodes represent volume integration correction surrogate models, enabling capturing discontinuity capacity, aliasing error reduction, and mesh discretization generalizability; (iv) implementing the input normalization technique that allows surrogate models to generalize across different initial conditions, boundary conditions, and solution orders; and (v) incorporating a data randomization technique that not only implicitly promotes agreement between surrogate models and true numerical models up to second-order derivatives, ensuring long-term stability and prediction capacity, but also serves as a data generation engine during training, leading to enhanced generalization on unseen data. To validate the effectiveness, stability, and generalizability of our novel DGNet approach, we present comprehensive numerical results for 1D and 2D compressible Euler equation problems.</description>

      <title>Splinets -- splines through the Taylor expansion, their support sets and orthogonal bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.00733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new representation of splines that targets efficiency in the analysis of functional data is implemented. The efficiency is achieved through two novel features: using the recently introduced orthonormal spline bases, the so-called {\it splinets} and accounting for the spline support sets in the proposed spline object representation. The recently-introduced orthogonal splinets are evaluated by {\it dyadic orthogonalization} of the $B$-splines. The package is built around the {\it Splinets}-object that represents a collection of splines. It treats splines as mathematical functions and contains information about the support sets and the values of the derivatives at the knots that uniquely define these functions. Algebra and calculus of splines utilize the Taylor expansions at the knots within the support sets. Several orthonormalization procedures of the $B$-splines are implemented including the recommended dyadic method leading to the splinets. The method bases on a dyadic algorithm that can be also viewed as the efficient method of diagonalizing a band matrix. The locality of the $B$-splines in terms of the support sets is, to a great extend, preserved in the corresponding splinet. This together with implemented algorithms utilizing locality of the supports provides a valuable computational tool for functional data analysis. The benefits are particularly evident when the sparsity in the data plays an important role. Various diagnostic tools are provided allowing to maintain the stability of the computations. Finally, the projection operation to the space of splines is implemented that facilitates functional data analysis. An example of a simple functional analysis of the data using the tools in the package is presented. The functionality of the package extends beyond the splines to piecewise polynomial functions, although the splines are its focus.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Estimation of Large Probit Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probit models are useful for modeling correlated discrete responses in many disciplines, including consumer choice data in economics and marketing. However, the Gaussian latent variable feature of probit models coupled with identification constraints pose significant computational challenges for its estimation and inference, especially when the dimension of the discrete response variable is large. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating large probit models. Our work is distinct from existing methods in two important aspects. First, instead of simulation or sampling methods, we apply and customize expectation propagation (EP), a deterministic method originally proposed for approximate Bayesian inference, to estimate moments of the truncated multivariate normal (TMVN) in the E (expectation) step. Second, we take advantage of a symmetric identification condition to transform the constrained optimization problem in the M (maximization) step into a one-dimensional problem, which is solved efficiently using Newton's method instead of off-the-shelf solvers. Our method enables the analysis of correlated choice data in the presence of more than 100 alternatives, which is a reasonable size in modern applications, such as online shopping and booking platforms, but has been difficult in practice with probit models. We apply our probit estimation method to study ordering effects in hotel search results on Expedia's online booking platform.</description>

      <title>Optical ISAC: Fundamental Performance Limits and Transceiver Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11792v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper characterizes the optimal Capacity-Distortion (C-D) tradeoff in an optical point-to-point system with Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) for communication and Single-Input Multiple-Output (SIMO) for sensing within an Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) framework. We consider the optimal Rate-Distortion (R-D) region and explore several Inner (IB) and Outer Bounds (OB). We introduce practical, asymptotically optimal Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) and Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLE) for target distance, addressing nonlinear measurement-to-state relationships and non-conjugate priors. As the number of sensing antennas increases, these estimators converge to the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Bound (BCRB). We also establish that the achievable Rate-Cram\'er-Rao Bound (R-CRB) serves as an OB for the optimal C-D region, valid for both unbiased estimators and asymptotically large numbers of receive antennas. To clarify that the input distribution determines the tradeoff across the Pareto boundary of the C-D region, we propose two algorithms: i) an iterative Blahut-Arimoto Algorithm (BAA)-type method, and ii) a memory-efficient Closed-Form (CF) approach. The CF approach includes a CF optimal distribution for high Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio (O-SNR) conditions. Additionally, we adapt and refine the Deterministic-Random Tradeoff (DRT) to this optical ISAC context.</description>
