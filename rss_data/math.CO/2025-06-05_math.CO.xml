      <title>The Tur\'{a}n density of short tight cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $3$-uniform tight $\ell$-cycle $C_\ell^{3}$ is the $3$-graph on $\{1,\dots,\ell\}$ consisting of all $\ell$ consecutive triples in the cyclic order. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be either the pair $\{C_{4}^{3}, C_{5}^{3}\}$ or the single tight $\ell$-cycle $C_{\ell}^{3}$ for some $\ell\ge 7$ not divisible by $3$.
  We show that the Tur\'an density of $\mathcal{C}$, that is, the asymptotically maximal edge density of a large $\mathcal{C}$-free $3$-graph, is equal to $2\sqrt{3} - 3$. We also establish the corresponding Erd\H{o}s-Simonovits-type stability result, informally stating that all almost maximum $\mathcal{C}$-free graphs are close in the edit distance to a 2-part recursive construction. This extends the earlier analogous results of Kam\v{c}ev-Letzter-Pokrovskiy ["The Tur\'an density of tight cycles in three-uniform hypergraphs", Int. Math. Res. Not. 6 (2024), 4804-4841] that apply for sufficiently large $\ell$ only.
  Additionally, we prove a finer structural result that allows us to determine the maximum number of edges in a $\{C_{4}^{3}, C_{5}^{3}\}$-free $3$-graph with a given number of vertices up to an additive $O(1)$ error term.</description>

      <title>A Linear Kernel for Independent Set Reconfiguration in Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a positive integer $r$, and a graph $G$ that is $K_{3,r}$-minor-free. Let $I_s$ and $I_t$ be two independent sets in $G$, each of size $k$. We begin with a ``token'' on each vertex of $I_s$ and seek to move all tokens to $I_t$, by repeated ``token jumping'', removing a single token from one vertex and placing it on another vertex. We require that each intermediate arrangement of tokens again specifies an independent set of size $k$. Given $G$, $I_s$, and $I_t$, we ask whether there exists a sequence of token jumps that transforms $I_s$ into $I_t$. When $k$ is part of the input, this problem is known to be PSPACE-complete. However, it was shown by Ito, Kami\'nski, and Ono (2014) to be fixed-parameter tractable. That is, when $k$ is fixed, the problem can be solved in time polynomial in the order of $G$.
  Here we strengthen the upper bound on the running time in terms of $k$ by showing that the problem has a kernel of size linear in $k$. More precisely, we transform an arbitrary input problem on a $K_{3,r}$-minor-free graph into an equivalent problem on a ($K_{3,r}$-minor-free) graph with order $O(k)$. This answers positively a question of Bousquet, Mouawad, Nishimura, and Siebertz (2024) and improves the recent quadratic kernel of Cranston, M\"{u}hlenthaler, and Peyrille (2024+). For planar graphs, we further strengthen this upper bound to get a kernel of size at most $42k$.</description>

      <title>Upho lattices II: ways of realizing a core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A poset is called upper homogeneous, or "upho," if all of its principal order filters are isomorphic to the whole poset. In previous work of the first author, it was shown that each (finite-type N-graded) upho lattice has associated to it a finite graded lattice, called its core, which determines the rank generating function of the upho lattice. In that prior work the question of which finite graded lattices arise as cores was explored. Here, we study the question of in how many different ways a given finite graded lattice can be realized as the core of an upho lattice. We show that if the finite lattice has no nontrivial automorphisms, then it is the core of finitely many upho lattices. We also show that the number of ways a finite lattice can be realized as a core is unbounded, even when restricting to rank-two lattices. We end with a discussion of a potential algorithm for listing all the ways to realize a given finite lattice as a core.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For fixed graphs $H$ and $F$, the \emph{generalized Tur\'an number} $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ is the maximum possible number of copies of a subgraph $H$ in an $n$-vertex $F$-free graph. This article is a survey of this extremal function whose study was initiated in an influential 2016 article by Alon and Shikhelman (\emph{J. Combin. Theory, B}, {\bf 121}, 2016).</description>

      <title>The Global Structure of a Typical Graph Without $H$ as an Induced Subgraph when $H$ is a Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One way to certify that a graph does not contain an induced cycle of length six is to provide a partition of its vertex set into (i) a stable set, and (ii) a graph containing no stable set of size three and no induced matching of size two. We show that almost every graph which does not contain a cycle of length six as an induced subgraph has such a certificate. We obtain similar characterizations of the structure of almost all graphs which contain no induced cycle of length $k$ for all even $k$ exceeding six. (Similar results were obtained for $k=3$ by Erdos, Kleitman, and Rothschild in 1976, for $k =4,5$ by Promel and Steger in 1991 and for odd $k$ exceeding 5 by Balogh and Butterfield in 2009.) We prove that a simiiar theorem for all $H$ holds up to the deletion of a set of $o(|V(G)|)$ vertices and ask for which $H$ the characterization holds fully.</description>

      <title>The vertex sets of subtrees of a tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a set of subsets of a set $W$. When is there a tree $T$ with vertex set $W$ such that each member of $\mathcal{F}$ is the set of vertices of a subtree of $T$? It is necessary that $\mathcal{F}$ has the Helly property and the intersection graph of $\mathcal{F}$ is chordal. We will show that these two necessary conditions are together sufficient in the finite case, and more generally, they are sufficient if no element of $W$ belongs to infinitely many infinite sets in $\mathcal{F}$.</description>

      <title>A Note on Inequalities for Three Domination Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short paper, we establish relations between the domination number $\gamma$, the total domination number $\gamma_t$, and the connected domination number $\gamma_c$ of a graph. In particular, we prove upper and lower bounds for $\gamma_t$ in terms of $\gamma$ and $\gamma_c$. Moreover, we propose the following conjecture: for every connected isolated-free graph $G$, \begin{equation*}\label{eq:low}
  \gamma_t(G) \geq \left \lceil \frac{3\gamma(G) +2\gamma_c(G)}{6}\right\rceil. \end{equation*} As evidence to support the conjecture, we prove that the conjecture holds when $\gamma_t(G) = \gamma_c(G)$ and also, when $\gamma_t(G) = \gamma_c(G) -1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, for positive integers $n,n'$, we give a geometric-combinatorial characterization for the set of quadratic inequalities on minors that are valid for all $n\times n'$ totally nonnegative matrices. This is obtained as a consequence from our earlier results on ``stable'' quadratic identities on minors of matrices generated by flows in planar graphs via Lindstr\"om's construction.</description>

      <title>Construction of pre-and post-Lie algebras for stochastic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give and study a construction of pre-Lie algebra structures on rooted trees whose edges and vertices are decorated, with a grafting product acting, through a map $\phi$, both on the decoration of the created edge and on the vertex that holds the grafting. We show that this construction gives a pre-Lie algebra if, and only if, the map $\phi$ satisfies a commutation relation, called tree-compatibility. We show how to extend this pre-Lie algebra structure to a post-Lie one by a semi-direct extension with another post-Lie algebra. We also define several constructions to obtain tree-compatible maps, and give examples, including a description of all tree-admissible maps when the space of decorations of the vertices is $2$-dimensional and the space of decorations of the edges is finite-dimensional. A particular example of such a construction is used by Bruned, Hairer and Zambotti for the study of stochastic partial differential equations: when no noise is involved, we show that the underlying tree-compatible map is the exponential of a simpler one and deduce an explicit isomorphism with a classical pre-Lie algebra of rooted trees; when a noise is involved, we obtain the underlying tree-compatible map as a direct sum. We also obtain with our formalism the post-Lie algebras described by Bruned and Katsetsiadis.</description>

      <title>Jumbled Scattered Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we combine the research on (absent) scattered factors with the one of jumbled words. For instance, $\mathtt{wolf}$ is an absent scattered factor of $\mathtt{cauliflower}$ but since $\mathtt{lfow}$, a jumbled (or abelian) version of $\mathtt{wolf}$, is a scattered factor, $\mathtt{wolf}$ occurs as a jumbled scattered factor in $\mathtt{cauliflower}$. A \emph{jumbled scattered factor} $u$ of a word $w$ is constructed by letters of $w$ with the only rule that the number of occurrences per letter in $u$ is smaller than or equal to the one in $w$. We proceed to partition and characterise the set of jumbled scattered factors by the number of jumbled letters and use the latter as a measure. For this new class of words, we relate the folklore longest common subsequence (scattered factor) to the number of required jumbles. Further, we investigate the smallest possible number of jumbles alongside the jumbled scattered factor relation as well as Simon's congruence from the point of view of jumbled scattered factors and jumbled universality.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for any circle graph $H$ with at least one edge and for any positive integer $k$, there exists an integer $t=t(k,H)$ so that every graph $G$ either has a vertex-minor isomorphic to the disjoint union of $k$ copies of $H$, or has a $t$-perturbation with no vertex-minor isomorphic to $H$. Using the same techniques, we also prove that for any planar multigraph $H$, every binary matroid either has a minor isomorphic to the cycle matroid of $kH$, or is a low-rank perturbation of a binary matroid with no minor isomorphic to the cycle matroid of $H$.</description>

      <title>From Weingarten calculus for real Grassmannians to deformations of monotone Hurwitz numbers and Jucys-Murphy elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work is inspired by three interrelated themes: Weingarten calculus for integration over unitary groups, monotone Hurwitz numbers which enumerate certain factorisations of permutations into transpositions, and Jucys-Murphy elements in the symmetric group algebra. The authors and Moskovsky recently extended this picture to integration on complex Grassmannians, leading to a deformation of the monotone Hurwitz numbers to polynomials that are conjectured to satisfy remarkable interlacing phenomena.
  In this paper, we consider integration on the real Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}_\mathbb{R}(M,N)$, interpreted as the space of $N \times N$ idempotent real symmetric matrices of rank $M$. We show that in the regime of large $N$ and fixed $\frac{M}{N}$, such integrals have expansions whose coefficients are variants of monotone Hurwitz numbers that are polynomials in the parameter $t = 1 - \frac{N}{M}$.
  We define a "$b$-Weingarten calculus", without reference to underlying matrix integrals, that recovers the unitary case at $b = 0$ and the orthogonal case at $b = 1$. The $b$-monotone Hurwitz numbers, previously introduced by Bonzom, Chapuy and Dolega, arise naturally in this context as monotone factorisations of pair partitions. The $b$- and $t$-deformations can be combined to form a common generalisation, leading to the notion of $bt$-monotone Hurwitz numbers, for which we state several results and conjectures.
  Finally, we introduce certain linear operators inspired by the aforementioned $b$-Weingarten calculus that can be considered as $b$-deformations of the Jucys-Murphy elements in the symmetric group algebra. We make several conjectures regarding these operators that generalise known properties of the Jucys-Murphy elements and make a connection to the family of Jack symmetric functions.</description>

      <title>On the enumeration of double cosets and self-inverse double cosets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double cosets appear in many contexts in combinatorics, for example in the enumeration of certain objects up to symmetries. Double cosets in a quotient of the form $H\backslash G / H$ have an inverse, and can be their own inverse. In this paper we present various formulas enumerating double cosets, and in particular self-inverse double cosets. We study double cosets in classical groups, especially the symmetric groups and the general linear groups, explaining how to obtain the informations on their conjugacy classes required to apply our formulas. We also consider double cosets of parabolic subgroups of Coxeter groups of type B.</description>

      <title>Mapped Exponent and Asymptotic Critical Exponent of Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04091v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how much injective morphisms can increase the repetitiveness of a given word. This question has a few possible variations depending on the meaning of ``repetitiveness''. We concentrate on fractional exponents of finite words and asymptotic critical exponents of infinite words. We characterize finite words that, when mapped by injective morphisms, can have arbitrarily high fractional exponent. For infinite words, alongside other results, we show that the asymptotic critical exponent grows at most by a constant factor (depending on the size of the alphabet) when mapped by an injective morphism. For both finite and infinite words, the binary case is better understood than the general case.</description>

      <title>Colour-biased Hamilton cycles in randomly perturbed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and an $r$-edge-colouring $\chi$ on $E(G)$, a Hamilton cycle $H\subset G$ is said to have $t$ colour-bias if $H$ contains $n/r+t$ edges of the same colour in $\chi$. Freschi, Hyde, Lada and Treglown showed every $r$-coloured graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\delta(G)\geq(r+1)n/2r+t$ contains a Hamilton cycle $H$ with $\Omega(t)$ colour-bias, generalizing a result of Balogh, Csaba, Jing and Pluh\'{a}r. In 2022, Gishboliner, Krivelevich and Michaeli proved that the random graph $G(n,m)$ with $m\geq(1/2+\varepsilon)n\log n$ typically admits an $\Omega(n)$ colour biased Hamilton cycle in any $r$-colouring.
  In this paper, we investigate colour-biased Hamilton cycles in randomly perturbed graphs. We show that for every $\alpha&gt;0$, adding $m=O(n)$ random edges to a graph $G_\alpha$ with $\delta(G_\alpha)\geq \alpha n$ typically ensures a Hamilton cycle with $\Omega(n)$ colour bias in any $r$-colouring of $G_\alpha\cup G(n,m)$. Conversely, for certain $G_{\alpha}$, reducing the number of random edges to $m=o(n)$ may eliminate all colour biased Hamilton cycles of $G(n,m)\cup G$ in a certain colouring. In contrast, at the critical endpoint $\alpha=(r+1)/2r$, adding $m$ random edges typically results in a Hamilton cycle with $\Omega(m)$ colour-bias for any $1\ll m\leq n$.</description>

      <title>Bounded powers of edge ideals: The strong exchange property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S=K[x_1, \ldots,x_n]$ denote the polynomial ring in $n$ variables over a field $K$ and $I \subset S$ a monomial ideal. Given a vector $\mathfrak{c}\in\mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}^n$, the ideal $I_{\mathfrak{c}}$ is the ideal generated by those monomials belonging to $I$ whose exponent vectors are componentwise bounded above by $\mathfrak{c}$. Let $\delta_{\mathfrak{c}}(I)$ be the largest integer $q$ for which $(I^q)_{\mathfrak{c}}\neq 0$. Let $I(G) \subset S$ denote the edge ideal of a finite graph $G$ on the vertex set $V(G) = \{x_1, \ldots, x_s\}$. In our previous work, it is shown that $(I(G)^{\delta_{\mathfrak{c}}(I)})_{\mathfrak{c}}$ is a polymatroidal ideal. Let $\mathcal{W}(\mathfrak{c},G)$ denote the minimal system of monomial generators of $(I(G)^{\delta_{\mathfrak{c}}(I)})_{\mathfrak{c}}$. It follows that $\mathcal{W}(\mathfrak{c},G)$ satisfies the symmetric exchange property. In the present paper, the question when $\mathcal{W}(\mathfrak{c},G)$ enjoys the strong exchange property, or equivalently, when $\mathcal{W}(\mathfrak{c},G)$ is of Veronese type is studied.</description>

      <title>A new strategy for finding spanning trees without small degree stems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03762v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an integer $k\geq 2$, a spanning tree of a graph without vertices of degree from $2$ to $k$ is called a {\it $[2,k]$-ST} of the graph. The concept of $[2,k]$-STs is a natural extension of a homeomorphically irreducible spanning tree (or HIST), which is a well-studied graph structure. In this paper, we give a new strategy for finding $[2,k]$-STs. By using the strategy, we refine or extend a known degree-sum condition for the existence of a HIST. Furthermore, we also investigate a degree-product condition for the existence of a $[2,k]$-ST.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the connected blocks polytope, which, apart from its own merits, can be seen as the generalization of certain connectivity based or Eulerian subgraph polytopes. We provide a complete facet description of this polytope, characterize its edges and show that it is Hirsch. We also show that connected blocks polytopes admit a regular unimodular triangulation by constructing a squarefree Gr\"obner basis. In addition, we prove that the polytope is Gorenstein of index $2$ and that its $h^\ast$-vector is unimodal.</description>

      <title>Crystals for shifted key polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article continues our study of $P$- and $Q$-key polynomials, which are (non-symmetric) "partial" Schur $P$- and $Q$-functions as well as "shifted" versions of key polynomials. Our main results provide a crystal interpretation of $P$- and $Q$-key polynomials, namely, as the characters of certain connected subcrystals of normal crystals associated to the queer Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{q}_n$. In the $P$-key case, the ambient normal crystals are the $\mathfrak{q}_n$-crystals studied by Grantcharov et al., while in the $Q$-key case, these are replaced by the extended $\mathfrak{q}_n$-crystals recently introduced by the first author and Tong. Using these constructions, we propose a crystal-theoretic lift of several conjectures about the decomposition of involution Schubert polynomials into $P$- and $Q$-key polynomials. We verify these generalized conjectures in a few special cases. Along the way, we establish some miscellaneous results about normal $\mathfrak{q}_n$-crystals and Demazure $\mathfrak{gl}_n$-crystals.</description>

      <title>HIST-Critical Graphs and Malkevitch's Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a given graph, a HIST is a spanning tree without $2$-valent vertices. Motivated by developing a better understanding of HIST-free graphs, i.e. graphs containing no HIST, in this article's first part we study HIST-critical graphs, i.e. HIST-free graphs in which every vertex-deleted subgraph does contain a HIST (e.g. a triangle). We give an almost complete characterisation of the orders for which these graphs exist and present an infinite family of planar examples which are $3$-connected and in which nearly all vertices are $4$-valent. This leads naturally to the second part in which we investigate planar $4$-regular graphs with and without HISTs, motivated by a conjecture of Malkevitch, which we computationally verify up to order $22$. First we enumerate HISTs in antiprisms, whereafter we present planar $4$-regular graphs with and without HISTs, obtained via line graphs. Finally, we confirm Malkevitch's conjecture for the family of line graphs of cyclically $4$-edge connected cubic graphs.</description>

      <title>Low-rank matrices, tournaments, and symmetric designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14015v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{a} = (a_{i})_{i \geq 1}$ be a sequence in a field $\mathbb{F}$, and $f \colon \mathbb{F} \times \mathbb{F} \to \mathbb{F}$ be a function such that $f(a_{i},a_{i}) \neq 0$ for all $i \geq 1$. For any tournament $T$ over $[n]$, consider the $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $M_{T}(f, \mathbf{a})$ with zero diagonal whose $(i,j)$th entry (for $i &lt; j$) is $f(a_{i},a_{j})$ if $i \to j$ in $T$, and $f(a_{j},a_{i})$ if $j \to i$ in $T$. It is known (cf. Balachandran et al., Linear Algebra Appl. 658 (2023), 310-318) that if $T$ is a uniformly random tournament over $[n]$, then $\operatorname{rank}(M_{T}(f,\mathbf{a})) \geq (\frac{1}{2}-o(1))n$ with high probability when $\operatorname{char}(\mathbb{F}) \neq 2$ and $f$ is a linear function.
  In this paper, we investigate the other extremal question: how low can the ranks of such matrices be? We work with sequences $\mathbf{a}$ that take only two distinct values, so the rank of any such $n \times n$ matrix is at least $n/2$. First, we show that the rank of any such matrix depends on whether an associated bipartite graph has certain eigenvalues of high multiplicity. Using this, we show that if $f$ is linear, then there are $n \times n$ real matrices $M_{T}(f;\mathbf{a})$ of rank at most $\frac{n}{2} + O(1)$. For rational matrices, we show that for each $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ we can find a sequence $\mathbf{a}(\varepsilon)$ for which there are $n \times n$ matrices $M_{T}(f;\mathbf{a}(\varepsilon))$ of rank at most $(\frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon)n + O(1)$. These matrices are constructed from symmetric designs, and we also use them to produce bisection-closed families of size greater than $\lfloor 3n/2 \rfloor - 2$ for $n \leq 15$, which improves the previously best known bound (cf. Balachandran et al., Electron J. Combin. 26 (2019), #P2.40).</description>

      <title>Two questions on Kneser colorings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate two questions on Kneser graphs $KG_{n,k}$. First, we prove that the union of $s$ intersecting families in ${[n]\choose k}$ has size at most ${n\choose k}-{n-s\choose k}$ for all sufficiently large $n$ that satisfy $n&gt;(2+\epsilon)k^2+s$ with $\epsilon&gt;0$. We provide an example that shows that this result is essentially tight for the number of colors close to $\chi(KG_{n,k})=n-2k+2$. We also improve the result of Bulankina and Kupavskii on the choice chromatic number, showing that it is at least $\frac 1{25} n\log n$ for all $k&lt;\sqrt n$ and $n$ sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Partitioning 2-edge-coloured bipartite graphs into monochromatic cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an $r$-edge-colouring of the edges of a graph $G$, we say that it can be partitioned into $p$ monochromatic cycles when there exists a set of $p$ vertex-disjoint monochromatic cycles covering all the vertices of $G$. In the literature of this problem, an edge and a single vertex both count as a cycle.
  We show that for every $2$-colouring of the edges of a complete balanced bipartite graph, $K_{n,n}$, it can be partitioned into at most 4 monochromatic cycles. This type of question was first studied in 1970 for complete graphs and in 1983, by Gy\'arf\'as and Lehel, for $K_{n,n}$. In 2014, Pokrovskiy showed for all $n$ that, given any $2$-colouring of its edges, $K_{n,n}$ can be partitioned into at most three monochromatic paths. It turns out that finding monochromatic cycles instead of paths is a natural question that has also been raised for other graphs. In 2015, Schaudt and Stein showed that 14 cycles are sufficient for sufficiently large $2$-edge-coloured $K_{n,n}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nut graph is a simple graph for which the adjacency matrix has a single zero eigenvalue such that all non-zero kernel eigenvectors have no zero entry. It is known that infinitely many $d$-regular nut graphs exist for $3 \leq d \leq 12$ and for $d \geq 4$ such that $d \equiv 0 \pmod{4}$. Here it is shown that infinitely many $d$-regular nut graphs exist for each degree $d \geq 3$. Moreover, we prove that there are infinitely many $d$-regular Cayley nut graphs for each even $d \ge 4$. This implies that we have identified all feasible degrees $d$ for which a $d$-regular Cayley nut graph exists.</description>

Abstract: We consider the number of domino tilings of an odd-by-odd rectangle that leave one hole. This problem is equivalent to the number of near-perfect matchings of the odd-by-odd rectangular grid. For any particular position of the vacancy on the $(2k+1)\times (2k+1)$ square grid, we show that the number of near-perfect matchings is a multiple of $2^k$, and from this follows a conjecture of Kong that the total number of near-perfect matchings is a multiple of $2^k$. We also determine the parity of the number of near-perfect matchings with a particular vacancy for the rectangle case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bipartite independence number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\widetilde{\alpha}(G)$, is defined as the smallest integer $q$ for which there exist positive integers $s$ and $t$ satisfying $s + t = q + 1$, such that for any two disjoint subsets $A, B \subseteq V(G)$ with $|A| = s$ and $|B| = t$, there exists an edge between $A$ and $B$. In this paper, we prove that for a $2$-connected graph $G$ of order at least three, if $\max\{d_G(x),d_G(y)\}\geq \widetilde{\alpha}(G)$ for any pair of nonadjacent vertices $x$ and $y$ in $G$ at distance 2, then $G$ is hamiltonian. In addition, we prove that for a $3$-connected graph $G$, if $\max\{d_G(x),d_G(y)\}\geq \widetilde{\alpha}(G)+1$ for any pair of nonadjacent vertices $x$ and $y$ in $G$ at distance 2, then $G$ is hamiltonian-connected. Our results generalize the work of Li and Liu.</description>

      <title>Generalized GM-MDS: Polynomial Codes are Higher Order MDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The GM-MDS theorem, conjectured by Dau-Song-Dong-Yuen and proved by Lovett and Yildiz-Hassibi, shows that the generator matrices of Reed-Solomon codes can attain every possible configuration of zeros for an MDS code. The recently emerging theory of higher order MDS codes has connected the GM-MDS theorem to other important properties of Reed-Solomon codes, including showing that Reed-Solomon codes can achieve list decoding capacity, even over fields of size linear in the message length.
  A few works have extended the GM-MDS theorem to other families of codes, including Gabidulin and skew polynomial codes. In this paper, we generalize all these previous results by showing that the GM-MDS theorem applies to any polynomial code, i.e., a code where the columns of the generator matrix are obtained by evaluating linearly independent polynomials at different points. We also show that the GM-MDS theorem applies to dual codes of such polynomial codes, which is non-trivial since the dual of a polynomial code may not be a polynomial code. More generally, we show that GM-MDS theorem also holds for algebraic codes (and their duals) where columns of the generator matrix are chosen to be points on some irreducible variety which is not contained in a hyperplane through the origin. Our generalization has applications to constructing capacity-achieving list-decodable codes as shown in a follow-up work by Brakensiek-Dhar-Gopi-Zhang, where it is proved that randomly punctured algebraic-geometric (AG) codes achieve list-decoding capacity over constant-sized fields.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the uniform algebraic rank of a divisor class on a finite graph. We show that it lies between Caporaso's algebraic rank and the combinatorial rank of Baker and Norine. We prove the Riemann-Roch theorem for the uniform algebraic rank, and show that both the algebraic and the uniform algebraic rank are realized on effective divisors. As an application, we use the uniform algebraic rank to show that Clifford representatives always exist. We conclude with an explicit description of such Clifford representatives for a large class of graphs.</description>

      <title>Proof of Merca's stronger conjecture on truncated Jacobi triple product series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the study of theta series and partition functions, Andrews and Merca, Guo and Zeng independently conjectured that a truncated Jacobi triple product series has nonnegative coefficients. This conjecture was proved analytically by Mao and combinatorially by Yee. In 2021, Merca proposed a stronger version of the conjecture, that is, for positive integers $1\leq S&lt;R$ with $k\geq 1$, the coefficient of $q^n$ in
  the theta series
  \[
  \frac{(-1)^{k} \sum_{j=k}^{\infty}(-1)^j q^{R j(j+1) / 2}\left(q^{-Sj}-q^{( j+1) S}\right)}{\left(q^S, q^{R-S}; q^R\right)_{\infty}}
  \]
  is nonnegative. Recently, some very special cases of this conjecture have been proved and studied. For any given $R, S$ and $k$, we take $s=S/(S,R), r=R/(S,R)$ which are coprime, equivalently. In this paper, we confirm Merca's stronger conjecture for sufficiently large $n$. Furthermore, for given $r, s$ and $k$, we provide a systematic method to determine an integer $N(r, s, k)$ such that Merca's stronger conjecture holds for $ n\geq N(r,s,k) $. More precisely, we decompose the infinite product in the denominator of the above theta series into two parts, one of which can be interpreted as the generating function of partitions with certain restricted parts and the other is a nonmodular infinite product.
  We derive the general upper and lower bounds for the coefficients of these two parts by using the partition theoretical method and the circle method, respectively. Further multiplying the partition part by the numerator of the theta series and considering the convolution with the nonmodular infinite product, we obtain the constant $N(r,s,k)$ and confirm Merca's stronger conjecture when $n\geq N(r,s,k)$. Moreover, we also show that when $k$ is sufficiently large, this conjecture holds directly for any $n\geq 0$.</description>

Abstract: We utilise the recent work of Orponen to yield a result of sum and product for Ahlfors-regular sets. The result is sharp up to constants. As a corollary, we obtain the fractal analogue of Solymosi's $4/3$-bound for finite subsets of $\mathbb{R}.$</description>

      <title>Neural Discovery in Mathematics: Do Machines Dream of Colored Planes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how neural networks can drive mathematical discovery through a case study of the Hadwiger-Nelson problem, a long-standing open problem at the intersection of discrete geometry and extremal combinatorics that is concerned with coloring the plane while avoiding monochromatic unit-distance pairs. Using neural networks as approximators, we reformulate this mixed discrete-continuous geometric coloring problem with hard constraints as an optimization task with a probabilistic, differentiable loss function. This enables gradient-based exploration of admissible configurations that most significantly led to the discovery of two novel six-colorings, providing the first improvement in thirty years to the off-diagonal variant of the original problem. Here, we establish the underlying machine learning approach used to obtain these results and demonstrate its broader applicability through additional numerical insights.</description>

      <title>A Proof of The Changepoint Detection Threshold Conjecture in Preferential Attachment Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of detecting and estimating a changepoint in the attachment function of a network evolving according to a preferential attachment model on $n$ vertices, using only a single final snapshot of the network. Bet et al.~\cite{bet2023detecting} show that a simple test based on thresholding the number of vertices with minimum degrees can detect the changepoint when the change occurs at time $n-\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. They further make the striking conjecture that detection becomes impossible for any test if the change occurs at time $n-o(\sqrt{n}).$ Kaddouri et al.~\cite{kaddouri2024impossibility} make a step forward by proving the detection is impossible if the change occurs at time $n-o(n^{1/3}).$ In this paper, we resolve the conjecture affirmatively, proving that detection is indeed impossible if the change occurs at time $n-o(\sqrt{n}).$ Furthermore, we establish that estimating the changepoint with an error smaller than $o(\sqrt{n})$ is also impossible, thereby confirming that the estimator proposed in Bhamidi et al.~\cite{bhamidi2018change} is order-optimal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a central hyperplane arrangement $\mathcal A$, coincide with the multidegrees of the Gauss map of a pencil of hypersurfaces naturally associated to $\mathcal A$. As a consequence, we obtain a proof of the Heron-Rota-Welsh conjecture for matroids representable over a field of characteristic zero.</description>

      <title>Schur Rank, Compatibility Degree, and Canonical Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12700v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of denominator vectors can be extended to all generic basis elements of upper cluster algebras in a natural way. Under a weakened version of generic pairing assumption, we provide a representation-theoretic interpretation for this extended notion. We derive several consequences in this generality. We present a counterexample to the conjecture that distinct cluster monomials have distinct denominator vectors. Utilizing a new rank function called the Schur rank, we extend the notion of compatibility degree. As an application, we find a tropical method to compute the multiplicity of a real component in the canonical decomposition of $\delta$-vectors.</description>
