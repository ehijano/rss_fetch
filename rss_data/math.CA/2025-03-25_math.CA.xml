      <title>Almost all real linear second order ordinary differential equations are solved by geodesic curves in two dimensional Riemannian hyperbolic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I show that a real linear second order ordinary differential equation $u''\left(x\right)+h\left(x\right)u\left(x\right)=0$, with differentiable $h(x)$, locally admits two linearly independent solutions which exist on an open interval around any $x_0\in\mathbb{R}$: \[
  u_\mathtt{top}(x)=\exp\left[\int_{x_0}^{x}\!\!d\xi\,\Phi\left(\xi\right)\frac{\Phi'\left(\xi\right)-\sqrt{\left[h\left(\xi\right)-\Phi^{2}\left(\xi\right)\right]^{2}+\left[\Phi'\left(\xi\right)\right]^{2}}}{h\left(\xi\right)-\Phi^{2}\left(\xi\right)}\right], \] \[
  u_\mathtt{bot}(x)=\exp\left[\int_{x_0}^{x}\!\!d\xi\,\Phi\left(\xi\right)\frac{\Phi'\left(\xi\right)+\sqrt{\left[h\left(\xi\right)-\Phi^{2}\left(\xi\right)\right]^{2}+\left[\Phi'\left(\xi\right)\right]^{2}}}{h\left(\xi\right)-\Phi^{2}\left(\xi\right)}\right], \] where $\Phi(x)$ is any geodesic curve in a two dimensional hyperbolic geometry of a Riemannian manifold $\mathbb{M}_h$, which is non-vertical at $x_0$. I define $\mathbb{M}_h$ to be an upper half plane $\{\left(x,\varPhi\right)\in\mathbb{R}^2\,|\,\varPhi&gt;0\}$, with points in which $\varPhi^2=h(x)$ being removed, equipped with metric $g_h=\left[\left(h(x)-\varPhi^2\right)^2dx^2+d\varPhi^2\right]/\varPhi^2$. A non-trivial character of the presented result stems from the fact that $g_h$ is solely defined in terms of the function $h(x)$.
  I also show that a local diffeomorphism between $\mathbb{M}_h$ and Poincar\'e upper half plane $\mathbb{H}$ is induced by any pair of linearly independent solutions of $u''\!\left(x\right)+h\left(x\right)u\left(x\right)=0$. If this pair is selected to be $u_\mathtt{top}(x)$ and $u_\mathtt{bot}(x)$, the associate geodesic curve $\Phi(x)$ is mapped to a vertical geodesic curve on $\mathbb{H}$.
  Thus, I establish a link between linear second order ordinary differential equations and two dimensional hyperbolic geometry.</description>

      <title>Linear operators preserving volume polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study linear operators preserving the property of being a volume polynomial. More, precisely we show that a linear operator preserves this property if the associated symbol is itself a volume polynomial. This can be seen as an analogue to theorems by Borcea-Br\"and\'en and Br\"and\'en-Huh for stable polynomials and Lorentzian polynomials, respectively.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Weyl functions in the class of operator-valued generalized Nevanlinna functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.06931v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for a generalized Nevanlinna function $Q$ ($Q\in N_{\kappa }\left( \mathcal{H} \right)$) to be a Weyl function (also known as a Weyl-Titchmarch function).
  We also investigate an important subclass of $N_{\kappa }(\mathcal{H})$, the functions that have a boundedly invertible derivative at infinity $Q'\left( \infty \right):=\lim \limits_{z \to \infty}{zQ(z)}$. These functions are regular and have the operator representation $Q\left( z \right)=\tilde{\Gamma}^{+}\left( A-z \right)^{-1}\tilde{\Gamma},z\in \rho \left( A \right)$, where $A$ is a bounded self-adjoint operator in a Pontryagin space $\mathcal{K}$. We prove that every such strict function $Q$ is a Weyl function associated with the symmetric operator $S:=A_{\vert (I-P)\mathcal{K}}$, where $P$ is the orthogonal projection, $P:=\tilde{\Gamma} \left( \tilde{\Gamma}^{+} \tilde{\Gamma} \right)^{-1} \tilde{\Gamma}^{+} $.
  Additionally, we provide the relation matrices of the adjoint relation $S^{+}$ of $S$, and of $\hat{A}$, where $\hat{A}$ is the representing relation of $\hat{Q}:=-Q^{-1}$. We illustrate our results through examples, wherein we begin with a given function $Q\in N_{\kappa }\left( \mathcal{H} \right)$ and proceed to determine the closed symmetric linear relation $S$ and the boundary triple $\Pi$ so that $Q$ becomes the Weyl function associated with $\Pi$.</description>

      <title>Multiple orthogonal polynomial ensembles of derivative type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the biorthogonal ensembles that are both a multiple orthogonal polynomial ensemble and a polynomial ensemble of derivative type (also called a P\'olya ensemble). We focus on the two notions of derivative type that typically appear in connection with the squared singular values of products of invertible random matrices and the eigenvalues of sums of Hermitian random matrices. Essential in the characterization is the use of the Mellin and Laplace transform: we show that the derivative type structure, which is a priori analytic in nature, becomes algebraic after applying the appropriate transform. Afterwards, we explain how these notions of derivative type can be used to provide a partial solution to an open problem related to orthogonality of the finite finite free multiplicative and additive convolution from finite free probability. In particular, we obtain families of multiple orthogonal polynomials that (de)compose naturally using these convolutions.</description>

      <title>Q-operators for the Ruijsenaars model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Ruijsenaars model admits a one-parameter commuting family of Q-operators. The commutativity is equivalent to an elliptic hypergeometric integral transformation that was conjectured by Gadde et al., and has an alternative interpretation in terms of S-duality for quiver gauge theories. We present two proofs of this conjecture, one using the elliptic Macdonald polynomials of Langmann et al., and one using known results on elliptic hypergeometric integrals. We also explain how the Noumi-Sano operators appear as degenerations of Q-operators.</description>

      <title>On the area of polynomial lemniscates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Erd\"os posed in 1940 the extremal problem of studying the minimal area of the lemniscate $\{|p(z)|&lt;1\}$ of a monic polynomial $p$ of degree $n$ all of whose zeros are in the closed unit disc. In this article, we prove that there exist positive constants $c,C$ independent of the degree $n$ such that \[ \dfrac{c}{\log n} \leq \min \text{Area}( \{ |p(z)|&lt;1 \} ) \leq \frac{C}{\log \log n},\] improving substantially the previously best known lower bound (due to Pommerenke in 1961) as well as improving the best known upper bound (due to Wagner in 1988). We also study the inradius (radius of the largest inscribed disc); we provide an estimate for the inradius in terms of the area that confirms a 2009 conjecture of Solynin and Williams, and we use this to give a lower bound of order $(n \sqrt{\log n})^{-1}$ on the inradius, addressing a 1958 problem posed by Erd\"os, Herzog, and Piranian (confirming their conjecture up to the logarithmic factor). In addition to studying the area of $\{|p(z)|&lt;1\}$, we consider other sublevel sets $\{|p(z)|&lt;t\}$, proving both upper and lower bounds of the same order $1/\log \log n$ when $t&gt;1$ and proving power law upper and lower bounds when $0&lt;t&lt;1$. We also consider the minimal area problem under a more general constraint, namely, replacing the unit disc with a compact set $K$ of unit capacity, where we show that the minimal area converges to zero as $n \rightarrow \infty$ (giving an affirmative answer to another question of Erd\"os, Herzog, Piranian); we also investigate the structure of the area minimizing polynomials, showing that the normalized zero-counting measure converges to the equilibrium measure of $K$ as the degree $n \rightarrow \infty$.</description>

      <title>Relaxation equations with stretched non-local operators and renewal processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study renewal processes defined by means of extensions of the standard relaxation equation through ``stretched" non-local operators (of order $\alpha$ and with parameter $\gamma$). In a first case we obtain a generalization of the fractional Poisson process, which displays either infinite or finite expected waiting times between arrivals, depending on the parameter $\gamma$. In the long run, the latter is proved to control also the memory property of the process, which, in some cases, is long-range dependent. We then consider a second-order relaxation-type equation involving the same operator, under different sets of conditions on the constants involved, and prove that the corresponding renewal processes are linked to the previous one either by convolution or by convex combination of the distributions. We discuss also time-change representations of these models, in terms of the inverse of a non-decreasing process which generalizes the $\alpha$-stable L\'{e}vy subordinator.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Reifenberg theorem for measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:1612.08052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study generalizations of Reifenberg's Theorem for measures in $\mathbb R^n$ under assumptions on the Jones' $\beta$-numbers, which appropriately measure how close the support is to being contained in a subspace. Our main results, which holds for general measures without density assumptions, give effective measure bounds on $\mu$ away from a closed $k$-rectifiable set with bounded Hausdorff measure. We show examples to see the sharpness of our results. Under further density assumptions one can translate this into a global measure bound and $k$-rectifiable structure for $\mu$. Applications include quantitative Reifenberg theorems on sets and discrete measures, as well as upper Ahlfor's regularity estimates on measures which satisfy $\beta$-number estimates on all scales.</description>

      <title>The P\'olya-Tchebotarev problem with semiclassical external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical P\'olya-Tchebotarev problem, commonly stated as a max-min logarithmic energy problem, asks for finding a compact of minimal capacity in the complex plane which connects a prescribed collection of fixed points. Variants of this problem have found ramifications and applications in the theory of non-hermitian orthogonal polynomials, random matrices, approximation theory, among others. Here we consider an extension of this classical problem, including a semiclassical external field, and enforcing finitely many prescribed collections of points to be connected, possibly also to infinity. Our method is based on Rakhmanov's approach to max-min problems in logarithmic potential theory, utilizes the developed machinery by Mart\'inez-Finkelshtein and Rakhmanov on critical measures, and extends the development of Kuijlaars and the second named author from the context of polynomial external fields to the semiclassical case considered here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate variants of Marstrand's projection theorem that hold for sets of directions and classes of sets in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We say that a set of directions $D \subseteq\mathcal{S}^1$ is $\textit{universal}$ for a class of sets if, for every set $E$ in the class, there is a direction $e\in D$ such that the projection of $E$ in the direction $e$ has maximal Hausdorff dimension. We construct small universal sets for certain classes. Particular attention is paid to the role of regularity. We prove the existence of universal sets with arbitrarily small positive Hausdorff dimension for the class of weakly regular sets. We prove that there is a universal set of zero Hausdorff dimension for the class of AD-regular sets.</description>

      <title>Completeness of sparse, almost integer and finite local complexity sequences of translates in $L^p(\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A real sequence $\Lambda = \{\lambda_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is called $p$-generating if there exists a function $g$ whose translates $\{g(x-\lambda_n)\}_{n=1}^\infty$ span the space $L^p(\mathbb{R})$. While the $p$-generating sets were completely characterized for $p=1$ and $p&gt;2$, the case $1 &lt; p \le 2$ remains not well understood. In this case, both the size and the arithmetic structure of the set play an important role. In the present paper, (i) We show that a $p$-generating set $\Lambda$ of positive real numbers can be very sparse, namely, the ratios $\lambda_{n+1} / \lambda_n$ may tend to $1$ arbitrarily slowly; (ii) We prove that every "almost integer" sequence $\Lambda$, i.e. satisfying $\lambda_n = n + \alpha_n$, $0 \neq \alpha_n \to 0$, is $p$-generating; and (iii) We construct $p$-generating sets $\Lambda$ such that the successive differences $\lambda_{n+1} - \lambda_n$ attain only two different positive values. The constructions are, in a sense, extreme: it is well known that $\Lambda$ cannot be Hadamard lacunary and cannot be contained in any arithmetic progression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove essentially optimal $L^p(\mathbb{R})$-estimates for variational variants of the maximal Fourier multiplier operators considered by Bourgain in his work on pointwise convergence of polynomial ergodic averages. As a corollary of our methods, we are able to quickly extend a result of Bourgain, namely the pointwise convergence of ergodic averages of integer parts of real-variables polynomials, to a broader class of functions, previously considered in a wide range of contexts by Boshernitzan-Jones-Wierdl. Namely, the following averages converge almost everywhere \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n \leq N} T^{\lfloor P(n) \rfloor} f, \; \; \; f \in L^p(X,\mu), \ P \in \mathbb{R}[\cdot], \] for any $\sigma$-finite measure space equipped with a measure-preserving transformation, $T:X \to X$, whenever $1 &lt; p \leq \infty$ if $P$ is linear, and $4/3 &lt; p \leq \infty$ otherwise.</description>
