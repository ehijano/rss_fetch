      <title>Exceptional X-ray activity in BL Lacertae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BL Lacertae is a unique blazar for which the X-ray band can cover either the synchrotron or the inverse Compton, or both parts of the broadband spectral energy distribution. In the latter case, when the spectral upturn is located in the X-ray range, it allows contemporaneous study of the low- and high-energy ends of the electron distribution function. In this work, we study spectral and temporal variability using X-ray and optical observations of the blazar performed with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory from 2020 to 2023. The large set of observational data reveals intensive flaring activity, accompanied by spectral changes in both spectral branches.
  We conclude that the low-energy and high-energy ends of the particle distribution function are characterised by similar variability scales. Additionally, the hard X-ray observations of BL Lacertae performed with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) confirm a concave spectral curvature for some epochs of the blazar activity and reveal that it can be shifted up to energies of as high as 8 keV. The time-resolved spectral analysis allows us to disentangle X-ray spectral variability features of the synchrotron from inverse Compton components.
  Despite significant variability of both spectral components, we find only small changes in the position of the spectral upturn. The different slopes and shapes of the X-ray spectrum of BL Lacertae demonstrate that the classification of this source is not constant, and BL Lacertae can exhibit features of either high-, intermediate-, or low-energy peaked blazar in different epochs of observation. This also indicates that the spectral upturn for this blazar can be located not only in the X-ray range of 0.3-10 keV, but also at lower or higher energies.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray bursts: what do we know today that we did not know 10 years ago?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I discuss here the progress made in the last decade on few of the key open problems in GRB physics. These include: (1) the nature of GRB progenitors, and the outliers found to the collapsar/merger scenarios; (2) Jet structures, whose existence became evident following GRB/GW170817; (3) the great progress made in understanding the GRB jet launching mechanisms, enabled by general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GR-MHD) codes; (4) recent studies of magnetic reconnection as a valid energy dissipation mechanism; (5) the early afterglow, which may be highly affected by a wind bubble, as well as recent indication that in many GRBs, the Lorentz factor is only a few tens, rather than few hundreds. I highlight some recent observational progress, including major breakthrough in detecting TeV photons and the on-going debate about their origin, polarization measurements, as well as the pair annihilation line recently detected in GRB 221009A, and its implications on the prompt emission physics. I point into some open questions that I anticipate would be at the forefront of GRB research in the next decade.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the search for dark matter subhalos using the Fermi-LAT 4FGL-DR4 catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations suggest that dark matter halos surrounding galaxies host numerous small subhalos, which might be detectable by the Fermi-LAT. In this work, we revisit the search for gamma-ray subhalo candidates using the latest Fermi-LAT 4FGL-DR4 catalog. The search is performed by fitting the spectral data of unassociated point sources in the catalog through an unbinned maximum likelihood method. We consider two models in the fitting. One is an empirical function provided by the catalog, and another is a DM model in which DM particles within nearby subhalos annihilate into gamma rays and other Standard Model particles. Based on the fitting results, we identify 32 candidates for which the maximum likelihood value of the DM model fit exceeds that of the empirical function fit. The estimated J-factors of these candidates range from $0.2$ to $5.8 \times 10^{20}\,{\rm GeV^{2}\,cm^{-5}}$, the DM particle masses vary from $30$ to $500\,{\rm GeV}$ and 12 of them are within the range of $[30, 80]\,{\rm GeV}$. Candidate 4FGL J2124.2+1531 is an exception with a J-factor of $4.52 \times 10^{21}\,{\rm GeV^{2}\,cm^{-5}}$ and a particle mass of $3108.44\,{\rm GeV}$. Interestingly, the identified candidates do not overlap with those reported in previous works, and we discuss the possible reasons for the discrepancy. At the current stage, we cannot rule out the possibility that these candidates are gamma-ray pulsars, and further confirmation through multi-band observations is required.</description>

      <title>Identifying New $\gamma$-Ray Sources in All-Sky Surveys Based on Fermipy's Advanced Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ an efficient method for identifying gamma-ray sources across the entire sky, leveraging advanced algorithms from Fermi p y, and cleverly utilizing the Galactic diffuse background emission model to partition the entire sky into 72 regions,thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of discovering new sources throughout the sky through multi-threaded parallel computing. After confirming the reliability of the new method, we applied it for the first time to analyze data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope encompassing approximately 15.41yr of all sky surveys.
  Through this analysis, we successfully identified 1379 new sources with levels exceeding 4sigma, of which 497 sources exhibited higher significance levels exceeding 5sigma. Subsequently, we performed a systematic analysis of the spatial extension, spectra, and light variation characteristics of these newly identified sources. We identified 21 extended sources and 23 sources exhibiting spectral curvature above 10GeV. Additionally, we identified 44 variable sources above 1GeV.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the memory and dynamical stability of magnetar bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time series of energy and waiting time of magnetar bursts carry important information about the source activity. In this paper, we investigate the memory and dynamical stability of magnetar bursts from four soft gamma repeater (SGR) sources: SGR 1806$-$20, SGR 1900+14, SGR J1935+2154 and SGR J1550$-$5418. Based on the rescaled range analysis, we quantify the memory in magnetar bursts for the first time and find that there exists long-term memory in the time series of both waiting time and energy. We investigate the dynamical stability in the context of randomness and chaos. For all the four SGR samples, we find that the waiting time is not completely random, but the energy of two SGRs is consistent with a total random organization. Furthermore, both waiting time and energy exhibits weak chaos. We also find no significant difference between SGRs and repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) in the randomness-chaos phase space. The statistical similarity between SGRs and repeating FRBs hints that there may be potential physical connection between these two phenomena.</description>

      <title>An attempt to study axion-photon coupling using compact binary systems with high Shapiro time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the axion-photon conversion process in pulsar binary systems with high Shapiro time delay. In these binary systems, the orbital plane is nearly parallel to the line of sight. When the companion star is positioned between the pulsar and the Earth, the pulsar radiation beam will pass through the companion's magnetic field, potentially leading to axion-photon conversion that affects the intensity and linear polarization of the photons. The advantage of using such systems for axion or axion-like particle (ALP) research is that the intrinsic intensity and polarization state of the source photons can be well determined. This work analyzes the axion-photon conversion and the magnetic field along the photon path, establishing the corresponding model and solving it numerically. We choose PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J1910-5959A for our study. By assuming the companion's magnetic field, magnetic axis angle, and detector sensitivity, we discuss the feasibility of using high Shapiro delay binary systems to constrain the axion/ALP parameter space. We find that the upper limits derived from these two sources are weaker then existing constraints. However, considering the higher reliability, the method proposed in this work is still valuable. As more suitable samples and richer observational results are discovered, further constraints on the axion parameters could be strengthened.</description>

      <title>Jet formation studies in AGN: a search for new targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the jet formation region in active galaxies has been imaged through mm-VLBI in few ideal targets, first and foremost M87. An important leap forward for understanding jet launching could be made by identifying a larger number of suitable objects, characterized by different accretion modes and jet powers. In this article, we present 1 cm and 7 mm VLBI data of a sample of 16 poorly explored radio galaxies, comprising both High-Excitation (HEG) and Low-Excitation Galaxies (LEG) and spanning a large range in radio power. The combination of the sources vicinity (z&lt;0.1) with a large black hole mass ($\log{M_{\rm BH}}$&gt;8.5) results in a high spatial resolution in units of Schwarzschild radii ($&lt;10^3-10^4$ $R_{\rm S}$), necessary for probing the region where the jet is initially accelerated and collimated. We aim at identifying the best candidates for follow-up observations with current and future VLBI facilities. The observations were performed with the High Sensitivity Array, including Effelsberg and the phased-VLA, which has allowed us to characterize the sub-parsec properties of these faint jets and to estimate their core brightness temperature and orientation. The number of sources imaged on scales $\lesssim 10^3$ $R_{\rm S}$ is more than doubled by our study. All targets were detected at both frequencies, and several present two-sided jet structures. Several LEG jets show hints of limb-brightening. The core brightness temperatures are generally below the equipartition value, indicating that equipartition has not yet been reached and/or that the emission is de-boosted. Among LEG, we identify 3C31, 3C66B, and 3C465 as the most promising, combining a relatively high flux density (&gt;50 mJy) with superb spatial resolution (&lt;500 $R_{\rm S}$) at 7 mm. The powerful HEG 3C452 is interesting as well due to its highly symmetric, two-sided jet base.</description>

      <title>Search for the multiwavelength counterparts to extragalactic unassociated Fermi {\gamma}-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. In this paper, we searched for multi-wavelength (X-ray, optical and radio) counterparts to the unassociated gamma-ray sources (UGS) of the Fermi 4FGL-DR4 catalog. The main goal is to identify new blazars and/or new active galactic nuclei (AGNs) emitting at GeV energies [like (Narrow Line) Seyfert-1 and radio galaxies]. Methods. We focus on sky regions observed by the Swift satellite that overlap with the reported positions of the UGSs. Since our primary interest lies in extra-galactic sources, we focus on UGSs located outside the Galactic plane (|b| &gt; 10$^{\circ}$). Due to the large number of sources (about 1800 UGS), we developed a pipeline to automatise the search for counterparts and significantly reduce the computational time for the analysis. Our association process begins by identifying potential X-ray counterparts for each UGS; if one is found, we further look for corresponding radio and optical counterparts in the X-ray counterpart error box, thus minimizing ambiguities. Results. Out of the 1284 UGSs in the 4FGL-DR4 catalog, 714 were observed at least once by Swift/XRT. We detected, with a significance of $\geq$ 3$\sigma$, at least one X-ray source within the Fermi error box for 274 of these $\gamma$-ray emitters. Among these, 193 UGSs have a single potential X-ray counterpart (referred to as UGS1), while 81 have multiple potential X-ray counterparts within the Fermi error box (referred to as UGS2). Of the UGS2, 54 have two X-ray counterparts, 11 have three, and the remaining 16 have more than three. Each UGS1 has an optical counterpart, and 113 also could be associated to a radio counterpart. We performed a comparison of the possible counterpart properties with those of the $\gamma$-ray emitters identified by Fermi, with the aim to assess the goodness of our associations.</description>

      <title>GRB multi-TeV detection: Beyond standard physics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detection by LHAASO up to 18 TeV of the gamma ray burst GRB 221009A at redshift $z = 0.151$ challenges standard physics because of the strong absorption due to the extragalactic background light (EBL) for photons with energies above 10 TeV. Emission models partially avoiding EBL absorption proposed to explain such an event are unsatisfactory since they require peculiar and contrived assumptions. By introducing in magnetized media the interaction of photons with axion-like particles (ALPs) - which are a generic prediction of most theories extending the standard model of particle physics towards a more satisfying theory - the detection of GRB 221009A can be naturally explained, thereby providing a strong hint at ALP existence.</description>

      <title>Quasi-steady emission from repeating fast radio bursts can be explained by magnetar wind nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among over 1000 known fast radio bursts (FRBs), only three sources - FRB 121102 (R1), FRB 190520 (R2) and FRB 201124 (R3) - have been linked to persistent radio sources (PRS). The observed quasi-steady emission is consistent with synchrotron radiation from a composite of magnetar wind nebula (MWN) and supernova (SN) ejecta. We compute the synchrotron flux by solving kinetic equations for energized electrons, considering electromagnetic cascades of electron-positron pairs interacting with nebular photons. For rotation-powered model, a young neutron star (NS) with age $t_{\rm age}\approx 20\,{\rm yr}$, dipolar magnetic field $B_{\rm dip}\approx (3-5)\times10^{12}\,{\rm G}$ and spin period $P_i\approx 1.5-3\,{\rm ms}$ in an ultra-stripped SN progenitor can account for emissions from R1 and R2. In contrast, R3 requires $t_{\rm age}\approx 10\,{\rm yr}$, $B_{\rm dip}\approx 5.5\times10^{13}\,{\rm G}$ and $P_i\approx 10\,{\rm ms}$ in a conventional core-collapse SN progenitor. For magnetar-flare-powered model, NS aged $t_{\rm age} \approx 25\,/40\,{\rm yr}$ in a USSN progenitor and $t_{\rm age} \approx 12.5\,{\rm yr}$ in a CCSN progenitor explains the observed flux for R1/R2 and R3, respectively. Finally, we constrain the minimum NS age $t_{\rm age,min} \sim 1-3\,{\rm yr}$ from the near-source plasma contribution to observed DM, and $t_{\rm age,min} \sim 6.5-10\,{\rm yr}$ based on the absence of radio signal attenuation.</description>

      <title>The possible long-term periodic variability of the extremely luminous quasar WISE J090924.01+000211.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extremely luminous infrared galaxy (ELIRG), WISE J090924.01+000211.1 (hereafter; WISE J0909+0002, $z=1.87$) is an extraordinary object with a quasar aspect. This study performs monitoring observations of WISE J0909+0002 with the 105 cm Murikabushi telescope, Okayama and Akeno 50 cm telescopes/MITSuME ($g'$, $R_{\rm c}$, and $I_{\rm c}$ bands), and the SaCRA 55 cm telescope/MuSaSHI ($r$, $i$, and $z$ bands). We obtain the following results by combining the UV/optical light curves of the CRTS, Pan-STARRS, and ZTF archive data, and our observational data: (1) the light curves of WISE J0909+0002 present quasi-periodic (sinusoidal) oscillations with the rest-frame period of $\sim$ 660$-$689 day; (2) the structure functions of WISE J0909+0002 do not show a damped random walk (DRW) trend; (3) the mock DRW light curves present periodic-like trend on rare occasions in 10000 simulations; (4) the relativistic boost scenario is favored, since the relation between variability amplitude and power-law slope ratio is consistent with the theoretical prediction of this scenario, and a substantial parameter space exists between the inclination angles and the black hole mass; (5) the circumbinary disk model is difficult to explain the spectral energy distribution of our target; (6) the significant radio flux density of WISE J0909+0002 is not detected from the VLA FIRST Survey, thus the radio jet precession scenario is ruled out. From our results, the Doppler boost scenario is likely as a cause of the periodic variability, consequently the quasi-periodic oscillations in WISE J0909+0002 is possibly interpreted by a supermassive blackhole binary. Additional observations to investigate the continuity of the periodic trend would bring new insights into mechanisms of the quasi-periodic oscillations and/or ELIRGs.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of black holes embedded in halos of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the (axial) quasinormal modes of black holes embedded in generic matter profiles. Our results reveal that the axial QNMs experience a redshift when the black hole is surrounded by various matter environments, proportional to the compactness of the matter halo. Our calculations demonstrate that for static black holes embedded in galactic matter distributions, there exists a universal relation between the matter environment and the redshifted vacuum quasinormal modes. In particular, for dilute environments the leading order effect is a redshift $1+U$ of frequencies and damping times, with $U \sim -{\cal C}$ the Newtonian potential of the environment at its center, which scales with its compactness ${\cal C}$.</description>

Abstract: First stars powered by dark matter (DM) heating instead of fusion can appear in the early Universe from theories of new physics. These dark stars (DSs) can be significantly larger and cooler than early Population III stars, and could seed supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We show that neutrino emission from supermassive DSs provides a novel window into probing SMBH progenitors. We estimate first DS constraints using data from Super-Kamiokande and IceCube neutrino experiments, and consistent with James Webb Space Telescope observations. Upcoming neutrino telescopes offer distinct opportunities to further explore DS properties.</description>

      <title>Proton Flux Measurement from Neutron Monitor Data Using Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Accurate measurements of cosmic ray proton flux are crucial for studying the modulation processes of cosmic rays during the solar activity cycle. We present a proton flux measurement method based on ground-based neutron monitor (NM) data and machine learning techniques. After preprocessing the NM data, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to simulate the relationship between the NM observations and proton flux measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02). We obtain daily proton flux data ranging from 1GV to 100GV for the period from 2011 to 2024, showing that the measured values are in good agreement with the observed ones. In particular, we provide daily proton flux measurements for periods when AMS-02 data are unavailable due to operational reasons. We also perform wavelet analyses on the continuous proton flux data to investigate the relationship between proton flux and solar activity variations, particularly during late 2014 when AMS-02 measurements were missing.</description>

      <title>Predicting Accurate X-ray Absorption Spectra for CN$^+$, CN$^\bullet$, and CN$^-$: Insights from First-Principles Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is an essential tool in X-ray astronomy, enabling detailed studies of celestial objects and their physical and chemical properties. However, comprehensive mapping of high-resolution X-ray spectra for even simple interstellar and circumstellar molecules is still lacking. In this study, we conducted systematic quantum chemical simulations to predict the C1s X-ray absorption spectra of CN$^+$, CN, and CN$^-$. Our findings provide valuable references for both X-ray astronomy and laboratory studies. We assigned the first electronic peak of CN$^+$ and CN to C1s $\rightarrow \sigma^*$ transitions, while the peak for CN$^-$ corresponds to a C1s $\rightarrow \pi^*$ transition. We further calculated the vibronic fine structures for these transitions using the quantum wavepacket method based on multiconfigurational-level, anharmonic potential energy curves, revealing distinct energy positions for the 0-0 absorptions at 280.7 eV, 279.6 eV, and 285.8 eV. Each vibronic profile features a prominent 0-0 peak, showing overall similarity but differing intensity ratios of the 0-0 and 0-1 peaks. Notably, introducing a C1s core hole leads to shortened C-N bond lengths and increased vibrational frequencies across all species. These findings enhance our understanding of the electronic structures and X-ray spectra of carbon-nitrogen species, emphasizing the influence of charge state on X-ray absorptions.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting the dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Hongmeng mission using the 21 cm global spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter is believed to account for a significant portion of the mass in the universe, exerting a critical influence on the formation and evolution of cosmic structures. This research delves into the processes of annihilation and decay of dark matter particles, which generate observable signals that deepen our comprehension of their characteristics and behaviors. Furthermore, the study explores the potential role of primordial black holes, with a focus on the emissions of Hawking radiation that could offer valuable insights into their distribution and size range. A key aspect of this investigation revolves around the 21 cm signal, a vital tool for scrutinizing the effects of dark matter particles and primordial black hole phenomena on the intergalactic medium. The upcoming Hongmeng mission, featuring a lunar orbital interferometer array, is poised to revolutionize our ability to observe the 21 cm signal. By conducting measurements devoid of atmospheric disturbances, the mission will significantly boost sensitivity to subtle signals associated with dark matter particle annihilation, decay, and primordial black hole emissions. This study assesses the expected performance of the Hongmeng mission in detecting these telltale signs and aims to unveil fresh insights into the nature and interactions of dark matter particles and primordial black hole emissions through a meticulous analysis of the global 21 cm spectrum. The mission holds immense promise for reshaping our understanding of the universe's concealed components.</description>

      <title>Impacts of dineutrons on nuclear compositions and neutrino reactions of the core-collapse supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nuclear compositions and neutrino reaction rates in the central region of the core-collapse supernova, assuming the existence of dineutrons ($^2n$) and tetraneutrons ($^4n$). At 100 ms after core bounce, $^2n$ and $^4n$ are more abundant than deuterons within radii of approximately 100 km and 50 km, respectively. Compared to the model ignoring the existence of $^2n$ and $^4n$, the mass fraction of neutrons up to a radius of 100 km reduces. Hence, the neutrino absorption and antineutrino emission rates decrease by approximately 40%-50%. Conversely, those of protons, deuterons, and $^4He$ increase, leading to the increase in the neutrino emission and antineutrino absorption rates by approximately eight times within a radius of 100 km.</description>

      <title>Solar Gamma-Ray Evidence for a Distinct Population of $&gt;$ 1 MeV Flare-Accelerated Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant improvements in our understanding of nuclear $\gamma$-ray line production and instrument performance allow us to better characterize the continuum emission from electrons at energies $\gtrsim$ 300 keV during solar flares. We represent this emission by the sum of a power-law extension of hard X-rays (PL) and a power law times an exponential function (PLexp). We fit the $\gamma$-ray spectra in 25 large flares observed by SMM, RHESSI, and Fermi with this summed continuum along with calculated spectra of all known nuclear components. The PL, PLexp, and nuclear components are separated spectroscopically. A distinct origin of the PLexp is suggested by significant differences between its time histories and those of the PL and nuclear components. RHESSI imaging/spectroscopy of the 2005 January 20 flare, reveals that the PL and nuclear components come from the footpoints while the PLexp component comes from the corona. While the index and flux of the anisotropic PL component are strongly dependent on the flares' heliocentric angle, the PLexp parameters show no such dependency and are consistent with a component that is isotropic. The PLexp spectrum is flat at low energies and rolls over at a few MeV. Such a shape can be produced by inverse Compton scattering of soft X-rays by 10--20 MeV electrons and by thin-target bremsstrahlung from electrons with a spectrum that peaks between 3 -- 5 MeV, or by a combination of the two processes. These electrons can produce radiation detectable at other wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Remnant masses from 1D+ core-collapse supernovae simulations: bimodal neutron star mass distribution and black holes in the low-mass gap</title>

Abstract: The explosion of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is an extremely challenging problem, and there are still large uncertainties regarding which stars lead to successful explosions that leave behind a neutron star, and which ones will form a black hole instead. In this paper, we simulate 341 progenitors at three different metallicities using spherically symmetric simulations that include neutrino-driven convection via a mixing-length theory. We use these simulations to improve previously derived explosion criteria based on the density and entropy profiles of the pre-supernova progenitor. We also provide numerical fits to calculate the final mass of neutron stars based on either compactness, the location of the Si/Si-O interface, or the Chandrasekhar mass. The neutron star birth mass distribution derived from our 1D+ simulations is bimodal, contrary to what the most popular 1D CCSN simulations have shown so far. We compare the theoretically derived neutron star mass distributions with the observed ones and discuss potential implications for population synthesis studies. We also analyze the black hole mass distribution predicted by our simulations. To be consistent with current models of matter ejection in failed SNe, a large fraction of the envelope must be expelled, leading to small black holes in the low-mass gap. One black hole in this mass region has recently been observed in the GW230529 event by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Our results naturally agree with this detection, which the most popular prescriptions for explodability and remnant masses are not able to reproduce. In general, we find that the explosion outcome and mass of the remnant strongly depend on the pre-collapse structure of the progenitor. However, their dependence on the initial mass of the star and the mass of the CO core is highly uncertain and non-linear.</description>

      <title>Repeating Partial Tidal Encounters of Sun-like Stars Leading to their Complete Disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stars grazing supermassive black holes on bound orbits may produce periodic flares over many passages, known as repeating partial tidal disruption events (TDEs). Here, we present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of sun-like stars over multiple tidal encounters. The star is significantly restructured and becomes less concentrated as a result of mass loss and tidal heating. The vulnerability to mass loss depends sensitively on the stellar density structure, and the strong correlation between the fractional mass loss $\Delta M/M_*$ and the ratio of the central and average density $\rho_{\mathrm{c}}/\bar\rho$, which was initially derived in disruption simulations of main-sequence stars, also applies for stars strongly reshaped by tides. Over multiple orbits, the star loses progressively more mass in each encounter and is doomed to a complete disruption. Throughout its lifetime, the star may produce numerous weak flares (depending on the initial impact parameter), followed by a couple of luminous flares whose brightness increases exponentially. Flux-limited surveys are heavily biased toward the brightest flares, which may appear similar to the flare produced by the same star undergoing a full disruption on its first tidal encounter. This places new challenges on constraining the intrinsic TDE rates, which need to take repeating TDEs into account. Other types of stars with different initial density structures (e.g., evolved stars with massive cores) follow distinct evolution tracks, which might explain the diversity of the long-term luminosity evolution seen in recently uncovered repeaters.</description>

      <title>Merging White Dwarf Binaries Produce Type Ia Supernovae in Elliptical Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I find that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with bimodal nebular emission profiles occur almost exclusively in massive ($M_\star \gtrsim 10^{11}~M_\odot$) galaxies with low star-formation rates (SFR~$\lesssim 0.5~M_\odot$/yr). The bimodal profiles are likely produced by two white dwarfs that exploded during a merger or collision, supported by a correlation between the peak-to-peak velocity separation ($v_{\rm sep}$) and the SN Ia peak luminosity ($M_V$) which arises naturally from more massive white dwarf binaries synthesizing more $^{56}$Ni during the explosion. The quiescent hosts are consistent with the long delay times required to form double white dwarf binaries. The distributions of SNe Ia with and without bimodal nebular lines differ in host mass, SFR, and specific SFR with K-S test probabilities of $3.1\%$, $0.03\%$, and $0.02\%$, respectively. Viewing angle effects can fully explain the SNe Ia in quiescent hosts without bimodal emission profiles and the dearth of merger/collision driven SNe Ia in star-forming hosts requires at least two distinct progenitor channels for normal SNe Ia. $30-40\%$ of all SNe Ia originate from mergers or collisions depending on how cleanly host environment distinguishes progenitor scenarios. The bimodal SNe Ia share some characteristics with the underluminous 91bg-like SNe Ia that also prefer older populations, but there is no unambiguous connection between the two classifications. This may suggest separate processes or multiple axes of ejecta (a)symmetry. Existing models for white dwarf mergers and collisions broadly reproduce the $v_{\rm sep} - M_V$ correlation and future analyses may be able to infer the masses/mass-ratios of merging white dwarfs in external galaxies.</description>

      <title>Extracting Astrophysical Information of Highly-Eccentric Binaries in the Millihertz Gravitational Wave Band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wide, highly eccentric ($e&gt;0.9$) compact binaries can naturally arise as progenitors of gravitational wave (GW) mergers. These systems are expected to have a significant population in the mHz band (e.g., $\sim 3-45$ detectable stellar-mass binary black holes with $e&gt;0.9$ in the Milky Way), with their GW signals characterized by "repeated bursts" emitted upon each pericenter passage. In this study, we show that the detection of mHz GW signals from highly eccentric stellar mass binaries in the local universe can strongly constrain their orbital parameters. Specifically, it can achieve a relative measurement error of $\sim 10^{-6}$ for orbital frequency and $\sim 1\%$ for eccentricity (as $1-e$) in most of the detectable cases. On the other hand, the binary's mass ratio, distance, and intrinsic orbital orientation may be less precisely determined due to degeneracies in the GW waveform. We also perform mock LISA data analysis to evaluate the realistic detectability of highly eccentric compact binaries. Our results show that highly eccentric systems could be efficiently identified when multiple GW sources and stationary Gaussian instrumental noise are present in the detector output. This work highlights the potential of extracting the signal of "bursting'' LISA sources to provide valuable insights into their orbital evolution, surrounding environment, and formation channels.</description>

      <title>The properties of the Galactic Hard X-Ray and soft gamma-ray Background based on 20 years of INTEGRAL/IBIS observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results of a study of the Galactic hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray background emission performed with the IBIS telescope aboard the INTEGRAL observatory using data obtained over more than 20 years of operations. The study of the Galactic background at energies between 10 keV and a few MeV is problematic due to the contribution of point sources, high instrumental background and large-scale extent of the emission, which leads to the need of utilizing complex model-dependent methods. Using the unique properties of the IBIS coded-mask telescope, we developed a model-independent approach to study diffuse continuum emission near the Galactic plane in the 25-60, 60-80, and 80-200 keV bands. The comparison of the 25-60 keV longitude profile with the near infrared intensity shows excellent agreement, confirming the stellar origin of the Galactic Ridge X-ray Emission (GRXE). The Galactic X-ray background is significantly detected from the direction of the Galactic bulge up to 200 keV. We built broad-band spectra of the Galactic background in three large regions, the Galactic bulge and two spiral arms at l=+/-20 deg. The spectral analysis reveals two distinct components with a minimum at about 80 keV. The low-energy (&lt;60 keV) component, associated with the GRXE, is consistent with a one-dimensional accretion flow model of intermediate polars with an average white dwarf mass of about 0.7 Msun. The high-energy part of the spectrum, dominating above 60 keV and attributed to the gamma-ray background, is consistent with a power-law model with photon index 1.55. The total 30-80 keV flux budget of 1.5e-9 erg/s/cm^2 observed within the effective IBIS field of view in the Galactic bulge region, consists of 2/3 of GRXE and 1/3 of gamma-ray background.</description>

Abstract: The discrepancy between models and data regarding the muon content in air showers generated by ultra-high energy cosmic rays still needs to be solved. The CONEX simulation framework provides a flexible tool to assess the impact of different interaction properties and thus address the muon puzzle. In this work, we present the multidimensional extension of CONEX and show its performance compared to CORSIKA by discussing muon-related air-shower features for three experiments: KASCADE, IceTop, and the Pierre Auger Observatory. We also implement an effective version of the core-corona model to demonstrate the impact of the core effect, as observed at the LHC, on the muon content in air showers produced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays. At a primary energy of $E_0 = 10^{19}\,$eV, we obtain an increase of $15\%$ to $20\%$ in the muon content.</description>

      <title>A Universal Energy Relation between synchrotron and Synchrotron Self-Compton radiation in GRBs and Blazars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent and brightest GRB 221009A observed by LHAASO marked the first detection of the onset of TeV afterglow, with a total of 7 GRBs exhibiting very high energy (VHE) afterglow radiation. However, consensus on VHE radiation of GRBs is still lacking. Multi-wavelength studies are currently a primary research method for investigating high-energy $\gamma$-ray astronomy. The limited sample of VHE GRBs, combined with their transient nature, hinders the progress of physical studies of GRBs. This paper aims to obtain useful information for GRB research through the properties of blazars, which share significant similarities with GRBs. By fitting high-quality and simultaneous multiwavelength spectral energy distributions with a one-zone leptonic model, the study explores the similarity of radiation properties of blazars and GRBs. A tight correlation between synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission luminosities suggests that blazars and GRBs share similar radiation mechanisms, to be specific, synchrotron radiation produces the observed X-ray photons, which also serve as targets for electrons in the SSC process. We hope that ground-based experiments can observe more GRBs in sub-TeV to confirm these findings.</description>

Abstract: Using tremendous photon statistics gained with the stray light aperture of the NuSTAR telescope over 11 years of operation, we set strong limits on the emission of close to monochromatic photons from the radiative decays of putative dark matter sterile neutrinos in the Milky Way. In the energy range of 3-20 keV covered by the NuSTAR, the obtained limits reach the bottom edge of theoretical predictions of realistic models where sterile neutrinos are produced in the early Universe. Only a small region is left to explore, if the sterile neutrinos form the entire dark matter component.</description>
