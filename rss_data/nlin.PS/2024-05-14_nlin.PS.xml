      <title>Interactions between fractional solitons in bimodal fiber cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a system of fractional nonlinear Schroedinger equations (FNLSEs) which model the copropagation of optical waves carried by different wavelengths or mutually orthogonal circular polarizations in fiber-laser cavities with the effective fractional group-velocity dispersion (FGVD), which were recently made available to the experiment. In the FNLSE system, the FGVD terms are represented by the Riesz derivatives, with the respective Levy index (LI). The FNLSEs, which include the nonlinear self-phase-modulation (SPM) nonlinearity, are coupled by the cross-phase modulation (XPM) terms, and separated by a group-velocity (GV) mismatch (rapidity). By means of systematic simulations, we analyze collisions and bound states of solitons in the XPM-coupled system, varying the LI and GV mismatch. Outcomes of collisions between the solitons include rebound, conversion of the colliding single-component solitons into a pair of two-component ones, merger of the solitons into a breather, their mutual passage leading to excitation of intrinsic vibrations, and the elastic interaction. Families of stable two-component soliton bound states are constructed too, featuring a rapidity which is intermediate between those of the two components.</description>

      <title>Fine structure of soliton bound states in the parametrically driven, damped nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static soliton bound states in nonlinear systems are investigated analytically and numerically in the framework of the parametrically driven, damped nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We find that the ordinary differential equations, which determine bound soliton solutions, can be transformed into the form resembling the Schr\"odinger-like equations for eigenfunctions with the fixed eigenvalues. We assume that a nonlinear part of the equations is close to the reflectionless potential well occurring in the scattering problem, associated with the integrable equations. We show that symmetric two-hump soliton solution is quite well described analytically by the three-soliton formula with the fixed soliton parameters, depending on the strength of parametric pumping and the dissipation constant.</description>

      <title>Birth, interactions, and evolution over topography of solitons in Serre-Green-Naghdi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New evidence of surprising robustness of solitary-wave solutions of the Serre-Green-Naghdi (SGN) equations is presented on the basis of high-resolution numerical simulations conducted using a novel well-balanced finite-volume method. SGN solitons exhibit a striking resemblance with their celebrated Korteweg-deVries (KdV) counterparts. Co-moving solitons are shown to exit intact from double and triple collisions with a remarkably small wave-wake residual. The counter-propagating solitons experiencing frontal collisions and solitons hitting a wall, non-existing in KdV case configurations, are shown to also recover, but with a much larger than in co-moving case residual, confirming with higher precision the results known in the literature. Multiple SGN solitons emerging from localized initial conditions are exhibited, and it is demonstrated that SGN solitons survive hitting localized topographic obstacles, and generate secondary solitons when they encounter a rising escarpment.</description>

      <title>Gravitational influence of Saturn's rings on its moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploratory missions have found that regolith on interplanetary bodies can be loosely packed and freely flowing, a state that strongly affects mission plans and that may also influence the large scale shapes of these bodies. We investigate whether notable circumferential ridges seen on Saturn's moons may be a byproduct of free flow of loosely packed regolith. Such ridges and other features likely record the history of the moons, and we find that if surface grains are freely flowing, then the combined gravity of Saturn itself and its tenuous ring generate similar circumferential features. Moreover, analysis of these features reveals the possibility of previously unreported morphologies, for example a stationary torus around a non rotating satellite. Some of these features persist even for a very low density and distant disk. This raises the prospect that nonlinear analysis of interactions from disks to moons and back again may lead to new insights.</description>

      <title>Stable-fixed-point description of square-pattern formation in driven two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate pattern formation in two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) caused by periodic driving of the interatomic interaction. We show that this modulation generically leads to a stable square grid density pattern, due to nonlinear effects beyond the initial Faraday instability. We take the amplitudes of two waves parametrizing the two-dimensional density pattern as order parameters in pattern formation. For these amplitudes, we derive a set of coupled time evolution equations from the Gross--Pitaevskii (GP) equation with a time-periodic interaction. We identify the fixed points of the time evolution and show by stability analysis that the inhomogeneous density exhibits a square grid pattern, which can be understood as a manifestation of a stable fixed point. Our stability analysis establishes the pattern in BECs as a nonequilibrium steady state.</description>
