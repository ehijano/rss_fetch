      <title>Data-driven sequential analysis of tipping in high-dimensional complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abrupt transitions ("tipping") in nonlinear dynamical systems are often accompanied by changes in the geometry of the attracting set, but quantifying such changes from partial and noisy observations in high-dimensional systems remains challenging. We address this problem with a sequential diagnostic framework, Data Assimilation-High dimensional Attractor's Structural Complexity (DA-HASC). First, this method reconstructs system's high-dimensional state using data assimilation from limited and noisy observations. Second, we quantify a structural complexity of the high-dimensional system dynamics from the reconstructed state by manifold learning. Third, we capture underlying changes in the system by splitting the reconstructed timeseries into sliding windows and analyzing the changes in the temporally local attractor's structural complexity. The structural information is provided as graph Laplacian and measured by Von Neumann entropy in this framework. We evaluate DA-HASC on both synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate that it can detect tipping under high-dimensionality and imperfect system knowledge. We further discuss how this framework behaves across different tipping mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Distillation and Interpretability of Ensemble Forecasts of ENSO Phase using Entropic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a distillation framework for an ensemble of entropy-optimal Sparse Probabilistic Approximation (eSPA) models, trained exclusively on satellite-era observational and reanalysis data to predict ENSO phase up to 24 months in advance. While eSPA ensembles yield state-of-the-art forecast skill, they are harder to interpret than individual eSPA models. We show how to compress the ensemble into a compact set of "distilled" models by aggregating the structure of only those ensemble members that make correct predictions. This process yields a single, diagnostically tractable model for each forecast lead time that preserves forecast performance while also enabling diagnostics that are impractical to implement on the full ensemble.
  An analysis of the regime persistence of the distilled model "superclusters", as well as cross-lead clustering consistency, shows that the discretised system accurately captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of ENSO. By considering the effective dimension of the feature importance vectors, the complexity of the input space required for correct ENSO phase prediction is shown to peak when forecasts must cross the boreal spring predictability barrier. Spatial importance maps derived from the feature importance vectors are introduced to identify where predictive information resides in each field and are shown to include known physical precursors at certain lead times. Case studies of key events are also presented, showing how fields reconstructed from distilled model centroids trace the evolution from extratropical and inter-basin precursors to the mature ENSO state. Overall, the distillation framework enables a rigorous investigation of long-range ENSO predictability that complements real-time data-driven operational forecasts.</description>

      <title>Seismic quiescence and activation prior to the 2025 M8.8 Kamchatka, Russia earthquake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 29 July 2025 Kamchatka earthquake, of magnitude M8.8 in the Kamchatka-Kuril subduction system, provides a unique opportunity to investigate the preparatory processes of a great subduction event. Despite Kamchatka's high seismic activity, the long-term evolution of seismicity preceding major ruptures has been poorly documented. Identifying temporal patterns-such as multiyear quiescence and short-term activation-is essential for understanding megathrust failure processes. We applied the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model and change-point analysis to earthquakes with M5 or larger within a 100-km radius of the 2025 mainshock epicenter, using the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) catalog spanning 1975-2025. This approach quantified temporal variations in the seismicity rate and detected statistically significant change points. We found a pronounced approximately 20-year quiescent interval beginning around mid-2003, followed by an abrupt activation that commenced with the M7.4 foreshock on 20 July 2025. Similar quiescence-to-activation sequences near the eventual hypocenter have been reported in previous studies for the 1997 M7.8 Kronotsky and 2006 M8.3 Simushirskoe earthquakes, which ruptured segments immediately north and south of the 2025 rupture, respectively. Together with these earlier studies, our findings suggest that heightened seismic activity following multiyear quiescence is a recurrent feature of the Kamchatka-Kuril subduction system hosting large megathrust earthquakes. Decadal-scale quiescence has also been reported off Hokkaido, Japan, overlapping the area assessed as having an elevated likelihood of a 17th-century-type M9-class earthquake. Given that Hokkaido is in the Kamchatka-Kuril subduction system, tracking a possible transition from quiescence to activation is important for situational awareness and time-dependent hazard assessment.</description>
