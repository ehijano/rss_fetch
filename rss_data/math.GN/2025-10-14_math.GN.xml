      <title>Longest paths in trees and isometricity of ultrametric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a tree of arbitrary finite or infinite order and let $U(T)$ be the set of all ultrametric spaces generated by vertex labelings of $T$. Let ${\bf US}$ denote the class of all ultrametric spaces generated by vertex labelings of star graphs. We prove that the inclusion $U(T)\subseteq {\bf US}$ holds if and only if the longest path in $T$ has a length not exceeding three.</description>

      <title>Plastic metric spaces and groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A metric space is plastic if all its non-expansive bijections are isometries. We prove three main results: (1) every countable dense subspace of a normed space is not plastic, (2) every $k$-crowded separable metric space contains a plastic dense subspace, and (3) every strictly convex separable metric group contains a plastic dense subgroup.</description>

      <title>A density counterpart of the Scheepers covering property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a density counterpart of the Scheepers covering property $\bigcup_{\mathrm{fin}}(\mathcal O,\Omega)$ and study its relations to known combinatorial density property. In particular, we show that it is equivalent to the $M$-separability under the Near Coherence of Filters principle of Blass and Weiss.</description>

      <title>The smallest $n$-pure subtopos and dimension theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of $n$-pure geometric morphism between Grothendieck toposes, over a Grothendieck base topos $\mathcal{T}$. This is a higher-dimensional analogue of the concepts of dense and pure geometric morphism. We extend the construction of the smallest dense subtopos and smallest pure subtopos by constructing a smallest $n$-pure subtopos, for each natural number $n$. Based on this, we then propose a concept of dimension for a Grothendieck topos, in this way also arriving naturally at a distinction between toposes with boundary and toposes without boundary. We show that the zero-dimensional toposes without boundary are precisely the Boolean toposes, and that the topos associated to an $n$-manifold is again $n$-dimensional (with boundary if the manifold has a boundary). Some other toposes for which we calculate the dimension are the topos associated to the rational line and the toposes associated to a right Ore monoid or free monoid. Finally, we move to algebraic geometry: for a scheme $X$ of characteristic $0$ and Krull dimension $d$, we prove that the dimension of the associated petit \'etale topos is $2d$, assuming that $X$ is excellent and regular, or that $X$ is variety. As a first example in mixed characteristic, we show that the petit \'etale topos associated to $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$ is two-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Detecting the real line among one-parametric topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a topological group is isomorphic to the real line if and only if it is a one-parameteric, metrizable, and not monothetic. This result is used in the authors' other paper to prove that one-parametric groups in strictly convex metric group all are topologically isomorphic to the real line.</description>

      <title>Locally compact strictly convex metric groups are abelian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every locally compact strictly convex metric group is abelian, thus answering one problem posed by the authors in their earlir paper. To prove this theorem we first construct the isomorphic embeddings of the real line into the strictly convex metric group using its geodesic properties and charaterization of the real line as a unique not monothetic one-parametric metrizable topological group. We proceed to show that all compact subgroups in a strictly convex metric group are trivial, which combined with the classical result of Iwasawa completes the proof of the main result.</description>

      <title>On covering properties of end and ray spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide new results on combinatorial characterizations of covering properties in end spaces and ray spaces. In particular, we characterize the Lindel\"of degree, the extent, the Rothberger property, $\sigma$-compactness and the Menger property for ray, end and edge-end spaces. We show that $\sigma$-compactness and the Menger property are equivalent for these spaces, and that they are all $D$-spaces.</description>

      <title>A note on adding isomorphisms and the pseudointersection number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every tower $\mathcal T$ there are $\aleph_1$-dense $A$ and $B$ so that any ``reasonable" forcing notion $\mathbb{P}$ -- an adjective that includes all known ones -- for making $A$ and $B$ isomorphic will add a pseudointersection for the tower. This shows in particular that $\mathsf{MA}_{\aleph_1}(\sigma{\rm -centered})$ holds in all known models of $\mathsf{BA}$, which provides intrigue to well known questions of Todor\v{c}evi\'c and Stepr\=ans-Watson.</description>

      <title>Semiframes: the algebra of semitopologies and actionable coalitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce semiframes (an algebraic structure) and investigate their duality with semitopologies (a topological one). Both semitopologies and semiframes are relatively recent developments, arising from a novel application of topological ideas to study decentralised computing systems.
  Semitopologies generalise topology by removing the condition that intersections of open sets are necessarily open. The motivation comes from identifying the notion of an actionable coalition in a distributed system -- a set of participants with sufficient resources for its members to collaborate to take some action -- with open set; since just because two sets are actionable (have the resources to act) does not necessarily mean that their intersection is.
  We define notions of category and morphism and prove a categorical duality between (sober) semiframes and (spatial) semitopologies, and we investigate how key well-behavedness properties that are relevant to understanding decentralised systems, transfer (or do not transfer) across the duality.</description>

      <title>Fine shape of metrizable spaces as a left fraction localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong shape category of compact metrizable spaces (compacta) is very well-studied; extending it to noncompact spaces, however, introduces computational complexity that makes it hard to work with. The fine shape category, as defined by Melikhov, seems to hold promise in terms of both applicability and simplicity: it is a different extension of compact strong shape to a generalized homotopy theory of metrizable spaces that is compatible with both \v{C}ech cohomology and Steenrod-Sitnikov homology, and its definition lends itself to straightforward proofs. Further research seems to be in order. One goal to have in mind is to show the fine shape category to be a homotopy category in Quillen's sense, which implies representation as a localization. But the strong shape of compacta was shown to be a left fraction localization in several ways; we extend the representation given by Cathey to fine shape, introducing the notion of FDR-embeddings to extend Cathey's SSDR-maps. In the process, we also introduce what we call the mapping cylinder of an approaching map; such a construction has been defined by Ferry and elaborated on by Mrozik in the compact case, yet it seems the direct extension on noncompact spaces is not possible. Thus we resort to a somewhat different definition.</description>

      <title>A new characterization of (pre)liminary C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20980v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an arbitrary countable ordinal $\alpha $, we introduce the notion of type $I_{\alpha }$ C*-algebra and $\alpha $-subhomogeneous C*-algebra. When $\alpha =0$, these recover the notions of Fell C*-algebra and of commutative C*-algebra, respectively. When $\alpha = n &lt;\omega $, these recover the notions of type $I_{n}$ C*-algebra and of $n$-subhomogeneous C*-algebra, respectively. We prove that a separable C*-algebra is liminary if and only if it is type $I_{\alpha }$ for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$, and it is preliminary (i.e., has no infinite-dimensional irreducible representation) if and only if it is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$. We also prove that for any countable ordinal $\alpha $ there exists a separable C*-algebra that is type $I_{\alpha }$ and not type $I_{\beta }$ for $\beta &lt;\alpha $, and a separable C*-algebra that is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous and not $\beta $-subhomogeneous for any $\beta &lt;\alpha $.</description>

      <title>Spans and convex combinations of boundary-valued continuous functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an $(n\ge 2)$-dimensional real Banach space $E$ with unit ball $E_{\le 1}$ and a topological space $X$ arbitrary elements in $C(X,E_{\le 1})$ are always expressible as linear combinations of at most three functions valued in the unit sphere $\partial E_{\le 1}$. On the other hand, for normal $X$, $C(X,E_{\le 1})$ can only be the convex hull of $C(X,\partial E_{\le 1})$ if the covering dimension of $X$ is strictly smaller than $\dim E$. A variant of this remark is the characterization of normal $X$ with $\dim X&lt;\dim E$ as precisely those for which $C(X,E_{\le 1})$ is the convex hull of nowhere-vanishing continuous $X\to E_{\le 1}$ or, equivalently, that of continuous functions $X\to E_{[r,1]}$, $r\in (0,1)$ valued in arbitrarily thin spherical shells.
  This extends a number of results due to Peck, Cantwell, Bogachev, Mena-Jurado, Navarro-Pascual and Jim\'enez-Vargas and others revolving around the realizability of the unit ball of $C(X,E)$ as a convex hull of its extreme points for strictly convex and/or complex $E$.</description>
