      <title>Adapting OpenAI's CLIP Model for Few-Shot Image Inspection in Manufacturing Quality Control: An Expository Case Study with Multiple Application Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This expository paper introduces a simplified approach to image-based quality inspection in manufacturing using OpenAI's CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model adapted for few-shot learning. While CLIP has demonstrated impressive capabilities in general computer vision tasks, its direct application to manufacturing inspection presents challenges due to the domain gap between its training data and industrial applications. We evaluate CLIP's effectiveness through five case studies: metallic pan surface inspection, 3D printing extrusion profile analysis, stochastic textured surface evaluation, automotive assembly inspection, and microstructure image classification. Our results show that CLIP can achieve high classification accuracy with relatively small learning sets (50-100 examples per class) for single-component and texture-based applications. However, the performance degrades with complex multi-component scenes. We provide a practical implementation framework that enables quality engineers to quickly assess CLIP's suitability for their specific applications before pursuing more complex solutions. This work establishes CLIP-based few-shot learning as an effective baseline approach that balances implementation simplicity with robust performance, demonstrated in several manufacturing quality control applications.</description>

      <title>Reducing Total Trip Time and Vehicle Emission through Park-and-Ride -- methods and case-study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses important issues of traffic congestion and vehicle emissions in urban areas by developing a comprehensive mathematical framework to evaluate Park-and-Ride (PnR) systems. The proposed approach integrates queueing theory and emissions modeling to simultaneously assess waiting times, travel times, and vehicle emissions under various PnR usage scenarios. The methodology employs a novel combination of Monte Carlo simulation and matrix geometric analytic methods to analyze a queueing network representing PnR facilities and road traffic. A case study of Tsukuba, Japan demonstrates the model's applicability, revealing potential reductions in social costs related to total trip time and emissions through optimized PnR policies. Specifically, the study found that implementing optimal bus frequency and capacity policies could reduce total social costs by up to 30\% compared to current conditions. This research contributes to the literature by providing a unified framework for evaluating PnR systems that considers both time and environmental costs, offering valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers seeking to improve transportation sustainability. The proposed model utilizes a single server queue with a deterministic service time and multiple arrival streams to represent traffic flow, incorporating both private cars and public buses. Emissions are calculated using the Methodologies for Estimating Air Pollutant Emissions from Transport (MEET) framework. The social cost of emissions and total trip time (SCETT) is introduced as a comprehensive metric for evaluating PnR system performance.</description>
