      <title>CardioGenAI: A Machine Learning-Based Framework for Re-Engineering Drugs for Reduced hERG Liability</title>

Abstract: The link between in vitro hERG ion channel inhibition and subsequent in vivo QT interval prolongation, a critical risk factor for the development of arrythmias such as Torsade de Pointes, is so well established that in vitro hERG activity alone is often sufficient to end the development of an otherwise promising drug candidate. It is therefore of tremendous interest to develop advanced methods for identifying hERG-active compounds in the early stages of drug development, as well as for proposing redesigned compounds with reduced hERG liability and preserved on-target potency. In this work, we present CardioGenAI, a machine learning-based framework for re-engineering both developmental and commercially available drugs for reduced hERG activity while preserving their pharmacological activity. The framework incorporates novel state-of-the-art discriminative models for predicting hERG channel activity, as well as activity against the voltage-gated NaV1.5 and CaV1.2 channels due to their potential implications in modulating the arrhythmogenic potential induced by hERG channel blockade. We applied the complete framework to pimozide, an FDA-approved antipsychotic agent that demonstrates high affinity to the hERG channel, and generated 100 refined candidates. Remarkably, among the candidates is fluspirilene, a compound which is of the same class of drugs (diphenylmethanes) as pimozide and therefore has similar pharmacological activity, yet exhibits over 700-fold weaker binding to hERG. We envision that this method can effectively be applied to developmental compounds exhibiting hERG liabilities to provide a means of rescuing drug development programs that have stalled due to hERG-related safety concerns. Additionally, the discriminative models can also serve independently as effective components of a virtual screening pipeline. We have made all of our software open-source.</description>
