      <title>Simulation of Thermal Nonequilibrium Cycles in the Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal nonequilibrium (TNE) is a condition of the plasma in the solar corona in which the local rate of energy loss due to radiation increases to the point that it cannot be sustained by the various heating terms acting on the plasma, precluding the existence of a steady state. The limit cycles of precipitation and evaporation that result from TNE have been simulated in 1D models of coronal loops, as well as 2D and 3D models of the solar chromosphere and lower corona. However, a careful study of TNE in the solar wind has not been performed until now. Here we demonstrate that for suitable combinations of local and global heating rates it is possible for the plasma to exhibit a TNE condition, even in the context of a transonic solar wind with appreciable mass and energy fluxes. This implies limits on the amount of foot-point heating that can be withstood under steady-state conditions in the solar wind, and may help to explain the variability of solar wind streams that emanate from regions of highly concentrated magnetic flux on the solar surface. The implications of this finding pertain to various sources of high-density solar wind, including plumes that form above regions of mixed magnetic polarity in polar coronal holes and the slow solar wind (SSW) that emanates from coronal hole boundaries.</description>

      <title>Forecast of solar activity based on mean-field dynamo model and neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a prediction of the solar activity on a short time-scale applying the method based on a combination of a nonlinear mean-field dynamo model and the artificial neural network. The artificial neural network which serves as a correction scheme for the forecast, uses the currently available observational data (e.g., the 13 month running average of the observed solar sunspot numbers) and the dynamo model output. The nonlinear mean-field $\alpha\,\Omega$ dynamo produces the large-scale magnetic flux which is redistributed by negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI) producing sunspots and active regions. The nonlinear mean-field dynamo model includes algebraic nonlinearity (caused by the feedback of the growing magnetic field on the plasma motion) and dynamic nonlinearities (related to the dynamics of the magnetic helicity of small-scale magnetic field). We compare the forecast errors with a horizon of 1, 6, 12 and 18 months, for different forecast methods, with the same corrections on the current monthly observations. Our forecast is in good agreement with the observed solar activity, the forecast error is almost stably small over short-medium ranges of forecasting windows. Despite a strong level of chaotic component in the solar magnetic activity we present quantitative evidence that the solar activity on a short range can be stably well predicted, by the joint use of the physically based model with the neural network. This result may have an immediate practical implementation for predictions of various phenomena of solar activity and other astrophysical processes, so may be of interest to a broad community.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Solar Wind Charged Particle Energy Deposited and Particle Identification by $\Delta$E-E Discrimination in the SNAPPY Cubesat Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Solar Neutrino and Astro-Particle PhYsics (SNAPPY) Cubesat is expected to launch in 2025 and it will carry into a polar orbit a prototype test detector for solar neutrino background studies while over the Earth's poles for the neutrino Solar Orbiting Laboratory future project ($\nu$SOL). During this flight it is possible to do other science measurements. One of these is an improved study of the solar wind particles through better particle identification and energy measurements. This study aimed to understand how well could the solar wind particles be identified using the planned detector but instead of using the veto array as an anti-coincidence it would be used as a $\Delta$E energy sampling of a phoswich particle ID system.</description>
