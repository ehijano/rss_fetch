      <title>Dynamics and non-integrability of the double spring pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics and integrability of the double spring pendulum, which has great importance in studying nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and bifurcations. Being a Hamiltonian system with three degrees of freedom, its analysis presents a significant challenge. To gain insight into the system's dynamics, we employ various numerical methods, including Lyapunov exponents spectra, phase-parametric diagrams, and Poincar\'e cross-sections. The novelty of our work lies in the integration of these three numerical methods into one powerful tool. We provide a comprehensive understanding of the system's dynamics by identifying parameter values or initial conditions that lead to hyper-chaotic, chaotic, quasi-periodic, and periodic motion, which is a novel contribution in the context of Hamiltonian systems. In the absence of gravitational potential, the system exhibits $S^1$ symmetry, and the presence of an additional first integral was identified using Lyapunov exponents diagrams. We demonstrate the effective utilisation of Lyapunov exponents as a potential indicator of first integrals and integrable dynamics. The numerical analysis is complemented by an analytical proof regarding the non-integrability of the system. This proof relies on the analysis of properties of the differential Galois group of variational equations along specific solutions of the system. To facilitate this analysis, we utilised a newly developed extension of the Kovacic algorithm specifically designed for fourth-order differential equations. Overall, our study sheds light on the intricate dynamics and integrability of the double spring pendulum, offering new insights and methodologies for further research in this field.

      <title>Time-Spectral Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study concerns the efficiency of time-spectral methods for numerical solution of differential equations. It is found that the time-spectral method GWRM demonstrates insensitivity to stiffness and chaoticity due to the implicit nature of the solution algorithm. Accuracy is thus determined primarily by numerical resolution of the solution shape. Examples of efficient solution of stiff and chaotic problems, where explicit methods fail or are significantly slower, are given. Non-smooth and partially steep solutions, however, remain challenging for convergence and accuracy. Some, earlier suggested, smoothing algorithms are shown to be ineffective in addressing this issue. Our findings underscore the need for further exploration of time-spectral approaches to enhance convergence and accuracy for steep or non-smooth solutions.</description>
