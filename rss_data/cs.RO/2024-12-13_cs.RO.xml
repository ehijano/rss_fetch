      <title>Vision-based indoor localization of nano drones in controlled environment with its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating unmanned aerial vehicles in environments where GPS signals are unavailable poses a compelling and intricate challenge. This challenge is further heightened when dealing with Nano Aerial Vehicles (NAVs) due to their compact size, payload restrictions, and computational capabilities. This paper proposes an approach for localization using off-board computing, an off-board monocular camera, and modified open-source algorithms. The proposed method uses three parallel proportional-integral-derivative controllers on the off-board computer to provide velocity corrections via wireless communication, stabilizing the NAV in a custom-controlled environment. Featuring a 3.1cm localization error and a modest setup cost of 50 USD, this approach proves optimal for environments where cost considerations are paramount. It is especially well-suited for applications like teaching drone control in academic institutions, where the specified error margin is deemed acceptable. Various applications are designed to validate the proposed technique, such as landing the NAV on a moving ground vehicle, path planning in a 3D space, and localizing multi-NAVs. The created package is openly available at https://github.com/simmubhangu/eyantra_drone to foster research in this field.</description>

      <title>EMATO: Energy-Model-Aware Trajectory Optimization for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving lacks strong proof of energy efficiency with the energy-model-agnostic trajectory planning. To achieve an energy consumption model-aware trajectory planning for autonomous driving, this study proposes an online nonlinear programming method that optimizes the polynomial trajectories generated by the Frenet polynomial method while considering both traffic trajectories and road slope prediction. This study further investigates how the energy model can be leveraged in different driving conditions to achieve higher energy efficiency. Case studies, quantitative studies, and ablation studies are conducted in a sedan and truck model to prove the effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Algorithms for Game-Theoretic Motion Planning and Control in Autonomous Racing using Near-Potential Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous racing extends beyond the challenge of controlling a racecar at its physical limits. Professional racers employ strategic maneuvers to outwit other competing opponents to secure victory. While modern control algorithms can achieve human-level performance by computing offline racing lines for single-car scenarios, research on real-time algorithms for multi-car autonomous racing is limited. To bridge this gap, we develop game-theoretic modeling framework that incorporates the competitive aspect of autonomous racing like overtaking and blocking through a novel policy parametrization, while operating the car at its limit. Furthermore, we propose an algorithmic approach to compute the (approximate) Nash equilibrium strategy, which represents the optimal approach in the presence of competing agents. Specifically, we introduce an algorithm inspired by recently introduced framework of dynamic near-potential function, enabling real-time computation of the Nash equilibrium. Our approach comprises two phases: offline and online. During the offline phase, we use simulated racing data to learn a near-potential function that approximates utility changes for agents. This function facilitates the online computation of approximate Nash equilibria by maximizing its value. We evaluate our method in a head-to-head 3-car racing scenario, demonstrating superior performance compared to several existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Continuous Gaussian Process Pre-Optimization for Asynchronous Event-Inertial Odometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras, as bio-inspired sensors, are asynchronously triggered with high-temporal resolution compared to intensity cameras. Recent work has focused on fusing the event measurements with inertial measurements to enable ego-motion estimation in high-speed and HDR environments. However, existing methods predominantly rely on IMU preintegration designed mainly for synchronous sensors and discrete-time frameworks. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time preintegration method based on the Temporal Gaussian Process (TGP) called GPO. Concretely, we model the preintegration as a time-indexed motion trajectory and leverage an efficient two-step optimization to initialize the precision preintegration pseudo-measurements. Our method realizes a linear and constant time cost for initialization and query, respectively. To further validate the proposal, we leverage the GPO to design an asynchronous event-inertial odometry and compare with other asynchronous fusion schemes within the same odometry system. Experiments conducted on both public and own-collected datasets demonstrate that the proposed GPO offers significant advantages in terms of precision and efficiency, outperforming existing approaches in handling asynchronous sensor fusion.</description>

      <title>Motor Imagery Teleoperation of a Mobile Robot Using a Low-Cost Brain-Computer Interface for Multi-Day Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have the potential to provide transformative control in prosthetics, assistive technologies (wheelchairs), robotics, and human-computer interfaces. While Motor Imagery (MI) offers an intuitive approach to BCI control, its practical implementation is often limited by the requirement for expensive devices, extensive training data, and complex algorithms, leading to user fatigue and reduced accessibility. In this paper, we demonstrate that effective MI-BCI control of a mobile robot in real-world settings can be achieved using a fine-tuned Deep Neural Network (DNN) with a sliding window, eliminating the need for complex feature extractions for real-time robot control. The fine-tuning process optimizes the convolutional and attention layers of the DNN to adapt to each user's daily MI data streams, reducing training data by 70% and minimizing user fatigue from extended data collection. Using a low-cost (~$3k), 16-channel, non-invasive, open-source electroencephalogram (EEG) device, four users teleoperated a quadruped robot over three days. The system achieved 78% accuracy on a single-day validation dataset and maintained a 75% validation accuracy over three days without extensive retraining from day-to-day. For real-world robot command classification, we achieved an average of 62% accuracy. By providing empirical evidence that MI-BCI systems can maintain performance over multiple days with reduced training data to DNN and a low-cost EEG device, our work enhances the practicality and accessibility of BCI technology. This advancement makes BCI applications more feasible for real-world scenarios, particularly in controlling robotic systems.</description>

      <title>An Event-Triggered Framework for Trust-Mediated Human-Autonomy Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the increased cooperation between humans and autonomous systems, we present a new hybrid systems framework capturing the interconnected dynamics underlying these interactions. The framework accommodates models arising from both the autonomous systems and cognitive psychology literature in order to represent key elements such as human trust in the autonomous system. The intermittent nature of human interactions are incorporated by asynchronous event-triggered sampling at the framework's human-autonomous system interfaces. We illustrate important considerations for tuning framework parameters by investigating a practical application to an autonomous robotic swarm search and rescue scenario. In this way, we demonstrate how the proposed framework may assist in designing more efficient and effective interactions between humans and autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Model-Data Fault Diagnosis for Wafer Handler Robots: Tilt and Broken Belt Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a hybrid model- and data-based scheme for fault detection, isolation, and estimation (FDIE) for a class of wafer handler (WH) robots. The proposed hybrid scheme consists of: 1) a linear filter that simultaneously estimates system states and fault-induced signals from sensing and actuation data; and 2) a data-driven classifier, in the form of a support vector machine (SVM), that detects and isolates the fault type using estimates generated by the filter. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme for two critical fault types for WH robots used in the semiconductor industry: broken-belt in the lower arm of the WH robot (an abrupt fault) and tilt in the robot arms (an incipient fault). We derive explicit models of the robot motion dynamics induced by these faults and test the diagnostics scheme in a realistic simulation-based case study. These case study results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid FDIE scheme achieves superior performance compared to purely data-driven methods.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for Internet of Robotic Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, robotics, and Internet of Things, multi-robot systems are progressively acquiring human-like environmental perception and understanding capabilities, empowering them to complete complex tasks through autonomous decision-making and interaction. However, the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) faces significant challenges in terms of spectrum resources, sensing accuracy, communication latency, and energy supply. To address these issues, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided IoRT network is proposed to enhance the overall performance of robotic communication, sensing, computation, and energy harvesting. In the case studies, by jointly optimizing parameters such as transceiver beamforming, robot trajectories, and RIS coefficients, solutions based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning and multi-objective optimization are proposed to solve problems such as beamforming design, path planning, target sensing, and data aggregation. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed solutions in improve communication quality, sensing accuracy, computation error, and energy efficiency of RIS-aided IoRT networks.</description>

      <title>Student-Informed Teacher Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning with a privileged teacher has proven effective for learning complex control behaviors from high-dimensional inputs, such as images. In this framework, a teacher is trained with privileged task information, while a student tries to predict the actions of the teacher with more limited observations, e.g., in a robot navigation task, the teacher might have access to distances to nearby obstacles, while the student only receives visual observations of the scene. However, privileged imitation learning faces a key challenge: the student might be unable to imitate the teacher's behavior due to partial observability. This problem arises because the teacher is trained without considering if the student is capable of imitating the learned behavior. To address this teacher-student asymmetry, we propose a framework for joint training of the teacher and student policies, encouraging the teacher to learn behaviors that can be imitated by the student despite the latters' limited access to information and its partial observability. Based on the performance bound in imitation learning, we add (i) the approximated action difference between teacher and student as a penalty term to the reward function of the teacher, and (ii) a supervised teacher-student alignment step. We motivate our method with a maze navigation task and demonstrate its effectiveness on complex vision-based quadrotor flight and manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Score and Distribution Matching Policy: Advanced Accelerated Visuomotor Policies via Matched Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual-motor policy learning has advanced with architectures like diffusion-based policies, known for modeling complex robotic trajectories. However, their prolonged inference times hinder high-frequency control tasks requiring real-time feedback. While consistency distillation (CD) accelerates inference, it introduces errors that compromise action quality. To address these limitations, we propose the Score and Distribution Matching Policy (SDM Policy), which transforms diffusion-based policies into single-step generators through a two-stage optimization process: score matching ensures alignment with true action distributions, and distribution matching minimizes KL divergence for consistency. A dual-teacher mechanism integrates a frozen teacher for stability and an unfrozen teacher for adversarial training, enhancing robustness and alignment with target distributions. Evaluated on a 57-task simulation benchmark, SDM Policy achieves a 6x inference speedup while having state-of-the-art action quality, providing an efficient and reliable framework for high-frequency robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning Novel Skills from Language-Generated Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current robot learning algorithms for acquiring novel skills often rely on demonstration datasets or environment interactions, resulting in high labor costs and potential safety risks. To address these challenges, this study proposes a skill-learning framework that enables robots to acquire novel skills from natural language instructions. The proposed pipeline leverages vision-language models to generate demonstration videos of novel skills, which are processed by an inverse dynamics model to extract actions from the unlabeled demonstrations. These actions are subsequently mapped to environmental contexts via imitation learning, enabling robots to learn new skills effectively. Experimental evaluations in the MetaWorld simulation environments demonstrate the pipeline's capability to generate high-fidelity and reliable demonstrations. Using the generated demonstrations, various skill learning algorithms achieve an accomplishment rate three times the original on novel tasks. These results highlight a novel approach to robot learning, offering a foundation for the intuitive and intelligent acquisition of novel robotic skills.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Predictive Control with Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained popularity for policy learning in robotics due to their ability to capture high-dimensional and multimodal distributions. However, diffusion policies are inherently stochastic and typically trained offline, limiting their ability to handle unseen and dynamic conditions where novel constraints not represented in the training data must be satisfied. To overcome this limitation, we propose diffusion predictive control with constraints (DPCC), an algorithm for diffusion-based control with explicit state and action constraints that can deviate from those in the training data. DPCC uses constraint tightening and incorporates model-based projections into the denoising process of a trained trajectory diffusion model. This allows us to generate constraint-satisfying, dynamically feasible, and goal-reaching trajectories for predictive control. We show through simulations of a robot manipulator that DPCC outperforms existing methods in satisfying novel test-time constraints while maintaining performance on the learned control task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of green energy, the efficiency and reliability of wind turbines are key to sustainable renewable energy production. For that reason, this paper presents a novel intelligent system architecture designed for the dynamic collection and real-time processing of visual data to detect defects in wind turbines. The system employs advanced algorithms within a distributed framework to enhance inspection accuracy and efficiency using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with integrated visual and thermal sensors. An experimental study conducted at the "Staryi Sambir-1" wind power plant in Ukraine demonstrates the system's effectiveness, showing a significant improvement in defect detection accuracy (up to 94%) and a reduction in inspection time per turbine (down to 1.5 hours) compared to traditional methods. The results show that the proposed intelligent system architecture provides a scalable and reliable solution for wind turbine maintenance, contributing to the durability and performance of renewable energy infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Within the Classical Robotics Stack: A Case Study in Robot Soccer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot decision-making in partially observable, real-time, dynamic, and multi-agent environments remains a difficult and unsolved challenge. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach to learning decision-making in such domains, however, end-to-end RL in complex environments is often intractable. To address this challenge in the RoboCup Standard Platform League (SPL) domain, we developed a novel architecture integrating RL within a classical robotics stack, while employing a multi-fidelity sim2real approach and decomposing behavior into learned sub-behaviors with heuristic selection. Our architecture led to victory in the 2024 RoboCup SPL Challenge Shield Division. In this work, we fully describe our system's architecture and empirically analyze key design decisions that contributed to its success. Our approach demonstrates how RL-based behaviors can be integrated into complete robot behavior architectures.</description>

      <title>Slope Considered Online Nonlinear Trajectory Planning with Differential Energy Model for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving energy-efficient trajectory planning for autonomous driving remains a challenge due to the limitations of model-agnostic approaches. This study addresses this gap by introducing an online nonlinear programming trajectory optimization framework that integrates a differentiable energy model into autonomous systems. By leveraging traffic and slope profile predictions within a safety-critical framework, the proposed method enhances fuel efficiency for both sedans and diesel trucks by 3.71\% and 7.15\%, respectively, when compared to traditional model-agnostic quadratic programming techniques. These improvements translate to a potential \$6.14 billion economic benefit for the U.S. trucking industry. This work bridges the gap between model-agnostic autonomous driving and model-aware ECO-driving, highlighting a practical pathway for integrating energy efficiency into real-time trajectory planning.</description>

      <title>Learning to Adapt: Bio-Inspired Gait Strategies for Versatile Quadruped Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has revolutionised quadruped robot locomotion, but existing control frameworks struggle to generalise beyond their training-induced observational scope, resulting in limited adaptability. In contrast, animals achieve exceptional adaptability through gait transition strategies, diverse gait utilisation, and seamless adjustment to immediate environmental demands. Inspired by these capabilities, we present a novel DRL framework that incorporates key attributes of animal locomotion: gait transition strategies, pseudo gait procedural memory, and adaptive motion adjustments. This approach enables our framework to achieve unparalleled adaptability, demonstrated through blind zero-shot deployment on complex terrains and recovery from critically unstable states. Our findings offer valuable insights into the biomechanics of animal locomotion, paving the way for robust, adaptable robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Distributional Reinforcement Learning based Integrated Decision Making and Control for Autonomous Surface Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing demands for Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) in recent years, the number of ASVs being deployed for various maritime missions is expected to increase rapidly in the near future. However, it is still challenging for ASVs to perform sensor-based autonomous navigation in obstacle-filled and congested waterways, where perception errors, closely gathered vehicles and limited maneuvering space near buoys may cause difficulties in following the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). To address these issues, we propose a novel Distributional Reinforcement Learning based navigation system that can work with onboard LiDAR and odometry sensors to generate arbitrary thrust commands in continuous action space. Comprehensive evaluations of the proposed system in high-fidelity Gazebo simulations show its ability to decide whether to follow COLREGs or take other beneficial actions based on the scenarios encountered, offering superior performance in navigation safety and efficiency compared to systems using state-of-the-art Distributional RL, non-Distributional RL and classical methods.</description>

      <title>iKap: Kinematics-aware Planning with Imperative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory planning in robotics aims to generate collision-free pose sequences that can be reliably executed. Recently, vision-to-planning systems have garnered increasing attention for their efficiency and ability to interpret and adapt to surrounding environments. However, traditional modular systems suffer from increased latency and error propagation, while purely data-driven approaches often overlook the robot's kinematic constraints. This oversight leads to discrepancies between planned trajectories and those that are executable. To address these challenges, we propose iKap, a novel vision-to-planning system that integrates the robot's kinematic model directly into the learning pipeline. iKap employs a self-supervised learning approach and incorporates the state transition model within a differentiable bi-level optimization framework. This integration ensures the network learns collision-free waypoints while satisfying kinematic constraints, enabling gradient back-propagation for end-to-end training. Our experimental results demonstrate that iKap achieves higher success rates and reduced latency compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Besides the complete system, iKap offers a visual-to-planning network that seamlessly integrates kinematics into various controllers, providing a robust solution for robots navigating complex and dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Integrating Vision Systems and STPA for Robust Landing and Take-Off in VTOL Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are versatile platforms widely used in applications such as surveillance, search and rescue, and urban air mobility. Despite their potential, the critical phases of take-off and landing in uncertain and dynamic environments pose significant safety challenges due to environmental uncertainties, sensor noise, and system-level interactions. This paper presents an integrated approach combining vision-based sensor fusion with System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to enhance the safety and robustness of VTOL UAV operations during take-off and landing. By incorporating fiducial markers, such as AprilTags, into the control architecture, and performing comprehensive hazard analysis, we identify unsafe control actions and propose mitigation strategies. Key contributions include developing the control structure with vision system capable of identifying a fiducial marker, multirotor controller and corresponding unsafe control actions and mitigation strategies. The proposed solution is expected to improve the reliability and safety of VTOL UAV operations, paving the way for resilient autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>GainAdaptor: Learning Quadrupedal Locomotion with Dual Actors for Adaptable and Energy-Efficient Walking on Various Terrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as an innovative solution for controlling legged robots in challenging environments using minimalist architectures. Traditional control methods for legged robots, such as inverse dynamics, either directly manage joint torques or use proportional-derivative (PD) controllers to regulate joint positions at a higher level. In case of DRL, direct torque control presents significant challenges, leading to a preference for joint position control. However, this approach necessitates careful adjustment of joint PD gains, which can limit both adaptability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose GainAdaptor, an adaptive gain control framework that autonomously tunes joint PD gains to enhance terrain adaptability and energy efficiency. The framework employs a dual-actor algorithm to dynamically adjust the PD gains based on varying ground conditions. By utilizing a divided action space, GainAdaptor efficiently learns stable and energy-efficient locomotion. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments conducted on a Unitree Go1 robot, demonstrating improved locomotion performance across diverse terrains.</description>

      <title>BaB-ND: Long-Horizon Motion Planning with Branch-and-Bound and Neural Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural-network-based dynamics models learned from observational data have shown strong predictive capabilities for scene dynamics in robotic manipulation tasks. However, their inherent non-linearity presents significant challenges for effective planning. Current planning methods, often dependent on extensive sampling or local gradient descent, struggle with long-horizon motion planning tasks involving complex contact events. In this paper, we present a GPU-accelerated branch-and-bound (BaB) framework for motion planning in manipulation tasks that require trajectory optimization over neural dynamics models. Our approach employs a specialized branching heuristics to divide the search space into subdomains, and applies a modified bound propagation method, inspired by the state-of-the-art neural network verifier alpha-beta-CROWN, to efficiently estimate objective bounds within these subdomains. The branching process guides planning effectively, while the bounding process strategically reduces the search space. Our framework achieves superior planning performance, generating high-quality state-action trajectories and surpassing existing methods in challenging, contact-rich manipulation tasks such as non-prehensile planar pushing with obstacles, object sorting, and rope routing in both simulated and real-world settings. Furthermore, our framework supports various neural network architectures, ranging from simple multilayer perceptrons to advanced graph neural dynamics models, and scales efficiently with different model sizes.</description>

      <title>NormalFlow: Fast, Robust, and Accurate Contact-based Object 6DoF Pose Tracking with Vision-based Tactile Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tactile sensing is crucial for robots aiming to achieve human-level dexterity. Among tactile-dependent skills, tactile-based object tracking serves as the cornerstone for many tasks, including manipulation, in-hand manipulation, and 3D reconstruction. In this work, we introduce NormalFlow, a fast, robust, and real-time tactile-based 6DoF tracking algorithm. Leveraging the precise surface normal estimation of vision-based tactile sensors, NormalFlow determines object movements by minimizing discrepancies between the tactile-derived surface normals. Our results show that NormalFlow consistently outperforms competitive baselines and can track low-texture objects like table surfaces. For long-horizon tracking, we demonstrate when rolling the sensor around a bead for 360 degrees, NormalFlow maintains a rotational tracking error of 2.5 degrees. Additionally, we present state-of-the-art tactile-based 3D reconstruction results, showcasing the high accuracy of NormalFlow. We believe NormalFlow unlocks new possibilities for high-precision perception and manipulation tasks that involve interacting with objects using hands. The video demo, code, and dataset are available on our website: https://joehjhuang.github.io/normalflow.</description>

      <title>A Behavior Tree-inspired programming language for autonomous agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a design for a functional programming language for autonomous agents, built off the ideas and motivations of Behavior Trees (BTs). BTs are a popular model for designing agents behavior in robotics and AI. However, as their growth has increased dramatically, the simple model of BTs has come to be limiting. There is a growing push to increase the functionality of BTs, with the end goal of BTs evolving into a programming language in their own right, centred around the defining BT properties of modularity and reactiveness.
  In this paper, we examine how the BT model must be extended in order to grow into such a language. We identify some fundamental problems which must be solved: implementing `reactive' selection, 'monitoring' safety-critical conditions, and passing data between actions. We provide a variety of small examples which demonstrate that these problems are complex, and that current BT approaches do not handle them in a manner consistent with modularity. We instead provide a simple set of modular programming primitives for handling these use cases, and show how they can be combined to build complex programs. We present a full specification for our BT-inspired language, and give an implementation in the functional programming language Haskell. Finally, we demonstrate our language by translating a large and complex BT into a simple, unambiguous program.</description>

      <title>A cheat sheet for probability distributions of orientational data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need for statistical models of orientations arises in many applications in engineering and computer science. Orientational data appear as sets of angles, unit vectors, rotation matrices or quaternions. In the field of directional statistics, a lot of advances have been made in modelling such types of data. However, only a few of these tools are used in engineering and computer science applications. Hence, this paper aims to serve as a cheat sheet for those probability distributions of orientations. Models for 1-DOF, 2-DOF and 3-DOF orientations are discussed. For each of them, expressions for the density function, fitting to data, and sampling are presented. The paper is written with a compromise between engineering and statistics in terms of notation and terminology. A Python library with functions for some of these models is provided. Using this library, two examples of applications to real data are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose MMD-OPT: a sample-efficient approach for minimizing the risk of collision under arbitrary prediction distribution of the dynamic obstacles. MMD-OPT is based on embedding distribution in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and the associated Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We show how these two concepts can be used to define a sample efficient surrogate for collision risk estimate. We perform extensive simulations to validate the effectiveness of MMD-OPT on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Importantly, we show that trajectory optimization with our MMD-based collision risk surrogate leads to safer trajectories at low sample regimes than popular alternatives based on Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end driving systems have made rapid progress, but have so far not been applied to the challenging new CARLA Leaderboard 2.0. Further, while there is a large body of literature on end-to-end architectures and training strategies, the impact of the training dataset is often overlooked. In this work, we make a first attempt at end-to-end driving for Leaderboard 2.0. Instead of investigating architectures, we systematically analyze the training dataset, leading to new insights: (1) Expert style significantly affects downstream policy performance. (2) In complex data sets, the frames should not be weighted on the basis of simplistic criteria such as class frequencies. (3) Instead, estimating whether a frame changes the target labels compared to previous frames can reduce the size of the dataset without removing important information. By incorporating these findings, our model ranks first and second respectively on the map and sensors tracks of the 2024 CARLA Challenge, and sets a new state-of-the-art on the Bench2Drive test routes. Finally, we uncover a design flaw in the current evaluation metrics and propose a modification for future challenges. Our dataset, code, and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/carla_garage.</description>

      <title>Learning Camera Movement Control from Real-World Drone Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study seeks to automate camera movement control for filming existing subjects into attractive videos, contrasting with the creation of non-existent content by directly generating the pixels. We select drone videos as our test case due to their rich and challenging motion patterns, distinctive viewing angles, and precise controls. Existing AI videography methods struggle with limited appearance diversity in simulation training, high costs of recording expert operations, and difficulties in designing heuristic-based goals to cover all scenarios. To avoid these issues, we propose a scalable method that involves collecting real-world training data to improve diversity, extracting camera trajectories automatically to minimize annotation costs, and training an effective architecture that does not rely on heuristics. Specifically, we collect 99k high-quality trajectories by running 3D reconstruction on online videos, connecting camera poses from consecutive frames to formulate 3D camera paths, and using Kalman filter to identify and remove low-quality data. Moreover, we introduce DVGFormer, an auto-regressive transformer that leverages the camera path and images from all past frames to predict camera movement in the next frame. We evaluate our system across 38 synthetic natural scenes and 7 real city 3D scans. We show that our system effectively learns to perform challenging camera movements such as navigating through obstacles, maintaining low altitude to increase perceived speed, and orbiting towers and buildings, which are very useful for recording high-quality videos. Data and code are available at dvgformer.github.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding, navigating, and exploring the 3D physical real world has long been a central challenge in the development of artificial intelligence. In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. In summary, we demonstrate that GenEx provides a transformative platform for advancing embodied AI in imaginative spaces and brings potential for extending these capabilities to real-world exploration.</description>

Abstract: Dynamic graphs are extensively employed for detecting anomalous behavior in nodes within the Internet of Things (IoT). Graph generative models are often used to address the issue of imbalanced node categories in dynamic graphs. Nevertheless, the constraints it faces include the monotonicity of adjacency relationships, the difficulty in constructing multi-dimensional features for nodes, and the lack of a method for end-to-end generation of multiple categories of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel graph generation model, called CGGM, specifically for generating samples belonging to the minority class. The framework consists two core module: a conditional graph generation module and a graph-based anomaly detection module. The generative module adapts to the sparsity of the matrix by downsampling a noise adjacency matrix, and incorporates a multi-dimensional feature encoder based on multi-head self-attention to capture latent dependencies among features. Additionally, a latent space constraint is combined with the distribution distance to approximate the latent distribution of real data. The graph-based anomaly detection module utilizes the generated balanced dataset to predict the node behaviors. Extensive experiments have shown that CGGM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and divergence. The results also demonstrate CGGM can generated diverse data categories, that enhancing the performance of multi-category classification task.</description>

An outstanding challenge with simulation-based testing is the generation of safety-critical scenarios, which are essential to ensure that AVs can handle rare but potentially fatal situations. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel framework, CaDRE, to generate realistic, diverse, and controllable safety-critical scenarios. Our approach optimizes for both the quality and diversity of scenarios by employing a unique formulation and algorithm that integrates real-world scenarios, domain knowledge, and black-box optimization. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive testing in three representative types of traffic scenarios. The results demonstrate superior performance in generating diverse and high-quality scenarios with greater sample efficiency than existing reinforcement learning (RL) and sampling-based methods.</description>

      <title>Robotics meets Fluid Dynamics: A Characterization of the Induced Airflow below a Quadrotor as a Turbulent Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of quadrotors for diverse applications, from agriculture to public safety, necessitates an understanding of the aerodynamic disturbances they create. This paper introduces a computationally lightweight model for estimating the time-averaged magnitude of the induced flow below quadrotors in hover. Unlike related approaches that rely on expensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations or drone specific time-consuming empirical measurements, our method leverages classical theory from turbulent flows. By analyzing over 16 hours of flight data from drones of varying sizes within a large motion capture system, we show for the first time that the combined flow from all drone propellers is well-approximated by a turbulent jet after 2.5 drone-diameters below the vehicle. Using a novel normalization and scaling, we experimentally identify model parameters that describe a unified mean velocity field below differently sized quadrotors. The model, which requires only the drone's mass, propeller size, and drone size for calculations, accurately describes the far-field airflow over a long-range in a very large volume which is impractical to simulate using CFD. Our model offers a practical tool for ensuring safer operations near humans, optimizing sensor placements and drone control in multi-agent scenarios. We demonstrate the latter by designing a controller that compensates for the downwash of another drone, leading to a four times lower altitude deviation when passing below.</description>

      <title>LLM-Personalize: Aligning LLM Planners with Human Preferences via Reinforced Self-Training for Housekeeping Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for robotics applications, particularly task planning, by harnessing their language comprehension and text generation capabilities. However, in applications such as household robotics, a critical gap remains in the personalization of these models to individual user preferences. We introduce LLM-Personalize, a novel framework with an optimization pipeline designed to personalize LLM planners for household robotics. Our LLM-Personalize framework features an LLM planner that performs iterative planning in multi-room, partially-observable household scenarios, making use of a scene graph constructed with local observations. The generated plan consists of a sequence of high-level actions which are subsequently executed by a controller. Central to our approach is the optimization pipeline, which combines imitation learning and iterative self-training to personalize the LLM planner. In particular, the imitation learning phase performs initial LLM alignment from demonstrations, and bootstraps the model to facilitate effective iterative self-training, which further explores and aligns the model to user preferences. We evaluate LLM-Personalize on Housekeep, a challenging simulated real-world 3D benchmark for household rearrangements, and show that LLM-Personalize achieves more than a 30 percent increase in success rate over existing LLM planners, showcasing significantly improved alignment with human preferences.

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Bipedal Locomotion: A Brief Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bipedal robots are gaining global recognition due to their potential applications and advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). While DRL has significantly advanced bipedal locomotion, the development of a unified framework capable of handling a wide range of tasks remains an ongoing challenge. This survey systematically categorises, compares, and analyses existing DRL frameworks for bipedal locomotion, organising them into end-to-end and hierarchical control schemes. End-to-end frameworks are evaluated based on their learning approaches, while hierarchical frameworks are examined in terms of layered structures that integrate learning-based or traditional model-based methods. We provide a detailed evaluation of the composition, strengths, limitations, and capabilities of each framework. Additionally, this survey identifies key research gaps and proposes future directions aimed at creating a more integrated and efficient framework for bipedal locomotion, with wide-ranging applications in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Robot Agnostic Visual Servoing considering kinematic constraints enabled by a decoupled network trajectory planner structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a visual servoing method consisting of a detection network and a velocity trajectory planner. First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of &lt;0.5 mm and orientation errors of &lt;1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</description>

      <title>Meta-Control: Automatic Model-based Control Synthesis for Heterogeneous Robot Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The requirements for real-world manipulation tasks are diverse and often conflicting; some tasks require precise motion while others require force compliance; some tasks require avoidance of certain regions, while others require convergence to certain states. Satisfying these varied requirements with a fixed state-action representation and control strategy is challenging, impeding the development of a universal robotic foundation model. In this work, we propose Meta-Control, the first LLM-enabled automatic control synthesis approach that creates customized state representations and control strategies tailored to specific tasks. Our core insight is that a meta-control system can be built to automate the thought process that human experts use to design control systems. Specifically, human experts heavily use a model-based, hierarchical (from abstract to concrete) thought model, then compose various dynamic models and controllers together to form a control system. Meta-Control mimics the thought model and harnesses LLM's extensive control knowledge with Socrates' "art of midwifery" to automate the thought process. Meta-Control stands out for its fully model-based nature, allowing rigorous analysis, generalizability, robustness, efficient parameter tuning, and reliable real-time execution.</description>

      <title>VDB-GPDF: Online Gaussian Process Distance Field with VDB Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robots reason about the environment through dedicated representations. Popular choices for dense representations exploit Truncated Signed Distance Functions (TSDF) and Octree data structures. However, TSDF provides a projective or non-projective signed distance obtained directly from depth measurements that overestimate the Euclidean distance. Octrees, despite being memory efficient, require tree traversal and can lead to increased runtime in large scenarios. Other representations based on the Gaussian Process (GP) distance fields are appealing due to their probabilistic and continuous nature, but the computational complexity is a concern. In this paper, we present an online efficient mapping framework that seamlessly couples GP distance fields and the fast-access OpenVDB data structure. The key aspect is a latent Local GP Signed Distance Field (L-GPDF) contained in a local VDB structure that allows fast queries of the Euclidean distance, surface properties and their uncertainties for arbitrary points in the field of view. Probabilistic fusion is then performed by merging the inferred values of these points into a global VDB structure that is efficiently maintained over time. After fusion, the surface mesh is recovered, and a global GP Signed Distance Field (G-GPDF) is generated and made available for downstream applications to query accurate distance and gradients. A comparison with the state-of-the-art frameworks shows superior efficiency and accuracy of the inferred distance field and comparable reconstruction performance. https://github.com/UTS-RI/VDB_GPDF</description>

      <title>From Imitation to Refinement -- Residual RL for Precise Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16677v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Behavior Cloning (BC) have made it easy to teach robots new tasks. However, we find that the ease of teaching comes at the cost of unreliable performance that saturates with increasing data for tasks requiring precision. The performance saturation can be attributed to two critical factors: (a) distribution shift resulting from the use of offline data and (b) the lack of closed-loop corrective control caused by action chucking (predicting a set of future actions executed open-loop) critical for BC performance. Our key insight is that by predicting action chunks, BC policies function more like trajectory "planners" than closed-loop controllers necessary for reliable execution. To address these challenges, we devise a simple yet effective method, ResiP (Residual for Precise Manipulation), that overcomes the reliability problem while retaining BC's ease of teaching and long-horizon capabilities. ResiP augments a frozen, chunked BC model with a fully closed-loop residual policy trained with reinforcement learning (RL) that addresses distribution shifts and introduces closed-loop corrections over open-loop execution of action chunks predicted by the BC trajectory planner.

      <title>Good Grasps Only: A data engine for self-supervised fine-tuning of pose estimation using grasp poses for verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel method for self-supervised fine-tuning of pose estimation. Leveraging zero-shot pose estimation, our approach enables the robot to automatically obtain training data without manual labeling. After pose estimation the object is grasped, and in-hand pose estimation is used for data validation. Our pipeline allows the system to fine-tune while the process is running, removing the need for a learning phase. The motivation behind our work lies in the need for rapid setup of pose estimation solutions. Specifically, we address the challenging task of bin picking, which plays a pivotal role in flexible robotic setups. Our method is implemented on a robotics work-cell, and tested with four different objects. For all objects, our method increases the performance and outperforms a state-of-the-art method trained on the CAD model of the objects. Project page available at gogoengine.github.io</description>

Abstract: This paper describes two C++/Open Motion Planning Library implementations of the recently developed motion planning algorithms HyRRT arXiv:2210.15082v1 [cs.RO] and HySST arXiv:2305.18649v1 [cs.RO]. Specifically, cHyRRT, an implementation of the HyRRT algorithm, is capable of generating a solution to a motion planning problem for hybrid systems with probabilistically completeness, while cHySST, an implementation of the asymptotically near-optimal HySST algorithm, is capable of computing a trajectory to solve the optimal motion planning problem for hybrid systems. cHyRRT is suitable for motion planning problems where an optimal solution is not required, whereas cHySST is suitable for such problems that prefer optimal solutions, within all feasible solutions. The structure, components, and usage of the two tools are described. Examples are included to illustrate the main capabilities of the toolbox.</description>

      <title>Drift-free Visual SLAM using Digital Twins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Globally-consistent localization in urban environments is crucial for autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles and drones, as well as assistive technologies for visually impaired people. Traditional Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) methods, though adequate for local pose estimation, suffer from drift in the long term due to reliance on local sensor data. While GPS counteracts this drift, it is unavailable indoors and often unreliable in urban areas. An alternative is to localize the camera to an existing 3D map using visual-feature matching. This can provide centimeter-level accurate localization but is limited by the visual similarities between the current view and the map. This paper introduces a novel approach that achieves accurate and globally-consistent localization by aligning the sparse 3D point cloud generated by the VIO/VSLAM system to a digital twin using point-to-plane matching; no visual data association is needed. The proposed method provides a 6-DoF global measurement tightly integrated into the VIO/VSLAM system. Experiments run on a high-fidelity GPS simulator and real-world data collected from a drone demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art VIO-GPS systems and offers superior robustness against viewpoint changes compared to the state-of-the-art Visual SLAM systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic tasks such as planning and navigation require a hierarchical semantic understanding of a scene, which could include multiple floors and rooms. Current methods primarily focus on object segmentation for 3D scene understanding. However, such methods struggle to segment out topological regions like "kitchen" in the scene. In this work, we introduce a two-step pipeline to solve this problem. First, we extract a topological map, i.e., floorplan of the indoor scene using a novel multi-channel occupancy representation. Then, we generate CLIP-aligned features and semantic labels for every room instance based on the objects it contains using a self-attention transformer. Our language-topology alignment supports natural language querying, e.g., a "place to cook" locates the "kitchen". We outperform the current state-of-the-art on room segmentation by ~20% and room classification by ~12%. Our detailed qualitative analysis and ablation studies provide insights into the problem of joint structural and semantic 3D scene understanding. Project Page: quest-maps.github.io</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline data are both valuable and practical resources for teaching robots complex behaviors. Ideally, learning agents should not be constrained by the scarcity of available demonstrations, but rather generalize beyond the training distribution. However, the complexity of real-world scenarios typically requires huge amounts of data to prevent neural network policies from picking up on spurious correlations and learning non-causal relationships. We propose CAIAC, a data augmentation method that can create feasible synthetic transitions from a fixed dataset without having access to online environment interactions. By utilizing principled methods for quantifying causal influence, we are able to perform counterfactual reasoning by swapping $\it{action}$-unaffected parts of the state-space between independent trajectories in the dataset. We empirically show that this leads to a substantial increase in robustness of offline learning algorithms against distributional shift.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Input and State Estimation for Multi-agent System with Dynamic Topology and Heterogeneous Sensor Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A crucial challenge in decentralized systems is state estimation in the presence of unknown inputs, particularly within heterogeneous sensor networks with dynamic topologies. While numerous consensus algorithms have been introduced, they often require extensive information exchange or multiple communication iterations to ensure estimation accuracy. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm that achieves an unbiased and optimal solution comparable to filters with full information about other agents. This is accomplished through the use of information filter decomposition and the fusion of inputs via covariance intersection. Our method requires only a single communication iteration for exchanging individual estimates between agents, instead of multiple rounds of information exchange, thus preserving agents' privacy by avoiding the sharing of explicit observations and system equations. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by dynamic communication topologies, we propose two practical strategies to handle issues arising from intermittent observations and incomplete state estimation, thereby enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the estimation process. Experiments and ablation studies conducted in both stationary and dynamic environments demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over other baselines. Notably, it performs as well as, or even better than, algorithms that have a global view of all neighbors.</description>

      <title>DriveMM: All-in-One Large Multimodal Model for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated exceptional comprehension and interpretation capabilities in Autonomous Driving (AD) by incorporating large language models. Despite the advancements, current data-driven AD approaches tend to concentrate on a single dataset and specific tasks, neglecting their overall capabilities and ability to generalize. To bridge these gaps, we propose DriveMM, a general large multimodal model designed to process diverse data inputs, such as images and multi-view videos, while performing a broad spectrum of AD tasks, including perception, prediction, and planning. Initially, the model undergoes curriculum pre-training to process varied visual signals and perform basic visual comprehension and perception tasks. Subsequently, we augment and standardize various AD-related datasets to fine-tune the model, resulting in an all-in-one LMM for autonomous driving. To assess the general capabilities and generalization ability, we conduct evaluations on six public benchmarks and undertake zero-shot transfer on an unseen dataset, where DriveMM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. We hope DriveMM as a promising solution for future end-to-end autonomous driving applications in the real world. Project page with code: https://github.com/zhijian11/DriveMM.</description>
