      <title>All rose window graphs are hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bicirculant is a regular graph that admits an automorphism having two orbits of the same size. A bicirculant can be described as follows. Given an integer $m \ge 1$ and sets $R,S,T \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_m$ such that $R=-R$, $T=-T$, $0 \not\in R \cup T$ and $0 \in S$, the graph $B(m;R,S,T)$ has vertex set $V=\{u_0,\dots,u_{m-1},v_0,\dots,v_m-1\}$ and edge set $E=\{u_iu_{i+j}| \ i \in \mathbb{Z}_m, j \in R\} \cup \{v_iv_{i+j}| \ i \in \mathbb{Z}_m, j \in T\} \cup \{u_iv_{i+j}| \ i \in \mathbb{Z}_m, j \in S\}.$ Let $m \ge 3$ be a positive integer and $a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}_m \setminus\{0\}$ with $a,b \ne m/2$. If we take $R = \{a,-a\}$, $S = \{0,c\}$ and $T = \{ b, -b\}$, the graph $B(m;R,S,T)$ is a generalized rose window graph. A rose window graph has the additional property that at least one of $a,b$ is relatively prime to $m$.
  In this paper we show that all generalized rose window graphs are hamiltonian. As a consequence we obtain that every connected bicirculant $B(m;R,S,T)$ with $|S| \ge 3$ is hamiltonian if $m$ is a product of at most three prime powers. In particular, every connected bicirculant $B(m;R,S,T)$ with$|S| \ge 3$ is hamiltonian for even $m&lt;210$ and odd $m &lt; 1155$.</description>

      <title>New bounds on the modularity of $G(n,p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modularity is a parameter indicating the presence of community structure in the graph. Nowadays it lies at the core of widely used clustering algorithms. We study the modularity of the most classical random graph, binomial $G(n,p)$. In 2020 McDiarmid and Skerman proved, taking advantage of the spectral graph theory and a specific subgraph construction by Coja-Oghlan from 2007, that there exists a constant $b$ such that with high probability the modularity of $G(n,p)$ is at most $b/\sqrt{np}$. The obtained constant $b$ is very big and not easily computable. We improve upon this result showing that a constant under $3$ may be derived here. Interesting is the fact that it might be obtained by basic probabilistic tools. We also address the lower bound on the modularity of $G(n,p)$ and improve the results of McDiarmid and Skerman from 2020 using estimates of bisections of random graphs derived by Dembo, Montanari, and Sen in 2017.</description>

      <title>On Euler's magic matrices of sizes $3$ and $8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proper Euler's magic matrix is an integer $n\times n$ matrix $M\in\mathbb Z^{n\times n}$ such that $M\cdot M^t=\gamma\cdot I$ for some nonzero constant $\gamma$, the sum of the squares of the entries along each of the two main diagonals equals $\gamma$, and the squares of all entries in $M$ are pairwise distinct. Euler constructed such matrices for $n=4$. In this work, we construct examples for $n=8$ and prove that no such matrix exists for $n=3$.</description>

      <title>Term Coding for Extremal Combinatorics: Dispersion and Complexity Dichotomies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce \emph{Term Coding}, a novel framework for analysing extremal problems in discrete mathematics by encoding them as finite systems of \emph{term equations} (and, optionally, \emph{non-equality constraints}). In its basic form, all variables range over a single domain, and we seek an interpretation of the function symbols that \emph{maximises} the number of solutions to these constraints. This perspective unifies classical questions in extremal combinatorics, network/index coding, and finite model theory.
  We further develop \emph{multi-sorted Term Coding}, a more general approach in which variables may be of different sorts (e.g., points, lines, blocks, colours, labels), possibly supplemented by variable-inequality constraints to enforce distinctness. This extension captures sophisticated structures such as block designs, finite geometries, and mixed coding scenarios within a single logical formalism.
  Our main result shows how to determine (up to a constant) the maximum number of solutions \(\max_{\mathcal{I}}(\Gamma,n)\) for any system of term equations (possibly including non-equality constraints) by relating it to \emph{graph guessing numbers} and \emph{entropy measures}.
  Finally, we focus on \emph{dispersion problems}, an expressive subclass of these constraints. We discover a striking complexity dichotomy: deciding whether, for a given integer \(r\), the maximum code size that reaches \(n^{r}\) is \emph{undecidable}, while deciding whether it exceeds \(n^{r}\) is \emph{polynomial-time decidable}.</description>

      <title>Enumerative combinatorics of unlabeled and labeled time-consistent galled trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mathematical phylogenetics, the time-consistent galled trees provide a simple class of rooted binary network structures that can be used to represent a variety of different biological phenomena. We study the enumerative combinatorics of unlabeled and labeled time-consistent galled trees. We present a new derivation via the symbolic method of the number of unlabeled time-consistent galled trees with a fixed number of leaves and a fixed number of galls. We also derive new generating functions and asymptotics for labeled time-consistent galled trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will introduce Bell numbers $D(n)$ of type $D$ as an analogue to the classical Bell numbers related to all the partitions of the set $[n]$. Then based on a signed set partition of type $D$, we will construct the recurrence relations of Bell numbers $D(n)$. In addition, we deduce the exponential generating function for $D(n)$. Finally, we will provide an explicit formula for $D(n)$.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Minimal Matroid Extensions and Irreducible Decompositions of Circuit Varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient method for decomposing the circuit variety of a given matroid $M$, based on an algorithm that identifies its minimal extensions. These extensions correspond to the smallest elements above $M$ in the poset defined by the dependency order. We apply our algorithm to several classical configurations: the V\'amos matroid, the unique Steiner quadruple system $S(3,4,8)$, the projective and affine planes, the dual of the Fano matroid, and the dual of the graphic matroid of $K_{3,3}$. In each case, we compute the minimal irreducible decomposition of their circuit varieties.</description>

      <title>An Intersection Product for the Polytope Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new multiplication for the polytope algebra, defined via the intersection of polytopes. After establishing the foundational properties of this intersection product, we investigate finite-dimensional subalgebras that arise naturally from this construction. These subalgebras can be regarded as volumetric analogues of the graded M\"obius algebra, which appears in the context of the Dowling-Wilson conjecture. We conjecture that they also satisfy the injective hard Lefschetz property and the Hodge-Riemann relations, and we prove these in degree one.</description>

      <title>Building sets, Chow rings, and their Hilbert series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish formulas for the Hilbert series of the Feichtner--Yuzvinsky Chow ring of a polymatroid using arbitrary building sets. For braid matroids and minimal building sets, our results produce new formulas for the Poincar\'e polynomial of the moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}$ of pointed stable rational curves, and recover several previous results by Keel, Getzler, Manin, and Aluffi--Marcolli--Nascimento. We also use our methods to produce examples of matroids and building sets for which the corresponding Chow ring has Hilbert series with non-log-concave coefficients. This contrasts with the real-rootedness and log-concavity conjectures of Ferroni--Schr\"oter for matroids with maximal building sets, and of Aluffi--Chen--Marcolli for braid matroids with minimal building sets.</description>

      <title>A self-avoiding curve associated with sums of digits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each $n\in N ^{\ast }$, we write $s_{n}=\left( 1,\ldots ,1,0\right) $ with $n$ times $1$. For each $a \in N$, we consider the binary representation $\left( a_{i}\right) _{i\in -N }$ of $a$ with $a_{i}=0$ for nearly each $i$; we denote by $\alpha _{n}(a)$ the number of integers $i$ such that $\left( a_{i}, \ldots ,a_{i+n} \right) =s_{n}$. We consider the curve $C_{n}=\left( S_{n,k}\right) _{k\in N ^{\ast }}$ which consists of consecutive segments of length $1$ such that, for each $k$, $S_{n,k+1}$ is obtained from $S_{n,k}$ by turning right if $k+\alpha _{n}(k)-\alpha _{n}(k-1)$ is even and left otherwise. $C_{1}$ is self-avoiding since it is the curve associated to the alternating folding sequence. In [1], M. Mend\`es France and J. Shallit conjectured that the curves $C_{n}$ for $n\geq 2$ are also self-avoiding. In the present paper, we show that this property is true for $n=2$. We also prove that $C_{2}$ has some properties similar to those which were shown in [2], [3] and [4] for folding curves.</description>

      <title>On graphs with a simple structure of maximal cliques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a hereditary graph class $\mathcal{G}$ is \emph{clique-sparse} if there is a constant $k=k(\mathcal{G})$ such that for every graph $G\in\mathcal{G}$, every vertex of $G$ belongs to at most $k$ maximal cliques, and any maximal clique of $G$ can be intersected in at most $k$ different ways by other maximal cliques.
  We provide various characterisations of clique-sparse graph classes, including a list of five parametric forbidden induced subgraphs. We show that recent techniques for proving induced analogues of Menger's Theorem and the Grid Theorem of Robertson and Seymour can be lifted to prove induced variants in clique-sparse graph classes when replacing ``treewidth'' by ''tree-independence number''.</description>

      <title>Modified Macdonald polynomials and the multispecies zero range process: II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous part of this work, we gave a new tableau formula for the modified Macdonald polynomials $\widetilde{H}_{\lambda}(X;q,t)$, using a weight on tableaux involving the \emph{queue inversion} (quinv) statistic. In this paper we explicitly describe a connection between these combinatorial objects and a class of multispecies totally asymmetric zero range processes (mTAZRP) on a ring, with site-dependent jump-rates. We construct a Markov chain on the space of tableaux of a given shape, which projects to the mTAZRP, and whose stationary distribution can be expressed in terms of quinv-weighted tableaux. We deduce that the mTAZRP has a partition function given by the modified Macdonald polynomial $\widetilde{H}_{\lambda}(X;1,t)$. The novelty here in comparison to previous works relating the stationary distribution of integrable systems to symmetric functions is that the variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ are explicitly present as hopping rates in the mTAZRP. We also obtain interesting symmetry properties of the mTAZRP probabilities under permutation of the jump-rates between the sites. Finally, we explore a number of interesting special cases of the mTAZRP, and give explicit formulas for particle densities and correlations of the process purely in terms of modified Macdonald polynomials.</description>

Abstract: We prove the universality of the large deviations for conjugacy invariant permutations with few cycles. As an application, we establish the universality of large deviation at speeds $n$ and $\sqrt{n}$ for the length of monotone subsequences in conjugacy invariant permutations, with a sharp control over the total number of cycles. This universality class includes the well-known Ewens measures.</description>

      <title>Duplicated Steiner triple systems with self-orthogonal near resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Steiner triple system, STS$(v)$, is a family of $3$-subsets (blocks) of a set of $v$ elements such that any two elements occur together in precisely one block. A collection of triples consisting of two copies of each block of an STS is called a duplicated Steiner triple system, DSTS. A resolvable (or near resolvable) DSTS is called self-orthogonal if every pair of distinct classes in the resolution has at most one block in common. We provide several methods to construct self-orthogonal near resolvable DSTS and settle the existence of such designs for all values of $v$ with only four possible exceptions. This addresses a recent question of Bryant, Davies and Neubecker.</description>

Abstract: We study the zero set of polynomials built from partition statistics, complementing earlier work in this direction by Boyer, Goh, Parry, and others. In particular, addressing a question of Males with two of the authors, we prove asymptotics for the values of $t$-hook polynomials away from an annulus and isolated zeros of a theta function. We also discuss some open problems and present data on other polynomial families, including those associated to deformations of Rogers-Ramanujan functions.</description>

      <title>The complexity of recognizing $ABAB$-free hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of geometric hypergraphs gave rise to the notion of $ABAB$-free hypergraphs. A hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is called $ABAB$-free if there is an ordering of its vertices such that there are no hyperedges $A,B$ and vertices $v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4$ in this order satisfying $v_1,v_3\in A\setminus B$ and $v_2,v_4\in B\setminus A$. In this paper, we prove that it is NP-complete to decide if a hypergraph is $ABAB$-free. We show a number of analogous results for hypergraphs with similar forbidden patterns, such as $ABABA$-free hypergraphs. As an application, we show that deciding whether a hypergraph is realizable as the incidence hypergraph of points and pseudodisks is also NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Improved Helly numbers of product sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite family $\mathcal F$ of convex sets is $k$-intersecting in $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ if the intersection of every subset of $k$ convex sets in $\mathcal F$ contains a point in $S$. The Helly number of $S$ is the minimum $k$, if it exists, such that every $k$-intersecting family contains a point of $S$ in its intersection. In this paper, we improve bounds on the Helly number of product sets of the form $A^d$ for various sets $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, including the ``exponential grid'' $A = \{\alpha^n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ and sets $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ defined by congruence relations.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits on 2-regular circulant digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic orbits (equivalence classes of closed paths up to cyclic shifts) play an important role in applications of graph theory. For example, they appear in the definition of the Ihara zeta function and exact trace formulae for the spectra of quantum graphs. Circulant graphs are Cayley graphs of $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Here we consider directed Cayley graphs with two generators (2-regular Cayley digraphs). We determine the number of primitive periodic orbits of a given length (total number of directed edges) in terms of the number of times edges corresponding to each generator appear in the periodic orbit (the step count). Primitive periodic orbits are those periodic orbits that cannot be written as a repetition of a shorter orbit. We describe the lattice structure of lengths and step counts for which periodic orbits exist and characterize the repetition number of a periodic orbit by its winding number (the sum of the step sequence divided by the number of vertices) and the repetition number of its step sequence. To obtain these results, we also evaluate the number of Lyndon words on an alphabet of two letters with a given length and letter count.</description>

      <title>The minimum edge-pancyclic graph of a given order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ of order $n$ is called edge-pancyclic if, for every integer $k$ with $3 \leq k \leq n$, every edge of $G$ lies in a cycle of length $k$. Determining the minimum size $f(n)$ of a simple edge-pancyclic graph with $n$ vertices seems difficult. Recently, Li, Liu and Zhan \cite{li2024minimum} gave both a lower bound and an upper bound of $f(n)$. In this paper, we improve their lower bound by considering a new class of graphs and improve the upper bound by constructing a family of edge-pancyclic graphs.</description>

      <title>Exceptional projections in finite fields: Fourier analytic bounds and incidence geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of bounding the number of exceptional projections (projections which are smaller than typical) of a subset of a vector space over a finite field onto subspaces. We establish bounds that depend on $L^p$ estimates for the Fourier transform, improving various known bounds for sets with sufficiently good Fourier analytic properties. The special case $p=2$ recovers a recent result of Bright and Gan (following Chen), which established the finite field analogue of Peres--Schlag's bounds from the continuous setting. We prove several auxiliary results of independent interest, including a character sum identity for subspaces (solving a problem of Chen) and a full generalization of Plancherel's theorem for subspaces. These auxiliary results also have applications in affine incidence geometry, that is, the problem of estimating the number of incidences between a set of points and a set of affine $k$-planes. We present a novel and direct proof of a well-known result in this area that avoids the use of spectral graph theory, and we provide simple examples demonstrating that these estimates are sharp up to constants.</description>

Abstract: It is proved that for any non-empty finite subset $Q$ of the square numbers, $
|Q+Q|\geq C'|Q|(\log |Q|)^{1/3+o(1)} $.
  This result essentially is proved -- with the same tools -- by Mei-Chu Chang. See in J. Funct. Anal. 207 (2004), no 2, 444-460.

      <title>Vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quasimap vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties. When the quiver varieties have isolated torus fixed points, we compute the coefficients of the vertex functions in the $K$-theoretic fixed point basis. We also give an explicit combinatorial description of zero-dimensional type $D$ quiver varieties and their vertex functions using the combinatorics of minuscule posets. Using Macdonald polynomials, we prove that these vertex functions can be expressed as products of $q$-binomial functions, which proves a degeneration of the conjectured 3d mirror symmetry of vertex functions. We provide an interpretation of type $D$ spin vertex functions as the partition functions of the half-space Macdonald processes of Barraquand, Borodin, and Corwin. This hints that the geometry of quiver varieties may provide new examples of integrable probabilistic models.</description>

      <title>$\lambda$-fold near-factorizations of groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations of groups with $\lambda &gt; 1$. While $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations of groups with $\lambda = 1$ have been studied in numerous papers, this is the first detailed treatment for $\lambda &gt; 1$. We establish fundamental properties of $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations and introduce the notion of equivalence. We prove various necessary conditions of $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations, including upper bounds on $\lambda$. We present three constructions of infinite families of $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations, highlighting the characterization of two subfamilies of $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations. We discuss a computational approach to $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations and tabulate computational results for abelian groups of small order.</description>

      <title>Convergence Laws for Extensions of First-Order Logic with Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For many standard models of random structure, first-order logic sentences exhibit a convergence phenomenon on random inputs. The most well-known example is for random graphs with constant edge probability, where the probabilities of first-order sentences converge to 0 or 1. In other cases, such as certain ``sparse random graph'' models, the probabilities of sentences converge, although not necessarily to 0 or 1. In this work we deal with extensions of first-order logic with aggregate operators, variations of averaging. These logics will consist of real-valued terms, and we allow arbitrary Lipschitz functions to be used as ``connectives''. We show that some of the well-known convergence laws extend to this setting.</description>
