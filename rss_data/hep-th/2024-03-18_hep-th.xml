Abstract: Thermal QCD systems like strongly coupled QGP require not only a large 't-Hooft coupling but also a finite gauge coupling arXiv:hep-ph/0701201. Unlike almost all top-down holographic models in the literature, holographic large-$N$ thermal QCD models based on this assumption, therefore necessarily require addressing this limit from ${\cal M}$ theory. In the context of strongly coupled (very large `t-Hooft coupling), bulk viscosity $\zeta$ of the type IIA-theory dual of thermal QCD-like theories was found to vary like $\frac{1}{3} - c_s^2$ arXiv:1807.04713 ($c_s$ being the speed of sound), and the same at weak coupling using kinetic theory and finite temperature field theory, was shown in arXiv:1807.04713 to vary like $\left(\frac{1}{3} - c_s^2\right)^2$. In this paper, we not only show that at intermediate coupling, $\zeta$ varies like a linear combination of the strong and weak coupling results, but also observe that this behavior is related to the existence of Contact 3-Structures that exists only at intermediate coupling effected by the intermediate-$N$ "MQGP" limit arXiv:2211.13186.</description>

      <title>Hidden Amplitude Zeros From Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Arkani-Hamed et al. proposed the existence of zeros in scattering amplitudes in certain quantum field theories including the cubic adjoint scalar theory Tr($\phi^3$), the $SU(N)$ non-linear sigma model (NLSM) and Yang-Mills (YM) theory. These hidden zeros are special kinematic points where the amplitude vanishes and factorizes into a product of lower-point amplitudes, similar to factorization near poles. In this letter, we show a close connection between the existence of such zeros and color-kinematics duality. In fact, all zeros can be derived from the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) relations. We also show that these zeros extend via the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) relations to special Galileon amplitudes and their corrections, evincing that these hidden zeros are also present in permutation-invariant amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Open EFT for Interacting Fermions from Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of an open EFT for finite-temperature holographic systems with interacting fermions. In particular, we do this for Yukawa interactions in the bulk using the real-time formalism (grSK geometry). From the bulk perspective, this study corresponds to Yukawa scattering against a black hole, incorporating the effects of Hawking radiation. We derive an EFT in the exterior of the black hole and thus develop a Witten diagrammatic understanding of the scattering processes. This allows the explicit evaluation of boundary Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) correlators to arbitrary order, at tree-level in the bulk. Here we present explicitly the SK generating functional up to four-point functions. Finally, we represent the correlators in a column-vector representation that manifests microscopic unitarity and thermality, with all the statistical factors neatly folded in.</description>

      <title>A differential representation for holographic correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a differential representation for holographic four-point correlators. In this representation, the correlators are given by acting differential operators on certain seed functions. The number of these functions is much smaller than what is normally seen in known examples of holographic correlators, and all of them have simple Mellin amplitudes. This representation establishes a direct connection between correlators in position space and their Mellin space counterpart. The existence of this representation also imposes non-trivial constraints on the structure of holographic correlators. We illustrate these ideas by correlators in ${\rm AdS}_5 \times {\rm S}^5$ and ${\rm AdS}_5 \times {\rm S}^3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how methods of number theory can be used to study anomalies in gauge quantum field theories in spacetime dimension two. To wit, the anomaly cancellation conditions for the abelian part of the local anomaly admit solutions if and only if they admit solutions in the reals and in the $p$-adics for every prime $p$ and we use this to build an algorithm to find all solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Scalar Field on Fuzzy de Sitter Space I. Field Modes and Vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a scalar field on a noncommutative model of spacetime, the fuzzy de Sitter space, which is based on the algebra of the de Sitter group $SO(1,d)$ and its unitary irreducible representations. We solve the Klein-Gordon equation in $d=2,4$ and show, using a specific choice of coordinates and operator ordering, that all commutative field modes can be promoted to solutions of the fuzzy Klein-Gordon equation. To explore completeness of this set of modes, we specify a Hilbert space representation and study the matrix elements (integral kernels) of a scalar field: in this way the complete set of solutions of the fuzzy Klein-Gordon equation is found. The space of noncommutative solutions has more degrees of freedom than the commutative one, whenever spacetime dimension is $d&gt;2$. In four dimensions, the new non-geometric, internal modes are parametrised by $S^2\times W$, where $W$ is a discrete matrix space. Our results pave the way to analysis of quantum field theory on the fuzzy de~Sitter space.</description>

      <title>An Exterior EFT for Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general conjecture for evaluating the multiple-discontinuity integrals that appear in real-time holography using gravitational Schwinger-Keldysh (grSK) geometry. Our conjecture is valid for arbitrary non-derivative interactions with any number of bulk tree-level exchanges. It is also consistent with a unitary exterior EFT at finite temperature with correct causal structure. We present a set of Feynman rules underlying this exterior EFT and illustrate it with the computation of four and five-point functions.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Pion amplitudes and low energy parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the Gauge Theory Bootstrap method proposed in our previous work [arXiv:2309.12402], we compute pion scattering phase shifts for all partial waves with angular momentum $\ell\le 3$ up to 2 GeV and calculate the low energy $\chi$PT coefficients $\bar{\ell}_{1,2,4,6}$. The method looks for the most general S-matrix that matches at low energy the tree level amplitudes of the non-linear sigma model and at high energy, QCD sum rules and form factors. This is a theoretical/numerical calculation that uses as only data the pion mass $m_\pi$, pion decay constant $f_\pi$ and the QCD parameters $N_c=3$, $N_f=2$, $m_q$ and $\alpha_s$. All results are in reasonable agreement with experiment. In particular, we find the $\rho(770)$, $f_2(1270)$ and $\rho(1450)$ resonances and some initial indication of particle production near the resonances. The interplay between the UV gauge theory and low energy pion physics is an example of a general situation where we know the microscopic theory as well as the effective theory of long wavelength fluctuations but we want to solve the strongly coupled dynamics at intermediate energies. The bootstrap builds a bridge between the low and high energy by determining the consistent S-matrix that matches both and provides, in this case, a new direction to understand the strongly coupled physics of gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Mode Recombination Formula and Nonanalytic Term in Effective Potential at Finite Temperature on Compactified Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new formula called a mode recombination formula, and we can recast the effective potential at finite temperature in one-loop approximation for fermion and scalar fields on the $D$-dimensional spacetime, $S_{\tau}^1\times R^{D-(p+1)}\times \prod_{i=1}^pS_i^1$ into a convenient form for discussing nonanalytic terms, which cannot be written in the form of any positive integer power of the field-dependent mass squared, in the effective potential. The formula holds irrespective of whether the field is a fermion or a scalar and of boundary conditions for spacial $S_i^1$ directions and clarifies the importance of zero modes in the Kaluza-Klein modes for the existence of the nonanalytic terms. The effective potential is drastically simplified further to obtain the nonanalytic terms in easier and more transparent way. In addition to reproducing previous results, we find that there exists no nonanalytic term for the fermion field with arbitrary boundary condition for the spacial $S_i^1$ direction, which is also the case for the scalar field with the antiperiodic boundary condition for the spacial direction.</description>

      <title>Duality as a Method to Derive a Gauge Invariant Massive Electrodynamics and New Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking into account the recent developments associated with duality in physics, this article is focused on investigating the properties of a tensor generalization of the electrodynamics dual to the standard vector model even considering the full radiative corrections. A discussion on duality is extended for non-linearly interacting models. The alternative tensor structure allows a new local self-interaction and also a partial gauge invariant mass term. In this way, the renormalization conditions, a new interaction, Ward-Takahashi identities for all the sets of gauge symmetries, and the Schwinger-Dyson quantum equations are carefully provided to consistently characterize the propagating modes of the quantum system. The possibility of this gauge invariant massive extension is considered from the perspective of a generalized Stueckelberg procedure for higher derivative systems.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic quantum Vlasov equation in spinor QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonadiabatic quantum Vlasov equation in spinor QED is derived, and its relation to the well-known adiabatic one is established by three methods. One is by an explicitly analytical expression, the second is by the Dirac equation in the V gauge, and the last is by introducing a turn-off electric field. Wherein what the first two of them are given is an instantaneous relation. Moreover, the time evolution of the distribution function for a specific momentum and the momentum distribution of created particle pairs after turning off the electric field are calculated and compared with those in scalar QED. It is found that both the oscillation periods of the distribution functions in spinor and scalar QED equal pi divided by the total energy of a particle after the electric field is turned off. The momentum distributions in spinor and scalar QED show a novel oscillation and out-of-phase behavior that cannot be explained by the Stokes phenomenon. These findings will further deepen our understanding of the quantum Vlasov equation and its application in vacuum pair production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Poincar\'e symmetry can be contracted in two ways to yield the Galilei symmetry and the Carroll symmetry. The Schr\"odinger equation exhibits the Galilei symmetry and is a fundamental equation in Galilean quantum mechanics. However, the question remains: what is the quantum equation that corresponds to the Carroll symmetry? In this paper, we derive a novel equation, called the Carroll-Schr\"odinger equation, which describes the quantum dynamics in the Carrollian framework. We also introduce the Carroll-Schr\"odinger algebra, which is a conformal extension of the centrally extended Carroll algebra, and show that it is the symmetry algebra of the Carroll-Schr\"odinger equation in two dimensions. We generalize our results to arbitrary dimensions and discuss some possible applications and extensions of our work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proposed that random wide neural networks near Gaussian process are quantum field theories around Gaussian fixed points. In this paper, we provide a novel map with which a wide class of quantum mechanical systems can be cast into the form of a neural network with a statistical summation over network parameters. Our simple idea is to use the universal approximation theorem of neural networks to generate arbitrary paths in the Feynman's path integral. The map can be applied to interacting quantum systems / field theories, even away from the Gaussian limit. Our findings bring machine learning closer to the quantum world.</description>

      <title>Gedanken Experiments to Destroy a Black Hole by a Test Particle: Multiply Charged Black Hole with Higher Derivative Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a gedanken experiment to destroy an extremally charged black hole by dropping a test particle, provided that there are multiple $U(1)$ gauge fields coupled with each other through higher derivative interactions. In the absence of higher derivative corrections, it is known that the Coulomb repulsion prevents a test particle that would break the extremal condition from falling into an extremal black hole and therefore the black hole cannot be destroyed. We extend this observation to include higher derivative corrections. Although the extremal condition is modified by the higher derivative interactions, we find that the repulsive force induced by the higher derivative couplings is responsible for preventing a test particle that would break the modified extremal condition to reach the event horizon. Thus, we confirm that the weak cosmic censorship conjecture holds for extremally charged black holes even in the presence of higher derivative corrections, as long as the test particle approximation is justified.</description>

Abstract: We discuss giant graviton expansions for the Schur index of ${\cal N}=4$ $U(N)$ SYM with the insertion of Wilson lines of the fundamental and the anti-fundamental representations. We first propose a double-sum giant graviton expansion and numerically confirm that it correctly reproduces the line-operator index. We also find that it reduces to a simple-sum expansion when we treat the index as a Taylor series with respect to a specific fugacity.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes of Near-Extremal Electric and Magnetic Black Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge-gravity duality provides a robust mathematical framework for studying the behavior of strongly coupled non-abelian plasmas both near and far away from thermodynamic equilibrium. In particular, their near-equilibrium transport coefficients such as viscosity, conductivity, diffusion constants, etc. can be determined from poles of the retarded Green's function which are the dissipative eigenmodes i.e., the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the dual gravitational field equations. The AdS5/CFT4 correspondence admits the description of a strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}$= 4 Supersymmetric Yang Mills (SYM) plasma at non-zero temperature as a dual AdS5 black brane geometry. We demonstrate the application of pseudospectral methods to solving the dual Einstein field equations using the example of homogenous isotropization in $\mathcal{N}$= 4 SYM plasma far from equilibrium. Using this framework, we also compute the quasinormal modes of electrically (Reissner-Nordstrom) and magnetically charged AdS5 black branes for the case of vanishing spatial momenta. The near-extremal behavior of these QNMs is analyzed for both types of black branes.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic correction to the entropy of black holes in STU supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leading quantum-gravitational correction to the black hole entropy is known to be a universal logarithmic term. In this study, we investigate the logarithmic corrections for the black holes in the STU supergravity models, which are a bosonic truncation into a specific class of $U(1)^2$-charged Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. We demonstrate how the entire Kerr-Newman-AdS and Kerr-Newman family of black holes can be recovered within the gauged and ungauged STU supergravity models as special embedding choices in 4D. Logarithmic corrections are computed using two distinct Euclidean quantum gravity setups for extremal and non-extremal limits of all embedded rotating, static, charged, and neutral black holes. Our calculations employ the on-shell heat kernel method based Seeley-DeWitt expansion computations. Notably, all the AdS$_4$ results exhibit a confirmed non-topological nature as compared to the flat counterparts, offering a natural and more comprehensive "infrared window into the microstates'' of black holes.</description>

We apply the schemes to space-time rotated modified Korteweg-de Vries systems and, exploiting their integrability, to Hamiltonian systems built from space-time rotated inverse Legendre transformed higher-order charges of these systems. We derive the equal-time Poisson bracket structures of these theories, establish the integrability of the latter theories by means of the Painlev\'e test and construct exact analytical period benign solutions in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions to the classical equations of motion. The classical energies of these partially complex solutions are real when they respect a certain modified CPT-symmetry and complex when this symmetry is broken. The higher order Cauchy and initial-boundary value problem are addressed analytically and numerically. Finally, we provide the explicit quantization of the simplest mKdV system, exhibiting the usual conundrum of having the choice between either having to deal with a theory that includes non-normalizable states or spectra that are unbounded from below. In our non-Hermitian system the choice is dictated by the correct sign in the decay width.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Universality of the Penrose Limit of Black Hole Photon Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the physics of photon rings in a wide range of axisymmetric black holes admitting a separable Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the geodesics. Utilizing the Killing-Yano tensor, we derive the Penrose limit of the black holes, which describes the physics near the photon ring. The obtained plane wave geometry is directly linked to the frequency matrix of the massless wave equation, as well as the instabilities and Lyapunov exponents of the null geodesics. Consequently, the Lyapunov exponents and frequencies of the photon geodesics, along with the quasinormal modes, can be all extracted from a Hamiltonian in the Penrose limit plane wave metric. Additionally, we explore potential bounds on the Lyapunov exponent, the orbital and precession frequencies, in connection with the corresponding inverted harmonic oscillators and we discuss the possibility of photon rings serving as holographic horizons in a holographic duality framework for astrophysical black holes. Our formalism is applicable to spacetimes encompassing various types of black holes, including stationary ones like Kerr, Kerr-Newman, as well as static black holes such as Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om, among others.</description>

      <title>With a Little Help from Photons: Quantum Field Theory on Continuous-Variable Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We delve into the use of photonic quantum computing to simulate quantum mechanics and extend its application towards quantum field theory. We develop and prove a method that leverages this form of Continuous-Variable Quantum Computing (CVQC) to reproduce the time evolution of quantum-mechanical states under arbitrary Hamiltonians, and we demonstrate the method's remarkable efficacy with various potentials. Our method centres on constructing an evolver-state, a specially prepared quantum state that induces the desired time-evolution on the target state. This is achieved by introducing a non-Gaussian operation using a measurement-based quantum computing approach, enhanced by machine learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel framework in which these methods can be extended to encode field theories in CVQC without discretising the field values, thus preserving the continuous nature of the fields. This opens new avenues for quantum computing applications in quantum field theory.</description>

Abstract: In these lectures, we review the status of the Curci-Ferrari model as a phenomenological approach to Landau gauge-fixed YM theories in the infrared. More precisely, after discussing some of the general properties of the model, we explain in full detail the evaluation of the one-loop two-point correlators that allowed for a successful comparison to the corresponding Landau-gauge lattice data. We also review the renormalization group flow of the model which controls its fate at high and low momentum scales.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics on (mini)superspace, or a non-linear extension of quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We outline the content and theoretical support for the proposal of "hydrodynamics on (mini)superspace" (or a non-linear extension of quantum cosmology) as an effective framework for quantum gravity in a cosmological context. The basis for the proposal is a general correspondence between hydrodynamics and cosmology, and a picture of the universe as a quantum gravity condensate. The support comes from several directions. One is from mathematical physics: the hydrodynamics of quantum fluids can be mapped to relativistic cosmological dynamics, and both share the same conformal symmetries, which can be unraveled via geometric methods in superspace. The second is that the proposed framework is realized in quantum gravity formalisms like group field theory, in which an emergent cosmological dynamics can be extracted from the hydrodynamics of fundamental quantum simplices in a condensate phase. The same proposal can be motivated from the idea of 3rd quantization of gravity and from recent work on quantum cosmology, as an effective way of incorporating topology changing processes or cosmological inhomogeneities, respectively. A key conceptual ingredient is the relational understanding of space and time, which makes superspace the natural arena for gravitational dynamics, as opposed to the "spacetime" manifold, together with the general idea of emergent spacetime. The proposal and the results supporting it suggest an exciting dialogue between quantum gravity, the theory of quantum fluids and cosmology, as well as a new direction for analogue gravity simulations in the lab.</description>

      <title>A Search for Classical Subsystems in Quantum Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoherence and einselection have been effective in explaining several features of an emergent classical world from an underlying quantum theory. However, the theory assumes a particular factorization of the global Hilbert space into constituent system and environment subsystems, as well as specially constructed Hamiltonians. In this work, we take a systematic approach to discover, given a fixed Hamiltonian, (potentially) several factorizations (or tensor product structures) of a global Hilbert space that admit a quasi-classical description of subsystems in the sense that certain states (the "pointer states") are robust to entanglement. We show that every Hamiltonian admits a pointer basis in the factorization where the energy eigenvectors are separable. Furthermore, we implement an algorithm that allows us to discover a multitude of factorizations that admit pointer states and use it to explore these quasi-classical "realms" for both random and structured Hamiltonians. We also derive several analytical forms that the Hamiltonian may take in such factorizations, each with its unique set of features. Our approach has several implications: it enables us to derive the division into quasi-classical subsystems, demonstrates that decohering subsystems do not necessarily align with our classical notion of locality, and challenges ideas expressed by some authors that the propensity of a system to exhibit classical dynamics relies on minimizing the interaction between subsystems. From a quantum foundations perspective, these results lead to interesting ramifications for relative-state interpretations. From a quantum engineering perspective, these results may be useful in characterizing decoherence free subspaces and other passive error avoidance protocols.</description>

      <title>Stability and Dynamics of f(Q,B) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the cosmological implications of a modified $f(Q, B)$ gravity model, incorporating both the nonmetricity scalar ($Q$) and the boundary term ($B$). A generic connection ($\Gamma_{\mu \nu}^{\alpha}$) has been used to define the four-dimensional metric tensor and the covariant derivative ($\nabla_{\mu}$). Statistical analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques constrains the $H(z)$ model free parameters based on observational data from the Cosmic Chronometers (CC) sample, the extended Pantheon$^+$ dataset, and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements. This analysis clarifies the deceleration and Equation of State (EoS) parameters and reveals a smooth transition from a deceleration to an accelerating expansion phase on the evolution history of the Universe. The most intriguing finding is identifying a stable critical point within the dynamical system of the model. This critical point corresponds to the de Sitter phase, a well-known era of accelerated expansion. The stability of the critical point suggests that, under specific initial conditions, the trajectory of the Universe will inherently be drawn towards and remain within the de Sitter phase. This aligns with the current observations, indicating Universe dominated by dark energy (DE) and undergoing late-time accelerated expansion.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from a nonspherical density profile with a misaligned deformation tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the numerical simulation of primordial black hole formation from a nonspherical profile of the initial curvature perturbation $\zeta$. We consider the background expanding universe filled with the perfect fluid with the linear equation of state $p=w\rho$ ($w=1/3$ or $1/5$), where $p$ and $\rho$ are the pressure and the energy density, respectively. The initial condition is set in a way such that the principal directions of the second derivatives of $\zeta$ and $\triangle \zeta$ at the central peak are misaligned, where $\triangle$ is the Laplacian. In this setting, since the linearized density is proportional to $\triangle \zeta$, the inertia tensor and deformation tensor $\partial_i\partial_j \zeta$ are misaligned. Thus tidal torque may act and the spin of a resultant primordial black hole would be non-zero in general, although it is estimated to be very small from previous perturbative analyses.As a result, we do not find a finite value of the spin within our numerical precision, giving support for the negligibly small value of the black hole spin for $1/5\lesssim w \lesssim 1/3$. More specifically, our results suggest that the dimensionless PBH spin $s$ is typically so small that $s\ll0.1$ for $w\gtrsim0.2$.</description>

Abstract: A proposal for an improved theoretical model to illuminate the quantum nature of gravity is given. This model investigates the gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) phenomena, circumventing classical communication constraints of LOCC principle. Here a non-relativistic two dimensional quantum oscillator detector is coupled to linearly polarized gravitational waves (GWs). Exploiting the quantum nature of GWs, we observe the GIE within the oscillator quantum states. Since the model satisfies ``event'' as well as ``system'' localities, the observed GIE is much robust signature for quantum nature of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have proven effective in image generation and have gained widespread usage; however, the underlying factors contributing to the performance disparity between stochastic and deterministic (i.e., the probability flow ODEs) sampling schemes remain unclear. We introduce a novel formulation of diffusion models using Feynman's path integral, which is a formulation originally developed for quantum physics. We find this formulation providing comprehensive descriptions of score-based generative models, and demonstrate the derivation of backward stochastic differential equations and loss functions.The formulation accommodates an interpolating parameter connecting stochastic and deterministic sampling schemes, and we identify this parameter as a counterpart of Planck's constant in quantum physics. This analogy enables us to apply the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) expansion, a well-established technique in quantum physics, for evaluating the negative log-likelihood to assess the performance disparity between stochastic and deterministic sampling schemes.</description>

Abstract: In view to scrutinise the idea that nonlocal modifications of \GR~could dynamically address the dark energy problem, we investigate the evolution of the Universe at infrared scales as an \IDG~model of the Ricci scalar, without introducing the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ or any scalar field. The accelerated expansion of the late Universe is shown to be compatible with the emergence of nonlocal gravitational effects at sufficiently low energies. A technique for circumventing the mathematical complexity of the nonlocal cosmological equations is explained and, after drawing a connection with the Starobinsky gravity, verifiable predictions are considered, like a possible decreasing in the strength of the effective gravitational constant.</description>

Abstract: We consider massive scalar field perturbations in the background of black holes immersed in Chaplygin-like dark fluid (CDF), and we analyze the photon sphere modes as well as the de Sitter modes and discuss their dominance, by using the pseudospectral Chebyshev method and the third order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. We also discuss the impact of the parameter representing the intensity of the CDF on both families of quasinormal modes. Mainly, we find that the propagation of a massive scalar field is stable in this background, and it is characterized by quasinormal frequencies with a smaller oscillation frequency and a longer decay time compared to the propagation of the same massive scalar field within the Schwarzschild-de Sitter background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Panic-induced herding in individuals often leads to social disasters, resulting in people being trapped and trampled in crowd stampedes triggered by panic. We introduce a novel approach that offers fresh insights into studying the phenomenon of asymmetrical panic-induced escape. Our approach is based on the concept of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB), a fundamental governing mechanism in the Physical Sciences. By applying the principles of SSB, we elucidate how asymmetrical panic-induced herding in individuals occurs. We highlight that understanding panic escape and preventing catastrophic situations can be achieved through two crucial parameters: "population density" control and "communication (or information transfer)" among individuals in a crowd. The interplay of these two parameters is responsible for either breaking or restoring the symmetry of a system. We describe how these parameters are set by design conditions as well as crowd control. Based on these parameters, we discuss strategies for preventing potential social disasters caused by asymmetrical panic escape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unique Nature of the Lorentz group in four dimensions is the root cause of the many remarkable properties of the Einstein spacetimes, in particular their operational structure on the 2-forms. We show how this operational structure can be used for two ends. First, it allows for a simple generalization of the Birkhoff theorem to Schwarzschild (A)de-Sitter spacetime. Second, it provides the means to construct an Abelian endomorphism group on the space of 2-forms. It is observed that taking the trace over this group element-wise induces a further Abelian group which may be identified with a tensor representation of conformal transformations, giving Einstein spacetimes access to their own conformal equivalence class. A further trace over the group yields the curvature invariants of the spacetime. The Kretschmann scalar becomes the topological Euler density, which may be linked in a simple way to the Hawking temperature of horizons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtained new hairy black hole solutions in Einstein-scalar theory, including asymptotic flat, de Sitter and anti-de Sitter black holes. The theory is inspired by Ref. [1], where traversable wormhole solutions from an Einstein-phantom scalar theory are constructed. In this work, we found new black hole solutions in an Einstein-normal scalar theory. Comparing with Schwarzschild metric, the hairy black holes have two interesting properties: i) the areas of the black holes are always smaller than the same mass Schwarzschild black holes; ii) A naked singularity with positive mass arises when the black hole mass decreases. The energy conditions for the black holes and naked singularities are checked. We found that, as hairy black holes, the null energy condition(NEC) and the strong energy condition(SEC) are hold, while the weak energy condition(WEC) is violated in the vicinity of black hole horizon. The naked singularity respects to all three energy conditions. We also investigate the quasinormal modes(QNMs) of the hairy black holes by a test scalar field. The results indicate that one can distinguish hairy black holes with the same mass Schwarzschilid black hole by their QNM spectra.</description>

      <title>Loop Special Relativity: Kaluza-Klein area metric as a line element for stringy events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let a physical event constitute a simple loop in spacetime. This in turn calls for a generalized loop line element (= distance$^2$ between two neighboring loops) capable of restoring, at the shrinking loop limit, the special relativistic line element (= distance$^2$ between the two neighboring center-of-masses, respectively). Sticking at first stage to a flat Euclidean/Minkowski background, one is led to such a preliminary loop line element, where the role of coordinates is played by the oriented cross-sections projected by the loop event. Such cross-sections are generically center-of-mass independent, unless (owing to a topological term) the loop events are intrinsically wrapped around a Kaluza-Klein like compact fifth dimension. Serendipitously, it is the Kaluza-Klein ingredient which, on top of its traditional assignments, is shown to govern the extension of Pythagoras theorem to loop space. Associated with $M_4 \otimes S_1$ is then a 10-dim loop spacetime metric, whose 4-dim center-of-mass core term is supplemented by a 6-dim Maxwell-style fine structure. The imperative inclusion of a positive (say Nambu-Goto) string tension within the framework of Loop Special Relativity is fingerprinted by a low periodicity breathing mode. Nash global isometric embedding is conjectured to play a major role in the construction of Loop General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Quantum reference frames, measurement schemes and the type of local algebras in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an operational framework, combining relativistic quantum measurement theory with quantum reference frames (QRFs), in which local measurements of a quantum field on a background with symmetries are performed relative to a QRF. This yields a joint algebra of quantum-field and reference-frame observables that is invariant under the natural action of the group of spacetime isometries. For the appropriate class of quantum reference frames, this algebra is parameterised in terms of crossed products. Provided that the quantum field has good thermal properties (expressed by the existence of a KMS state at some nonzero temperature), one can use modular theory to show that the invariant algebra admits a semifinite trace. If furthermore the quantum reference frame has good thermal behaviour (expressed by the existence of a KMS weight) at the same temperature, this trace is finite. We give precise conditions for the invariant algebra of physical observables to be a type $\textnormal{II}_1$ factor. Our results build upon recent work of Chandrasekaran, Longo, Penington and Witten [JHEP 2023, 82 (2023)], providing both a significant mathematical generalisation of these findings and a refined operational understanding of their model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.00211v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical systems which can be described by classical fields in classical theory, can also be described by quantum states in quantum field theory. We study the correspondence between the classical field and the quantum state which both describe the same physical systems. We derive the quantum states corresponding to the classical field in the representation expanded by the eigenstates of quantum field operators. This allows us to directly observe the spatial entanglement structure of quantum states and explore the differences and relationships between quantum superposition and classical superposition. We find that if two classical fields are identical in a certain spatial region, then their corresponding quantum states have the same reduced density matrix in that region. This indicates that knowing the classical field in a local region is sufficient to immediately derive the reduced density matrix for that region. According to the correspondence between classical observables and quantum states, we derive the equation of motion in classical theory from the evolution of quantum states in Yukawa theory. This leads to the relativistic classical Yukawa theory, and we further obtain relativistic corrections to the Yukawa potential.</description>

      <title>On Type IIA AdS$_3$ solutions and massive GK geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.09532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give the necessary and sufficient conditions for warped AdS$_3$ (and Mink$_3$) solutions of Type II supergravities to preserve ${\cal N}=(2,0)$ supersymmetry, in terms of geometric conditions on their internal space M$_7$. Such solutions possess a canonical ten-dimensional Killing vector that can be either time-like or null. In this work we classify the null case in massive Type IIA supergravity which necessitates that M$_7$ decomposes as a circle fibration over a six-dimensional base with orthogonal SU(2)-structure containing a complex four-manifold. We narrow our focus to solutions for which M$_7$ becomes $\mathbb{T}^2$ fibred over a foliation of a K\"{a}hler manifold over an interval. We find a class of solutions which are the massive Type IIA version of GK geometries and present an extremal problem which computes the central charge of the solution using just topology. Finally, we present geometric conditions for AdS$_3$ solutions to preserve arbitrary extended chiral supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Communication protocols and QECCs from the perspective of TQFT, Part I: Constructing LOCC protocols and QECCs from TQFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) provide a general, minimal-assumption language for describing quantum-state preparation and measurement. They therefore provide a general language in which to express multi-agent communication protocols, e.g. local operations, classical communication (LOCC) protocols. Here we construct LOCC protocols using TQFT, and show that LOCC protocols generically induce quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs). Using multi-observer scenarios described by quantum Darwinism and Bell/EPR experiments as examples, we show how these LOCC-induced QECCs effectively convert entanglement into classical redundancy. In the accompanying Part II, we show that such QECCs can be regarded as implementing, or inducing the emergence of, spacetimes on the boundaries between interacting systems. We investigate this connection between inter-agent communication and spacetime using BF and Chern-Simons theories, and then using topological M-theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the superaction for the $T\overline{T}$ deformation of 2D free $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ supersymmetric model with a deformed superfield. We show that the $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ off-shell supersymmetry in the free theory is deformed under the $T\overline{T}$ deformation, which is incorporated in the deformed superfield. We interpret this superaction as an effective action of the Goldstone superfield for the partial spontaneous breaking of $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetry to $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$. We show that the unbroken and broken supersymmetry of the effective superaction corresponds to the off-shell $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ supersymmetry and the off-shell fermi global non-linear symmetry in the $T\overline{T}$-deformed theory, respectively. We demonstrate that this effective superaction can be obtained by the non-linear realization of the partially broken global supersymmetry~(PBGS) from the coset superspace. Furthermore, we reproduce the superaction by the constrained superfield method accompanied by a field redefinition.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct the wedge holography in the presence of homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformation. We observe that the DGP term is the reason for the existence of non-zero tension of the Karch-Randall branes in Yang-Baxter deformed wedge holography. The homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformation introduce non-trivial island surfaces inside the black hole horizon whose entanglement entropy is lower than the twice of thermal entropy of the black hole. Therefore, we obtain the Page curve even without the DGP term on the Karch-Randall branes due to the homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformation in the context of wedge holography. Finally, we compute the the holographic complexity in homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformed $AdS_2$ background.</description>

We apply this to the 3d-3d correspondence and provide a Lagrangian description of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories $T[M_3]$ with 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ boundary conditions for 3-manifolds $M_3$ in several contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider turbulence of waves that interact weakly via four-wave scattering (sea waves, plasma waves, spin waves, and many others). In the first non-vanishing order in the interaction, the occupation number of waves satisfy a closed kinetic equation which has stationary solutions describing turbulent cascades. We show that a straightforward perturbation theory beyond the kinetic equation gives terms that generally diverge both at small (IR) and large (UV) wavenumbers for a direct cascade. The analysis up to the third order identifies the most UV-divergent terms. In order to gain qualitative analytic control, we sum a subset of the most UV divergent term, to all orders, giving a perturbation theory which is generally free from UV divergence, showing that turbulence becomes independent of the dissipation scale when it goes to zero. On the contrary, the ever-present IR divergence means that the effective coupling is parametrically larger than the naive estimate and grows with the pumping scale (similar to anomalous scaling in fluid turbulence). This suggests that the kinetic equation does not describe wave turbulence even of arbitrarily small level if the cascade is sufficiently long. We show that the character of strong turbulence is determined by the sign of the coupling, that is, whether the effective four-wave interaction is enhanced or suppressed by collective effects. The enhancement possibly signals that strong turbulence is dominated by multi-wave bound states (solitons, shocks, cusps), similar to confinement in quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Symplectic formulation of the type IIB scalar potential with U-dual fluxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a symplectic formulation of the $N =1$ four-dimensional type IIB scalar potential arising from a flux superpotential which has four S-dual pairs of fluxes demanded by the U-dual completion arguments. Our symplectic formulation presents a very compact and concise way of expressing the generic scalar potential in just a few terms via using a set of symplectic identities along with the so-called ``axionic-flux" combinations. We demonstrate the utility of our symplectic master-formula by considering an underlying four-dimensional type IIB supergravity model based on a ${\mathbb T}^6/({\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2)$ orientifold, in which the scalar potential induced by the U-dual flux superpotential results in a total of 76276 terms involving 128 flux parameters. Given that our symplectic formulation does not need the information about the metric of the internal background, it is applicable to the models beyond the toroidal compactifications such as to those which use orientifolds of the Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate multifield models in which the two-field BNRT model is coupled to a third field through mediator functions in the Lagrangian density. To conduct the investigation, we obtain the equations of motion and develop a first-order formalism based on energy minimization. Two possibilities are considered: i) the third field acting in the mediator functions to modify the BNRT solutions; ii) the BNRT fields feeding the mediator function to produce effects in the kink solution of the third field. In the case i), the results show that the solutions may be related to the standard ones with the coordinate redefined in terms of the mediator functions if they are equal. This allows to induce effects similar to geometric constrictions in the core, or to compactify the tail of the BNRT solutions. If the mediator functions differ one from another, we show that the effects are distinct, with the compactification of just one of the two-field solutions. In the case ii), the orbit parameter of the model plays an important role, modifying the mediator function that induces changes in the profile of the kink associated to the third field.</description>

Abstract: Non-relativistic quantum field theory is a framework that describes systems where the velocities are much smaller than the speed of light. A large class of those obey Schr\"{o}dinger invariance, which is the equivalent of the conformal symmetry in the relativistic world. In this review, we pedagogically introduce the main theoretical tools used to study non-relativistic physics: null reduction and $c \rightarrow \infty$ limits, where $c$ is the speed of light. We present a historical overview of non-relativistic wave equations, Jackiw-Pi vortices, the Aharonov-Bohm scattering, and the trace anomaly for a Schr\"{o}dinger scalar. We then review modern developments, including fermions at unitarity, the quantum Hall effect, off-shell actions, and a systematic classification of the trace anomaly. The last part of this review is dedicated to current research topics. We define non-relativistic supersymmetry and a corresponding superspace to covariantly deal with quantum corrections. Finally, we define the Spin Matrix Theory limit of the AdS/CFT correspondence, which is a non-relativistic sector of the duality obtained via a decoupling limit, where a precise matching of the two sides can be achieved.</description>

Abstract: Anomalous symmetries are known to strongly constrain the possible IR behavior along any renormalization group (RG) flow. Recently, the extension of the notion of symmetry in QFT has provided new types of anomalies with a corresponding new class of constraints on RG flows. In this paper, we derive the constraints imposed on RG flows from anomalies that can only be activated in the presence of specific background fluxes even though they do not necessarily correspond to a symmetry. We show that such anomalies can only be matched by gapped theories that exhibit either spontaneous symmetry breaking or symmetry fractionalization. In addition, we exhibit previously unstudied examples of these flux background anomalies that arise in $4d$ QCD and $4d$ SUSY QCD.</description>

Abstract: We compute the form factors of the order and disorder operators, together with those of the stress-energy tensor, of the two-dimensional three-state Potts model with vacancies along its thermal deformation of the critical point. At criticality the model is described by the non-diagonal partition function of the unitary minimal model $\mathcal{M}_{6,7}$ of conformal field theories and is accompanied by an internal $S_3$ symmetry. Its off-critical thermal deformation is an integrable massive theory which is still invariant under $S_3$. The presence of infinitely many conserved quantities, whose spin spectrum is related to the exceptional Lie algebra $E_6$, allows us to determine the analytic $S$-matrix, the exact mass spectrum and the matrix elements of local operators of this model in an exact non-perturbative way. We use the spectral representation series of the correlators and the fast convergence of these series to compute several universal ratios of the renormalization group.</description>

Abstract: In this work we present the $\alpha'$-exact background equations of motion of the bosonic chiral string (also known as Hohm-Siegel-Zwiebach model), with the spin two ghost fields integrated out. This is the first instance of a worldsheet model in which all corrections are fully determined in a generic curved spacetime. As a concrete cross-check, we find complete agreement between all three-point and a sample of four-point tree level scattering amplitudes computed using field theory methods and the chiral string prescription. These equations of motion provide a field theoretical shortcut to compute worldsheet correlators in conventional bosonic strings (with arbitrary number of massless and mass level one states), and outline a new perspective on massive resonances in string theory.</description>

Abstract: A longstanding enigma within AdS/CFT concerns the entanglement entropy of holographic quantum fields in Rindler space. The vacuum of a quantum field in Minkowski spacetime can be viewed as an entangled thermofield double of two Rindler wedges at a temperature $T=1/2\pi$. We can gradually disentangle the state by lowering this temperature, and the entanglement entropy should vanish in the limit $T\to 0$ to the Boulware vacuum. However, holography yields a non-zero entanglement entropy at arbitrarily low $T$, since the bridge in the bulk between the two wedges retains a finite width. We show how this is resolved by bulk quantum effects of the same kind that affect the entropy of near-extremal black holes. Specifically, a Weyl transformation maps the holographic Boulware states to near-extremal hyperbolic black holes. A reduction to an effective two-dimensional theory captures the large quantum fluctuations in the geometry of the bridge, which bring down to zero the density of entangled states in the Boulware vacuum. Using another Weyl transformation, we construct unentangled Boulware states in de Sitter space.</description>

Abstract: Is string theory uniquely determined by self-consistency? Causality and unitarity seemingly permit a multitude of putative deformations, at least at the level of two-to-two scattering. Motivated by this question, we initiate a systematic exploration of the constraints on scattering from higher-point factorization, which imposes extraordinarily restrictive sum rules on the residues and spectra defined by a given amplitude. These bounds handily exclude several proposed deformations of the string: the simplest "bespoke" amplitudes with tunable masses and a family of modified string integrands from "binary geometry." While the string itself passes all tests, our formalism directly extracts the three-point amplitudes for the low-lying string modes without the aid of worldsheet vertex operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the survey initiated in arXiv:2012.14197 to explore the Bethe/Gauge correspondence between supersymmetric SO/Sp gauge theories in 2d/3d/4d and open spin chain with integrable boundaries. We collect the known Bethe ansatz equations of different types of spin chains with general boundaries that have been analyzed in the literature, and compare them with the vacua equations of the quiver gauge theories. It seems that not all the vacua equations of quiver gauge theory with BCD-type gauge groups can be realized as some known Bethe ansatz equations of integrable spin chain models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm to recursively bootstrap $n$-point gluon and graviton Mellin-Momentum amplitudes in (A)dS spacetime using only three-point amplitude. We discover that gluon amplitudes are simply determined by factorization for $n\geq 5$. The same principle applies to $n$-point graviton amplitudes, but additional constraints such as flat space and soft limits are needed to fix contact terms. Furthermore, we establish a mapping from $n$-point Mellin-Momentum amplitudes to $n$-point cosmological correlators. We efficiently compute explicit examples up to five points. This leads to the first five-graviton amplitude in $AdS_{d+1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Wilson line defect half-indices of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric $SU(N)$ Chern-Simons theories of level $k\le -N$ with Neumann boundary conditions for the gauge fields, together with 2d Fermi multiplets and fundamental 3d chiral multiplets to cancel the gauge anomaly. We derive some exact results and also make some conjectures based on expansions of the $q$-series. We find several interesting connections with special functions known in the literature, including Rogers-Ramanujan functions for which we conjecture integral representations, and the appearance of Appell-Lerch sums for certain Wilson line half-index grand canonical ensembles which reveal an unexpected appearance of mock modular functions. We also find intriguing $q$-difference equations relating half-indices to Wilson line half-indices. Some of these results also have a description in terms of a dual theory with Dirichlet boundary conditions for the vector multiplet in the dual theory.</description>

      <title>Giant graviton expansion of Schur index and quasimodular forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flavored superconformal Schur index of $\mathcal N=4$ $U(N)$ SYM has finite $N$ corrections encoded in its giant graviton expansion in terms of D3 branes wrapped in $AdS_{5}\times S^{5}$. The key element of this decomposition is the non-trivial index of the theory living on the wrapped brane system. A remarkable feature of the Schur limit is that the brane index is an analytic continuation of the flavored index of $\mathcal N=4$ $U(n)$ SYM, where $n$ is the total brane wrapping number. We exploit recent exact results about the Schur index of $\mathcal N=4$ $U(N)$ SYM to evaluate the closed form of the the brane indices appearing in the giant graviton expansion. Away from the unflavored limit, they are characterized by quasimodular forms providing exact information at all orders in the index universal fugacity. As an application of these results, we present novel exact expressions for the giant graviton expansion of the unflavored Schur index in a class of four dimensional $\mathcal N=2$ theories with equal central charges $a=c$, i.e. the non-Lagrangian theories $\widehat{\Gamma}(SU(N))$ with $\Gamma = E_{6}, E_{7}, E_{8}$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the restricted phase space (RPS) thermodynamics for charged AdS black holes by considering the impact of quantum gravity on the event horizon area. The primary aim of this work is to elucidate the influence of quantum gravitational effects on thermodynamic behaviors, critical phenomena, phase transitions, and the stability of black holes. We observe that charged AdS black holes exhibit thermodynamic behavior similar to that of Van der Waals fluids when influenced by quantum gravity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel black hole thermodynamic phenomenon, which we term ``resistance of phase transitions". Our study uncovers a violation of the homogeneity property of the Smarr relation in RPS thermodynamics due to the effects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Existence of a weak-disorder non-Fermi liquid fixed point in the hydrodynamic regime of two-dimensional nematic quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.08442v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Role of quenched randomness in metallic quantum criticality is one of the long standing problems in condensed matter physics. An aspect of the fundamental difficulties lies in the fact that such nonmagnetic disorders lead effective interactions between abundant soft modes near the Fermi surface to be drastically enhanced particularly in the diffusive regime, where the perturbative framework does not work. Here, we revisit the problem of dirty quantum critical metals in a different angle, focusing on the hydrodynamic regime instead of the diffusive regime near the non-Fermi liquid quantum critical point. More concretely, we study effects of mutual correlations between quantum critical nematic fluctuations and weak localization corrections, and show the existence of a weak-disorder non-Fermi liquid fixed point, based on the renormalization group (RG) analysis up to the two-loop order. The two-loop order RG analysis suggests that the absence of quantum coherence in two-particle composite excitations weakens the role of weak localization corrections and allows a weakly disordered non-Fermi liquid metallic state in the hydrodynamic regime of the nematic quantum critical point. Although this dirty non-Fermi liquid metallic state may not be the true infrared stable fixed point at zero temperature, expected to be characterized by the diffusive Ohmic regime, we argue that this weak-disorder non-Fermi liquid metallic fixed point would govern the region of an intermediate energy scale, described by effective hydrodynamics of nematic quantum criticality. In this respect we believe that this research would be an important step in understanding the $T-$linear electrical resistivity as a characteristic feature of non-Fermi liquids and the origin of unconventional superconductivity from effective hydrodynamics of quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Putting Flat $\Lambda$CDM In The (Redshift) Bin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology is specified by two constant fitting parameters at the background level in the late Universe, the Hubble constant $H_0$ and matter density (today) $\Omega_m$. Mathematically, $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$ are either integration constants arising from solving ordinary differential equations or are directly related to integration constants. Seen in this context, if fits of the $\Lambda$CDM model to cosmological probes at different redshifts lead to different $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ parameters, this is a mismatch between mathematics and observation. Here, in mock observational Hubble data (OHD) (geometric probes of expansion history) we demonstrate evolution in distributions of best fit parameters with effective redshift. As a result, considerably different $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ best fits from Planck-$\Lambda$CDM cannot be precluded in high redshift bins. We explore if OHD, Type Ia supernovae and standardisable quasar samples exhibit redshift evolution of best fit $\Lambda$CDM parameters. In all samples, we confirm a decreasing $H_0$ and increasing $\Omega_m$ trend with increasing bin redshift. Through comparison with mocks, we confirm that similar behaviour can arise randomly within the flat $\Lambda$CDM model with probabilities as low as $p = 0.0021$ ($3.1 \, \sigma$). We present complementary profile distribution analysis confirming the shifts in cosmological parameters in high redshift bins. In particular, we identify a redshift range where Planck $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ values are disfavoured at $99.6 \%$ ($2.9 \sigma$) confidence level in a combination of OHD and supernovae data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Torsion polynomials connect the genus of a hyperbolic knot (a topological invariant) with the discrete faithful representation (a geometric invariant). Using a new combinatorial structure of an ideal triangulation of a 3-manifold that involves edges as well as faces, we associate a polynomial to a cusped hyperbolic manifold that conjecturally agrees with the $\BC^2$-torsion polynomial, which conjecturally detects the genus of the knot. The new combinatorics is motivated by super-geometry in dimension 3, and more precisely by super-Ptolemy assignments of ideally triangulated 3-manifolds and their $\mathrm{OSp}_{2|1}(\BC)$-representations. Extended section 4, and added superalgebras with a single odd generator.</description>

      <title>Shadows of a generic class of spherically symmetric, static spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the characteristics of shadows for a general class of spherically symmetric, static spacetimes, which may arise in general relativity or in modified theories of gravity. The chosen line element involves a sum (with constant but different coefficients) of integer powers of $\frac{1}{\text{r}}$ in $\text{g}_\text{tt}$ and $\text{g}_\text{rr}$, in the Schwarzschild gauge. We begin our discussion by motivating the line element through a study of the energy conditions (null and weak) and the extent to which they are satisfied/violated for diverse choices of the parameters appearing in the metric functions. Subsequently, we construct the circular shadows and analyse the dependence of the shadow radius on the metric parameters. We find that with specific choices of the metric parameters (within the ranges allowed by the energy conditions) one can, in principle, obtain values that conform with recent observations on shadows, as available in the literature. We also mention where such metrics may arise (i.e., in which theory of gravity and the physical scenario therein), thereby proposing that the observed shadows may be representative signatures of different theoretical contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work derives 5 methods to evaluate families of odd zeta values by combining a power of $\pi$ with Lambert series whose ratios of successive terms tend to $e^{-\pi\sqrt{a}}$ with integers $a\ge7$, outperforming Ramanujan's results with merit $a=4$. Families with $a=7$ and $a=8$ evaluate $\zeta(2n+1)$. Families with $a=9$ and $a=16$ evaluate $\zeta(4n+1)$ with faster convergence. A fifth family with $a=12$ evaluates $\zeta(6n+1)$ and gives the fastest convergence for $\zeta(6n+7)$. Members of three of the families were discovered empirically by Simon Plouffe. An intensive new search strongly suggests that there are no more than 5 families with integers $a\ge7$. There are at least 18 families that involve involve Lambert series with rational $a&gt;4$. Quasi-modular transformations of Lambert series resolve rational sequences that were discovered empirically. Expansions of Lambert series in polylogarithms, familiar from quantum field theory, provide proofs of all known evaluations with rational merit $a&gt;4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider an extension of the symmetric teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR), namely, $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity, by including a boundary term $\mathbb{B}_Q$, where $\mathbb{Q}$ is the non-metricity scalar. More specifically, we explore static and spherically symmetric black hole and regular black hole solutions in $f(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{B}_Q)$ gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED). In particular, to obtain black hole solutions, and in order to ensure that our solutions preserve Lorentz symmetry, we assume the following relation $f_Q = -f_B$, where $f_{Q}=\partial f/\partial\mathbb{Q}$ and $f_{B}= \partial f/\partial\mathbb{B}_Q$. We develop three models of black holes, and as the starting point for each case we consider the non-metricity scalar or the boundary term in such a way to obtain the metric functions $A(r)$. Additionally, we are able to express matter through analytical solutions for specific NLED Lagrangians ${\cal L}_{\rm NLED}(F)$. Furthermore, we also obtain generalized solutions of the Bardeen and Culetu types of regular black holes, by imposing specific metric functions.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the emergence of quantum state designs in systems with symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state designs, by enabling an efficient sampling of random quantum states, play a quintessential role in devising and benchmarking various quantum protocols with broad applications ranging from circuit designs to black hole physics. Symmetries, on the other hand, are expected to reduce the randomness of a state. Despite being ubiquitous, the effects of symmetry on quantum state designs remain an outstanding question. The recently introduced projected ensemble framework generates efficient approximate state t-designs by hinging on projective measurements and many-body quantum chaos. In this work, we examine the emergence of state designs from the random generator states exhibiting symmetries. Leveraging on translation symmetry, we analytically establish a sufficient condition for the measurement basis leading to the state t-designs. Then, by making use of the trace distance measure, we numerically investigate the convergence to the designs. Subsequently, we inspect the violation of the sufficient condition to identify bases that fail to converge. We further demonstrate the emergence of state designs in a physical system by studying the dynamics of a chaotic tilted field Ising chain with periodic boundary conditions. We find faster convergence of the trace distance in the initial time, however, it saturates to a finite value deviating from random matrix prediction at a late time, in contrast to the case with open boundary condition. To delineate the general applicability of our results, we extend our analysis to other symmetries. We expect our findings to pave the way for further exploration of deep thermalization and equilibration of closed and open quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: We give a computability result for open Gromov-Witten invariants based on open WDVV equations. This is analogous to the result of Kontsevich-Manin for closed Gromov-Witten invariants. For greater generality, we base the argument on a formal object, the Frobenius superpotential, that generalizes several different definitions of open Gromov-Witten invariants. As an application, we prove vanishing properties for open Gromov-Witten invariants on products of projective spaces.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we offer the dynamical system analysis of the DBI (Dirac-Born-Infeld) scalar field in a modified $f(Q)$ gravity context. We have taken a polynomial form of modified gravity and used two different kinds of scalar potential, i.e., polynomial and exponential, and found a closed autonomous dynamical system of equations. We have analyzed the fixed points of such a system and commented on the conditions under which deceleration to late-time acceleration happens in this model. We have noted the similarity of the two models and have also shown that our result is indeed consistent with the previous work done on Einstein's gravity. We have also investigated the phenomenological implications of our models by plotting the EoS ($\omega$), Energy density ($\Omega$), and deceleration parameter ($q$) w.r.t. to e-fold time and comparing with the present value. Finally, we conclude the paper by observing how the dynamical system analysis differs in modified $f(Q)$ gravity, and we also provide some of the future scope of our work.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Microscopy: Tomography and Entanglement Measures via Quantum Monte Carlo</title>

Abstract: We develop a protocol, dubbed entanglement microscopy, to obtain the full reduced density matrix associated with subregions in quantum Monte Carlo simulations for bosonic and fermionic manybody systems. Our microscopy allows to perform quantum state tomography, and thus gives access to true entanglement measures, such as the logarithmic negativity (LN). We exemplify our method by studying the phase diagram near quantum critical points (QCP) in 2 spatial dimensions: the transverse field Ising model and a Gross-Neveu-Yukawa transition of Dirac fermions. Our main results are: i) the Ising QCP exhibits short-range entanglement with a finite sudden death of the LN both in space and temperature; ii) the Gross-Neveu QCP has a power-law decaying fermionic LN consistent with conformal field theory (CFT) exponents; iii) going beyond bipartite entanglement, we find no detectable 3-party entanglement in a large parameter window near the Ising QCP in 2d, in contrast to 1d. We also analytically obtain the large-temperature power law scaling of the fermionic LN for general interacting systems. Our approach allows one to perform quantum state tomography locally in a way that is analogous to atomic-scale imaging with a scanning tunneling microscope. Controlled entanglement microscopy opens a new window into quantum matter, with countless systems waiting to be explored.</description>

      <title>New quasi-Einstein metrics on a two-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct all axi-symmetric non-gradient $m$-quasi-Einstein structures on a two-sphere. This includes the spatial cross-section of the extreme Kerr black hole horizon corresponding to $m=2$, as well as a family of new regular metrics with $m\neq 2$ given in terms of hypergeometric functions. We also show that in the case $m=-1$ with vanishing cosmological constant the only orientable compact solution in dimension two is the flat torus, which proves that there are no compact surfaces with a metrisable affine connection with skew Ricci tensor.</description>
