      <title>On Tempered Ultradistributions in Classical Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inclusion of tempered ultradistributions (or functions of slow growth) in the notion of classical Sobolev spaces. We investigate basically the properties of tempered ultradistribution spaces in Sobolev spaces. Our new Sobolev space preserving the original properties and condition whose derivatives are linear continuous operators embedding in $L^p$ for $1\leq p\leq \infty$ is characterized. Moreover, we also consider some Sobolev embedding theorems involving rapidly decreasing functions, and finally, we prove the extension of Rellich's compactness theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of windowed linear canonical transform in biquaternion setting namely Biquaternion Windowed Linear Canonical Transform (BiQWLCT) and various properties of BiQWLCT, such as linearity, shift, parity, orthogonality relation, inversion formula, Plancherel theorem are established. Heisenberg uncertainty principle associated with the Biquaternion Windowed Linear Canonical Transform is also derived.

      <title>Covering $B_X$ by finitely many convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite covering by closed convex sets of $B_X$, the unit ball of an infinite-dimensional Banach space, we investigate whether there is a set of the covering that contains balls of radius close to $1$ and (a) arbitrarily high finite dimension or (b) infinite dimension. In case (a) the answer is affirmative, but for the case (b) we just get radius close to $1/2$ and finite codimension under much more restrictive hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Jordan and Lie derivations of $\phi $-Johnson amenable Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let U be a $\phi $-Johnson amenable Banach algebra in which $\phi$ is a non-zero multiplicative linear functional on U. Suppose that X is a Banach U-bimodule such that $a.x=\phi(a)x$ for all a in U and x in X or $x.a=\phi(a)x$ for all a in U and x in X. We show that every continuous Jordan derivation from U to X is a derivation, and every continuous Lie derivation from U to X decomposed into the sum of a continuous derivation and a continuous center-valued trace.</description>

      <title>Singular multipliers on multiscale Zygmund sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an Orlicz space $ L^2 \subseteq X \subseteq L^1$ on $[0,1]$, with submultiplicative Young function ${\mathrm{Y}_X}$, we fully characterize the closed null sets $\Xi$ of the real line with the property that H\"ormander-Mihlin or Marcinkiewicz multiplier operators $\mathrm{T}_m$ with singularities on $\Xi$ obey weak-type endpoint modular bounds on $X$ of the type
  \[
  \left|\left\{x\in \mathbb R : |\mathrm{T}_m f(x)| &gt;\lambda\right\}\right| \leq C \int_{\mathbb R} \mathrm{Y}_X \left(\frac{|f|}{\lambda}\right), \qquad \forall \lambda&gt;0.
  \] These sets $\Xi$ are exactly those enjoying a scale invariant version of Zygmund's $(L\sqrt{\log L},{L^2})$ improving inequality with $X$ in place of the former space, which is termed multiscale Zygmund property. Our methods actually yield sparse and quantitative weighted estimates for the Fourier multipliers $\mathrm{T}_m$ and for the corresponding square functions.
  In particular, our framework covers the case of singular sets $\Xi$ of finite lacunary order and thus leads to modular and quantitative weighted versions of the classical endpoint theorems of Tao and Wright for Marcinkiewicz multipliers. Moreover, we obtain a pointwise sparse bound for the Marcinkiewicz square function answering a recent conjecture of Lerner. On the other hand, examples of non-lacunary sets enjoying the multiscale Zygmund property for each $X=L^p$, $1&lt;p\leq 2$ are also covered.
  The main new ingredient in the proofs is a multi-frequency, multi-scale projection lemma based on Gabor expansion, and possessing independent interest.</description>

      <title>Approximation Theory of Tree Tensor Networks: Tensorized Multivariate Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.11932v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the approximation of multivariate functions with tensor networks (TNs). The main conclusion of this work is an answer to the following two questions: ``What are the approximation capabilities of TNs?" and "What is an appropriate model class of functions that can be approximated with TNs?"
  To answer the former, we show that TNs can (near to) optimally replicate $h$-uniform and $h$-adaptive approximation, for any smoothness order of the target function. Tensor networks thus exhibit universal expressivity w.r.t. isotropic, anisotropic and mixed smoothness spaces that is comparable with more general neural networks families such as deep rectified linear unit (ReLU) networks. Put differently, TNs have the capacity to (near to) optimally approximate many function classes -- without being adapted to the particular class in question.
  To answer the latter, as a candidate model class we consider approximation classes of TNs and show that these are (quasi-)Banach spaces, that many types of classical smoothness spaces are continuously embedded into said approximation classes and that TN approximation classes are themselves not embedded in any classical smoothness space.</description>

      <title>Computerized Tomography and Reproducing Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The X-ray transform is one of the most fundamental integral operators in image processing and reconstruction. In this article, we revisit the formalism of the X-ray transform by considering it as an operator between Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). Within this framework, the X-ray transform can be viewed as a natural analogue of Euclidean projection. The RKHS framework considerably simplifies projection image interpolation, and leads to an analogue of the celebrated representer theorem for the problem of tomographic reconstruction. It leads to methodology that is dimension-free and stands apart from conventional filtered back-projection techniques, as it does not hinge on the Fourier transform. It also allows us to establish sharp stability results at a genuinely functional level (i.e. without recourse to discretization), but in the realistic setting where the data are discrete and noisy. The RKHS framework is versatile, accommodating any reproducing kernel on a unit ball, affording a high level of generality. When the kernel is chosen to be rotation-invariant, explicit spectral representations can be obtained, elucidating the regularity structure of the associated Hilbert spaces. Moreover, the reconstruction problem can be solved at the same computational cost as filtered back-projection.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e--Sobolev Inequalities Based on Choquet--Lorentz Integrals with Respect to Hausdorff Contents on Bounded John Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded John domain in $\mathbb R^n$ with $n\ge 2$, and let $\mathcal{H}_{\infty }^{\delta}$ denote the Hausdorff content of dimension $\delta\in (0,n]$. In this article, the authors prove the Poincar\'e and the Poincar\'e--Sobolev inequalities on Choquet--Lorentz integrals with respect to $\mathcal{H}_{\infty }^{\delta}$ for all continuously differentiable functions on $\Omega$. These results not only extend the recent Poincar\'e and Poincar\'e--Sobolev inequalities, obtained by Harjulehto and Hurri-Syrj\"{a}nen in [J. Funct. Anal. 284 (2023), Paper No. 109862], to the Choquet--Lorentz integrals, but also provide some endpoint estimates (weak type) of their results in the critical case. One of the main novelties exists in that, to achieve the goals, the authors develop some new tools associated with Choquet--Lorentz integrals on $\mathcal{H}_{\infty }^{\delta}$, such as the fractional Hardy--Littlewood maximal inequality and the Hedberg-type pointwise estimate on the Riesz potential. As an application, the sharp boundedness of the Riesz potential on Choquet--Lorentz integrals is obtained. Moreover, even for classical Lorentz integrals, these Poincar\'e and Poincar\'e--Sobolev inequalities are also new.</description>

      <title>The Choquet-Deny Property for Groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A countable discrete group is called Choquet-Deny if for any non-degenerate probability measure on the group, the corresponding space of bounded harmonic functions is trivial. Building on the previous work of Jaworski, a complete characterization of Choquet-Deny groups was recently achieved by Frisch, Hartman, Tamuz, and Ferdowski. In this article, we extend the study of the Choquet-Deny property to the framework of discrete measured groupoids. Our primary result offers a complete characterization of this property in terms of the isotropy groups and the equivalence relation associated with the given groupoid. Additionally, we use the implications derived from our main theorem to classify the Choquet-Deny property of transformation groupoids.</description>

      <title>Universality and sharp matrix concentration inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.05142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, under mild assumptions, the spectrum of a sum of independent random matrices is close to that of the Gaussian random matrix whose entries have the same mean and covariance. This nonasymptotic universality principle yields sharp matrix concentration inequalities for general sums of independent random matrices when combined with the Gaussian theory of Bandeira, Boedihardjo, and Van Handel. A key feature of the resulting theory is that it is applicable to a broad class of random matrix models that may have highly nonhomogeneous and dependent entries, which can be far outside the mean-field situation considered in classical random matrix theory. We illustrate the theory in applications to random graphs, matrix concentration inequalities for smallest singular values, sample covariance matrices, strong asymptotic freeness, and phase transitions in spiked models.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality and Decay of $p$-Hardy Weights on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct optimal Hardy weights to subcritical energy functionals $h$ associated with quasilinear Schr\"odinger operators on locally finite graphs. Here, optimality means that the weight $w$ is the largest possible with respect to a partial ordering, and that the corresponding shifted energy functional $h-w$ is null-critical. Moreover, we show a decay condition of Hardy weights in terms of their integrability with respect to certain integral weights. As an application of the decay condition, we show that null-criticality implies optimality near infinity. We also briefly discuss an uncertainty-type principle and a Rellich-type inequality.</description>

      <title>Stability of solutions of stationary Boussinesq systems on weak-Morrey spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we establish the asymptotic stability of steady solutions for the Boussinesq systems in the framework of Cartesian product of critical weak-Morrey spaces on $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $n \geqslant 3$. In our strategy, we first establish the continuity for the long time of the bilinear terms associated with the mild solutions of the Boussinesq systems, i.e., the bilinear estimates by using only the norm of the present spaces. As a direct consequence, we obtain the existence of global small mild solutions and asymptotic stability of steady solutions of the Boussinesq systems in the class of continuous functions from $[0, \infty)$ to the Cartesian product of critical weak-Morrey spaces. Our techniques consist interpolation of operators, duality, heat semigroup estimates , Holder and Young inequalities in block spaces (based on Lorentz spaces) that are preduals of Morrey-Lorentz spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first paper in a series that studies smooth relative Lie algebra homologies and cohomologies based on the theory of formal manifolds and formal Lie groups. In this paper, we lay the foundations for this study by introducing the notion of formal manifolds in the context of differential geometry, inspired by the notion of formal schemes in algebraic geometry. We develop the basic theory for formal manifolds, and establish a fully faithful contravariant functor from the category of formal manifolds to the category of topological $\mathbb{C}$-algebras. We also prove the existence of finite products in the category of formal manifolds by studying vector-valued formal functions.</description>
