      <title>A new class of positive linear operators preserving logarithmic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new class of positive linear operators that generalize the classical Bernstein operators. Specifically, we construct a sequence of operators that reproduce the logarithmic function $\ln(1+\mu+x)$, with $\mu &gt; 0$ and $x \in [0,1]$. We prove pointwise and uniform convergence and we derive a quantitative estimate of the approximation error in terms of the modulus of continuity. We also obtain a Voronovskaja-type asymptotic formula, that is used to establish saturation results and inverse theorems. In particular, the saturation class of the considered approximation process is characterized by solving a second order differential equation. Shape-preserving properties, such as monotonicity, concavity and variation diminishing, are also investigated. Finally, a simple application to signal denoising is addressed.</description>

      <title>A Multiplicative Neural Network Architecture: Locality and Regularity of Appriximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a multiplicative neural network architecture in which multiplicative interactions constitute the fundamental representation, rather than appearing as auxiliary components within an additive model. We establish a universal approximation theorem for this architecture and analyze its approximation properties in terms of locality and regularity in Bessel potential spaces.
  To complement the theoretical results, we conduct numerical experiments on representative targets exhibiting sharp transition layers or pointwise loss of higher-order regularity. The experiments focus on the spatial structure of approximation errors and on regularity-sensitive quantities, in particular the convergence of Zygmund-type seminorms. The results show that the proposed multiplicative architecture yields residual error structures that are more tightly aligned with regions of reduced regularity and exhibits more stable convergence in regularity-sensitive metrics.
  These results demonstrate that adopting a multiplicative representation format has concrete implications for the localization and regularity behavior of neural network approximations, providing a direct connection between architectural design and analytical properties of the approximating functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the sharp constants in the $L^2$-Caffarelli--Kohn--Nirenberg (or $L^2$-CKN for short) inequalities on Euclidean spaces, we study, in a unified framework, a sequence of $L^2$-CKN inequalities on metric measure spaces. On a general metric measure space, this sequence implies a reverse volume comparison of G\"unther type. Moreover, on a subclass of spaces admitting the measure contraction property, we show that this sequence of $L^2$-CKN inequalities are valid if and only if the spaces are volume cones. We also provide a stability result for inequalities of this type on volume cones.</description>

      <title>Process-Based Lagrange Multipliers for Nonconvex Set-Valued Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Lagrange multiplier theory for nonconvex set-valued optimization problems under Lipschitz-type regularity conditions. Instead of classical continuous linear functionals, we introduce closed convex processes -- set-valued mappings whose graphs are closed convex cones -- as generalized Lagrange multipliers. This geometric framework extends separation principles beyond convexity and differentiability. We establish the existence of multiplier processes under verifiable assumptions, including Lipschitz regularity at a reference point, the existence of a bounded base of the ordering cone, and a nondegeneracy condition ensuring proper isolation of optimal values. These processes preserve global optimality: nondominated (respectively, minimal) solutions of the primal problem remain nondominated (respectively, minimal) in the penalized problem. In the scalar case, we obtain a one-to-one correspondence between multiplier processes and lower semicontinuous sublinear functions, yielding exact penalty formulations without additional constraint qualifications. An infinite-dimensional example shows that interiority conditions on the ordering cone, while sufficient, are not necessary. Applications to set-valued vector equilibrium problems are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Talagrand-type transport inequalities for path spaces over Carnot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Talagrand-type transportation inequalities for the law of Brownian motion on Carnot groups. An important example is the lift of standard Brownian motion to the Brownian rough path. We present a direct proof on enhanced path space, which also yields equality when restricting to adapted couplings in the transport problem. Moreover, we prove a Talagrand inequality for the heat kernel measure on Carnot groups and deduce the inequality for the law of Brownian motion on Carnot groups via a bottom-up argument. Our study of this enhanced Wiener measure contributes to a longstanding programme to extend key properties of Wiener measure to the non-commutative setting of the enhanced Wiener measure, which is of central importance in Lyons' rough path theory. With a non-commutative sub-Riemannian state space, we observe phenomena that differ from the Euclidean case. In particular, while a top-down projection argument recovers Talagrand's inequality on Euclidean space from the corresponding inequality on the path space, such a projection argument breaks down in the Carnot group setting. We further study a Riemannian approximation of the Heisenberg group, in which case the failure of the top-down projection can be partially overcome. Finally, we show that the cost function used in the Talagrand inequality is a natural choice, in that it arises as a limit of discretised costs in the sense of $\Gamma$-convergence.</description>

      <title>C*-like modules and matrix $p$-operator norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalization of H\"older duality to algebra-valued pairings via $L^p$-modules. H\"older duality states that if $p \in (1, \infty)$ and $p^{\prime}$ are conjugate exponents, then the dual space of $L^p(\mu)$ is isometrically isomorphic to $L^{p^{\prime}}(\mu)$. In this work we study certain pairs $(\mathsf{Y},\mathsf{X})$, as generalizations of the pair $(L^{p^{\prime}}(\mu), L^p(\mu))$, that have an $L^p$-operator algebra valued pairing $\mathsf{Y} \times \mathsf{X} \to A$. When the $A$-valued version of H\"older duality still holds, we say that $(\mathsf{Y},\mathsf{X})$ is C*-like. We show that finite and countable direct sums of the C*-like module $(A,A)$ are still C*-like when $A$ is any block diagonal subalgebra of $d \times d$ matrices. We provide counterexamples when $A \subset M_d^p(\mathbb{C})$ is not block diagonal.</description>

      <title>Characterisations of Sobolev spaces and constant functions over metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a doubling metric measure space $(X,\rho,\mu)$ supporting a Poincar\'e inequality, we give a new characterisation of first-order Sobolev spaces by mean oscillations, and extend previous characterisations of constant functions in terms of the finiteness of certain integrals through a new approach. As a key tool of independent potential, we introduce a novel ``macroscopic'' Poincar\'e inequality, whose right-hand side has oscillations of the same form as the left-hand side, but at a smaller macroscopic scale $r\in(0,R)$.
  Besides intrinsic interest, these results are motivated by applications to quantitative compactness properties of commutators $[f,T]$ of pointwise multipliers and singular integrals. With pivotal use of the present results, a characterisation of commutator mapping properties, over the same class of general domains $(X,\rho,\mu)$, is obtained in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Maximal non-compactness of embeddings between sequence spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We will focus on studying the ball measure of non-compactness $\alpha(T)$ for various particular instances of embedding operators in sequence spaces. Our first main goal is to find necessary and sufficient conditions for an identity operator to be maximally non-compact. Next, we will focus on studying Lorentz sequence spaces $\ell^{p,q}$ and their basic properties. We will characterize the inclusions between Lorentz sequence spaces depending on the values of $p$ and $q$. Then we will try to determine exact values of the norms of the identity operators between these embedded spaces. Lastly, we will determine whether these identity operators are maximally non-compact by using our general theorems.</description>

      <title>On five questions of Bourin and Lee: symmetric moduli and an Euler operator identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We answer five questions posed by Bourin and Lee on symmetric moduli and related orbit inequalities in \cite{BL26}, and thereby obtain a sequence of sharp results for matrices and compact operators. We first show that the isometry-orbit identity behind the matrix weighted parallelogram law cannot be extended beyond the parameter range $0\le x\le1$, and that a counterexample already exists in dimension one.Next, we prove that the exponent $2$ in the Bourin--Lee unitary-orbit estimate for the quadratic symmetric modulus is optimal in every dimension $n\ge2$ by constructing an explicit $2\times2$ counterexample for all $p&gt;2$.We then construct a compact operator $Z$ for which the associated singular-value inequality fails for every $p&gt;2$, in fact for a fixed choice of indices. We also settle a Thompson-type triangle problem for symmetric moduli: the inequality fails for the arithmetic symmetric modulus but holds for the quadratic symmetric modulus.Finally, we develop isometry-orbit refinements of an Euler operator identity and derive sharp Clarkson--McCarthy type inequalities for Schatten $p$-norms, together with further consequences for unitarily invariant norms and singular values.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Psi(x,y)$ denote the count of $y$-smooth numbers below $x$ and $P(n)$ denote the largest prime factor of $n$. We prove that for $f$ a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, the partial sums over $y$-smooth numbers always enjoy better than squareroot cancellation, in the sense that $$ \mathbb{E} \Big|\sum_{\substack{1\leq n \leq x\\ P(n) \leq y}} f(n) \Big| = o\left( \Psi(x,y)^{1/2} \right),$$ uniformly on the entire range $ 2 \leq y \leq x$. The bounds are quantitative and give a large saving when $y$ isn't too close to $x$.</description>

      <title>Metrics on completely positive maps via noncommutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study methods of inducing metrics on unital completely positive maps by employing seminorms arising in noncommutative geometry. Our main approach relies on the development of an infinite-dimensional $C^*$-algebraic analogue of the Choi-Jamio\l{}kowski isomorphism. Under suitable conditions, we show that the induced metrics satisfy the quantum information theoretic properties of stability and chaining. Moreover, we show how to generate such metrics using constructions native to noncommutative geometry, by for example using external Kasparov products of spectral triples.</description>
