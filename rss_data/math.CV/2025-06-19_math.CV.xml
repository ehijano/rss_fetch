      <title>Intersection numbers between horizontal foliations of quadratic differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that the intersection number between the horizontal foliations of any two finite-area holomorphic quadratic differentials on an arbitrary Riemann surface is finite. Our main result shows that the intersection number is jointly continuous in the $L^1$-norm on the quadratic differentials. A corollary is that the Jenkins-Strebel differentials are not dense in the space of all finite-area holomorphic quadratic differentials when the infinite Riemann surface is not parabolic.</description>

      <title>Using Real-Variable Techniques to Study Zeros of Complex-Valued Harmonic Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the zeros of two one-parameter families of harmonic functions and describe how the number of zeros depends on the parameter. Our functions have the property that all zeros lie on certain rays in the complex plane and thus we are able to use real-variable techniques to count the zeros on each ray.</description>

      <title>The Hexablock: a domain associated with the $\mu$-synthesis in $M_2(\mathbb C)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a new domain in $\mathbb C^4$, namely the hexablock $\mathbb{H}$ that arises in connection with a special case of the $\mu$-synthesis problem in $M_2(\mathbb C)$. Previous attempts to study a few instances of the $\mu$-synthesis problem led to domains such as symmetrized bidisc $\mathbb G_2$, tetrablock $\mathbb E$ and pentablock $\mathbb P$. Throughout, the relations of $\mathbb{H}$ with these three domains are explored. Several characterizations of the hexablock are established. We determine the distinguished boundary $b \mathbb{H}$ of $\mathbb{H}$ and obtain a subgroup of the automorphism group of $\mathbb{H}$. The \textit{rational $\overline{\mathbb{H}}$-inner functions}, i.e., the rational functions from the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ to $\mathbb{H}$ that map the boundary of $\mathbb{D}$ to $b\mathbb{H}$ are characterized. We obtain a Schwarz lemma for $\mathbb{H}$. Finally, it is shown that $\mathbb{G}_2$, $\mathbb{E}$, and $\mathbb{P}$ are analytic retracts of $\mathbb{H}$. By an application of the theory of the hexablock, we find alternative proofs to a few existing results on geometry and function theory of the pentablock.</description>

      <title>On uniformly lightness of ring mappings and convergence to a homeomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of mappings is called uniformly light if the image of the continuum under these mappings cannot be contracted to a point under the sequence of mappings of the family. In this paper, we are interested in the problem of the uniform lightness of a family of homeomorphisms satisfying upper moduli inequalities. We have shown that a family of such homeomorphisms satisfies the above-mentioned condition of uniform lightness if the majorant participating in the modulus estimate defining the family is integrable over almost all spheres. Under the same conditions, we show that this family of homeomorphisms is uniformly open, i.e., their image contains a ball of fixed radius, independent of each mapping separately. As an application of the results obtained, we have proved the assertion about the uniform convergence of homeomorphisms to a homeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Segre forms of singular metrics on vector bundles and Lelong numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E\to X$ be a holomorphic vector bundle with a singular Griffiths negative Hermitian metric $h$ with analytic singularities. One can define, given a smooth reference metric $h_0$, a current $s(E,h,h_0)$ that is called the associated Segre form, which defines the expected Bott-Chern class and coincides with the usual Segre form of $h$ where it is smooth. We prove that $s(E,h,h_0)$ is the limit of the Segre forms of a sequence of smooth metrics if the metric is smooth outside the unbounded locus, and in general as a limit of Segre forms of metrics with empty unbounded locus. One can also define an associated Chern form $c(E,h,h_0)$ and we prove that the Lelong numbers of $s(E,h,h_0)$ and $c(E,h,h_0)$ are integers if the singularities are integral, and non-negative for $s(E,h,h_0)$. We also extend these results to a slightly larger class of singular metrics with analytic singularities.</description>

      <title>Analytic Schur multipliers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in this paper analytic Schur multipliers on ${\Bbb C}_+^2$ and ${\Bbb D}^2$, i.e. Schur multipliers on ${\Bbb R}^2$ and ${\Bbb T}^2$ that are boundary-value functions of functions analytic in ${\Bbb C}_+^2$ and ${\Bbb D}^2$. Such Schur multipliers are important when studying properties of functions of maximal dissipative operators and contractions under perturbation. We show that if the boundary-value function of a Schur multiplier has certain regularity properties, then it can be represented as an element of the Haagerup tensor product of spaces of analytic functions with similar regularity properties.</description>

      <title>Weighted Szeg\H{o} Kernels on Planar Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study properties of weighted Szeg\H{o} and Garabedian kernels on planar domains. Motivated by the unweighted case as explained in Bell's work, the starting point is a weighted Kerzman-Stein formula that yields boundary smoothness of the weighted Szeg\H{o} kernel. This provides information on the dependence of the weighted Szeg\H{o} kernel as a function of the weight. When the weights are close to the constant function $1$ (which corresponds to the unweighted case), it is shown that some properties of the unweighted Szeg\H{o} kernel propagate to the weighted Szeg\H{o} kernel as well. Finally, it is shown that the reduced Bergman kernel and higher order reduced Bergman kernels can be written as a rational combination of three unweighted Szeg\H{o} kernels and their conjugates, thereby extending Bell's list of kernel functions that are made up of simpler building blocks that involve the Szeg\H{o} kernel.</description>

      <title>Singular cscK metrics on smoothable varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the lower semi-continuity of the coercivity threshold of Mabuchi functional along a degenerate family of normal compact K\"ahler varieties with klt singularities. Moreover, we establish the existence of singular cscK metrics on $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein smoothable klt varieties when the Mabuchi functional is coercive, these arise as a limit of cscK metrics on close-by fibres. The proof relies on developing a novel strong topology of pluripotential theory in families and establishing uniform estimates for cscK metrics.</description>

      <title>Exponential actions defined by vector configurations, Gale duality, and moment-angle manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exponential actions defined by vector configurations provide a universal framework for several constructions of holomorphic dynamics, non-Kaehler complex geometry, toric geometry and topology. These include leaf spaces of holomorphic foliations, intersections of real and Hermitian quadrics, the quotient construction of simplicial toric varieties, LVM and LVMB manifolds, complex-analytic structures on moment-angle manifolds and their partial quotients. In all of these cases, the geometry and topology of the appropriate quotient object can be described by combinatorial data including a pair of Gale dual vector configurations.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of pointed maps to moduli spaces of polarized varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a finiteness result for pointed maps to the base space $U$ of a smooth projective family of varieties with maximal variation in moduli. For its proof, we establish the rigidity of pointed maps to a (not necessarily compact) variety which is hyperbolic modulo a proper closed subset. Together with Viehweg's hyperbolicity conjecture on the bigness of log-canonical bundles of moduli spaces, resolved by Campana-Paun, we derive an optimal dimension bound on the Hom scheme from a curve to $U$ among other applications.</description>
