      <title>Spontaneous baryosynthesis with large initial phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate particle production by a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) in spontaneous baryogenesis, focusing on large initial misalignment angles. Our analysis confirms the established cubic dependence of the baryon asymmetry on the initial phase for small angles. However, this scaling breaks down for larger angles, with particle production saturating as the initial phase approaches ${\pi}$ in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Constraints on light QCD and CP-violating axions from the death line of rotation-powered pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For axions that couple to nucleons, the presence of dense nuclear matter can displace the axion from its vacuum minimum, sourcing large field gradients around neutron stars (and, more generally, compact objects). These gradients, which we refer to as axion hair, couple to the local background magnetic field, inducing a large voltage drop near the surface of the star; here, we demonstrate that the presence of axion hair decouples local near-field particle acceleration in the open magnetic field line bundle from the rotational frequency of the pulsar itself. This is significant as the non-observation of old slowly-rotating pulsars is attributed to the fact the rotationally-induced electric fields are not strong enough to sustain $e^\pm$ pair production. In this work, we review the evidence for the existence for `pulsar death', i.e. the threshold at which $e^\pm$ pair production (and thus, by association, coherent radio emission) ceases, and demonstrate using both semi-analytics and particle-in-cell simulations that the existence of axion hair can dramatically extend pulsar lifetimes. We show that the non-observation of extremely old, slowly rotating, pulsars allows for a new probe of light QCD and CP-violating axions. We also demonstrate how the observation of emission from both poles of pulsars with nearly orthogonal rotational and magnetic axes, as seen e.g. in PSR J1906+0746, can be used to set competitive limits on CP-violating axion-nucleon interactions.</description>

      <title>Weak Scale Triggers in the SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are no weak scale triggers in the SMEFT up to dimension six that can solve the hierarchy problem far above the weak scale. Our arguments can be used to show that the same is true at dimension eight. Weak scale triggers are local operators sensitive to the Higgs mass squared and they are needed in a large number of qualitatively different cosmological solutions to the hierarchy problem. These solutions have little in common besides the use of a trigger operator. We argue that focusing on the signatures of the three already-known trigger operators can lead to discover or exclude this class of solutions to the hierarchy problem.</description>

      <title>Dedicated Searches for Millicharged Particles at Intensity-Frontier Facilities: SpinQuest and SHiP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a dedicated study of searches for millicharged particles (mCPs) utilizing scintillator-based detectors at high-intensity fixed-target experiments, with particular focus on the SpinQuest and forthcoming Search for Hidden Particles experiment (SHiP) facilities. The analysis incorporates the three primary production mechanisms: meson decays, Drell-Yan processes, and proton bremsstrahlung. In particular, our updated analysis reveals that proton bremsstrahlung dominates the production rate in the sub-GeV mass regime. Detailed detector simulations and background evaluations are performed to obtain realistic sensitivity estimates. Our results demonstrate that future experiments located in the SpinQuest and SHiP facilities can achieve substantial improvements in discovery potential, enhancing sensitivity to the mCP charge parameter $\epsilon=q_{\chi}/e$ (with $q_\chi$ denoting the mCP electric charge) by up to two orders of magnitude relative to existing limits.</description>

      <title>Amplitude Surrogates for Multi-Jet Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient amplitude predictions are essential for precision studies of multi-jet processes at the LHC. We introduce a novel neural network architecture that predicts multi-jet amplitudes by leveraging the Catani-Seymour factorization scheme and related lower-jet amplitudes, requiring the network to learn only a correction factor. This hybrid approach combines theoretical factorization with a data-driven ansatz, enabling fast and scalable amplitude predictions. Our networks also estimate the accuracy of each prediction, allowing us to selectively use results that meet a predefined accuracy threshold. In the context of leading-order event generation, this approach achieves speed-up factors of up to 20 while maintaining all observables at the percent-level accuracy.</description>

      <title>TeV Scale Quark-Lepton Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quark-lepton symmetric Pati-Salam (PS) model based on the gauge group $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times SU(4)_C$ with an $E_6$-inspired particle spectrum which naturally accommodates a multi-TeV leptoquark gauge boson $X_\mu(3,1,\frac{2}{3})$. A softly broken $Z_2$ symmetry plays a crucial role in realizing this scenario, under which the Standard Model (SM) fermions are even, while new vector-like fermions present in the model are odd. A notable feature of this model is that the PS gauge boson $X_\mu$ itself is $Z_2$-odd, causing it to couple exclusively between SM fermions and the vector-like fermions, except in the right-handed down-quark sector, where mixing is induced by the soft breaking of $Z_2$. This structure leads to helicity suppression of tree-level meson decays mediated by $X_\mu$, with helicity-unsuppressed contributions arising only via one-loop diagrams. We show that $X_\mu$ can be as light as 1.1 TeV while being compatible with all flavor-violating constraints. However, mass relations among the $(W'^\pm_\mu, Z'_\mu, X_\mu)$ gauge bosons push the $X_\mu$ mass limit up to 4.3 TeV from the stringent LHC bounds on the $Z^\prime$ mass. This comparatively low PS-breaking scale opens up promising collider opportunities for probing the leptoquark gauge boson, as well as the distinctive signature of vector-like down-type quarks carrying an unusual baryon number of $2/3$. The model can be further tested via lepton flavor-violating processes induced by the leptoquark gauge boson, such as $\mu \to e \gamma$, $\mu \to e e e$, and $\mu$-$e$ conversion in nuclei. Neutrino masses arise in the model through dimension-seven operators at tree-level, as well as from dimension-five operators via one-loop diagrams.</description>

      <title>Structure and Formation of the Deeply Bound $\bar{p}$ atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretically the structure and formation of the deeply bound $\bar{p}$ atoms. We find that the widths of the atomic states are narrower than the level spacing even for deeply bound states so that the well-isolated deeply bound $\bar{p}$ atoms are expected to exist. We also find the $\bar{p}$-nuclear states with huge widths. For the observation of the deep $ {\bar p}$-atomic states, we investigate theoretically the $(\bar{p}, p)$ reactions for $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, and $^{31}$P target nuclei. We find that the momentum transfer of the $( {\bar p},p)$ reaction is small and the formation of the $ {\bar p}$-atomic states can be observed as the discrete peak structures in the $( {\bar p},p)$ spectrum. We conclude that the $(\bar{p}, p)$ reactions are very much suited for the $\bar{p}$ atom formation and the spectra of the reaction are expected to provide new valuable information on the $ {\bar p}$ atoms and $ {\bar p}$-nucleus interaction.</description>

      <title>JUNO's Impact on the Neutrino Mass Ordering from Lorentz Invariance Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to probe new physics by searching for Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV). Using the 59.1-day dataset recently released by this experiment, we analyze neutrino oscillations to place new constraints on the LIV parameters in the CPT-even ($c_{ee} - c_{e\mu}$, $c_{ee} - c_{e\tau}$) and CPT-odd ($a_{ee} - a_{e\mu}$, $a_{ee} - a_{e\tau}$) sectors. Our analysis reveals a significant shift in the oscillation parameter space of $\sin^2\theta_{12}-\Delta m^2_{21}$ when LIV is included; with the best-fit point for normal ordering moving to the higher values of the solar angle $\theta_{12}$, a strong preference emerges for inverted mass ordering. In particular, the $c_{ee} - c_{e\tau}$ and $a_{ee} - a_{e\tau}$ sectors show the most pronounced effects. We report the most stringent bounds from JUNO to date on these LIV parameters, showcasing the detector's unique sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Concurrence fill and mode distribution of entanglement in neutrino oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of three flavor neutrino oscillation, we demonstrate that the measures of entanglement can be expressed in terms of experimentally accessible appearance and disappearance probabilities. We explicitly show here that the genuine tripartite entanglement measure, i.e., the tangle vanishes identically for all flavors signifying that three flavor neutrino system form a W-type entangled state. Further, we investigate alternative measures of tripartite entanglement like the partial tangle and the concurrence fill which capture the total sharing of entanglement beyond pairwise correlations. In terms of bipartite and bi-partitioned entanglement measures, we derive the symmetric invariant and the concurrence fill, which quantify the distributed entanglement completely expressible in terms of flavor transition probabilities. These entanglement measures display distinct energy dependent patterns across the oscillation window which can be experimentally accessible in the long baseline experiments like DUNE providing an alternative quantum information perspective on flavor evolution. We use GLobal Long Baseline Experiment Simulator (\textsf{GLoBES}) simulations within the DUNE set up to investigate these tripartite entanglement measures in terms of neutrino energy and the length of the baseline. It is observed that, at the point of maximal mixing, these measures show near maximal entanglement between the muon and the tau flavor modes establishing entanglement monogamy. Within the DUNE set up, the wide band of energy and expected higher sensitivity to CP-violation at second oscillation maximum provide a unique advantage to explore the quantum correlation effects across a broader energy window.</description>

      <title>Probing Vector-Like Quarks at a future Muon-Proton Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential for discovering singly produced vector-like top quarks at a muon-proton collider. The analysis reveals that these quarks primarily decay into a W boson accompanied by a bottom quark, which has the largest branching ratio (BR). The research considers the three different center-of-mass energies: 5.29 TeV, 6.48 TeV, and 9.16 TeV. As indicated in our cross-sectional analysis, at 9.16 TeV with a coupling parameter kappa = 0.5, the production probability reaches its peak. However, as the vector-like quark mass exceeds 3 TeV, the production significance diminishes rapidly. For the comparison, the study also performs calculations for proton-proton and electron-proton colliders to highlight the muon-proton collider's effectiveness in probing vector-like quarks. To enhance the detection sensitivity, traditional event selection cuts are applied and optimized. Detailed signal significance calculations suggest that while the hadronic channel yields higher event rates, the leptonic channel offers superior background suppression.</description>

      <title>An anlaysis on $J/\psi\to\pi^0\gamma^*$ within resonance chiral theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the first measurement of the electron-positron invariant mass spectrum in $J/\psi \to \pi^0 e^+e^-$ by BESIII, using the framework of resonance chiral theory. Our results indicate that both strong interaction and electromagnetic transition are essential to accurately describe the data. We obtain the $\pi^0$ transition form factor for $J/\psi \to \pi^0\gamma^*$ and the corresponding decay branching ratios for $J/\psi \to \pi^0 l^+l^-$. The decay process $J/\psi \to \pi^0 V$ is also examined. It is found that $J/\psi \to \pi^0 \rho^0$ is dominated by the strong interaction, while the other two channels, $J/\psi \to \pi^0 \omega$ and $\pi^0 \phi$, arise primarily from electromagnetic transitions.</description>

      <title>Lindblad-driven recombination of the X(3872) tetraquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal structure of the exotic meson X(3872) remains an open question. We investigate its production in heavy-ion collisions under the hypothesis that it is a compact tetraquark. To this end, we derive a coalescence model from the Lindblad equation, assuming that unbound heavy quarks are thermalized within the quark-gluon plasma and that the adiabatic approximation holds. Using this model, we predict the nuclear modification factor of the X(3872) at LHC energies, with proton-proton baseline cross sections estimated from available experimental data. We also consider the effect of simplifying assumptions on the model, and a complementary approach based on chemical equilibration. Our results indicate that recombination is the dominant production mechanism for a tetraquark X(3872). It leads to a significant yield enhancement in heavy-ion collisions, suggesting that the nuclear modification factor is a powerful observable for probing the exotic nature of this state</description>

Abstract: We compute the contributions of heavy quarks to the deep-inelastic scattering structure functions $F_4$ and $F_5$ at next-to-leading order of perturbative QCD in the ACOT scheme. Both analytic results including the details of the calculation as well as numerical results for the neutral and charged current cases are presented. Our study thus lays the groundwork for future measurements of these two structure functions in experiments such as the SHiP experiment.</description>

      <title>Hidden self-energy contributions of collinear functions in SCET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the requirement of the LSZ reduction formula to remove self-energy contributions on external legs, we examine quark self-energy contributions in soft-collinear effective (SCET) theory. We examine an operator basis that follows directly from full quantum chromodynamics (QCD) (upon application of the SCET equations of motion to express small Dirac components in terms of large Dirac components). We find that, for this basis, the self-energy contributions can be identified from their diagrammatic topologies, as in full QCD. However, for an alternative operator basis that is obtained from the direct-QCD basis by an application of Wilson-line identities, interactions are shifted from a covariant derivative to a Wilson line. Consequently, some self-energy contributions are hidden in diagrams involving Wilson lines, making their identification subtle.</description>

      <title>The $J/\psi \to \phi \eta \pi^0$ reaction: $a_0(980)$ production, triangle singularity and non $\phi$ background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $J/\psi\to\phi\eta\pi^{0}$ reaction measured recently by the BESIII collaboration with high precision, paying attention to three important aspects: 1) The production of the $a_0(980)$ in the $\pi^0\eta$ mass distributions, with the typical narrow width observed in isospin violating processes; 2) The origin of two peaks in the $\phi\pi^{0}$ mass distributions that were branded as ``non $\phi$" contribution in the experimental analysis; 3) The existence of two triangle mechanisms developing a triangle sigularity at the same energy where the ``non $\phi$" contribution peaks in the experiment. However, we also show that the strength of these peaks is very small relative to the observed ones, a feature which is tied to the experimental technique used to identify the $\phi$ looking at $K^+K^-$ in a narrow window of invariant mass around the $\phi$ mass. We suggest that these triangle singularities could be observed with other methods to identify the $\phi$.</description>

      <title>Order statistics for multijet events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that rank-ordered jet rapidity distributions - a direct application of order statistics - provide a simple yet powerful probe of high-energy (small-x) QCD dynamics at the LHC. In inclusive dijet topologies at s^(1/2) = 8 and 13 TeV, with realistic jet selections, we compare a BFKL-based Monte Carlo (BFKLex) to two general-purpose event generators based on collinear factorization and DGLAP parton showers, PYTHIA8 (pT-ordered) and HERWIG7 (angular-ordered). Even when two underlying dynamics happen to give similar inclusive jet rapidity distributions, such observables are too coarse to discriminate their underlying rapidity point processes, whereas the rank-ordered distributions remain sensitive to the differences in how rapidity space is filled. For fixed multiplicity (N=3) and for the second-most-forward/backward jets across multiplicities, BFKLex populates the rapidity interval more democratically, whereas the general-purpose event generators exhibit comparatively stronger edge enhancement for N=3 and narrower, more centrally concentrated distributions for the second-most ranks. These shape differences are stable under variations of jet radius, proton PDFs, and MPI/hadronization settings, and persist when requiring large rapidity separation between the outer jets. Rank-ordered rapidities thus compress genuinely exclusive information about the multi-jet final state into one-dimensional, normalized histograms that are directly measurable with existing dijet and Mueller-Navelet selections and provide a new handle on high-energy radiation patterns.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of mixing angles and computation of the hadronic $W$ decay widths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the 1-loop hadronic $W$-boson decay widths in the Standard Model with different renormalization schemes of the quark mixing matrix found in the literature. Importantly, we provide the first numerical results for a variant of the On-Shell scheme which does not require mixing matrix counterterms at all, i.e. $\delta V=0$. The scheme is based on the fact that one can always choose a basis in which there are no mixing matrices (angles) and, therefore, the corresponding counterterms are superfluous. For full consistency, the principles of this scheme are employed both for the quark mixing matrix and for the Weinberg angle.</description>

      <title>The quantum evolutions of the diffractive transverse-momentum dependent gluon distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Colour Glass Condensate description of electron-nucleus collisions at high energy, we study the diffractive production of a pair of jets with transverse momenta much larger than the nuclear saturation momentum $Q_s$. At leading order in the QCD coupling, the di-jet cross-section exhibits transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) factorisation, with a gluon diffractive TMD distribution (DTMD) which is controlled by gluon saturation and describes the transverse-momentum imbalance between the produced jets. The next-to-leading corrections generate the various quantum evolutions of the diffractive gluon distribution. We focus on the Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) evolution which describes the change in the gluon DTMD when increasing the ''hard scale'' (the typical transverse momentum of the di-jets). We consider two different representations for this equation, one in transverse-momentum space, the other one in transverse-coordinate space. They are not fully equivalent with each other (despite being related by a Fourier transform) because of the respective boundary conditions. These conditions encode the essential physics of gluon saturation together with the effects of two other types of quantum evolution: the BK/JIMWLK evolution over the rapidity gap (''inside the Pomeron'') and the DGLAP evolution outside the rapidity gap (''within the diffractive system''). We demonstrate that, due to gluon saturation, one can compute both the boundary conditions and the CSS solutions fully from first principles, without reference to non-perturbative physics. We numerically find a good agreement between the CSS solutions in the two aforementioned representations.</description>

      <title>Determination of $B$-meson distribution amplitudes from $B\to \pi,K,D$ transition form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on $B \to \pi$, $K$ and $B\to D$ form factors from lattice QCD and light-cone sum rules has made it possible to constrain the inverse moment $\lambda_B$ of the $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes by performing a global fit of $B\to \pi,K,D$ form factors. We have compiled the $B\to \pi,K,D$ form factors calculated by the HPQCD, MILC, and RBC/UKQCD collaborations in the large $q^2$ region. By employing an three-parameter ansatz of the $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes, we express the $B\to \pi,K,D$ form factors at $q^2=0$ that are calculated from light-cone sum rules, in terms of the inverse moment $\lambda_B$ of the leading-twist $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitude. In the $B \to \pi \ell \nu$ channel, we also include the available $q^2$-binned experimental data from the BaBar, Belle, and Belle~II collaborations. Using the Bourrely-Caprini-Lellouch parametrization, we perform a global fit and obtain $\lambda_B=217(19)_{-17}^{+82}$~MeV and $|V_{\text{ub}}|=3.68(13)_{-1}^{+0}\times10^{-3}$. The second uncertainty is obtained by constraining $\lambda_B&gt;200$ MeV and varying the inverse logarithmic moments $\hat{\sigma}_1\in[-0.7,0.7]$ and $\hat{\sigma}_2\in[-6,6]$, which represents the model-dependent uncertainty from the $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes. When taking into account $\lambda_B$ and $\hat{\sigma}_1$ as fitting parameters simultaneously, the intervals of our preditions are $\lambda_B=[208, 324]$~MeV and $\hat{\sigma}_1=[-0.7, 0.27]$.</description>

      <title>Characterizing LHC-Resonances in extended HEFT: information on the nature of extended scalar sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In theories with extended scalar sectors the lightest new scalar degree of freedom might be accessible at colliders. Going beyond simplified models, such a theory can be described in a gauge-invariant and agnostic way via an EFT with a non-linearly realized electroweak symmetry. In this extended HEFT, depending on the $SU(2)$ nature of the new scalar in the UV, operators will be suppressed by different powers of a heavy mass scale. We use dimensional analysis to systematically evaluate expected hierarchies between Wilson coefficients, leading to structural relations between potential LHC observables, such as di-boson resonances, tau pair production or the di-photon channel. Once future collider data reveals a hint of a new scalar field, it can be fitted to this extended HEFT and such a structural analysis will help interpret it with respect to possible UV models, circumventing the need to individually test each possible model on the data or to fix the $SU(2)$ representation of the new scalar beforehand. For illustration, the framework is applied to the tentative 95 GeV resonance. In addition to its usefulness for collider physics, the extended HEFT can also be beneficial for low-energy observables, allowing to describe new scalars in an agnostic way.</description>

      <title>Dark matter mounds from the collapse of supermassive stars: a general-relativistic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the importance of a fully relativistic treatment of the dephasing of gravitational waves induced by dark-matter overdensities in extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). However, a general-relativistic description of the dark matter phase-space distribution is currently available only for the case of a dark matter "spike" arising from adiabatic black hole growth. Here we develop a fully general-relativistic formalism for the more realistic scenario in which a supermassive stellar progenitor collapses to a black hole and produces a shallower dark matter overdensity, or "mound". We follow self-consistently the evolution of the supermassive star, its collapse, and the subsequent growth of the resulting black hole, together with the collisionless dark matter orbits. We find that in the regime where the collapse becomes non-adiabatic, the dark matter distribution function is significantly reshaped, with a clear depletion in the low-binding-energy region of phase space. Our results provide a more realistic prediction for the dark matter phase-space distribution around supermassive black holes, which is an essential step in our programme to use future EMRI observations to extract information about both the nature of dark matter and the formation history of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Structure of Chern-Simons Graviton Scattering Amplitudes from Topological Gravity Equivalence Theorem and Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitons naturally acquire topological masses in the 3d topologically massive gravity (TMG) theory that includes the gravitational Chern-Simons term. We present a covariant formulation of the TMG theory by introducing an unphysical dilaton field through the conformal transformation. We conduct the BRST quantization of the covariant TMG theory, which reduces to the conventional TMG in the unitary gauge. We demonstrate that this covariant TMG theory conserves the physical degrees of freedom (DoF) in the massless limit, under which the physical massive graviton becomes an unphysical massless graviton and its physical DoF is converted to the massless dilaton. With these, we newly establish a topological gravity equivalence theorem (TGRET), which connects each scattering amplitude of physical gravitons to the corresponding dilaton scattering amplitude in the high energy limit. The TGRET provides a general mechanism to guarantee all the large energy cancellations in any massive graviton scattering amplitudes. Applying the TGRET and using the generalized gravitational power counting rule, we prove that the $N$-point massive graviton amplitudes ($N\geqslant 4$) have striking energy cancellations by powers proportional to $\frac{5}{2}N$ ($\frac{7}{2}N$) in the Landau (unitary) gauge. This explains the large energy cancellations of $E^{11}\to E^1$ (Landau gauge) and $E^{12}\to E^1$ (unitary gauge) for the four graviton amplitudes. We compute the four-point graviton (dilaton) amplitudes and explicitly demonstrate the TGRET and these large energy cancellations. With the extended massive double-copy approach, we systematically construct the graviton (dilaton) scattering amplitudesin the TMG theory from the corresponding gauge boson (adjoint scalar) amplitudes in the topologically massive Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Geometry of non-Gaussianity in transient non-attractor inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflationary models predicting abundant primordial black holes (PBHs) and large amplitude of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) often rely on amplified fluctuations over limited scales, typically driven by phase transitions, particle production, or departures from slow-roll evolution. While the power spectrum of these models has been extensively studied, higher-order correlations are much less understood. Motivated by the complex physics involved and the fact that PBH and SIGW formation are both sensitive to non-linearities, we present a detailed study of the bispectrum as the leading non-linear effect in these scenarios. We refer to the scale- and shape-dependence of the bispectrum collectively as its geometry; and define a scale-dependent shape correlator to disentangle the two dependencies. Generally, we find that for the scales most affected by phase transitions and particle production (including the power spectrum peak), the bispectrum is strongest near the equilateral configuration, while non-attractor phases tend to produce correlations near the squeezed configuration. We further propose a simplified bispectrum estimator, resembling local-type non-Gaussianity but with scale-dependent amplitude, that captures the main features of the full bispectrum. As an implication of our results, we show that incorporating the bispectrum significantly broadens the range of scales with a substantial probability of large smoothed density contrasts compared to linear analysis. This suggests that non-linearities can alter not only PBH abundance and SIGW amplitude but also their mass and frequency spectra. In particular, and in contrast with the usual assumption, our results hint that the second-highest peak of the power spectrum may produce more PBHs than the highest peak.</description>

      <title>Wet Hair: Global Symmetries in Entanglement Islands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central conjecture in quantum gravity is the non-existence of global symmetries. As a fully unitary theory, there is no information loss in a UV complete quantum gravity theory. We see both these concepts reflected in the AdS/CFT correspondence, which tells us that dynamical processes in AdS are fully captured by a manifestly unitary CFT with no information loss. Furthermore, global symmetries of the CFT are dual to gauge symmetries in the AdS, which implies no global symmetry in the AdS. In this work, we provide concrete evidence for the connection between the non-existence of global symmetries and the absence of information loss in quantum gravity. We study the $\textit{island setups}$ in which a gravitational AdS is coupled with a nongravitational bath on its boundary. In such theories, the information in the AdS can be lost to the bath. We provide concrete examples with global symmetries in the island setup, from both the bottom-up and the top-down perspectives. We argue that these global symmetries are consistent due to $\textit{entanglement islands}$, in which holography is realized in a novel fashion. The global symmetries we construct are all mixed with spontaneously broken gauge symmetries. We will show that this fact has two implications: $\textbf{1)}$ The black hole hair is detectable in the bath (``wet hair"); $\textbf{2)}$ a resolution of a puzzle proposed by Harlow and Shagoulian.</description>

      <title>Singularities in Cosmological Loop Correlators II : Non Local Interactions and Flat Space limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-local interactions naturally arise in the ADM formalism after solving the constraint equations and substituting their solutions back into the action. However, the effects of these non-local operators on loop corrections to cosmological correlators remain largely unexplored. Extending the analysis of arXiv:2503.21880 , in this work we compute the $1$-loop bispectrum during slow-roll inflation, including the inverse-Laplacian operators present at cubic and quartic order in the ADM action (in the spatially flat gauge). These non-local vertices introduce non-trivial angular dependencies that significantly complicate the evaluation of loop integrals. We find that the diagrammatic rules of arXiv:2503.21880 for identifying poles and branch cuts in correlators without explicit integration remain valid even in the presence of such non-local interactions. Finally, we derive the flat-space limit of the $1$-loop inflationary correlator and verify it with explicit examples, thereby establishing a direct correspondence between its leading total-energy singularities ($\omega_T\rightarrow0$) and the flat-space scattering amplitude.</description>

      <title>Insights for Early Dark Energy with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), as one of the earliest processes in the universe accessible to direct observation, offers a powerful and independent probe of the cosmic expansion history. With recent advances in both theory and observation, including efficient and flexible BBN codes, percent-level measurements of primordial deuterium and helium-4 abundances, refined measurements of nuclear reaction rates, and precise determinations of the baryon density from the cosmic microwave background, particularly keen insights can be gained from BBN. In this work, we leverage these developments to place model-independent constraints on deviations from the Standard Model expansion history during BBN. Using the latest abundance data, we apply principal component analysis to identify the most constrained and physically meaningful modes of expansion history variation. This approach allows us to impose the most general constraints on early dark energy during the epoch of BBN. We further examine whether general modifications to the expansion rate could alleviate the long-standing lithium problem. Our results demonstrate that BBN, sharpened by modern data and statistical techniques, remains an indispensable probe of dark energy and new physics in the early universe.</description>

Abstract: The perturbative expansion of two-point functions of lowest dimension supersymmetric operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and ABJM theory exhibits uniform transcendental weight. Inspired by this, we construct an explicit basis of uniformly transcendental master integrals for these correlators, through four loops in four and three loops in three dimensions. In terms of these bases, the two-point functions simplify to rational linear combinations. Conversely, such explicit bases of uniformly transcendental integrals can be useful for other applications.</description>

      <title>One-loop power spectrum corrections in interacting dark energy cosmologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) models offer a promising avenue to explore possible exchanges of energy and momentum between dark matter and dark energy, providing a dynamical extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Such interactions modify the growth of cosmic structures, imprinting distinctive signatures on the matter power spectrum that can be tested through large-scale structure (LSS) observations. In this work, we compute the one-loop corrections to the matter power spectrum in IDE models. We then reinterpret these results within the standard framework of the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS), which provides a consistent description of mildly non-linear scales and allows for reliable comparisons with observational data. We investigate two commonly studied forms of the coupling function, $Q$, namely $Q = \xi \mathcal{H} \rho_{\rm m}$ and $Q = \xi \mathcal{H} \rho_{\rm DE}$, and introduce a novel interaction term, $Q = \Gamma \, \rho_{\rm m} \, \rho_{\rm DE} \, \theta_{\rm m}$, characterized by the non-linear coupling constant $\Gamma$, which links the interaction strength to the velocity divergence of dark matter. This coupling function is proposed to isolate the effects solely of the IDE model on mildly non-linear scales. Using Full-Shape (FS) measurements of the galaxy power spectrum from BOSS DR12, we constrain the interaction rate $\Gamma$, the cosmological parameters, and the bias parameters. We find $\Gamma = 0.0039 \pm 0.0082$, which is highly consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model. This work opens the possibility of testing IDE models at mildly non-linear scales, potentially providing new insights for this class of models beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework.</description>

      <title>On the physical running of the electric charge in a dimensionless theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the renormalization of the gauge coupling in massless QED coupled to a scaleless quadratic theory of gravity. We compare two alternative prescriptions for the running of the electric charge: (i) the conventional $\mu$-running in minimal subtraction, and (ii) a ''physical'' running extracted from the logarithmic dependence of amplitudes on a hard scale $Q^{2}$ (e.g., $p^{2}$ or a Mandelstam invariant) after removing IR effects. At one loop, using dimensional regularization with an IR mass regulator $m$, we compute the photon vacuum polarization. We find a clean separation between UV and soft logarithms: the former is gauge and process independent and fixes the beta function, whereas the latter encodes nonlocal, IR-dominated contributions that may depend on gauge parameters and must not be interpreted as UV running. In the quadratic-gravity sector, the photon self-energy is UV finite--the $\ln\mu^{2}$ pieces cancel--leaving only $\ln(Q^{2}/m^{2})$ soft logs. Consequently, quadratic gravity does not modify the one-loop UV coefficient and thus does not alter $\beta(e)$. Therefore, the physical running coincides with the $\mu$-running in QED at one loop. Our analysis clarifies how to extract a gauge and process independent running in the presence of gravitational interactions and why soft logs from quadratic gravity should not contribute to $\beta(e)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.12285v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study Dirac and Majorana neutrino oscillations in a magnetic field in the three-flavour case. A theoretical framework developed in \cite{Popov:2019} is extended to the case of three neutrino species, as well as to the Majorana neutrinos case. The closed expression for the Dirac neutrinos flavour and spin oscillations are given. Majorana neutrino oscillations are studied numerically. We show that the probabilities exhibit a complicated interplay of oscillation on magnetic $\mu_\nu B$ and vacuum $\Delta m^2_{ij}/2p$ frequencies. It is also shown that neutrino oscillations in an interstellar magnetic field can modify neutrino fluxes observed in neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Bottomonium suppression at RHIC and LHC in an open quantum system approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present potential non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (pNRQCD) predictions for bottomonium suppression in sqrt(sNN) = 200 GeV, 2.76 TeV, and 5.02 TeV heavy-ion collisions using an open quantum systems (OQS) description of the reduced heavy-quark anti-quark density matrix. Compared to prior OQS+pNRQCD studies we include the rapidity dependence of bottomonium production and evolution, allowing for a fully 3-dimensional description of bottomonium trajectories in the quark-gluon plasma. The underlying formalism used to compute the ground and excited state survival probabilities is based on a Lindblad equation that is accurate to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the binding energy over temperature. For the background evolution, we make use of a 3+1D viscous hydrodynamics code which reproduces soft hadron observables at all three collision energies. We find good agreement between NLO OQS+pNRQCD predictions and data taken at LHC energies, however, at RHIC energies, there is tension with recent bottomonium suppression measurements by the STAR collaboration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the observation of the ${\eta}_{t}$ meson at the LHC and the promising prospect of the ${\eta}_{t}$ meson available at the approaching HL-LHC, branching ratios for the ${\eta}_{t}$ ${\to}$ $f\bar{f}$, $gg$, ${\gamma}{\gamma}$, $W^{+}W^{-}$, $Z^{0}Z^{0}$, $Z^{0}{\gamma}$ and $Z^{0}H$ decays are roughly estimated. It is found that tens of opposite-charge dilepton events from the ${\eta}_{t}$ ${\to}$ $W^{+}W^{-}$ decay and hundreds of events from the ${\eta}_{t}$ ${\to}$ $Z^{0}H$ ${\to}$ ${\ell}^{+}{\ell}^{-}H$ decay using the single $Z^{0}$ boson tagging method are expected to be accessible. This estimation provides a reference for future experimental study on the ${\eta}_{t}$ meson.</description>

      <title>Robust estimates of theoretical uncertainties at fixed-order in perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calculations truncated at a fixed order in perturbation theory are accompanied by an associated theoretical uncertainty, which encodes the missing higher orders (MHOU). This is typically estimated by a scale variation procedure, which has well-known shortcomings. In this work, we propose a simple prescription to directly encode the missing higher order terms using theory nuisance parameters (TNPs) and estimate the uncertainty by their variation. We study multiple processes relevant for Large Hadron Collider physics at next-to-leading and next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbation theory, obtaining MHOU estimates for differential observables in each case. In cases where scale variations are well-behaved we are able to replicate their effects using TNPs, while we find significant improvement in cases where scale variation typically underestimates the uncertainty.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Schwinger Effect in Superradiant Axion Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superradiance can cause the axion cloud around a rotating black hole to reach extremely high densities, and the decay of these axions can produce a powerful laser. The electric field of these lasers is strong enough that the Schwinger effect may become significant, resulting in the production of an electron-positron plasma. We explore the dynamics between axion lasers and this electron-positron plasma. While there are several mechanisms by which the inclusion of a plasma can impact the laser's behavior, the most significant of these mechanisms is that the electron-positron plasma imparts an effective mass on the photon. As the plasma frequency increases, axion decay becomes energetically unfavorable, up to the point where the axion no longer decays into photons, shutting off the laser. We find that the impact of the electron-positron plasma on the dynamics of the system depend heavily on the parameters, specifically the axion mass $m_\phi$ and the superradiant coupling $\alpha$, and that we may divide parameter space into three regimes: the unenhanced, enhanced, and unstable regimes. In the unenhanced and enhanced regime, the system will eventually settle into an equilibrium state, emitting a laser of constant luminosity while the number of axions remains constant. In the unenhanced regime, this equilibrium state can be calculated while neglecting the effects of Schwinger production; in the enhanced regime, the equilibrium luminosity is slightly larger than what it would be without Schwinger production. In the unstable regime, the electron-positron plasma suppresses axion decay to the point where the system is never able to reach equilibrium; instead, the axions continue to grow superradiantly. In all three cases, the production of superradiant axions will eventually cause the black hole to spin down to the point where superradiance ceases.</description>

      <title>Supercooled Goldstone Bosons at the QCD Chiral Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a universal non-equilibrium enhancement of long-wavelength Goldstone bosons induced by quenches to the broken phase in Model G -- the dynamical universality class of an $O(4)$-antiferromagnet and the chiral phase transition in QCD. Scaling arguments for the coarsening dynamics describing the formation of the chiral condensate predict a parametric enhancement in the infrared spectra of Goldstones, a prediction confirmed by stochastic simulations of the transition. The details of the enhancement are determined by the non-linear dynamics of a superfluid effective theory, which is a limit of Model G reflecting the broken $O(4)$ symmetry. Our results translate to a parametric enhancement of low-momentum pions in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC, which are underpredicted in current hydrodynamic models without critical dynamics.</description>

      <title>CoMBolt-ITA, a Collective Model based on relativistic Boltzmann equation in the Isotropization Time Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new (2+1)-model is developed to investigate the collective behavior of the quark-gluon plasma produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. This framework couples pre-equilibrium dynamics with hydrodynamic evolution by solving the Boltzmann equation within the isotropization time approximation to simulate the dynamics of quasiparticle evolution. A numerical scheme based on the method of characteristics enables the evolution to begin from a specified initial Boltzmann distribution. In this work, the spatial structure of the initial distribution is modeled using the TrENTo framework. Our results show that a medium initialized at $\tau_0$ on the order of 1\,[fm/$c$] with a small shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ($\eta/s = 0.008$) evolves consistently with hydrodynamic simulations, such as those performed using the VISH2+1 code, while discrepancies arise for a medium with $\eta/s = 0.8$. Furthermore, when initialized with a highly anisotropic momentum distribution in the longitudinal direction at early times, the system exhibits spatially non-uniform thermalization in the transverse plane, leading to the emergence of a nontrivial hypersurface that marks the onset of hydrodynamic applicability. Finally, we compute the $p_T$-spectra for a non-fluctuating initial condition using the hybrid version of CoMBolt-ITA. In this hybrid setup, the description is switched from quasiparticles to hadrons, and UrQMD is used to model the hadron gas dynamics. We compare these results with those obtained from the hybrid VISH2+1 initialized within the same setup. For a small shear viscosity, $\eta/s = 0.08$, the two results show a good level of consistency, whereas for a larger value, $\eta/s = 0.8$, a noticeable discrepancy emerges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of a finite modular flavour symmetry, fermion mass hierarchies may be generated by a slight deviation of the modulus from a symmetric point. We point out that this small parameter governing charged-lepton mass hierarchies may also be responsible for the breaking of lepton number in a symmetry-protected low-scale seesaw, sourcing active neutrino masses and the mass splitting of a pseudo-Dirac pair of heavy neutrinos. We discuss the phenomenological implications of this mechanism, including the possibility to test the considered models at future planned and proposed heavy neutral lepton searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have used the parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE together with the Dynamically Constrained Phase-space Coalescence model (DCPC) to study the $T_{cs0}^{*}(2870)^{0}$ production in $pp$ collision at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV, following the LHCb observation of $T_{cs0}^{*}(2870)^{0}$ in the $B^{-}\to D^{-}D^{0}K^{0}_{S}$ decays in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7, 8, and 13 TeV [PRL 134(2025)101901]. The final hadronic states of the $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV are first simulated by the PACIAE model. Four sets of $T_{cs0}^{*}(2870)^{0}$ candidates are then recombined by the DCPC model using the constituent meson pair of $D^{0}K^{0}_{S}$, $D^{+}K^{-}$, $D^{*+}K^{*-}$, and $D^{*0} \bar{K}^{*0}$ based on the above simulated final hadronic states, respectively. We calculate their rapidity distributions, transverse momentum spectra, and angular distribution between the two component mesons, as well as angular distribution between $D$ component meson and $T_{cs0}^{*}(2870)^{0}$. Our results show that the yields of four $T_{cs0}^{*}(2870)^{0}$ candidates follow the magnitude order of $D^{0}K^{0}_{S}$ $&gt;$ $D^{+}K^{-}$ $&gt;$ $D^{*+}K^{*-}$ $\sim$ $D^{*0} \bar{K}^{*0}$. Similar ordering behavior is also observed in the aforementioned distributions.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of $W$-boson measurements to low-mass right-handed neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A low-mass right-handed neutrino could interact with electroweak bosons via mixing, a mediator particle, or loop corrections. Using an effective field theory, we determine constraints on these interactions from $W$-boson measurements at hadron colliders. Due to the difference in the initial states at the Tevatron and the LHC, $W$-boson decays to a right-handed neutrino would artificially increase the mass measured at the Tevatron while only affecting the difference between $W^+$ and $W^-$ mass measurements at the LHC. Measurements from CDF and the LHC are used to infer the corresponding parameter values, which are found to be inconsistent between the two. The LHC experiments can improve sensitivity to these interactions by measuring the cosine of the helicity angle using $W$ bosons produced with transverse momentum above $\approx 50$ GeV.</description>

      <title>The inclusive Higgs boson cross-section in gluon-gluon fusion in soft-virtual approximation at fourth order in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present precise results for the inclusive Higgs boson cross-section in gluon-gluon fusion at the LHC considering state-of-the-art fourth-order results in perturbative QCD arising from the dominant soft and virtual gluon emissions. Utilizing four-loop QCD results for the gluon-form factor, the splitting function and related anomalous dimensions, we study the effects of threshold enhanced soft gluon emissions and estimate their impact on the total cross-section at the fourth order. Our study highlights the role of these higher-order contributions in improving the perturbative convergence and in significantly reducing the renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties. The results provide strong evidence for the perturbative stability and reliability of Higgs boson cross-section predictions at the LHC, thereby reinforcing the robustness of theoretical inputs in precision Higgs phenomenology. We also provide cross-section predictions using a large set of available parton distribution functions and show that, together with the value of the strong coupling $\alpha_s(m_Z)$, they cause the largest residual uncertainty for the Higgs boson cross-section in gluon-gluon fusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The determination of the shear viscosity is a central topic in various areas of modern physics. In particular, it is often necessary to evaluate the shear viscosity $\eta$ of fluids made up of more than one species, all interacting with different cross sections. Since it may be difficult to extract information on the interaction among different species, various combinations of the viscosities of the individual components are often used. We work in the Chapman-Enskog framework and investigate on binary mixtures, by comparing such single component combinations with a full 2-component formalism: we find that, in most cases, the full viscosity is well approximated by a weighted linear average of the single component viscosities, although this result is far from being general. Moreover, we validate our 2-component Chapman-Enskog results for $\eta$ by comparing them with an independent numerical simulation of the Boltzmann equation, which estimates the shear viscosity via a Green-Kubo formula, in the case of a quasi-particle system that reproduces lattice QCD thermodynamics. We see that the temperature dependence of $\eta/s$ of such system of quarks and gluons is not well described by combinations of the individual components, highlighting the importance of inter-species scattering.</description>

Abstract: Heavy quarks offer an invaluable hard probe of the droplets of quark gluon plasma (QGP) formed in heavy ion collisions at the LHC and RHIC. Given their large mass, they are predominantly produced in hard scattering processes at the earliest moment of a collision and given their rarity they almost never annihilate with a heavy antiquark subsequently. This means that they experience, and probe, the entire history of the expanding, cooling, droplet of QGP from hydrodynamization through hadronization. Quantitative measurements of heavy quark final state observables therefore give us access to information about the transport properties of QGP as well as about medium modifications of hadronization. To date, the Hybrid strong/weak coupling Model of jet quenching has not included any implementation of the heavy-quark sector, which has made it impossible to confront its predictions with measurements of heavy quark and jet observables together, in a unified fashion. Here, we extend the Hybrid Model to investigate heavy quark observables for the first time. We introduce a strongly-coupled calculation of heavy-quark energy loss with the correct behavior when the heavy quarks are either ultrarelativistic or non-relativistic, Gaussian momentum broadening, and recombination of heavy quarks with medium partons using a local color neutralization model of hadronization. We compare our results for the suppression $R_{\rm AA}$ and azimuthal anisotropies $v_2$ of B- and D-mesons and $\Lambda_c$ baryons, the $R_{\rm AA}$ of B-tagged jets, as well as baryon-to-meson ratios, with available experimental data from ALICE, ATLAS and CMS.</description>

      <title>Stringent Constraints on Gravitational Wave Signatures of Dark Electromagnetism in Neutron Star Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave interferometers have studied compact object mergers and solidified our understanding of strong gravity. Their increasing precision raises the possibility of detecting new physics, especially in a neutron star binary system that may contain hidden-sector particles. In particular, a new vector force between binary constituents, giving rise to dark electromagnetic phenomena, could measurably alter the inspiral waveforms and thus be constrained by gravitational wave observations. In this work, we critically examine the mechanisms for neutron stars to acquire enough hidden-sector particles with requisite couplings to furnish a detectable signature from dark electromagnetism. We demonstrate that the repulsive nature of vector forces imposes stringent constraints on any putative particle physics model or astrophysical environment which could give rise to such gravitational signatures. We argue that absent an extreme fine-tuning of parameters, such signatures are well out of reach of any current or near-future gravitational wave observatory.</description>

      <title>On the photon self-energy to three loops in QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the photon self-energy to three loops in Quantum Electrodynamics. The method of differential equations for Feynman integrals and a complete $\epsilon$-factorization of the former allow us to obtain fully analytical results in terms of iterated integrals involving integration kernels related to a K3 geometry. We argue that our basis has the right properties to be a natural generalization of a canonical basis beyond the polylogarithmic case and we show that many of the kernels appearing in the differential equations, cancel out in the final result to finite order in $\epsilon$. We further provide generalized series expansions that cover the whole kinematic space so that our results for the self-energy may be easily evaluated numerically for all values of the momentum squared. From the local solution at $p^2=0$, we extract the photon wave function renormalization constant in the on-shell scheme to three loops and confirm its agreement with previously obtained results.</description>

      <title>Neutrino quantum kinetics in three flavors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impact of neutrino flavor conversion on the supernova mechanism is yet to be fully understood. We present multi-energy and multi-angle solutions of the neutrino quantum kinetic equations in three flavors, without employing any attenuation term for the neutrino self-interaction strength and taking into account neutrino advection and non-forward collisions with the background medium. Flavor evolution is explored within a spherically symmetric shell surrounding the region of neutrino decoupling in the interior of a core-collapse supernova, relying on the output of a spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova model with a progenitor mass of $18.6 M_\odot$. We select two representative post-bounce times: $t_{\rm pb} = 0.25$ s (no angular crossings are present and flavor conversion is triggered by slow collective effects) and $t_{\rm pb} = 1$ s (angular crossings trigger fast flavor instabilities). We find that flavor equipartition is achieved for the late post-bounce time ($t_{\rm pb} = 1$ s), where the (anti)neutrino emission properties among different flavors tend to approach each other. In this case, $\bar\nu_e$ tends to $\bar\nu_x = (\bar\nu_\mu + \bar\nu_\tau)/2$ and a similar trend holds for neutrinos. However, flavor equipartition does not occur for our early post-bounce time ($t_{\rm pb} = 0.25$ s). Accounting for weak-magnetism corrections, crossings in the $\mu$ and $\tau$ lepton number angular distributions arise; however, such crossings have a magnitude smaller than the one occurring in the electron sector and negligibly affect flavor evolution. Because of flavor conversion, the neutrino heating rate increases up to $30\%$ with respect to the case where flavor conversion is neglected.</description>

      <title>Bounds on complex structure moduli values for perturbative control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: String compactification in the framework of the low energy effective supergravity requires the perturbative control in both the large volume and the weak coupling expansions. However, when the complex structure moduli couple to some lattice structure, the Sp$(2(h^{2,1}+1))$ symmetry of the tree level K\"ahler potential allows the correction to the K\"ahler potential to diverge in the large field limit of the complex structure moduli, resulting in the breakdown of the perturbative control. Here the lattice structure naturally appears in the presence of a tower of states like the Kaluza-Klein or the string modes, an essential ingredient of the distance conjecture. The similar situation can be found from the axio-dilaton contribution to the corrected K\"ahler potential, where the SL$(2, \mathbb{Z})$ symmetry as well as the coupling between the axio-dilaton and the lattice structure allow the correction to diverge in the weak coupling limit. In order to keep the perturbative control, the values of the complex structure moduli as well as the dilaton must have the upper bound, which is determined by the volume of the internal manifold and the string coupling constant, hence the Kaluza-Klein and the string mass scales. The form of the bounds are quite similar to that given by the distance conjecture, both prevents the descent of a tower of states.</description>

      <title>Quenching through the QCD chiral phase transition</title>

Abstract: We present a detailed numerical and analytical study of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of Model G, the dynamical universality class relevant to the chiral phase transition. We perform numerical 3D stochastic (Langevin) simulations of the $O(4)$ critical point for large lattices in the chiral limit. We quench the system from the high-temperature unbroken phase to the broken phase and study the non-equilibrium dynamics of pion fields. Strikingly, the non-equilibrium evolution of the two-point functions exhibits a regime of growth, a parametrically large enhancement, and a subsequent slow relaxation to equilibrium. We analyze our numerical results using dynamic critical scaling and mean-field theory. The growth of the two point functions is determined by the non-linear dynamics of an ideal non-abelian superfluid, which is a limit of Model G that reflects the broken chiral symmetry. We also relate the non-equilibrium two-point functions to a long-lived parametric enhancement of soft pion yields relative to thermal equilibrium following a quench.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Extragalactic Magnetic Field: Auger Data Meet UHECR Propagation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses from the Pierre Auger Collaboration suggest correlations between the arrival directions of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) and catalogs of starburst galaxies (SGBs) and jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We revisit these analyses using the same methodology as \auger , but explicitly incorporating UHECR deflections in turbulent extragalactic magnetic fields (EGMFs). We demonstrate that while for SBGs the same sources as for the generic \auger\ analysis dominate the catalog correlations, jetted AGNs are dominated by Centaurus~A when accounting for source distances and deflections. Using our framework, we derive 90\% confidence level upper limits on the local EGMF strength of 4.4~nG~Mpc$^{1/2}$ for SBGs and 6.7~nG~Mpc$^{1/2}$ for jetted AGNs. Assuming instead that the UHECR deflections predominantly arise from the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), we obtain a GMF upper limit of $1.4 \, \mu$G~kpc$^{1/2}$ for a Galactic halo size of 30~kpc.</description>

      <title>First direct search for light dark matter interactions in a transition-edge sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of transition-edge sensor (TES) single-photon detectors as a simultaneous target and sensor for direct dark matter searches, and report results from the first search of this kind. We perform a 489 h science run with a TES device optimized for the detection of 1064 nm photons, with a mass of ~0.2 ng and an energy threshold of ~0.3 eV, and set new limits on dark matter interactions with both electrons and nucleons for dark matter with mass below the MeV scale. With their excellent energy resolution, TESs enable search strategies that are complementary to recent results from superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors and kinetic inductance detectors. We show that next-generation TES arrays hold promise to probe new regions of light dark matter parameter space.</description>

      <title>Benchmarks and applications of the nuclear deexcitation event generator NucDeEx</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron multiplicity is a key observable in recent neutrino experiments that can enhance the sensitivity of various neutrino physics searches. Nuclear deexcitation plays a significant role in neutron emissions associated with neutrino-nucleus interactions. Therefore, precise prediction of this process is essential. To address this need, a general-purpose nuclear deexcitation event generator \textsc{NucDeEx} was developed and released as an open-source package. The treatment of low-lying discrete excited states was updated to better reproduce experimental data. Benchmarks were conducted using existing nuclear deexcitation event generators and experimental data. Application to other simulators, neutrino event generator \textsc{NEUT} and general particle simulation tool \textsc{Geant4}, are also presented.</description>

      <title>$F$-term Multi-Field Inflation in Supergravity without Stabiliser Superfields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realising $F$-term slow-roll inflation in supergravity is non-trivial due to the well-known $\eta$-problem. The common strategy to solve the problem is to impose a shift symmetry on the K\"ahler potential, but this often leads to a negative potential in the large-field regime. To avoid negative potentials, an additional superfield called the stabiliser is usually added with a desired interaction. An alternative mechanism in supergravity, avoiding the use of a stabiliser superfield, was earlier proposed by two of us in the setup with a single chiral superfield having inflaton and goldstino amongst its field components. In this work, we extend that alternative mechanism to multi-superfield models of inflation, thereby providing a generic framework for embedding a wide class of single- and multi-field inflation models into supergravity. We illustrate our approach by several concrete examples of multi-field inflation and clarify the conditions required to avoid tachyonic instabilities during multi-field evolution. Our proposal significantly broadens the theoretical landscape of $F$-term inflation models in supergravity.</description>
