      <title>Learning to predict superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of materials remains a major challenge in condensed matter physics due to the lack of a comprehensive and quantitative theory. We present a data-driven approach that combines chemistry-informed feature extraction with interpretable machine learning to predict $T_c$ and classify superconducting materials. We develop a systematic featurization scheme that integrates structural and elemental information through graphlet histograms and symmetry vectors. Using experimentally validated structural data from the 3DSC database, we construct a curated, featurized dataset and design a new kernel to incorporate histogram features into Gaussian-process (GP) regression and classification. This framework yields an interpretable $T_c$ predictor with an $ R^2$ value of 0.93 and a superconductor classifier with quantified uncertainties. Feature-significance analysis further reveals that GP $T_c$ predictor can achieve near-optimal performance only using four second-order graphlet features. In particular, we discovered a previously overlooked feature of electron affinity difference between neighboring atoms as a universally predictive descriptor. Our graphlet-histogram approach not only highlights bonding-related elemental descriptors as unexpectedly powerful predictors of superconductivity but also provides a broadly applicable framework for predictive modeling of diverse material properties.</description>

      <title>Measuring intrinsic relaxation rates in superconductors using nonlinear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss intrinsic relaxation rates in superconductors, and how they may be measured using non-linear optical (terahertz) response. We consider both $s$ and $d$-wave superconductors, both with and without a phenomenological (energy dependent) damping. Intrinsic relaxation rates of interest include the Higgs mode decay rate, the quasiparticle redistribution rate ($1/T_1$) and the quasiparticle dephasing rate ($1/T_2$), where the latter two rates are zero in the pure BCS model, but non-zero in the presence of damping. Using the Anderson pseudospin formalism, we illustrate how these intrinsic relaxation rates are related to measurable quantities such as the time-dependent gap function and the non-linear current (a.k.a. third harmonic generation). Hence, we show how intrinsic relaxation rates may be experimentally extracted and discuss what one may thereby learn about the underlying damping. We also discuss the effects of polarization control (viz. non-linear response to light polarized in different directions), which offers a useful experimental knob, especially for $d$-wave superconductors, enabling selective excitation of modes in different irreducible representations (and readout of their corresponding relaxation rates).</description>

      <title>Superfluidity in Fermi systems within the framework of Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review is based on lectures given by the author at the Enrico Fermi Summer School in Varenna. It presents the basics of Density Functional Theory (DFT) for Fermi superfluids, with particular emphasis on nuclear systems. Special attention is given to the foundations of both DFT and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT). The review explores the advantages and challenges involved in the practical application of TDDFT to superfluid systems, as well as the typical approximations employed. Various applications of the TDDFT framework to the description of phenomena related to nonequilibrium superfluidity in atomic nuclei, neutron stars, and ultracold atoms are discussed.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of the superconducting diode effect of pair-density-wave states in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically study the efficiency of the intrinsic superconducting diode effect of several pair-density-wave states that can emerge in two-dimensional $d$-wave metallic altermagnets. To this end, we investigate several scenarios using an effective minimal microscopic model and Ginzburg-Landau analysis in order to derive the corresponding pairing phase diagrams. In addition, we examine also whether the presence of a Rashba spin-orbit coupling and an applied external magnetic field are beneficial to this effect in these systems. As a consequence, our results add further support to the fact that altermagnetic materials indeed provide a good platform for the pursuit of finite-momentum superconductivity, which can lead to an optimization of the diode efficiency in some physically interesting situations. The latter phenomenon has been recently proposed to be key in improving the applicability of new energy-efficient quantum electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Intrinsic Triplet Superconductivity in Noncentrosymmetric NbRe through Inverse Spin-Valve Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NbRe is a non-centrosymmetric superconductor that has been proposed as a candidate for intrinsic spin-triplet pairing. However, a conclusive demonstration of triplet pairing in NbRe is yet to be found. To probe the presence of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs, we fabricated Py/NbRe/Py trilayers capped with an antiferromagnetic layer. Magnetic and electrical measurements reveal an inverse spin-valve effect, which could indicate equal-spin triplet superconductivity. The minimal sample structure and the lack of ad hoc engineered interfaces clearly associate our observation to intrinsic triplet correlations of NbRe. The availability of NbRe in thin-film form and the simplicity of the heterostructure highlight its potential as a scalable platform for superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Odd-frequency Pairing in Josephson Junctions Coupled by Magnetic Textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson junctions coupled through magnetic textures provide a controllable platform for odd-frequency superconductivity and Majorana physics. Within a tight-binding Green function framework, induced pair correlations and spectral properties are analyzed under various magnetic and geometric conditions. When the junction is in the topologically trivial regime, even-frequency singlet pairing is dominant, whereas the topological phase is characterized by the coexistence of Majorana bound states and robust odd-frequency equal-spin triplet pairing at the interface edges. The odd-frequency polarized triplets reveal a divergent $1/\omega$ behavior when the Majorana states are decoupled, which is intrinsically connected to their self-conjugation property. The zero-frequency divergence evolves into shifted resonances and linear low-frequency behavior once hybridization occurs. A nonmagnetic interruption in the texture separates the topological superconductor into two topological segments and generates additional inner Majorana modes. When the nonmagnetic barrier is comparable to the inner Majorana states localization length, they hybridize and modify their associated odd-frequency triplet pairing, while the outer edge modes preserve their self-conjugated nature. Tuning the superconducting phase difference further controls the onset of the topological regime and the stability of localized Majorana states. The results highlight the central role of odd-frequency triplet correlations as a probe of topological superconductivity in magnetically engineered Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Electronic structures and superconductivity in Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has motivated extensive efforts to explore higher $T_c$ superconductors. Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% (~2/3) Nd doping level and then falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap. Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital, demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through the bilayer two-orbital t-J model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Modified Monte Carlo method with the heat bath algorithm for a model cuprate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of numerical simulation using a modified Monte Carlo method with a heat bath algorithm for the pseudospin model of cuprates are presented. The temperature phase diagrams are constructed for various degrees of doping and for various parameters of the model, and the effect of local correlations on the critical temperatures of the model cuprate is investigated. It is shown that, in qualitative agreement with the results of the mean field, the heat bath algorithm leads to a significant decrease in the estimate of critical temperatures due to more complete accounting of fluctuations, and also makes it possible to detect phase inhomogeneous states. The possibility of using machine learning to accelerate the heat bath algorithm is discussed.</description>

      <title>A novel way of recasting the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer gap equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gap equations lie at the core of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, a standard tool in the description of superfluidity. As a set of non-linear integral equations, the gap equations' inherent difficulties oftentimes hinder even the crudest descriptions of superfluid states. Hard-core potentials, high-density superfluids, and coupled-channel pairing are all reasons that have historically required one to provide special treatment to the gap equations to get a solution. In this paper we present a new method for solving the gap equations that holds the promise of being an efficient universal solver that requires the minimum amount of \textit{a priori} knowledge of the targeted solutions. With theoretical evidence of exotic nuclear superfluidity posing new questions to our understanding of this fundamental property of nuclear systems, the presented method can be a valuable tool when exploring new pairing states, finite-temperature properties, or the development of sophisticated descriptions of nuclear superfludity.</description>

      <title>Lithographic integration of TES microcalorimeters with SQUID multiplexer circuits for large format spectrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arrays of hundreds or thousands of low temperature detectors have been deployed for many experiments, both bolometers for long wavelength applications and calorimeters for shorter wavelength applications. One challenge that is common to many of these arrays is the efficient use of focal plane area to achieve a large fill fraction of absorbers coupled to detectors. We are developing an integrated fabrication of soft X-ray transition edge sensors (TES) and microwave SQUID multiplexers ($\mu$MUX) with the goal of maximizing the fill fraction of the focal plane area on a scale of many thousand pixel detectors. We will utilize lithographically defined high density interconnects to circumvent limitations in existing solutions that use wirebonds or flip-chip bonds. Here we report the first demonstration of combining TES and $\mu$MUX processes into a single TES-System-on-a-Chip (TES-SoC) fabrication on a silicon wafer. The $\mu$MUX SQUIDs and TES electrothermal feedback circuits are microfabricated first and protected with passivating SiO$_2$, then the TES devices and TES-to-SQUID interconnects are fabricated, and finally the protective layer is removed before the fabrication of the microwave resonators. We show that the microwave SQUIDs are functional and have reasonable yield, and that we are able to read out the transition temperature of the connected TESs using those SQUIDs.</description>

      <title>Higher-order epitaxy: A pathway to suppressing structural instability and emergent superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular beam epitaxy enables the growth of thin film materials with novel properties and functionalities. Typically, the lattice constants of films and substrates are designed to match to minimise disorders and strains. However, significant lattice mismatches can result in higher-order epitaxy, where commensurate growth occurs with a period defined by integer multiples of the lattice constants. Despite its potential, higher-order epitaxy is rarely used to enhance material properties or induce emergent phenomena. Here, we report single-crystalline FeTe films grown via 6:5 commensurate higher-order epitaxy on CdTe(001) substrates. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals self-organised periodic interstitials near the interface, arising from higher-order lattice matching. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction shows that the tetragonal-to-monoclinic structural transition in bulk FeTe is strongly suppressed. Remarkably, these films exhibit substrate-selective two-dimensional superconductivity, likely due to suppressed monoclinic distortion. These findings demonstrate the potential of higher-order epitaxy as a tool to control materials and inducing emergent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Amplification and Detection of Single Itinerant Microwave Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon detectors are an essential part of the toolbox of modern quantum optics for implementing quantum technologies and enabling tests of fundamental physics. The low energy of microwave photons, the natural signal path for superconducting quantum devices, makes their detection much harder than for visible light. Despite impressive progress in recent years and the proposal and realization of a number of different detector architectures, the reliable detection of a single itinerant microwave photon remains an open topic.
  Here, we investigate and simulate a detailed protocol for single-photon multiplication and subsequent amplification and detection. At its heart lies a Josephson-photonics device which uses inelastic Cooper-pair tunneling driven by a dc bias in combination with the energy of an incoming photon to create multiple photons, thus compensating for the low-energy problem. Our analysis provides clear design guidelines for utilizing such devices, which have previously been operated in an amplifier mode with a continuous wave input, for counting photons. Combining a formalism recently developed by M{\o}lmer to describe the full quantum state of in- and outgoing photon pulses with stochastic Schr\"odinger equations, we can describe the full multiplication and detection protocol and calculate performance parameters, such as detection probabilities and dark count rates. With optimized parameters, a high population of a single output mode can be achieved that can then be easily distinguished from vacuum noise in heterodyne measurements of quadratures with a conventional linear amplifier. Realistic devices with two multiplication stages with multiplication of $16$ reach for an impinging Gaussian pulse of length $T$ a detection probability of $84.5\%$ with a dark count rate of $10^{-3}/T$, and promise to outperform competing schemes.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and confinement: A new pairing mechanism in high-T_{C} cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02300v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that entanglement and confinement hole pairing (ECHP) is the precise physics for the entanglement framework of the RVB theory of high-Tc cuprates. Our novel strong ECHP mechanism explains the whole phase diagram of both electron and hole-doped cuprates, notably the linearly decreasing T* at the pseudogap, the duality of spin-gap and strange-metal phase, the Tc=T* at the optimum doping and the rest of over-doped regions of SC dome, presence of parallel superconducting stripes in CuO plane (spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized channels), and linear-T behavior of strange-metal phase above the overdoped regions of SC dome. It also explains experimental spin textures of cuprates. We refer to our new ECHP model as a resonating entanglement-confinement hole pair (RECHP) theory. Based on RECHP theory, we are able to give a conceptual and comprehensive qualitative explanation of the whole phase diagram, thus giving the sought-after mechanism responsible for the whole phase diagram of high-Tc cuprates.</description>

      <title>Vortex structure and intervortex interaction in superconducting structures with intrinsic diode effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the intrinsic superconducting diode effect can affect the structure, interactions and dynamics of Abrikosov vortices in non-centrosymmetric superconductor/ferromagnet hybrid structures. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory accounting for the spin-orbit and exchange-field effects predicts a chiral distortion of the superfluid velocity, non-central interaction forces and resulting torque in a vortex-antivortex pair, and anisotropy of the Bean-Livingston barrier. These closed-form results are fully confirmed by time-dependent GL numerical simulations carried out with a fourth-order least-squares finite-difference solver, which captures equilibrium single vortex configuration in realistic mesoscopic geometries. The analysis shows that the cubic gradient term shifts vortex cores by an amount proportional to the in-plane exchange field and simultaneously generates a lateral torque that can rotate entire vortex ensembles, showing how spin-orbit coupling and the exchange field enable breakdown of the vortex-antivortex symmetry in a finite-size sample. By combining transparent analytics with quantitative numerics, the work provides the hallmarks of vortex physics in superconducting structures with an intrinsic diode effect and supplies concrete guidelines for designing non-reciprocal superconducting circuits, fluxonic logic elements, and kinetic-inductance devices.</description>

      <title>Higgs mode in superconducting Titanium nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report observations of Higgs modes in superconducting Titanium nanostructures at very low temperature. They appear as anomalies in the microwave complex impedance of the samples revealed by the presence of a dc supercurrent. By varying the sample geometry and contact material, we probe how the Higgs modes are sensitive to the dimensionality of superconductivity, the penetration of the dc and ac current densities in the sample and the dissipation in the contacts.</description>

      <title>The Mottness and the Anderson localization in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The oxygen content plays a pivotal role in determining the electronic and superconducting properties of the recently discovered La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ superconductors. In this work, we investigate the impact of oxygen vacancies on the insulating behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ across the doping range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$. At $\delta = 0.5$, we construct a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model to describe the system. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the model captures the characteristics of a bilayer Mott insulator. To explore the effects of disorder within the range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$, we treat the system as a mixture of metallic and Mott insulating phases. By applying the dynamical cluster approximation and the typical medium dynamical cluster approximation, we identify an Anderson localization transition at a critical doping of $\delta \sim 0.2$ through the geometric average of the local density of states. This Anderson localization transition is the key reason for the suppression of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. These results provide a quantitative explanation of recent experimental observations and highlight the critical influence of oxygen content on the physical properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$.</description>

      <title>Topologically Charged Vortices at Superconductor-Quantum Hall Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore interface states between a type-II $s$-wave superconductor (SC) and a $\nu = 1$ quantum Hall (QH) state. We show that the effective interaction gives rise to two emergent Abelian Higgs fields, representing paired electrons localized at the SC-QH interface. These fields interact with each other in the presence of a Chern-Simons term originating from the QH sector. The Chern-Simons term leads to a topological contribution to the photon mass and imparts a \emph{fractional} topological charge of $e/2$ to the interface vortices. The topological mass modifies the vortex lattice at the interface, while the topological charge leads to formation of vortex quadruplets. We predict that these effects lead to a \emph{topological} Abrikosov lattice at the interface.</description>
