      <title>DIPSY: A new Disc Instability Population SYnthesis, I. Modeling, evolution of individual systems, and tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disc instability (DI) is a model aimed at explaining the formation of companions through the fragmentation of the circumstellar gas disc. Furthermore, DI could explain the formation of part of the observed exoplanetary population. We aim to provide a new comprehensive global model for the formation of companions via DI. The latter leads for the companions to orbital migration and damping of the eccentricities and inclinations. As it evolves, the disc is continuously monitored for self-gravity and fragmentation. When the conditions are satisfied, one (or several) clumps are inserted. The evolution of the clumps is then followed in detail. We showcased the model by performing a number of simulations for various initial conditions, from simple non-fragmenting systems to complex systems with many fragments. We confirm that the DIPSY model is a comprehensive and versatile global model of companion formation via DI. It enables studies of the formation of companions with planetary to low stellar masses around primaries with final masses that range from the brown dwarf to the B-star regime. We conclude that it is necessary to consider the many interconnected processes such as gas accretion, orbital migration, and N-body interactions, as they strongly influence the inferred population of forming objects. It is also clear that model assumptions play a key role in the determination of the systems undergoing formation.</description>

      <title>DIPSY: A new Disc Instability Population SYnthesis, II. The Populations of Companions Formed Through Disc Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We applied the global end-to-end model described in Paper~I of this series to perform a population synthesis of companions formed via disc instability (DI). By using initial conditions compatible with both observations and hydrodynamical simulations, and by studying a large range of primary masses (0.05-5 Msol), we can provide quantitative predictions of the outcome of DI.
  In the baseline population, we find that ~10 % of the discs fragment, and about half of these end up with a surviving companion after 100 Myr. 75\% of the companions are in the brown dwarf regime, 15 % are low-mass stars, and 10 % planets. At distances larger than ~100 au, DI produces planetary-mass companions on a low percent level. Inside of 100 AU, however, planetary-mass companions are very rare (low per mill level). The average companion mass is ~30 Mj scaling weakly with stellar mass. Most of the initial fragments do not survive on a Myr timescale; they either collide with other fragments or are ejected, resulting in a population of free-floating objects (about 1-2 per star). We also quantify several variant populations to critically assess some of our assumptions used in the baseline population.
  DI appears to be a key mechanism in the formation of distant companions with masses ranging from low-mass stars down to the planetary regime, contributing, however, only marginally to planetary mass objects inside of 100 AU. Our results are sensitive to a number of physical processes, which are not completely understood. Two of them, gas accretion and clump-clump collisions, are particularly important and need to be investigated further. Magnetic fields and heavy-element accretion have not been considered in our study, although they are also expected to affect the inferred population. We suggest acknowledging the importance of the gravito-turbulent phase, which most protoplanetary discs experience.</description>

      <title>Detection of an NH$_3$ absorption band at 2.2 $\mu$m on Europa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of NH$_3$-bearing components on icy planetary bodies has important implications for their geology and potential habitability. Here, I report the detection of a characteristic NH$_3$ absorption feature at 2.20 $\pm$ 0.02 $\mu$m on Europa, identified in an observation from the Galileo Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer. Spectral modeling and band position indicate that NH$_3$-hydrate and NH$_4$-chloride are the most plausible candidates. Spatial correlation between detected ammonia signatures and Europa's microchaos, linear, and band geologic units suggests emplacement from the underground or shallow subsurface. I posit that NH$_3$-bearing materials were transported to the surface via effusive cryovolcanism or similar mechanisms during Europa's recent geological past. The presence of ammoniated compounds implies a thinner ice shell (Spohn &amp; Schubert, 2003) and a thicker, chemically reduced, high-pH subsurface ocean on Europa (Hand et al. 2009). With the detection of NH$_3$-bearing components, this study presents the first evidence of a nitrogen-bearing species on Europa -- an observation of astrobiological significance given nitrogen's essential role in the chemistry of life.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised diffusion model fine-tuning for costate initialization using Markov chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global search and optimization of long-duration, low-thrust spacecraft trajectories with the indirect method is challenging due to a complex solution space and the difficulty of generating good initial guesses for the costate variables. This is particularly true in multibody environments. Given data that reveals a partial Pareto optimal front, it is desirable to find a flexible manner in which the Pareto front can be completed and fronts for related trajectory problems can be found. In this work we use conditional diffusion models to represent the distribution of candidate optimal trajectory solutions. We then introduce into this framework the novel approach of using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms with self-supervised fine-tuning to achieve the aforementioned goals. Specifically, a random walk Metropolis algorithm is employed to propose new data that can be used to fine-tune the diffusion model using a reward-weighted training based on efficient evaluations of constraint violations and missions objective functions. The framework removes the need for separate focused and often tedious data generation phases. Numerical experiments are presented for two problems demonstrating the ability to improve sample quality and explicitly target Pareto optimality based on the theory of Markov chains. The first problem does so for a transfer in the Jupiter-Europa circular restricted three-body problem, where the MCMC approach completes a partial Pareto front. The second problem demonstrates how a dense and superior Pareto front can be generated by the MCMC self-supervised fine-tuning method for a Saturn-Titan transfer starting from the Jupiter-Europa case versus a separate dedicated global search.</description>

      <title>Exploring Warm Jupiter Migration Pathways with Eccentricities. I. Catalog of Uniform Keplerian Fits to Radial Velocities of 200 Warm Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant planets are expected to predominantly form beyond the water ice line and occasionally undergo inward migration. Unlike hot Jupiters, which can result from high-eccentricity tidal migration, warm Jupiters between 0.1-1 AU ($\approx$10--365 d) are in many ways more challenging to explain because they reside outside the tidal influence of their host stars. Warm Jupiters should therefore preserve traces of their origins as their eccentricities are directly related to their past interactions. We analyze the eccentricities of 200 warm Jupiters orbiting 194 Sun-like host stars (with FGKM spectral types) using 18,587 RV measurements across 40 high-resolution spectrographs. RVs are compiled from the literature and are supplemented with 540 new observations from MINERVA-Australis at Mt. Kent Observatory and the Habitable-zone Planet Finder spectrograph at McDonald Observatory's Hobby-Eberly Telescope, which are timed to improve eccentricity constraints by sampling orbits near periastron passage. The overarching goal of this program is to establish the relative importance of giant planet migration channels through the largest homogeneous analysis of warm Jupiter orbital properties to date. In particular, we evaluate and compare the impact of different system architectures and host star characteristics on the population-level eccentricity distributions of warm Jupiters. Here, we present the target sample, observations, orbit fitting procedure, and parameter summary statistics of our survey. All orbit fit solutions, parameter posterior chains, and merged RV tables for each system are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Exploring Warm Jupiter Migration Pathways with Eccentricities II. Correlations with Host Star Properties and Orbital Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Warm Jupiters with orbital periods of $\approx$10-365 d represent a population of giant planets located well within the water ice line but beyond the region of tidal influence of their host star relevant for high-eccentricity tidal migration. Orbital eccentricities offer important clues about the formation and dynamical history of warm Jupiters because in situ formation and disk migration should imprint near-circular orbits whereas planet scattering should excite eccentricities. Based on uniform Keplerian fits of 18,587 RVs targeting 200 warm Jupiters, we use hierarchical Bayesian modeling to evaluate the impact of host star metallicity, stellar mass, and orbital separation on the reconstructed population-level eccentricity distributions. Warm Jupiters take on a broad range of eccentricities, and their population-level eccentricities are well modeled using a Beta distribution with $\alpha$ = 1.00$^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$ and $\beta$ = 2.79$^{+0.28}_{-0.26}$. We find that 27$^{+3}_{-4}\%$ of warm Jupiters have eccentricities consistent with near-circular orbits ($e$ $&lt;$ 0.1), suggesting that most warm Jupiters (73$^{+3}_{-3}\%$) detected are dynamically hot. Warm Jupiters orbiting metal-rich stars are more eccentric than those orbiting metal-poor stars -- in agreement with earlier findings -- but no differences are observed as a function of stellar host mass or orbital separation, at least within the characteristic ranges probed by our sample ($\approx$0.5--2.0 $M_{\odot}$ and 0.1--1 AU, respectively). In this sense, metallicity plays a larger role in shaping the underlying eccentricity distribution of warm Jupiters than stellar mass or final orbital distance. These results are broadly consistent with planet scattering playing a major role in shaping the orbital architectures of close-in giant planets.</description>

      <title>microJAX: A Differentiable Framework for Microlensing Modeling with GPU-Accelerated Image-Centered Ray Shooting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce microJAX, the first fully differentiable implementation of the image-centered ray-shooting (ICRS) algorithm for gravitational microlensing. Built on JAX and its XLA just-in-time compiler, microJAX exploits GPU parallelism while providing exact gradients through automatic differentiation. The current release supports binary- and triple-lens geometries, including limb-darkened extended-source effects, and delivers magnifications that remain differentiable for all model parameters. Benchmarks show that microJAX matches the accuracy of established packages and attains up to a factor of $\sim$5-6 speed-up in the small-source, limb-darkened regime on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. Since the model is fully differentiable, it integrates seamlessly with probabilistic programming frameworks, enabling scalable Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and variational inference workflows. Although the present work focuses on standard microlensing magnification models, the modular architecture is designed to support upcoming implementations of microlensing higher-order effects, while remaining compatible with external likelihood frameworks that incorporate advanced noise models. microJAX thus provides a robust foundation for precise and large-scale surveys anticipated in the coming decade, including the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, where scalable, physically self-consistent inference will be essential for maximizing scientific return.</description>

      <title>JCMT detection of HCN emission from 3I/ATLAS at 2.1 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of HCN ($J=3-2$) rotational emission from comet 3I/ATLAS at a heliocentric distance of 2.13 AU with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). Observations were conducted from 07 August 2025 (UT) using the $^{\prime}\overline U^{\prime}\overline u$ heterodyne receiver and ACSIS spectroscopic backend. The HCN line was detected at $&gt;5\sigma$ on 14 Sep 2025 (UT) and a production rate of $Q({\rm HCN})=(4.0\pm1.7)\times10^{25}\ {\rm s}^{-1}$ was derived by non-LTE radiative transfer modelling. Preliminary estimates of the HCN/H$_2$O and CN/HCN abundance ratios suggest values similar to Solar System comets.</description>

      <title>Eclipse Mapping with Ariel: Future Prospects for a Population-Level Mapping Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eclipse mapping is a powerful tool for measuring 3D profiles of exoplanet atmospheres. To date, only JWST has been capable of widely applying this technique, but as a general observatory, it is too time-limited to conduct population-level mapping studies. Ariel, on the other hand, is a dedicated exoplanet mission set to observe 1000 transiting exoplanets, making it a natural candidate for this. To assess Ariel's mapping potential, we quantitatively benchmark its abilities against those of JWST using a simulation-and-retrieval framework with existing JWST eclipse maps as test cases. We find that for high-ranking targets, Ariel will be able to derive qualitatively similar maps to JWST using the same amount of observations; for mid-ranking targets, Ariel will be able to compete using as few as 3x as many observations; and for lower-ranking targets, the use of phase curves overcomes the need for an impractical number of repeated eclipse observations. We find that while Ariel is unlikely to have extensive latitudinal mapping abilities, it will have wide-ranging longitudinal abilities, from which the first-order atmospheric dynamics can be constrained. Using an analytically-derived metric, we determine the best eclipse mapping targets for Ariel, finding that it will be able to map nearly 100 targets using full phase curves in only quarter of its lifetime. This would be the largest mapping survey to date, and have enormous ramifications for our understanding of exoplanet atmospheric dynamics. Finally, we rank all the best mapping targets for both JWST and Ariel in order to encourage future eclipse mapping studies.</description>

      <title>An Open-Access Web Tool for Light Curve Simulation and Analysis of Small Solar System Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a web-based application designed to simulate rotational light curves of small airless Solar System bodies under user-defined geometrical and physical conditions. The tool integrates both physical and empirical photometric models and enables users to input custom shape models, surface properties, and viewing geometries. A dedicated module also computes projected silhouettes at the epoch of stellar occultations, allowing direct comparison with observed chords. The application, developed in Python and Django, has been validated using well-characterized targets such as (136108) Haumea, (101955) Bennu, and (433) Eros, showing excellent agreement between synthetic and observed light curves and silhouettes. Beyond standard light curve simulations, the tool supports scenarios including surface heterogeneity, non-principal axis rotation (tumbling), and phase-angle effects. This flexible and accessible platform provides a powerful resource for interpreting photometric data, supporting ongoing observation campaigns, and aiding future mission planning.</description>

      <title>A Kinematic History of Stellar Encounters with Beta Pictoris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beta Pictoris is an A-type star hosting a complex planetary system with two massive gas giants and a prominent debris disk. Variable absorption lines in its stellar spectrum have been interpreted as signatures of exocomets (comet-like bodies transiting the star). Stellar flybys can gravitationally perturb objects in the outer comet reservoir, altering their orbits and potentially injecting them into the inner system, thereby triggering exocomet showers.
  We aim to assess the contribution of stellar flybys to the observed exocomet activity by reconstructing the stellar encounter history of beta Pictoris in the past and future.
  We used Gaia DR3 data, supplemented with radial velocities from complementary spectroscopic surveys, to compile a catalogue of stars currently within 80 pc of beta Pictoris. Their orbits were integrated backward and forward in time in an axisymmetric Galactic potential (Gala package) to identify encounters within 2 pc of the system.
  We identified 99 416 stars within 80 pc of beta Pictoris at present with resolved kinematics. Among these, 49 stars (including the eight components of five binaries) encounter beta Pictoris within 2 pc between -1.5 Myr and +2 Myr. For four of the binaries, the centre-of-mass trajectories also pass within 2 pc. We estimate the sample to be more than 60 % complete within 0.5 Myr of the present.
  Despite beta Pictoris being the eponym of its famous moving group, none of the identified encounters involved its moving group members; all are unrelated field stars. We find no encounter capable of shaping observed disc structures, although stellar flybys may contribute to the long-term evolution of a potential Oort Cloud. Our catalogue constitutes the most complete reconstruction of the beta Pictoris encounter history to date and provides a robust foundation for future dynamical simulations.</description>

      <title>Habitable World Discovery and Characterization: Coronagraph Concept of Operations and Data Post-Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery and characterization of habitable worlds was the top scientific recommendation of the Astro2020 decadal survey and is a key objective of the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Biosignature identification drives exceedingly challenging observations, which require raw contrasts of roughly 10$^{-10}$ contrast and ultimately, 1$\sigma$ photometric precision of roughly 3$\times 10^{-12}$ contrast. Despite significant advances for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's Coronagraph Instrument, technological gaps still exist in a wide range of technologies such as starlight suppression, deformable mirrors, wavefront control, low noise detectors, and high-contrast spectroscopy. Even with these new technologies matured, the Habitable Worlds Observatory must carefully obtain the observations and rely on post-processing of the data to achieve its science objectives.
  During the START and TAG efforts, a working group was convened to explore the Coronagraph Concept of Operations and Post Processing (COPP) in the context of the Habitable Worlds Observatory. This COPP working group evaluated coronagraphic concept of operations to enable different post processing approaches, such as reference differential imaging and angular differential imaging, polarization differential imaging, orbital differential imaging, coherent differential imaging, spectral processing, and point-spread function subtraction algorithms that incorporate ancillary telemetry and data. Future integrated modeling simulations and testbed demonstrations are needed to determine the achievable post processing gains for each approach. We report a summary of this working group's activities and findings, as well as an outlook for maturation of these techniques and infusion into the Habitable Worlds Observatory technology portfolio.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Interior Structure and Mode of Tidal Heating in Enceladus</title>

Abstract: Enceladus is among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system due to its astrobiological potential. Determining the extent and duration of habitability (i.e., sustained habitability) requires characterizing the interior properties and the level and distribution of tidal heating in Enceladus. Inferring the intensity of geophysical activity in the core has direct implications for the potential hydrothermal activity and supply of chemical species important for habitability to the ocean. We build a statistical framework to constrain the interior using estimates of libration, shape, heat flux, gravity, and total mass. We use this framework to examine the extent that geodetic measurements can improve our understanding of the interior structure, with an emphasis on partitioning of dissipation between the shell and the core. We quantify plausible ranges of gravitational (k2) and displacement (h2, l2) tidal Love numbers consistent with existing observations. We demonstrate that measuring k2 alone can only constrain the total tidally dissipated energy, but not its radial distribution. However, measuring the amplitude and phase of h2 or l2 facilitates determining the extent of tidal dissipation in the shell and the core. We provide the precisions required for measuring k2, h2, and l2 that enable distinguishing between the main tidal heating scenarios, i.e., in the shell versus the core. We also explore the effect of the structural heterogeneities of the shell on the tidal response. Lastly, we evaluate the efficacy of future geodetic measurements to constrain key interior properties essential to understand the present-day (instantaneous) and long-term (sustained) habitability at Enceladus.</description>

      <title>The mass of the exo-Venus Gliese 12 b, as revealed by HARPS-N, ESPRESSO, and CARMENES</title>

Abstract: Small temperate planets are prime targets for exoplanet studies due to their possible similarities with the rocky planets in the Solar System. M dwarfs are promising hosts since the planetary signals are within our current detection capabilities. Gliese 12 b is a Venus-sized temperate planet orbiting a quiet M dwarf. We present here the first precise mass measurement of this small exoplanet. We performed a detailed analysis using HARPS-N, ESPRESSO, and CARMENES radial velocities, along with new and archival \tess, \cheops, and MuSCAT2/3 photometry data. From fitting the available data, we find that the planet has a radius of $R_\mathrm{p} = 0.93\pm0.06 \,\mathrm{R_\oplus}$ and a mass of $M_\mathrm{p} = 0.95^{+0.29}_{-0.30} \,\mathrm{M_\oplus}$ (a $3.2\sigma$ measurement of the semi-amplitude $K=0.67\pm0.21\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}$), and is on an orbit with a period of $12.761418^{+0.000060}_{-0.000055}\,\mathrm{d}$. A variety of techniques were utilised to attenuate stellar activity signals. Gliese 12 b has an equilibrium temperature of $T_\mathrm{eq}=317 \pm 8\,\mathrm{K}$, assuming an albedo of zero, and a density consistent with that of Earth and Venus ($\rho_\mathrm{p}=6.4\pm2.4\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$). We find that Gliese 12 b has a predominantly rocky interior and simulations indicate that it is unlikely to have retained any of its primordial gaseous envelope. The bulk properties of Gliese 12 b place it in an extremely sparsely populated region of both mass--radius and density--$T_\mathrm{eq}$ parameter space, making it a prime target for follow-up observations, including Lyman-$\alpha$ studies.</description>

      <title>Poro-viscoelastic tidal heating of Io</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Io's tidally driven global volcanism indicates widespread partial melting in its mantle. How this melt participates in the interior dynamics, and, in particular, the role it plays in tidal dissipation, is poorly understood. We model Io's tidal deformation by treating its mantle as a two-phase (solid and melt) system. By combining poro-viscous and poro-elastic compaction theories in a Maxwell framework with a consistent model of tidal and self-gravitation, we produce the first self-consistent evaluation of Io's tidal heating rate due to shearing, compaction, and Darcy flow.
  We find that Darcy dissipation can potentially exceed shear heating, but only for large (0.05 to 0.2) melt fractions, and if the grain size is large or melt viscosity ultra-low. Since grain sizes larger than 1cm are unlikely, this suggests that Darcy dissipation is secondary to shear dissipation. Compaction dissipation is maximised when the asthenosphere is highly resistive to isotropic stresses, but contributes at most 1% of Io's observed heating rate.
  This work represents a crucial step toward a self-consistent quantitative theory for the dynamics of Io's partially molten interior.</description>

      <title>How two-dimensional are planet--disc interactions? I. Locally isothermal discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planet--disc interactions, despite being fundamentally three-dimensional, are often studied in the two-dimensional `thin-disk' approximation. The overall morphology of planet--disc interactions has ben shown to be similar in both 2D and 3D simulations, however, the ability of a 2D simulation to quantitatively match 3D results depends strongly on how the potential of the planet is handled. Typically, the 2D planetary potential is smoothed out using some `smoothing length', a free parameter, for which different values have been proposed, depending on the particular aspect of the interaction focused on. In this paper, we re-derive 2D Navier--Stokes in detail for planet--disc interactions to find better ways to represent the 2D gravitational force. We perform a large suite of 2D and 3D simulations to test these force prescriptions. We identify the parts of the interaction that are fundamentally 3D, and test how well our new force prescriptions, as well as traditional smoothed potentials, are able to match 3D simulations. Overall, we find that the optimal way to represent the planetary potential is the `Bessel-type potential', but that even in this case 2D simulations are unable to reproduce the correct scaling of the total torque with background gradients, and are at best able match the one-sided Lindblad torque and gap widths to level of 10 per cent. We find that analysis of observed gap structures based on standard 2D simulations may systematically underestimate planetary masses by a factor of two, and discuss the impacts of 3D effects on observations of velocity kinks.</description>

      <title>Icy or Rocky? Convective or Stable? New interior models of Uranus and Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new framework for constructing agnostic and yet physical models for planetary interiors and apply it to Uranus and Neptune. Unlike previous research that either impose rigid assumptions or rely on simplified empirical profiles, our approach bridges both paradigms. Starting from randomly generated density profiles, we applied an iterative algorithm that converges towards models that simultaneously satisfy hydrostatic equilibrium, match the observed gravitational moments, and remain thermodynamically and compositionally consistent. The inferred interior models for Uranus and Neptune span a wide range of possible interior structures, in particular encompassing both water-dominated and rock-dominated configurations (rock-to-water mass ratios between 0.04-3.92 for Uranus and 0.20-1.78 for Neptune). All models contain convective regions with ionic water and have temperature-pressure profiles that remain above the demixing curves for hydrogen-helium-water mixtures. This offers both a plausible explanation for the observed non-dipolar magnetic fields and indicates that no hydrogen-helium-water demixing occurs. We find a higher H-He mass fraction in the outermost convection zones for Uranus (0.62-0.73) compared to Neptune (0.25-0.49) and that Uranus' magnetic field is likely generated deeper in the interior compared to Neptune. We infer upper limits of 0.69-0.74 (Uranus) versus 0.78-0.92 (Neptune) for the outer edges of the dynamo regions in units of normalised radii. Overall, our findings challenge the conventional classification of Uranus and Neptune as 'ice giants' and underscore the need for improved observational data or formation constraints to break compositional degeneracy.</description>
