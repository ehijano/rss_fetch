      <title>Finite Element and Machine Learning Modeling of Autogenous Self-Healing Concrete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A time-dependent modeling framework for autogenous self-healing concrete that couples moisture diffusion with damage evolution was developed. Water transport follows Fick's second law with a damage-dependent diffusivity obtained by power-law interpolation between intact concrete and crack space. Healing reduces damage in proportion to local moisture and a smoothed cement availability field computed via a Helmholtz filter. Two finite element variants were implemented in FEniCSx over time horizons up to $5\times10^6$ seconds: a Crack Diffusion Model (CDM) with standard diffusion and a Crack Membrane Model (CMM) that gates cross-crack transport until a critical moisture threshold is reached. Key control parameters are the initial crack orientation and size, the diffusion coefficients of intact and cracked concrete, the healing rate constant, and the cement availability smoothing parameter. Simulations on a unit square domain show that healing time varies non-monotonically with crack orientation, peaking near $45^\circ$ and $135^\circ$ and minimizing near $90^\circ$, consistent with diffusion distance to crack endpoints dominating the process. The dependence on crack width reverses with material parameters: healing time increases when $D_{\text{cracked}}&lt;D_{\text{intact}}$ and decreases when $D_{\text{cracked}}&gt;D_{\text{intact}}$. The CMM reproduces staged moisture penetration with delayed gate activation but lengthens total healing time, whereas the CDM is efficient for parametric sweeps. Machine learning classifiers trained on one million simulation samples predict binary healing outcomes $H(\sigma,\gamma,t)$ (healed or not) with high accuracy (up to 0.998 for neural networks). Although experimental calibration is still required, the framework provides a versatile tool for guiding laboratory studies and implementations of self-healing concrete.</description>

      <title>A polygonal Reissner-Mindlin plate element based on the scaled boundary finite element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a polygonal Reissner-Mindlin plate element is presented. The formulation is based on a scaled boundary finite element method, where in contrast to the original semi-analytical approach, linear shape functions are introduced for the parametrization of the scaling and the radial direction. This yields a fully discretized formulation, which enables the use of non-star-convex-polygonal elements with an arbitrary number of edges, simplifying the meshing process. To address the common effect of transverse shear locking for low-order Reissner-Mindlin elements in the thin-plate limit, an assumed natural strain approach for application on the polygonal scaled boundary finite elements is derived. Further, a two-field variational formulation is introduced to incorporate three-dimensional material laws. Here the plane stress assumptions are enforced on the weak formulation, facilitating the use of material models defined in three-dimensional continuum while considering the effect of Poisson's thickness locking. The effectiveness of the proposed formulation is demonstrated in various numerical examples.</description>

      <title>SparseEB-gMCR: A Generative Solver for Extreme Sparse Components with Application to Contamination Removal in GC-MS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical chemistry instruments provide physically meaningful signals for elucidating analyte composition and play important roles in material, biological, and food analysis. These instruments are valued for strong alignment with physical principles, enabling compound identification through pattern matching with chemical libraries. More reliable instruments generate sufficiently sparse signals for direct interpretation. Generative multivariate curve resolution (gMCR) and its energy-based solver (EB-gMCR) offer powerful tools for decomposing mixed signals suitable for chemical data analysis. However, extreme signal sparsity from instruments such as GC-MS or 1H-NMR can impair EB-gMCR decomposability. To address this, a fixed EB-select module inheriting EB-gMCR's design was introduced for handling extreme sparse components. Combined with minor adjustments to energy optimization, this led to SparseEB-gMCR. In synthetic datasets, SparseEB-gMCR exhibited comparable decomposability and graceful scalability to dense-component EB-gMCR. The sparse variant was applied to real GC-MS chromatograms for unsupervised contamination removal. Analysis showed siloxane-related pollution signals were effectively eliminated, improving compound identification reliability. Results demonstrate that SparseEB-gMCR preserves the decomposability and self-determining component capability of EB-gMCR while extending adaptability to sparse and irregular chemical data. With this sparse extension, the EB-gMCR family becomes applicable to wider ranges of real-world chemical datasets, providing a general mathematical framework for signal unmixing and contamination elimination in analytical chemistry.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Layer Machine Learning and Econometric Pipeline for Forecasting Market Risk: Evidence from Cryptoasset Liquidity Spillovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969; Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors (HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74 assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap, Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided in the artifact repository.</description>

      <title>AI PB: A Grounded Generative Agent for Personalized Investment Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100 GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI insights in high-stakes finance.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Exchange that Mitigate a Bribery Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the popularity of Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) because of their use in wide areas of applications such as payment channels, atomic swaps, etc, their use in exchange is still questionable. This is because of its incentive incompatibility and susceptibility to bribery attacks.
  State-of-the-art solutions such as MAD-HTLC (Oakland'21) and He-HTLC (NDSS'23) address this by leveraging miners' profit-driven behaviour to mitigate such attacks. The former is the mitigation against passive miners; however, the latter works against both active and passive miners. However, they consider only two bribing scenarios where either of the parties involved in the transfer collude with the miner.
  In this paper, we expose vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art solutions by presenting a miner-collusion bribery attack with implementation and game-theoretic analysis. Additionally, we propose a stronger attack on MAD-HTLC than He-HTLC, allowing the attacker to earn profits equivalent to attacking naive HTLC.
  Leveraging our insights, we propose \prot, a game-theoretically secure HTLC protocol resistant to all bribery scenarios. \prot\ employs a two-phase approach, preventing unauthorized token confiscation by third parties, such as miners. In Phase 1, parties commit to the transfer; in Phase 2, the transfer is executed without manipulation. We demonstrate \prot's efficiency in transaction cost and latency via implementations on Bitcoin and Ethereum.</description>

      <title>Prot2Text-V2: Protein Function Prediction with Multimodal Contrastive Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting protein function from sequence is a central challenge in computational biology. While existing methods rely heavily on structured ontologies or similarity-based techniques, they often lack the flexibility to express structure-free functional descriptions and novel biological functions. In this work, we introduce Prot2Text-V2, a novel multimodal sequence-to-text model that generates free-form natural language descriptions of protein function directly from amino acid sequences. Our method combines a protein language model as a sequence encoder (ESM-3B) and a decoder-only language model (LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct) through a lightweight nonlinear modality projector. A key innovation is our Hybrid Sequence-level Contrastive Alignment Learning (H-SCALE), which improves cross-modal learning by matching mean- and std-pooled protein embeddings with text representations via contrastive loss. After the alignment phase, we apply instruction-based fine-tuning using LoRA on the decoder to teach the model how to generate accurate protein function descriptions conditioned on the protein sequence. We train Prot2Text-V2 on about 250K curated entries from SwissProt and evaluate it under low-homology conditions, where test sequences have low similarity with training samples. Prot2Text-V2 consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across various metrics.</description>

      <title>Local-Global Associative Frames for Symmetry-Preserving Crystal Structure Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal structures are defined by the periodic arrangement of atoms in 3D space, inherently making them equivariant to SO(3) group. A fundamental requirement for crystal property prediction is that the model's output should remain invariant to arbitrary rotational transformations of the input structure. One promising strategy to achieve this invariance is to align the given crystal structure into a canonical orientation with appropriately computed rotations, or called frames. However, existing work either only considers a global frame or solely relies on more advanced local frames based on atoms' local structure. A global frame is too coarse to capture the local structure heterogeneity of the crystal, while local frames may inadvertently disrupt crystal symmetry, limiting their expressivity. In this work, we revisit the frame design problem for crystalline materials and propose a novel approach to construct expressive Symmetry-Preserving Frames, dubbed as SPFrame, for modeling crystal structures. Specifically, this local-global associative frame constructs invariant local frames rather than equivariant ones, thereby preserving the symmetry of the crystal. In parallel, it integrates global structural information to construct an equivariant global frame to enforce SO(3) invariance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SPFrame consistently outperforms traditional frame construction techniques and existing crystal property prediction baselines across multiple benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>Geospatial AI for Liquefaction Hazard and Impact Forecasting: A Demonstrative Study in the U.S. Pacific Northwest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent large-magnitude earthquakes have demonstrated the damaging consequences of soil liquefaction and reinforced the need to understand and plan for liquefaction hazards at a regional scale. In the United States, the Pacific Northwest is uniquely vulnerable to such consequences given the potential for crustal, intraslab, and subduction zone earthquakes. In this study, the liquefaction hazard is predicted geospatially at high resolution and across regional scales for 85 scenario earthquakes in the states of Washington and Oregon. This is accomplished using an emergent geospatial model that is driven by machine learning, and which predicts the probability of damaging ground deformation by surrogating state-of-practice geotechnical models. The adopted model shows improved performance and has conceptual advantages over prior regional-scale modeling approaches in that predictions (i) are informed by mechanics, (ii) employ more geospatial information using machine learning, and (iii) are geostatistically anchored to known subsurface conditions. The utility of the resulting predictions for the 85 scenarios is then demonstrated via asset and network infrastructure vulnerability assessments. The liquefaction hazard forecasts are published in a GIS-ready, public repository and are suitable for disaster simulations, evacuation route planning, network vulnerability analysis, land-use planning, insurance loss modeling, hazard communication, public investment prioritization, and other regional-scale applications.</description>
