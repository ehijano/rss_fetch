      <title>Evolutionary Optimization Trumps Adam Optimization on Embedding Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models, especially diffusion architectures, have transformed image generation; however, they are challenging to control and optimize for specific goals without expensive retraining. Embedding Space Exploration, especially with Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), has been shown to be a promising method for optimizing image generation, particularly within Diffusion Models. Therefore, in this work, we study the performance of an evolutionary optimization method, namely Separable Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (sep-CMA-ES), against the widely adopted Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), applied to Stable Diffusion XL Turbo's prompt embedding vector. The evaluation of images combines the LAION Aesthetic Predictor V2 with CLIPScore into a weighted fitness function, allowing flexible trade-offs between visual appeal and adherence to prompts. Experiments on a subset of the Parti Prompts (P2) dataset showcase that sep-CMA-ES consistently yields superior improvements in aesthetic and alignment metrics in comparison to Adam. Results indicate that the evolutionary method provides efficient, gradient-free optimization for diffusion models, enhancing controllability without the need for fine-tuning. This study emphasizes the potential of evolutionary methods for embedding space exploration of deep generative models and outlines future research directions.</description>

      <title>A Reinforced Evolution-Based Approach to Multi-Resource Load Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a reinforced genetic approach to a defined d-resource system optimization problem. The classical evolution schema was ineffective due to a very strict feasibility function in the studied problem. Hence, the presented strategy has introduced several modifications and adaptations to standard genetic routines, e.g.: a migration operator which is an analogy to the biological random genetic drift.</description>

      <title>Neural Computation Without Slots: Steps Towards Biologically Plausible Memory and Attention in Natural and Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many models used in artificial intelligence and cognitive science rely on multi-element patterns stored in "slots" - dedicated storage locations - in a digital computer. As biological brains likely lack slots, we consider how they might achieve similar functional outcomes without them by building on the neurally-inspired modern Hopfield network (MHN; Krotov &amp; Hopfield, 2021), which stores patterns in the connection weights of an individual neuron. We propose extensions of this approach to increase its biological plausibility as a model of memory and to capture an important advantage of slot-based computation in contemporary language models. For memory, neuroscience research suggests that the weights of overlapping sparse ensembles of neurons, rather than a dedicated individual neuron, are used to store a memory. We introduce the K-winner MHN, extending the approach to ensembles, and find that within a continual learning regime, the ensemble-based MHN exhibits greater retention of older memories, as measured by the graded sensitivity measure d', than a standard (one-neuron) MHN. Next, we consider the powerful use of slot-based memory in contemporary language models. These models use slots to store long sequences of past inputs and their learned encodings, supporting later predictions and allowing error signals to be transported backward in time to adjust weights underlying the learned encodings of these past inputs. Inspired by these models' successes, we show how the MHN can be extended to capture both of these important functional outcomes. Collectively, our modeling approaches constitute steps towards understanding how biologically plausible mechanisms can support computations that have enabled AI systems to capture human-like abilities that no prior models have been able to achieve.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Astrocyte Network Calcium Dynamics for Biologically Plausible Intelligence in Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network anomaly detection systems encounter several challenges with traditional detectors trained offline. They become susceptible to concept drift and new threats such as zero-day or polymorphic attacks. To address this limitation, we propose a Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning framework that draws inspiration from astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in the brain, where rapid, context-sensitive adaptation enables robust information processing. Our approach couples a multicellular astrocyte dynamics simulator with a deep neural network (DNN). The simulator models astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics through three key mechanisms: IP$_3$-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release, SERCA pump uptake, and conductance-aware diffusion through gap junctions between cells. Evaluation of our proposed network on CTU-13 (Neris) network traffic data demonstrates the effectiveness of our biologically plausible approach. The Ca$^{2+}$-gated model outperforms a matched baseline DNN, achieving up to $\sim$98\% accuracy with reduced false positives and negatives across multiple train/test splits. Importantly, this improved performance comes with negligible runtime overhead once Ca$^{2+}$ trajectories are precomputed. While demonstrated here for cybersecurity applications, this Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning framework offers a generic solution for streaming detection tasks that require rapid, biologically grounded adaptation to evolving data patterns.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multimodal Protein Function Prediction Through Dual-Branch Dynamic Selection with Reconstructive Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal protein features play a crucial role in protein function prediction. However, these features encompass a wide range of information, ranging from structural data and sequence features to protein attributes and interaction networks, making it challenging to decipher their complex interconnections. In this work, we propose a multimodal protein function prediction method (DSRPGO) by utilizing dynamic selection and reconstructive pre-training mechanisms. To acquire complex protein information, we introduce reconstructive pre-training to mine more fine-grained information with low semantic levels. Moreover, we put forward the Bidirectional Interaction Module (BInM) to facilitate interactive learning among multimodal features. Additionally, to address the difficulty of hierarchical multi-label classification in this task, a Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) is designed to select the feature representation that is most conducive to current protein function prediction. Our proposed DSRPGO model improves significantly in BPO, MFO, and CCO on human datasets, thereby outperforming other benchmark models.</description>

      <title>Why Consciousness Should Explain Physical Phenomena: Toward a Testable Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reductionist approach commonly employed in scientific methods presupposes that both macro and micro phenomena can be explained by micro-level laws alone. This assumption implies intra-level causal closure, rendering all macro phenomena epiphenomenal. However, the integrative nature of consciousness suggests that it is a macro phenomenon. To ensure scientific testability and reject epiphenomenalism, the reductionist assumption of intra-level causal closure must be rejected. This implies that even neural-level behavior cannot be explained by observable neural-level laws alone. Therefore, a new methodology is necessary to acknowledge the causal efficacy of macro-level phenomena. We model the brain as operating under dual laws at different levels. This model includes hypothetical macro-level psychological laws that are not determined solely by micro-level neural laws, as well as the causal effects from macro to micro levels. In this study, we propose a constructive approach that explains both mental and physical phenomena through the interaction between these two sets of laws.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient and Accurate Spiking Neural Networks via Adaptive Bit Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets, including the static CIFAR and ImageNet datasets and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS, DVS-GESTURE, and SHD datasets, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69% accuracy gain and 4.16x lower bit budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be open-sourced.</description>
