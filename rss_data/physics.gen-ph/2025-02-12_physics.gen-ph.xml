      <title>EPR Paradox, Bell Inequalities and Peculiarities of Quantum Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum theory revolutionised physics by introducing a new fundamental constant and a new mathematical framework to describe the observed phenomena at the atomic scale. These new concepts run counter to our familiar notions of classical physics, and pose questions about how to understand quantum physics as a fundamental theory of nature. Peculiarities of quantum correlations underlie all these questions, and this article describes their formulation, tests and resolution within the standard framework of quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized formulation for ideal light-powered systems through energy and entropy flow analysis Part 2: Beyond the first-order evaluation under realistic conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For photosynthetic systems under irradiation not limited to blackbody radiation, this study formulates the ideal efficiency and Boltzmann factor in a general form based on energy-entropy flow analysis, assuming zero entropy generation within the system as the ideal condition. The non-equilibrium contribution between the radiation and system, which increases with the absorption rate and reduces the ideal efficiency, is quantitatively analyzed, first for monochromatic light. Based on these results, a unified formula for the ideal efficiency of a light-powered system with an absorption rate |$\varepsilon$| for non-monochromatic light diluted with a dilution factor d after being emitted by blackbody radiation at temperature T is derived in the most compact form. This formulation is then extended to include cases wherein entropy was discarded from the system via radiation simultaneously with waste heat. This leads to a unified reclassification of several previously proposed ideal efficiencies, such as the Jeter, Spanner, and Petela, as the basis of practical efficiency, based on flow conditions. Furthermore, in this study, previous frameworks on light-powered systems are classified into piston-cylinder (closed photon gas) and flowing radiation (open photon gas) models, demonstrating that the latter better suits microscopic light-powered systems. Finally, two issues related to the ideal efficiency derived from the prior flowing radiation model (Landsberg and Tonge, 1980), often referred to as the Landsberg limit, have been resolved using a mathematical model constructed in this study based on Einstein's absorption and radiation theory. The ideal efficiency obtained is found to be very similar to Carnot efficiency.</description>

      <title>Stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics assuming that vacuum fields are real</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I review the realistic interpretation of several typically quantum phenomena using a heuristic approach that rests on the assumption that the electromagnetic quantum vacuum is a stochastic field. I include the particle behaviour of light, the photoelectric effect, the hdrogen atom, the Casimir effect, and entanglement in the optical tests of Bell inequalities. The stochastic approach might be formally connected with the standard Hilbert space formalism via the Wigner representation of the field.</description>

      <title>Quasilattices of the Spectre monotile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spectre is a family of recently discovered aperiodic monotiles that tile the plane only in non-periodic ways, and novel physical phenomena have been predicted for planar systems made of aperiodic monotiles. It is shown that point decorations of Tile(1,1), the base tile for all Spectres, supports the generation of a large variety of aperiodic quasilattices, in contrast to Bravais-lattices in which all point decorations would be periodic. A lattice generating function is introduced as a mapping from point decorations to quasilattice space, and investigated systematically. It is found that some lattices result from the properties of nearest-neighbor distances of point decorations, and that other lattices show near-periodicity in projections to one of the axes of a tilted tiling. It is concluded that the lattice generating function can serve as a template for the design of physical potential landscapes that can be controlled by the point decoration as a parameter.</description>
