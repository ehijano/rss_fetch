      <title>Irregular sets for a class of skew product transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the irregular set of any continuous observable for a class of skew product transformations, which is driven by a uniquely ergodic homeomorphism system $(\Omega,\mathbb{P},\theta)$ and satisfies Anosov and toplogical mixing on fibers property. We prove that if the irregular set of any continuous observable is nonempty on a fiber, then the irregular set must be nonempty, residual, and carry full fiber topological entropy on $\mathbb{P}$-a.e. fibers. The orbit-gluing technique provided by the fiber specification property are utilized.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of open and semi-open maps of compact Hausdorff spaces by induced maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f\colon X\rightarrow Y$ be a continuous surjection of compact Hausdorff spaces. By $$f_*\colon\mathfrak{M}(X)\rightarrow\mathfrak{M}(Y),\ \mu\mapsto \mu\circ f^{-1} \quad{\rm and}\quad 2^f\colon2^X\rightarrow2^Y,\ A\mapsto f[A]$$ we denote the induced continuous surjections on the probability measure spaces and hyperspaces, respectively. In this paper we mainly show the following facts:
  (1) If $f_*$ is semi-open, then $f$ is semi-open.
  (2) If $f$ is semi-open densely open, then $f_*$ is semi-open densely open.
  (3) $f$ is open iff $2^f$ is open.
  (4) $f$ is semi-open iff $2^f$ is semi-open.
  (5) $f$ is irreducible iff $2^f$ is irreducible.</description>

      <title>SIR models with vital dynamics, reinfection and randomness to investigate the spread of infectious diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate SIR models with vital dynamics, reinfection, and randomness at the transmission coefficient and recruitment rate. Initially, we conduct an extensive analysis of the autonomous scenario, covering aspects such as local and global well-posedness, the existence and internal structure of attractors, and the presence of gradient dynamics. Subsequently, we explore the implications of small nonautonomous random perturbations, establishing the continuity of attractors and ensuring their topological structural stability. Additionally, we study scenarios in which both the transmission coefficient and the recruitment rate exhibit time-dependent or random behavior. For each scenario, we establish the existence of attractors and delineate conditions that determine whether the disease is eradicated or reaches an endemic state. Finally, we depict numerical simulations to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Optimized Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Reconstruction and Forecasting of Atmospheric Chemistry Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the optimized dynamic mode decomposition algorithm for constructing an adaptive and computationally efficient reduced order model and forecasting tool for global atmospheric chemistry dynamics. By exploiting a low-dimensional set of global spatio-temporal modes, interpretable characterizations of the underlying spatial and temporal scales can be computed. Forecasting is also achieved with a linear model that uses a linear superposition of the dominant spatio-temporal features. The DMD method is demonstrated on three months of global chemistry dynamics data, showing its significant performance in computational speed and interpretability. We show that the presented decomposition method successfully extracts known major features of atmospheric chemistry, such as summertime surface pollution and biomass burning activities. Moreover, the DMD algorithm allows for rapid reconstruction of the underlying linear model, which can then easily accommodate non-stationary data and changes in the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Multiband linear cellular automata and endomorphisms of algebraic vector groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a correspondence between certain multiband linear cellular automata - models of computation widely used in the description of physical phenomena - and endomorphisms of certain algebraic unipotent groups over finite fields. The correspondence is based on the construction of a universal element specialising to a normal generator for any finite field. We use this correspondence to deduce new results concerning the temporal dynamics of such automata, using our prior, purely algebraic, study of the endomorphism ring of vector groups. These produce 'for free' a formula for the number of fixed points of the $n$-iterate in terms of the $p$-adic valuation of $n$, a dichotomy for the Artin-Mazur dynamical zeta function, and an asymptotic formula for the number of periodic orbits. Since multiband linear cellular automata simulate higher order linear automata (in which states depend on finitely many prior temporal states, not just the direct predecessor), the results apply equally well to that class.</description>

      <title>Infinite unrestricted sumsets of the form $B+B$ in sets with large density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a set $A \subset \mathbb{N}$ we characterize in terms of its density when there exists an infinite set $B \subset \mathbb{N}$ and $t \in \{0,1\}$ such that $B+B \subset A-t$, where $B+B : =\{b_1+b_2\colon b_1,b_2 \in B\}$. Specifically, when the lower density $\underline{d}(A) &gt;1/2$ or the upper density $\overline{d}(A)&gt; 3/4$, the existence of such a set $B\subset \mathbb{N}$ and $t\in \{0,1\}$ is assured. Furthermore, whenever $\underline{d}(A) &gt; 3/4$ or $\overline{d}(A)&gt;5/6$, we show that the shift $t$ is unnecessary and we also provide examples to show that these bounds are sharp. Finally, we construct a syndetic three-coloring of the natural numbers that does not contain a monochromatic $B+B+t$ for any infinite set $B \subset \mathbb{N}$ and number $t \in \mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>On the evolution of slow dispersal in multi-species communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.08498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any $N \geq 2$, we show that there are choices of diffusion rates $\{d_i\}_{i=1}^N$ such that for $N$ competing species which are ecologically identical and having distinct diffusion rates, the slowest disperser is able to competitive exclude the remainder of the species. In fact, the choices of such diffusion rates is open in the Hausdorff topology. Our result provides some evidence in the affirmative direction regarding the conjecture by Dockery et al. in 1998. The main tools include Morse decomposition of the semiflow, as well as the theory of normalized principal Floquet bundle for linear parabolic equations. A critical step in the proof is to establish the smooth dependence of the Floquet bundle on diffusion rate and other coefficients, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On p-biharmonic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.15249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we study $p$-biharmonic curves as a natural generalization of biharmonic curves. In contrast to biharmonic curves $p$-biharmonic curves do not need to have constant geodesic curvature if $p=\frac{1}{2}$ in which case their equation reduces to the one of $\frac{1}{2}$-elastic curves. We will classify $\frac{1}{2}$-biharmonic curves on closed surfaces and three-dimensional space forms making use of the results obtained for $\frac{1}{2}$-elastic curves from the literature. By making a connection to magnetic geodesic we are able to prove the existence of $\frac{1}{2}$-biharmonic curves on closed surfaces. In addition, we will discuss the stability of $p$-biharmonic curves with respect to normal variations. Our analysis highlights some interesting relations between $p$-biharmonic and $p$-elastic curves.</description>

      <title>Dimension two holomorphic distributions on four-dimensional projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08901v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional holomorphic distributions on $\mathbb{P}^4$. We classify dimension two distributions, of degree at most $2$, with either locally free tangent sheaf or locally free conormal sheaf and whose singular scheme has pure dimension one. We show that the corresponding sheaves are split. Next, we investigate the geometry of such distributions, studying from maximally non-integrable to integrable distributions. In the maximally non-integrable case, we show that the distribution is either of Lorentzian type or a push-forward by a rational map of the Cartan prolongation of a singular contact structure on a weighted projective 3-fold. We study distributions of dimension two in $\mathbb{P}^4$ whose the conormal sheaves are the Horrocks-Mumford sheaves, describing the numerical invariants of their singular schemes which are smooth and connected. Such distributions are maximally non-integrable, uniquely determined by their singular schemes and invariant by a group $H_5 \rtimes SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_5) \subset Sp(4, \mathbb{Q})$, where $H_5$ is the Heisenberg group of level $5$. We prove that the moduli spaces of Horrocks-Mumford distributions are irreducible quasi-projective varieties and we determine their dimensions. Finally, we observe that the space of codimension one distributions, of degree $d\geq 6$, on $\mathbb{P}^4$ have a family of degenerated flat holomorphic Riemannian metrics. Moreover, the degeneracy divisors of such metrics consist of codimension one distributions invariant by $H_5 \rtimes SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_5)$ and singular along a degenerate abelian surface with $(1,5)$-polarization and level-$5$-structure.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of endomorphisms of algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\sigma$ denote an endomorphism of a smooth algebraic group $G$ over the algebraic closure of a finite field, and assume all iterates of $\sigma$ have finitely many fixed points. Steinberg gave a formula for the number of fixed points of $\sigma$ (and hence of all of its iterates $\sigma^n$) in the semisimple case, leading to a representation of its Artin-Mazur zeta function as a rational function. We generalise this to an arbitrary (smooth) algebraic group $G$, where the number of fixed points $\sigma_n$ of $\sigma^n$ can depend on $p$-adic properties of $n$. We axiomatise the structure of the sequence $(\sigma_n)$ via the concept of a `finite-adelically distorted' (FAD-)sequence. Such sequences also occur in topological dynamics, and our subsequent results about zeta functions and asymptotic counting of orbits apply equally well in that situation; for example, to $S$-integer dynamical systems, additive cellular automata and other compact abelian groups. We prove dichotomies for the associated Artin-Mazur zeta function, and study the analogue of the Prime Number Theorem for the function counting periodic orbits of length $\leq N$. For an algebraic group $G$ we express the error term via the $\ell$-adic cohomological zeta function of $G$.</description>

      <title>Homotopy types of diffeomorphisms groups of simplest Morse-Bott foliations on lens spaces, 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a Morse-Bott foliation on the solid torus $T=S^1\times D^2$ into $2$-tori parallel to the boundary and one singular central circle. Gluing two copies of $T$ by some diffeomorphism between their boundaries, one gets a lens space $L_{p,q}$ with a Morse-Bott foliation $\mathcal{F}_{p,q}$ obtained from $\mathcal{F}$ on each copy of $T$ and thus consisting of two singluar circles and parallel $2$-tori. In the previous paper [O. Khokliuk, S. Maksymenko, Journ. Homot. Rel. Struct., 2024, 18, 313-356] there were computed weak homotopy types of the groups $\mathcal{D}^{lp}(\mathcal{F}_{p,q})$ of leaf preserving (i.e. leaving invariant each leaf) diffeomorphisms of such foliations. In the present paper it is shown that the inclusion of these groups into the corresponding group $\mathcal{D}_{+}^{fol}(\mathcal{F}_{p,q})$ of foliated (i.e. sending leaves to leaves) diffeomorphisms which do not interchange singular circles are homotopy equivalences.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive Control Barrier Functions for Safety Critical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies safety guarantees for systems with time-varying control bounds. It has been shown that optimizing quadratic costs subject to state and control constraints can be reduced to a sequence of Quadratic Programs (QPs) using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). One of the main challenges in this method is that the CBF-based QP could easily become infeasible under tight control bounds, especially when the control bounds are time-varying. The recently proposed adaptive CBFs have addressed such infeasibility issues, but require extensive and non-trivial hyperparameter tuning for the CBF-based QP and may introduce overshooting control near the boundaries of safe sets. To address these issues, we propose a new type of adaptive CBFs called Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive CBFs (AVCBFs). Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary variable that multiplies each CBF itself, and define dynamics for the auxiliary variable to adapt it in constructing the corresponding CBF constraint. In this way, we can improve the feasibility of the CBF-based QP while avoiding extensive parameter tuning with non-overshooting control since the formulation is identical to classical CBF methods. We demonstrate the advantages of using AVCBFs and compare them with existing techniques on an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) problem with time-varying control bounds.</description>

      <title>Classification of non-free p.m.p. boolean actions of ergodic full groups and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Dye's reconstruction theorem, which classifies isomorphisms between full groups, to a classification of homomorphisms between full groups. For full groups of ergodic p.m.p. equivalence relations, our result roughly says that such homomorphisms come only from actions of the equivalence relation, or of one of its symmetric powers. This has several rigidity consequences for homomorphisms between full groups. Our main application is a characterization of property (T) for ergodic p.m.p. equivalence relations purely in full group terms, without using their topology: an ergodic p.m.p. equivalence relation has (T) iff all non-free ergodic boolean actions of its full group are strongly ergodic.</description>
