      <title>Chaotic Behavior of Trapped Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental results on the arrival direction of high-energy cosmic rays have motivated studies to understand their propagating environment. The observed anisotropy is shaped by interstellar and local magnetic fields. In coherent magnetic structures, such as the heliosphere, or due to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, magnetic mirroring can temporarily trap particles, leading to chaotic behavior. In this work, we develop a new method to characterize cosmic rays' chaotic behavior in magnetic systems using finite-time Lyapunov exponents. This quantity determines the degree of chaos and adapts to transitory behavior. We study particle trajectories in an axial-symmetric magnetic bottle to highlight mirroring effects. By introducing time-dependent magnetic perturbations, we study how temporal variations affect chaotic behavior. We tailor our model to the heliosphere; however, it can represent diverse magnetic configurations exhibiting mirroring phenomena. Our results have three key implications. (1)Theoretical: We find a correlation between the finite-time Lyapunov exponent and the particle escape time from the system, which follows a power law that persists even under additional perturbations. This power law may reveal intrinsic system characteristics, offering insight into propagation dynamics beyond simple diffusion. (2)Simulation: Chaotic effects play a role in cosmic ray simulations and can influence the resulting anisotropy maps. (3)Observational: Arrival maps display areas where the chaotic properties vary significantly; these changes can be the basis for time variability in the anisotropy maps. This work lays the framework for studying the effects of magnetic mirroring of cosmic rays within the heliosphere and the role of temporal variability in the observed anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Can the neutrinos from TXS 0506+056 have a coronal origin?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The blazar TXS 0506+056 has been the first astrophysical source associated with high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, and it has emerged as the second-most-prominent hotspot in the neutrino sky over ten years of observations. Although neutrino production in blazars has traditionally been attributed to processes in the powerful relativistic jet, the observation of a significant neutrino flux from NGC 1068 -- presumably coming from the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) corona -- suggests that neutrinos can also be produced in the cores of AGN. This raises the question whether neutrino production in TXS~0506+056 is also associated with the core region. We study this scenario, focusing on the hypothesis that this blazar is a masquerading BL Lac, a high-excitation quasar with hidden broad emission lines and a standard accretion disk. We show that magnetic reconnection is an acceleration process necessary to reach tens of PeV proton energies, and we use observationally motivated estimates of the X-ray luminosity of the coronal region to predict the emission of secondaries and compare them to the observed multi-wavelength and neutrino spectra of the source. We find that the coronal neutrino emission from TXS 0506+056 is too low to describe the IceCube observed neutrinos from this AGN, which in turn suggests that the blazar jet remains the preferred location for neutrino production.</description>

      <title>The radio re-brightening of the Type IIb SN 2001ig</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the late-time evolution of the compact Type IIb SN 2001ig in the spiral galaxy NGC 7424, with new and unpublished archival data from the Australia Telescope Compact Array and the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder. More than two decades after the SN explosion, its radio luminosity is showing a substantial re-brightening: it is now two orders of magnitude brighter than expected from the standard model of a shock expanding into a uniform circumstellar wind (i.e., with a density scaling as R^{-2}). This suggests that the SN ejecta have reached a denser shell, perhaps compressed by the fast wind of the Wolf-Rayet progenitor or expelled centuries before the final stellar collapse. We model the system parameters (circumstellar density profile, shock velocity, mass loss rate), finding that the denser layer was encountered when the shock reached a distance of ~0.1 pc; the mass-loss rate of the progenitor immediately before the explosion was Mdot/v_w ~ 10^{-7} Msun/yr/(km/s). We compare SN 2001ig with other SNe that have shown late-time re-brightenings, and highlight the opposite behaviour of some extended Type IIb SNe which show instead a late-time flux cut-off.</description>

      <title>Spectra of He isotopes and the $^3$He/$^4$He ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its launch, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer-02 (AMS-02) has delivered outstanding quality measurements of the spectra of cosmic-ray (CR) species, $e^{\pm}$, $\bar{p}$, and nuclei (H-Si, S, Fe), which have resulted in a number of breakthroughs. Besides elemental spectra, AMS-02 also measures the spectra of light isotopes albeit within a smaller rigidity range. In this paper, we use the precise measurements of He isotopes and the $^3$He/$^4$He ratio by AMS-02, together with Voyager 1 data, and investigate their origin. We show that there is an excess in $^3$He at higher energies compared to standard calculations assuming its fully secondary origin, which may indicate a source of primary $^3$He, or signify a change in the propagation parameters over the Galactic volume probed by the $^3$He/$^4$He ratio. We provide updated local interstellar spectra (LIS) of $^3$He and $^4$He in the rigidity range from 2-40 GV. Our calculations employ the self-consistent GalProp-HelMod framework that has proved to be a reliable tool in deriving the LIS of CR $e^{-}$, $\bar{p}$, and nuclei $Z\le28$.</description>

      <title>Exploring blazars through sonification. Visual and auditory insights into multifrequency variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using open astronomical multifrequency databases, we constructed light curves and developed a comprehensive visualisation and sonification analysis for the blazars Mrk~501, Mrk~1501, Mrk~421, BL~Lacerta, AO~0235+164, 3C~66A, OJ~049, OJ~287, and PKS~J2134-0153. This study employed Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and Parameter Mapping Sonification (PMSon) techniques to generate waveforms, spectrograms, and sonifications. These representations demonstrate that data visualisation and sonification are powerful tools for analysing astronomical objects like blazers, providing insights into their multifrequency variability. This work highlights how sonification and visualisation can aid in identifying potential patterns, power variations, regularities, and gaps in the data. This multimodal approach also underscores the importance of inclusivity in scientific communication, offering accessible methods for exploring the complex behaviour of blazers.</description>

      <title>Collisionless shocks having relativistic velocities in relativistically hot plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shocks in relativistically hot plasmas are thought to exist in various high-energy astrophysical phenomena, but it is not clear how relativistic collisionless shocks are formed, whether particles are accelerated by the shock as in the case of cold upstream. In this work, collisionless shocks with a relativistic shock velocity in relativistically hot unmagnetized electron-positron plasmas are investigated by two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. It is shown that the upstream flow is dissipated by the Weibel instability, so that the relativistic collisionless shock is formed as in the case of cold upstream. The density and magnetic field structures around the shock front are almost independent of the upstream temperature when the spatial scale is normalized by the inertial length scale which takes into account the relativistic temperature. This can be understood by considering the pressure anisotropy, which asymptotically approaches a finite value due to the relativistic beaming effect, even as the temperature becomes relativistically hotter and hotter. In addition, as long as the shock velocity is relativistic, some particles are accelerated, forming a power-law energy spectrum similar to that in the cold upstream.</description>

      <title>A search for extremely-high-energy neutrinos and first constraints on the ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray proton fraction with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a search for the diffuse extremely-high-energy neutrino flux using $12.6$ years of IceCube data. The non-observation of neutrinos with energies well above $10 \, \mathrm{PeV}$ constrains the all-flavor neutrino flux at $10^{18} \, \mathrm{eV}$ to a level of $E^2 \Phi_{\nu_e + \nu_\mu + \nu_\tau} \simeq 10^{-8} \, \mathrm{GeV} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{sr}^{-1}$, the most stringent limit to date. Using this data, we constrain the proton fraction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) above $\simeq 30 \, \mathrm{EeV}$ to be $\lesssim 70\,$% (at $90\,$% CL) if the cosmological evolution of the sources is comparable to or stronger than the star formation rate. This result complements direct air-shower measurements by being insensitive to uncertainties associated with hadronic interaction models. It is the first such result to disfavor the ``proton-only" hypothesis for UHECRs using neutrino data.</description>

      <title>Thirty-five years of timing of M53A with Arecibo and FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR B1310+18A is a 33-ms binary pulsar in a 256-day, low eccentricity orbit with a low-mass companion located in NGC 5024 (M53). In this Letter, we present the first phase-coherent timing solution for this pulsar (designated as M53A) derived from a 35-year timing baseline; this combines the archival Arecibo Observatory data with the recent observations from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). We find that the spin period derivative of the pulsar is between 6.1 and $7.5 \times 10^{-19} \rm \, s\, s^{-1}$, which implies a characteristic age between 0.70 and 0.85 Gyr. The timing solution also includes a precise position and proper motion for the pulsar, enabling the identification of the companion of M53A in Hubble Space Telescope data as a Helium white dwarf (He WD) with a mass of $M_{\rm WD}=0.39^{+0.05}_{-0.07} \, \rm M_{\odot}$ and a cooling age of $0.14^{+0.04}_{-0.03}\, \rm Gyr$, confirming that the system formed recently in the history of the GC. The system resembles, in its spin and orbital characteristics, similarly wide pulsar - He WD systems in the Galactic disk. We conclude by discussing the origin of slow pulsars in globular clusters, showing that none of the slow pulsars in low-density globular clusters are as young as the systems observed in the densest known globular clusters.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent scenario for jet and stellar explosion in collapsar: General relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulation with dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulation with a dynamo term is performed for modeling the collapsar in full general relativity. As an initial condition, a spinning black hole and infalling stellar matter are modeled based on a stellar evolution result, superimposing a weak toroidal magnetic field. After the growth of a massive torus around the black hole, the magnetic field is amplified in it, developing poloidal fields via dynamo. In an early stage of the torus growth, magnetic fluxes that fall to the vicinity of the central black hole are swallowed by the black hole and global poloidal magnetic fields that can be the source of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism are not developed. However, in a later stage in which the ram pressure of the infalling matter becomes weak, the magnetic field amplified by the black hole spin via the winding becomes large enough to expel the infalling matter by the magnetic pressure, and subsequently, a global poloidal magnetic field that penetrates the black hole is established, launching a jet along the spin axis by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism with the luminosity suitable for explaining typical long gamma-ray bursts. Together with the jet launch, the effectively viscous effect in the inner region of the torus and the magnetocentrifugal effect drive the stellar explosion with the explosion energy comparable to typical or powerful supernovae. We also find large amounts of synthesized $^{56}$Ni and Zn associated with the stellar explosion. In the presence of jet launching, $r$-process elements are weakly synthesized. The numerical results of the explosion energy, ejecta mass, and $^{56}$Ni mass are in a good agreement with those for observed broad-lined type Ic supernovae. Our result illustrates a self-consistent scenario for the gamma-ray-burst-associated broad-lined type Ic supernovae.</description>

      <title>First spectro-polarimetric study of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GX 9+1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02078v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first spectro-polarimetric study of the bright atoll source GX 9+1, using the simultaneous Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), and Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations. The source was observed to remain in the soft state, with no changes in state throughout the observation period. The source does not show significant polarization in the 2-8 keV energy range. However, a significant polarization (3.3 sigma) was detected in the 2-3 keV range, with a polarization degree of 3.3 +/- 0.8% and a polarization angle of 11 +/- 7 deg. We used the simultaneous energy spectra from NICER (0.6 - 11 keV) and IXPE (2-8 keV) to study the spectral properties of the source during observations. The observed spectrum of the source can be well described by a combination of Comptonized blackbody emission from the neutron star surface (compbb model in XSPEC) and thermal Comptonized component with seed photons from the accretion disc. The spectral properties of GX 9+1 during the observation are consistent with those of other bright atoll-sources in the soft state. However, the high polarization degree observed in the low-energy band does not align with previous IXPE observations of other atoll-sources. This observed polarization in the source is attributed to the strong polarization of the Comptonized blackbody component. We discuss the results from the spectro-polarimetric studies in the context of various accretion disc and coronal geometries of the source.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an RRAT-like pulsar via its single pulses in an MWA imaging survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of PSR J0031$-$5726 in the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA eXtended imaging survey at a Galactic latitude of $b \approx -60^\circ$. The pulsar exhibits both sporadic, extremely bright pulses reminiscent of rotating radio transients (RRATs) as well as a persistent, dimmer pulses. The bright pulses tend to arrive at later rotation phases than their dimmer counterparts, and have dramatically varying polarization angle curves, such that the integrated profile appears almost completely depolarized down to the system noise level. The rotation measure of individual pulses was found to sometimes vary by up to ${\sim}0.8\,$rad/m$^2$, but was otherwise generally consistent with its average (ionosphere-corrected) value of $10.0 \pm 0.1\,$rad/m$^2$. We surmise that J0031$-$5726 may represent a class of pulsar that is intermediate between normal pulsars and RRATs.</description>

      <title>Consistent crust-core interpolation and its effect on non-radial neutron star oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To model the structure of neutron stars (NSs) theoretically,it is common to consider layers with different density regimes. Matching the equation of state (EoS) for the crust and core and obtaining a suitable description of these extreme conditions are crucial for understanding the properties of these compact objects. In this work, we construct ten different NS EoSs incorporating three distinct crust models, which are connected to the core using a thermodynamically and causally consistent formalism. For cold NSs, we propose a linear relationship between pressure and energy density in a narrow region between the crust and core, effectively establishing an interpolation function in the pressure-baryonic chemical potential plane. We then compare this EoS matching method with the classical approach, which neglects causal and thermodynamic consistency. We solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation to obtain the mass-radius relationship and compare our results with observational constraints on NSs. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of the new matching formalism on non-radial oscillation frequencies and damping times. Our findings suggest that the method used to glue the crust and core EoS impacts NS observables, such as the radius, oscillation frequencies, and damping times of non-radial modes, which may be crucial for interpreting future gravitational wave observations from neutron star mergers or isolated pulsars. The effects are particularly noticeable for low-mass NSs, regardless of the specific EoS model chosen. In particular, we find that the $p_1$ oscillation mode exhibits significant differences in frequencies among alternative matching methods, whereas the fundamental $f$-mode remains unaffected by changes in crust models or interpolation schemes.</description>

      <title>Search for a diffuse flux of photons with energies above tens of PeV at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse photons of energy above 0.1 PeV, produced through the interactions between cosmic rays and either interstellar matter or background radiation fields, are powerful tracers of the distribution of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. Furthermore, the measurement of a diffuse photon flux would be an important probe to test models of super-heavy dark matter decaying into gamma-rays. In this work, we search for a diffuse photon flux in the energy range between 50 PeV and 200 PeV using data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. For the first time, we combine the air-shower measurements from a 2 km$^2$ surface array consisting of 19 water-Cherenkov surface detectors, spaced at 433 m, with the muon measurements from an array of buried scintillators placed in the same area. Using 15 months of data, collected while the array was still under construction, we derive upper limits to the integral photon flux ranging from 13.3 to 13.8 km$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ above tens of PeV. We extend the Pierre Auger Observatory photon search program towards lower energies, covering more than three decades of cosmic-ray energy. This work lays the foundation for future diffuse photon searches: with the data from the next 10 years of operation of the Observatory, this limit is expected to improve by a factor of $\sim$20.</description>

      <title>Mixing neutron star material into the jets in the common envelope jets supernova r-process scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I find that the accretion disk around the neutron star (NS) that enters the core of a massive evolved star in the frame of the common-envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) r-process scenario can penetrate the crust of the NS, mix neutron-rich crust material into the disk, and enrich the jets that the disk launches with the neutron-rich material. As the NS accretes at high rates from the core inside which it revolves, it forms an accretion disk with high density. In the CEJSN r-process scenario, the very high density in the accretion disk results in low electron fraction gas, enabling the r-process. Jets carry the r-process elements out. The new claim in this study is that the high-density accretion disk destroys part of the NS crust and entrains this mass. The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability mixes material from the deeper crust. The total neutron-rich mass that the disk mixes and the jets carry can be up to ~0.01Mo. Enriching the accretion disk with neutron-rich material ensures a low electron fraction as required by the r-process nucleosynthesis and the ejection of massive r-process ejecta, ~0.01-0.03Mo. I strengthen the CEJSN r-process scenario but do not claim it is the main r-process site. I only claim that two or more r-process sites contribute to r-process nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Constraints on minimally and conformally coupled ultralight dark matter with the EPTA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are extremely stable natural timekeepers. Pulsar Timing Array experiments, tracking subtle changes in the pulsars' rotation periods, can shed light on the presence of ultralight particles in our Galaxy. In this conference paper, we start by reviewing the most conservative scenario, in which ultralight particles interact only gravitationally. In this setting, we show that Pulsar Timing Arrays are able to constrain the presence of ultralight fields up to a few tenths of the observed dark matter abundance. Then, we consider conformally coupled ultralight candidates, demonstrating that the constraints on the universal scalar coupling of the field to Standard Model particles improve on existing bounds by several orders of magnitude, in the relevant mass range analyzed by Pulsar Timing Arrays. The discussion presented here is based on [1,2].</description>

      <title>Modulation of X-ray flux by obscuration of neutron star boundary layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the X-ray variability of both black hole (BH) and neutron star (NS) systems provide a tool for probing strong gravity and dense matter equations of state. Nevertheless, the mechanism of QPO modulation in NS systems, where the amplitudes of QPOs with frequencies approaching kHz range are very high in comparison to BH high-frequency QPOs, remains an unsolved puzzle. Relativistic ray tracing of photons emitted from the immediate vicinity of compact objects has, to date, been used to investigate various mechanisms that explain the observed weak BH QPOs. However, it has not been applied to model the NS QPO signal, which requires incorporating the NS surface and a bright boundary layer (BL) on it. Here, we explore the QPO modulation mechanisms based on the BL obscuration. Using simplified models of axisymmetric oscillations of thick accretion discs (tori), we demonstrate that the disc oscillations drive the high NS QPO amplitudes through BL obscuration, which is relevant especially for vertical oscillations. We also demonstrate that obscuration effects enable the observability of the Keplerian frequency in the case of discs that decay due to instabilities.</description>

      <title>Carpet-3 detection of a photon-like air shower with estimated primary energy above 100 TeV in a spatial and temporal coincidence with GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brightest cosmic gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever detected, GRB 221009A, was accompanied by photons of very high energies. These gamma rays may be used to test both the astrophysical models of the burst and our understanding of long-distance propagation of energetic photons, including potential new-physics effects. Here we present the observation of a photon-like air shower with the estimated primary energy of $300^{+43}_{-38}$ TeV, coincident (with the chance probability of $\sim 9\cdot 10^{-3}$) with the GRB in its arrival direction and time. Making use of the upgraded Carpet-3 muon detector and new machine learning analysis, we estimate the probability that the primary was hadronic as $\sim 3 \cdot 10^{-4}$. This is the highest-energy event ever associated with any GRB.</description>

      <title>Pearls on a string: Dark and bright galaxies on a strikingly straight and narrow filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a chain of galaxies along an almost straight line in the nearby Universe with a projected length of ~5 Mpc. The galaxies are distributed within projected distances of only 7-105 kpc from the axis of the identified filament. They have redshifts in a very small range of z=0.0361-0.0370 so that their radial velocities are consistent with galaxy proper motions. The filament galaxies are mainly star-forming and have stellar masses in a range of $\rm 10^{9.1}-10^{10.7}\,M_{\odot}$. We search for systems with similar geometrical properties in the full-sky mock galaxy catalogue of the MillenniumTNG simulations and find that although such straight filaments are unusual and rare, they are predicted by $\Lambda$CDM simulations (4% incidence). We study the cold HI gas in a 1.3 Mpc section of the filament through HI-21cm emission line observations and detect eleven HI sources, many more than expected from the HI mass function in a similar volume. They have HI masses $\rm 10^{8.5}-10^{9.5}\,M_{\odot}$ and are mostly within ~120 kpc projected distance from the filament axis. None of these HI sources has a confirmed optical counterpart. Their darkness together with their large HI-21cm line-widths indicate that they contain gas that might not yet be virialized. These clouds must be marking the peaks of the dark matter and HI distributions over large scales within the filament. The presence of such gas clouds around the filament spines is predicted by simulations, but this is the first time that the existence of such clouds in a filament is observationally confirmed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the accretion phase of a core-collapse supernova (SN), dark-photon (DP) cooling can be largest in the gain layer below the stalled shock wave. In this way, it could counter-act the usual shock rejuvenation by neutrino energy deposition and thus prevent the explosion. This peculiar energy-loss profile derives from the resonant nature of DP production. The largest cooling and thus strongest constraints obtain for DP masses of 0.1-0.4 MeV, a range corresponding to the photon plasma mass in the gain region. Electron-capture SNe, once observationally unambiguously identified, could provide strong bounds even down to nearly 0.01 MeV. For a coupling strength so small that neutrino-driven explosions are expected to survive, the DP cooling of the core is too small to modify the neutrino signal, i.e., our new argument supersedes the traditional SN1987A cooling bound.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Feedback in Massive Halos: Implications for the Distribution of Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use order of magnitude estimates and observational constraints to argue that feedback from relativistic cosmic rays (CRs) produced by massive black holes is likely to have a particularly large effect at radii of order the virial radius and larger in group-mass halos. We show that for a range of plausible (but uncertain) CR transport parameters and energetics, the pressure produced by CRs generated by the central massive black hole over its lifetime can be of order the thermal gas pressure in the outskirts of $\sim 10^{13-14} M_\odot$ halos (but not in more massive clusters). The properties of this CR feedback at low redshift are not well predicted by the radiative cooling rate of hot gas at smaller radii, which is often used as a proxy for `current' black hole feedback. This is because most black hole growth happens early in massive halos, and CR transport timescales in halo outskirts are Gyr or more; the accumulated CR energy thus depends on the full history of black hole activity in the halo. The large CR pressure in group-mass systems likely leads to CR-driven outflows that move gas from large halo radii to outside the virial radius. Such feedback would not be captured by current cosmological simulations that focus on mechanical black hole feedback; in particular, CR feedback remains active even long after the mechanical feedback sourcing the CRs has turned off. We speculate that this CR feedback may be important for explaining the weak lensing $S_8$ tension and the evidence for strong feedback at large halo radii from kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich measurements. Prospects for testing this mechanism observationally and implementing the necessary physics in cosmological simulations are discussed.</description>

Abstract: The burgeoning field of multi-messenger astronomy is poised to revolutionize our understanding of the most enigmatic astrophysical phenomena in the Universe. At the same time, it has opened a new window of opportunity to probe various particle physics phenomena. This is illustrated here with a few example new physics scenarios, namely, decaying heavy dark matter, pseudo-Dirac neutrinos and light dark sector physics, for which new constraints are derived using recent multi-messenger observations.</description>

      <title>A Compact theorem on the compactness of ultra-compact objects with monotonically decreasing matter fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-gravitating horizonless ultra-compact objects that possess light rings have attracted the attention of physicists and mathematicians in recent years. In the present compact paper we raise the following physically interesting question: Is there a lower bound on the global compactness parameters ${\cal C}\equiv\text{max}_r\{2m(r)/r\}$ of spherically symmetric ultra-compact objects? Using the non-linearly coupled Einstein-matter field equations we explicitly prove that spatially regular ultra-compact objects with monotonically decreasing density functions (or monotonically decreasing radial pressure functions) are characterized by the lower bound ${\cal C}\geq1/3$ on their dimensionless compactness parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For neutron stars, there exist universal relations insensitive to the equation of states, the so called I-Love-Q relations, which show the connections among the moment of inertia, tidal Love number and quadrupole moment. In this paper, we show that these relations also apply to dark stars, bosonic or fermionic. The relations can be extended to higher ranges of the variables, clarifying the deviations for dark stars in the literature, as those curves all approximate the ones generated by a polytropic equation of state, when taking the low density (pressure) limit. Besides, we find that for equation of states with scaling symmetries, the I-Love-Q curves do not change when adjusting the scaling parameters.</description>

      <title>Hybrid stars in light of the HESS J1731-347 remnant and the PREX-II experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent analysis on the central compact object in the HESS J1731-347 remnant suggests interestingly small values for its mass and radius. Such an observation favors soft nuclear models that may be challenged by the observation of massive compact stars. In contrast, the recent PREX-II experiment, concerning the neutron skin thickness of $^{208}$Pb, points towards stiff equations of state that favor larger compact star radii. In the present study, we aim to explore the compatibility between stiff hadronic equations of state (favored by PREX-II) and the HESS J1731-347 remnant in the context of hybrid stars. For the construction of hybrid equations of state we use three widely employed Skyrme models combined with the well-known vector MIT bag model. Furthermore we consider two different scenarios concerning the energy density of the bag. In the first case, that of a constant bag parameter, we find that the resulting hybrid equations of state are strongly disfavored by the observation of $\sim2 M_\odot$ pulsars. However, the introduction of a Gaussian density dependence yields results that are compatible with the conservative $2 M_\odot$ constraint. The utilization of recent data based on the observation of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0952-0607 and GW190814 allows for the imposition of additional constraints on the relevant parameters and the stiffness of the two phases. Interestingly, we find that the derived hybrid equations of state do not satisfy the PSR J0030+0451 constraints in $1\sigma$ and only marginally agree with the $2\sigma$ estimations. In addition, we estimate that the observation of massive pulsars, like PSR J0952-0607, in combination with the existence of HESS J1731-347, may require a strong phase transition below $\sim 1.7n_0$. Finally, we show that the supermassive compact object involved in GW190814 could potentially be explained as a rapidly rotating hybrid star.</description>

      <title>Fast radio bursts as precursor radio emission from monster shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been proposed recently that the breaking of MHD waves in the inner magnetosphere of strongly magnetized neutron stars can power different types of high-energy transients. Motivated by these considerations, we study the steepening and dissipation of a strongly magnetized fast magnetosonic wave propagating in a declining background magnetic field, by means of particle-in-cell simulations that encompass MHD scales. Our analysis confirms the formation of a monster shock as $B^2-E^2 \to 0$, that dissipates about half of the fast magnetosonic wave energy. It also reveals, for the first time, the generation of a high-frequency precursor wave by a synchrotron maser instability at the monster shock front, carrying a fraction of $\sim 10^{-3}$ of the total energy dissipated at the shock. The spectrum of the precursor wave exhibits several sharp harmonic peaks, with frequencies in the GHz band under conditions anticipated in magnetars. Such signals may appear as fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound bounds and first-order phase transitions in compact stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present study, we employ three distinct, physically motivated speed of sound bounds to construct hybrid models, where the high-density phase is described by the maximally stiff equation of state. In particular, we consider the bounds related to special relativity, relativistic kinetic theory and conformality. The low-density hadronic phase is described by a state-of-the-art microscopic relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory. This work aims to access the effect of the different speed of sound constraints on the relevant parameter space of the key parameters of first-order phase transitions by utilizing recent astronomical data. This involves a systematic analysis that also includes two distinct schemes for the construction of hybrid models (abrupt and smooth). Finally, a relevant discussion is conducted on the possible occurrence of a thermodynamic inconsistency that is related to the stability of the high-density phase over hadronic matter at large densities.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Constraining the Neutron Star Equation of State and Mass Distribution through Multimessenger Observations and Nuclear Benchmarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With ongoing advancements in nuclear theory and experimentation, together with a growing body of neutron star (NS) observations, a wealth of information on the equation of state (EOS) for matter at extreme densities has become accessible. Here, we utilize a hybrid EOS formulation that combines an empirical parameterization centered around the nuclear saturation density with a generic three-segment piecewise polytrope model at higher densities. We incorporate data derived from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), and from experiments such as PREX-II and CREX. Furthermore, we examine the influence of a total of 129 NS mass measurements up to April 2023, as well as simultaneous mass and radius measurements derived from the X-ray emission from surface hot spots on NSs. Additionally, we consider constraints on tidal properties inferred from the gravitational waves emitted by coalescing NS binaries. To integrate this extensive and varied array of constraints, we utilize a hierarchical Bayesian statistical framework to simultaneously deduce the EOS and the distribution of NS masses. We find that incorporating data from $\chi$EFT significantly tightens the constraints on the EOS of NSs near or below the nuclear saturation density. However, constraints derived from pQCD computations and nuclear experiments such as PREX-II and CREX have minimal impact.</description>

      <title>Strange stars admixed with mirror dark matter: confronting observations of XTE J1814-338</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15969v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a novel framework for explaining the mass and radius relationships of observed neutron stars by considering strange stars (SSs) admixed with mirror dark matter (MDM). We develop a theoretical model that incorporates non-commutative algebra to describe the interactions between ordinary strange quark matter (SQM) and MDM, which are predicted to form compact objects that could explain recent astrophysical data, including observations of PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0437-4715, and the central compact object in HESS J1731-347. Notably, we demonstrate that the exotic mass-radius measurement of XTE J1814-338 can be explained by the presence of a mirror SS with an ordinary SQM core. In contrast to other explanations based on boson stars, our SS+MDM model offers a natural explanation for this system. We provide detailed mass-radius comparisons with observational data and discuss future observations that could test the predictions of our model, offering new insights into neutron star structure and the role of dark matter in compact objects.</description>

Abstract: The study of massive binary systems has steadily progressed over the past decades, with increasing focus on their evolution, interactions and mergers, driven by improvements in computational modelling and observational techniques. In particular, when a binary system involves a massive giant and a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH) that go through common envelope evolution (CEE), it might result in the merger of the compact object with the core of its giant companion, giving rise to various high energy astrophysical phenomena. We review the different evolutionary channels that lead to compact object-core mergers, key physical processes with emphasis on the role of accretion physics, feasibility of r-process nucleosynthesis, expected observable electromagnetic, neutrino and gravitational-wave (GW) signatures, as well as potential correlation with detected core collapse supernovae (CCSNe), luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) and low luminosity long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). After presenting our current understanding of these mergers, we conclude discussing prospects for future advancements.</description>

      <title>Synthetic pulsar lightcurves from global kinetic simulations and comparison with the Fermi-LAT catalog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotation-powered pulsars represent the main class of identified gamma-ray sources in the Galaxy. The wealth of observational data collected by the AGILE and Fermi gamma-ray space telescopes in the GeV range, and by ground-based Cherenkov telescopes in the TeV band provide invaluable insights into how relativistic plasmas dissipate and accelerate particles. Decoding the information contained in the gamma-ray pulses profile is an important step to understand how pulsars work. In this study, we aim at putting an ab initio plasma model of pulsar magnetospheres to the test, in light of the most recent gamma-ray observations in the GeV and TeV bands. To this end, we present of a new series of global particle-in-cell simulations of an inclined pulsar magnetosphere. High-quality synthetic pulse profiles in the synchrotron and inverse Compton channels are reconstructed to study in greater details their morphology and their energy dependence. We also perform a fit of observed lightcurves with the model, using the third Fermi-LAT gamma-ray pulsar catalog. Reconnection in the wind current sheet powers synchrotron and inverse Compton emission. The modeled pulse profiles reproduce some of the salient features of observed gamma-ray pulsars, including the mysterious Vela-like lightcurves, such as: the generic double-peaked structure, the presence of a bridge or third peak in between the main pulses, the pulse narrowing with increasing energy. The bolometric synchrotron radiative efficiency is strictly limited by the reconnection rate. Our global kinetic simulations are able to match observed pulse profiles. Such direct comparisons will help drive and focus future simulation developments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyzes the multi-wavelength flaring activity of the distant flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) OP 313 (z=0.997) during November 2023 to March 2024, using data from Fermi-Large Area Telescope, Swift X-ray Telescope, and Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope. The analysis highlights two significant very high energy(VHE) detection epochs and GeV gamma-ray flaring episodes, providing insight into jet emission processes and radiative mechanisms. Key findings include broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) evolution, including enigmatic X-ray spectral changes. Modeling of the multi-wavelength SED with a one-zone leptonic radiative processes attributes the emissions to synchrotron radiation, Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC), and External Compton (EC) mechanisms, with torus photons as the primary source for EC processes. The results suggest that the gamma-ray emitting region lies outside the broad-line region but within the dusty torus. Furthermore, we find that the radiated power is significantly smaller than the total jet power, suggesting that most of the bulk energy remains within the jet even after passing through the blazar emission zone. These findings advance our understanding of particle acceleration, jet dynamics, and photon field interactions in FSRQs.</description>

Abstract: Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) dominate the galactic gamma-ray sky at very high energies, and are major contributors to the leptonic cosmic ray flux. However, whether or not pulsars also accelerate ions to comparable energies is not yet experimentally confirmed. We aim to constrain the birth period and pair-production multiplicity for a set of pulsars. In doing so, we aim to constrain the proportion of ions in the pulsar magnetosphere and hence the proportion of ions that could enter the pulsar wind. We estimate possible ranges of the value of the average pair production multiplicity for a sample of 26 pulsars in the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) catalogue, which have also been observed by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) telescopes. We then derive lower limits for the pulsar birth periods and average pair production multiplicities for a subset of these sources where the extent of the pulsar wind nebula and surrounding supernova shell have been measured in the radio. We also derive curves for the average pair production multiplicities as a function of birth period for sources recently observed by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). We show that there is a potential for hadrons entering the pulsar wind for most of the H.E.S.S. and LHAASO sources we consider, dependent upon the efficiency of luminosity conversion into particles. We also present estimates of the pulsar birth period for six of these sources, which all fall into the range of $\simeq$10-50 ms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Bayesian Inference with Renormalization for Gravitational Waves</title>

Abstract: Advancements in gravitational-wave interferometers, particularly the next generation, are poised to profoundly impact gravitational wave astronomy and multimessenger astrophysics. A hybrid quantum algorithm is proposed to carry out quantum inference of parameters from compact binary coalescences detected in gravitational-wave interferometers. It performs quantum Bayesian Inference with Renormalization and Downsampling (qBIRD). We choose binary black hole (BBH) mergers from LIGO observatories as the first case to test the algorithm, but its application can be extended to more general instances. The quantum algorithm is able to generate corner plots of relevant parameters such as chirp mass, mass ratio, spins, etc. by inference of simulated gravitational waves with known injected parameter values with zero noise, Gaussian noise and real data, thus recovering an accuracy equivalent to that of classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo inferences. The simulations are performed with sets of 2 and 4 parameters. These results enhance the possibilities to extend our capacity to track signals from coalescences over longer durations and at lower frequencies extending the accuracy and promptness of gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Transition from adiabatic inspiral to plunge for eccentric binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole binaries with small mass ratios will be critical targets for the forthcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. They also serve as useful tools for understanding the properties of binaries at general mass ratios. In its early stages, such a binary's gravitational-wave-driven inspiral can be modeled as the smaller body flowing through a sequence of geodesic orbits of the larger black hole's spacetime. Its motion through this sequence is determined by the rate at which backreaction changes an orbit's integrals of motion $E$, $L_z$, and $Q$. Key to the motion being close to a geodesic at any moment is the idea that the effect of backreaction is small compared to a ``restoring force'' arising from the potential which governs geodesic motion. This restoring force holds the small body on a geodesic trajectory as the backreaction causes that geodesic to slowly evolve. As the inspiraling body approaches the last stable orbit (LSO), the restoring force becomes weaker and the backreaction becomes stronger. Once the small body evolves past the LSO, its trajectory converges to a plunging geodesic. This work aims to smoothly connect these two disparate regimes: the slowly evolving adiabatic inspiral and the final plunge. Past work has focused on this transition to plunge for circular systems. Here, we study the transition for binaries with eccentricity. A well-defined eccentric transition will make it possible to develop small-mass-ratio binary waveform models that terminate in a physically reasonable way, rather than abruptly terminating as an inspiral-only model ends. A model that can explore the parameter space of eccentricity may also be useful for understanding the final cycles of eccentric binaries at less extreme mass ratios, such as those likely to be observed by ground-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Approximate helical symmetry in compact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inspiral of a circular, non-precessing binary exhibits an approximate helical symmetry. The effects of eccentricity, precession, and radiation reaction break the exact symmetry. We estimate the failure of this symmetry using the flux of the BMS charge corresponding to helical symmetry carried away by gravitational waves. We analytically compute the helical flux for binaries moving on eccentric orbits and quasi-circular orbits without precession using post-Newtonian theory. The helical flux is non-vanishing at the 0PN order for eccentric orbits as expected. We analytically predict the helical flux to be at a relative 5PN order for quasi-circular non-precessing binaries. This prediction is compared with 113 quasi-circular non-precessing numerical relativity waveforms from the SXS catalog. We find good agreement between analytical and numerical results for quasi-circular non-precessing binaries establishing that helical symmetry starts to break at 5PN for these binaries.</description>

      <title>A geometric template bank for the detection of spinning low-mass compact binaries with moderate orbital eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06433</link>

Abstract: Compact binaries on eccentric orbits are another class of gravitational-wave (GW) sources that can provide a wealth of information on binary formation pathways and astrophysical environments. However, historically, eccentricity is often neglected in modelled GW searches for compact binaries. We show that currently used modelled searches that employ quasi-circular template banks are highly ineffectual in detecting binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star--black hole (NSBH) systems with orbital eccentricities in the range of $[10^{-5},0.15]$ at a GW frequency of $15$Hz. For populations of moderately eccentric BNS and NSBH binaries with (anti-)aligned component spins, we demonstrate that quasi-circular template banks fail to detect up to $\sim 40\%$ of such systems. To alleviate these inefficiencies, we develop the first \emph{geometric} template bank for the search of BNSs and NSBH binaries that includes masses, (anti-)aligned spins and moderate eccentricity. Utilising the post-Newtonian inspiral waveform {\tt TaylorF2Ecc} and a global coordinate transformation, we construct a globally flat metric to efficiently place eccentric templates. Our geometric template bank is highly effectual, and significantly improves the recovery of eccentric signals with less than $6\%$ of signals missed due to the finite template spacing in the bank.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of hybrid neutron star EoS constraints within a nonlocal color superconducting quark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00115</link>

Abstract: We present a physics-informed Bayesian analysis of equation of state constraints using observational data for masses, radii and tidal deformability of pulsars and a generic class of hybrid neutron star equation of state with color superconducting quark matter on the basis of a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model. The nuclear matter phase is described within a relativistic density functional model of the DD2 class and the phase transition is obtained by a Maxwell construction. We find the region in the two-dimensional parameter space spanned by the vector meson coupling and the scalar diquark coupling, where three conditions are fulfilled: 1) the Maxwell construction can be performed, 2) the maximum mass of the hybrid neutron star is not smaller than 2.0 M$_\odot$ and 3) the onset density of the phase transition is not below the nuclear saturation density $n_0=0.15$ fm$^{-3}$. The result of this study shows that the favorable neutron star equation of state has low onset masses for the occurrence of a color superconducting quark matter core between $0.5-0.7~M_\odot$ and maximum masses in the range $2.15 - 2.22~M_\odot$. In the typical mass range of $1.2 - 2.0~M_\odot$, the radii of these stars are between 11.9 and 12.4 km, almost independent of the mass. In principle, hybrid stars would allow for larger maximum masses than provided by the hadronic reference equation of state.</description>

      <title>BASS XLVII: 22 GHz Radio Atlas of Swift-BAT Selected AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the third phase of the largest high-frequency, high-resolution imaging survey of 231 nearby, hard X-ray selected AGN, with a very high $98 \pm 1\%$ detection fraction. This survey presents VLA 22 GHz radio observations with 1" spatial resolution covering over $6$ orders of magnitude in radio luminosity in nearby AGN that span $\sim4$ orders of magnitude in black hole mass and X-ray luminosity. We identify three different radio morphologies: $44 \pm 3\%$ (102/231) are compact or unresolved, $46 \pm 3\%$ (106/231) show an extended structure (star formation, possible one-sided jets, etc.), and $8 \pm 2\%$ (19/231) have a biconical or two-sided jet-like morphology. The remaining $2 \pm 1\%$ (4/231) sources are non-detections. The radio-to-X-ray luminosity ratios of the Swift-BAT AGN ($\text{L}_R/\text{L}_{14-195 \text{keV}} \sim 10^{-5.5}$ and $\text{L}_R/\text{L}_{2-10 \text{keV}} \sim 10^{-5}$) with a scatter of $\sim0.5$ dex are similar to that of coronally active stars ($\text{L}_R/\text{L}_X \sim 10^{-5}$). For most targets, extended emission in radio-quiet objects is broadly consistent with the expectation for star formation from previous FIR observations, once the contribution from the radio core has been subtracted. Our sample represents nearby analogs of distant AGN at the peak of black hole growth, and thus the high detection fraction in our work has important implications for future high frequency AGN radio surveys with the next generation VLA (ngVLA) or Square Kilometre Array (SKA), both of which should detect large fractions of more distant AGN.</description>
