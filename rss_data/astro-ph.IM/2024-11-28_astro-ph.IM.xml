      <title>Comparison of Fast, Hybrid Imaging Architectures for Multi-scale, Hierarchical Aperture Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two major areas of modern radio astronomy, namely, explosive astrophysical transient phenomena and observations of cosmological structures, are driving the design of aperture arrays towards large numbers of low-cost elements consisting of multiple spatial scales spanning the dimensions of individual elements, the size of stations (groupings of individual elements), and the spacing between stations. Such multi-scale, hierarchical aperture arrays require a combination of data processing architectures -- pre-correlation beamformer, generic version of FFT-based direct imager, post-correlation beamformer, and post-correlation FFT imager -- operating on different ranges of spatial scales to obtain optimal performance in imaging the entire field of view. Adopting a computational cost metric based on the number of floating point operations, its distribution over the dimensions of discovery space, namely, field of view, angular resolution, polarisation, frequency, and time is examined to determine the most efficient hybrid architectures over the parameter space of hierarchical aperture array layouts. Nominal parameters of specific upcoming and planned arrays -- the SKA at low frequencies (SKA-low), SKA-low-core, a proposed long baseline extension to SKA-low (LAMBDA-I), compact all-sky phased array (CASPA), and a lunar array (FarView-core) -- are used to determine the most optimal architecture hierarchy for each from a computational standpoint, and provide a guide for designing hybrid architectures for multi-scale aperture arrays. For large, dense-packed layouts, a FFT-based direct imager is most efficient for most cadence intervals, and for other layouts that have relatively lesser number of elements or greater sparsity in distribution, the best architecture is more sensitive to the cadence interval, which in turn is determined by the science goals.</description>

      <title>The Roman coronagraph community participation program: observation planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Coronagraphic Instrument onboard the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is an important stepping stone towards the characterization of habitable, rocky exoplanets. In a technology demonstration phase conducted during the first 18 months of the mission (expected to launch in late 2026), novel starlight suppression technology may enable direct imaging of a Jupiter analog in reflected light. Here we summarize the current activities of the Observation Planning working group formed as part of the Community Participation Program. This working group is responsible for target selection and observation planning of both science and calibration targets in the technology demonstration phase of the Roman Coronagraph. We will discuss the ongoing efforts to expand target and reference catalogs, and to model astrophysical targets (exoplanets and circumstellar disks) within the Coronagraph's expected sensitivity. We will also present preparatory observations of high priority targets.</description>

      <title>Development of an MKID frequency-to-pixel LED mapper for SPT-3G+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SPT-3G+ is the next-generation camera for the South Pole Telescope (SPT). SPT is designed to measure the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the mm/sub-mm sky. The planned focal plane consists of 34,000 microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs), divided among three observing bands centered at 220, 285, and 345 GHz. Each readout line is designed to measure 800 MKIDs over a 500 MHz bandwidth, which places stringent constraints on the accuracy of the frequency placement required to limit resonator collisions that reduce the overall detector yield. To meet this constraint, we are developing a two-step process that first optically maps the resonance to a physical pixel location, and then next trims the interdigitated capacitor (IDC) to adjust the resonator frequency. We present a cryogenic LED apparatus operable at 300 mK for the optical illumination of SPT-3G+ detector arrays. We demonstrate integration of the LED controls with the GHz readout electronics (RF-ICE) to take data on an array of prototype SPT-3G+ detectors. We show that this technique is useful for characterizing defects in the resonator frequency across the detector array and will allow for improvements in the detector yield.</description>

      <title>LISA test-mass charging. Particle flux modeling, Monte Carlo simulations and induced effects on the sensitivity of the observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The LISA space observatory will explore the sub-Hz spectrum of gravitational wave emission from the Universe. The space environment, where will be immersed in, is responsible for charge accumulation on its free falling test masses (TMs) due to the galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar energetic particles (SEP) impinging on the spacecraft. Primary and secondary particles produced in the spacecraft material eventually reach the TMs by depositing a net positive charge fluctuating in time. This work is relevant for any present and future space missions that, like LISA, host free-falling TMs as inertial reference. Aims. The coupling of the TM charge with native stray electrostatic field produces noise forces on the TMs, which can limit the performance of the LISA mission. A precise knowledge of the charging process allows us to predict the intensity of these charge-induced disturbances and to design specific counter-measures. Methods. We present a comprehensive toolkit that allows us to calculate the TM charging time-series in a geometry representative of LISA mission, and the associated induced forces under different conditions of the space environment by considering the effects of short, long GCR flux modulations and SEPs. Results. We study, for each of the previously mentioned conditions, the impact of spurious forces associated with the TM charging process on the mission sensitivity for gravitational wave detection.</description>

      <title>Using different sources of ground truths and transfer learning to improve the generalization of photometric redshift estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore methods to improve galaxy redshift predictions by combining different ground truths. Traditional machine learning models rely on training sets with known spectroscopic redshifts, which are precise but only represent a limited sample of galaxies. To make redshift models more generalizable to the broader galaxy population, we investigate transfer learning and directly combining ground truth redshifts derived from photometry and spectroscopy. We use the COSMOS2020 survey to create a dataset, TransferZ, which includes photometric redshift estimates derived from up to 35 imaging filters using template fitting. This dataset spans a wider range of galaxy types and colors compared to spectroscopic samples, though its redshift estimates are less accurate. We first train a base neural network on TransferZ and then refine it using transfer learning on a dataset of galaxies with more precise spectroscopic redshifts (GalaxiesML). In addition, we train a neural network on a combined dataset of TransferZ and GalaxiesML. Both methods reduce bias by $\sim$ 5x, RMS error by $\sim$ 1.5x, and catastrophic outlier rates by 1.3x on GalaxiesML, compared to a baseline trained only on TransferZ. However, we also find a reduction in performance for RMS and bias when evaluated on TransferZ data. Overall, our results demonstrate these approaches can meet cosmological requirements.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Transfer Learning for Astronomical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of astronomical data from large-scale surveys has created both opportunities and challenges for the astrophysics community. This paper explores the possibilities offered by transfer learning techniques in addressing these challenges across various domains of astronomical research. We present a set of recent applications of transfer learning methods for astronomical tasks based on the usage of a pre-trained convolutional neural networks. The examples shortly discussed include the detection of candidate active galactic nuclei (AGN), the possibility of deriving physical parameters for galaxies directly from images, the identification of artifacts in time series images, and the detection of strong lensing candidates and outliers. We demonstrate how transfer learning enables efficient analysis of complex astronomical phenomena, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. This kind of method will be very helpful for upcoming large-scale surveys like the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). By showcasing successful implementations and discussing methodological approaches, we highlight the versatility and effectiveness of such techniques.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based classification for Single Photon Space Debris Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing number of man-made debris in Earth's orbit poses a threat to active satellite missions due to the risk of collision. Characterizing unknown debris is, therefore, of high interest. Light Curves (LCs) are temporal variations of object brightness and have been shown to contain information such as shape, attitude, and rotational state. Since 2015, the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) group of Space Research Institute (IWF) Graz has been building a space debris LC catalogue. The LCs are captured on a Single Photon basis, which sets them apart from CCD-based measurements. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) models have emerged as a viable technique for analyzing LCs. This work aims to classify Single Photon Space Debris using the ML framework. We have explored LC classification using k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Random Forest (RDF), XGBoost (XGB), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers in order to assess the difference in performance between traditional and deep models. Instead of performing classification on the direct LCs data, we extracted features from the data first using an automated pipeline. We apply our models on three tasks, which are classifying individual objects, objects grouped into families according to origin (e.g., GLONASS satellites), and grouping into general types (e.g., rocket bodies). We successfully classified Space Debris LCs captured on Single Photon basis, obtaining accuracies as high as 90.7%. Further, our experiments show that the classifiers provide better classification accuracy with automated extracted features than other methods.</description>

      <title>CAPMAP: A New Instrument to Measure the E-mode CMB Polarization on Angular Scales of 4 arcmin to 40 arcmin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CMB polarization is the Everest in the quest to characterize the earliest photons from the Universe. After a long list of ever-decreasing upper limits, a detection of polarization was made in 2002 by the DASI team at ell =~ 500. The experiment described in this thesis is designed to make a more detailed measurements at higher angular resolution. The E-mode polarization power spectrum not only provides a more direct link to the properties of the last scattering surface than the temperature anisotropy but also offers complementary information which can be used to break various degeneracies in the determination of cosmological parameters. Most importantly, the existence of polarization is a robust prediction of the standard cosmological picture so a precise measurement of the CMB polarization should come as a confirmation of the standard model. However, polarization measurements represent an experimental challenge. The weakness of the polarization signal requires both a demanding instrumental sensitivity and focused attention to all sources of systematic error. This thesis describes the design, construction, and testing of a 90 GHz four-element array of correlation polarimeters to probe the E-mode polarization power spectrum at multipoles (ell) ranging from 500 to 1500. The array was fielded in Jan 2003 on the 7-meter Crawford Hill antenna, in Holmdel, New Jersey and observed for two months. The receiver calibration is described in detail, as well as the characterization of the pointing and beams. Preliminary analysis indicates that the instrument is sufficiently sensitive to detect the few micro Kelvin signal of the CMB polarization.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Synchrotron Beam Characterisation from a Single Interferogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12090v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double-aperture Young interferometry is widely used in accelerators to provide a one-dimensional beam measurement. We improve this technique by combining and further developing techniques of non-redundant, two-dimensional, aperture masking and self-calibration from astronomy. Using visible synchrotron radiation, tests at the ALBA synchrotron show that this method provides an accurate two-dimensional beam transverse characterisation, even from a single 1 ms interferogram. The non-redundancy of the aperture mask in the technique enables it to be resistant to spatial phase fluctuations that might be introduced by vibration of optical components, or in the laboratory atmosphere.</description>

      <title>A VLBI Calibration System with Real-time Pulsar Gating for FRB Localization using CHIME/FRB Outriggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several thousand fast radio burst (FRB) sources have been discovered using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) radio telescope, as part of the CHIME/FRB project. Currently, CHIME/FRB is able to localize most FRBs to a limiting precision of several arcminutes, which can be improved to subarcminute precision for some FRB sources through offline analysis of their baseband data. This allows only the most nearby sources to be robustly associated with a host galaxy. Using three new Outrigger telescopes located at transcontinental distances from CHIME, the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project will improve the localization capabilities of CHIME/FRB. Together, these radio telescopes will form a wide field of view, very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) array that will enable FRBs discovered by CHIME/FRB to be localized to a limiting precision of ~50 milliarcseconds. The astrometric position of each FRB will be determined using calibration solutions derived from well-localized radio pulsars and compact, steady radio sources. We present an overview of the VLBI calibration system that will be employed within the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project to achieve high precision FRB localizations, which will enable studies of a large number of FRB host galaxies and local environments.</description>

      <title>New tools for studying planarity in galaxy satellite systems: Milky Way satellite planes are consistent with {\Lambda}CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new concept -- termed "planarity" -- which aims to quantify planar structure in galaxy satellite systems without recourse to the number or thickness of planes. We use positions and velocities from the Gaia EDR3 to measure planarity in Milky Way (MW) satellites and the extent to which planes within the MW system are kinematically supported. We show that the position vectors of the MW satellites exhibit strong planarity but the velocity vectors do not, and that kinematic coherence cannot, therefore, be confirmed from current observational data. We then apply our methodology to NewHorizon, a high-resolution cosmological simulation, to compare satellite planarity in MW-like galaxies in a {\Lambda}CDM-based model to that in the MW satellite data. We demonstrate that kinematically supported planes are common in the simulation and that the observed planarity of MW satellites is not in tension with the standard {\Lambda}CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of the light collection stability of a PEN-based wavelength shifting reflector in a tonne scale liquid argon detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid argon detectors rely on wavelength shifters for efficient detection of scintillation light. The current standard is tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB), but it is challenging to instrument on a large scale. Poly(ethylene 2,6-naphthalate) (PEN), a polyester easily manufactured as thin sheets, could simplify the coverage of large surfaces with wavelength shifters. Previous measurements have shown that commercial grades of PEN have approximately 50% light conversion efficiency relative to TPB. Encouraged by these results, we conducted a large-scale measurement using $4~m^2$ combined PEN and specular reflector foils in a two-tonne liquid argon dewar to assess its stability over approximately two weeks. This test is crucial for validating PEN as a viable substitute for TPB. The setup used for the measurement of the stability of PEN as a wavelength shifter is described, together with the first results, showing no evidence of performance deterioration over a period of 12 days.</description>

      <title>Development of a bunching ionizer for TOF mass spectrometers with reduced resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In some types of mass spectrometers, such as Time of Flight mass spectrometers (TOF-MSs), it is necessary to control pulsed beams of ions. This can be easily accomplished by applying a pulsed voltage to the pusher electrode while the ionizer is continuously flowing ions. This method is preferred for its simplicity, although the ion utilization efficiency is not optimized. Here we employed another pulse-control method with a higher ion utilization rate, which is to bunch ions and kick them out instead of letting them stream. The benefit of this method is that higher sensitivity can be achieved; since the start of new ions cannot be allowed during TOF separation, it is highly advantageous to bunch ions that would otherwise be unusable. In this study, we used analytical and numerical methods to design a new bunching ionizer with reduced resources, adopting the principle of electrostatic ion beam trap. The test model experimentally demonstrated the bunching performance with respect to sample gas density and ion bunching time using gas samples and electron impact ionization. We also conducted an experiment in connection with a miniature TOF-MS, and showed that the sensitivity was improved by more than one order of magnitude using the newly developed ionizer. Since the device is capable of bunching ions with lower voltage and lower power consumption (~100 V, ~0.8 W) compared with conventional RF ion trap bunchers (several kilovolts, ~10 W), it will be possible to find applications in portable mass spectrometer with reduced resources.</description>

      <title>In-situ observations of resident space objects with the CHEOPS space telescope</title>

Abstract: The CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS) is a partnership between the European Space Agency and Switzerland with important contributions by 10 additional ESA member States. It is the first S-class mission in the ESA Science Programme. CHEOPS has been flying on a Sun-synchronous low Earth orbit since December 2019, collecting millions of short-exposure images in the visible domain to study exoplanet properties. A small yet increasing fraction of CHEOPS images show linear trails caused by resident space objects crossing the instrument field of view. To characterize the population of satellites and orbital debris observed by CHEOPS, all and every science images acquired over the past 3 years have been scanned with a Hough transform algorithm to identify the characteristic linear features that these objects cause on the images. Thousands of trails have been detected. This statistically significant sample shows interesting trends and features such as an increased occurrence rate over the past years as well as the fingerprint of the Starlink constellation. The cross-matching of individual trails with catalogued objects is underway as we aim to measure their distance at the time of observation and deduce the apparent magnitude of the detected objects. As space agencies and private companies are developing new space-based surveillance and tracking activities to catalogue and characterize the distribution of small debris, the CHEOPS experience is timely and relevant. With the first CHEOPS mission extension currently running until the end of 2026, and a possible second extension until the end of 2029, the longer time coverage will make our dataset even more valuable to the community, especially for characterizing objects with recurrent crossings.</description>

      <title>First characterisation of the MAGO cavity, a superconducting RF detector for kHz-MHz gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterodyne detection using microwave cavities is a promising method for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves or ultralight axion dark matter. In this work, we report on studies conducted on a spherical 2-cell cavity developed by the MAGO collaboration for high-frequency gravitational waves detection. Although fabricated around 20 years ago, the cavity had not been used since. Due to deviations from the nominal geometry, we conducted a mechanical survey and performed room-temperature plastic tuning. Measurements and simulations of the mechanical resonances and electromagnetic properties were carried out, as these are critical for estimating the cavity's gravitational wave coupling potential. Based on these results, we plan further studies in a cryogenic environment. The cavity characterisation does not only provide valuable experience for a planned physics run but also informs the future development of improved cavity designs.</description>

      <title>A one-stop strategy to search for long-duration gravitational-wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blind continuous gravitational-wave (CWs) searches are a significant computational challenge due to their long duration and weak amplitude of the involved signals. To cope with such problem, the community has developed a variety of data-analysis strategies which are usually tailored to specific CW searches; this prevents their applicability across the nowadays broad landscape of potential CW source. Also, their sensitivity is typically hard to model, and thus usually requires a significant computing investment. We present fasttracks, a massively-parallel engine to evaluate detection statistics for generic CW signals using GPU computing. We demonstrate a significant increase in computational efficiency by parallelizing the brute-force evaluation of detection statistics without using any computational approximations. Also, we introduce a simple and scalable post processing which allows us to formulate a generic semi-analytic sensitivity estimate algorithm. These proposals are tested in a minimal all-sky search in data from the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. The strategies here discussed will become increasingly relevant in the coming years as long-duration signals become a standard observation of future ground-based and space-borne detectors.</description>

      <title>A new potential method for the $X_{\rm max}$ measurement of extensive air showers based on backtracking radio signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: {Measurements of cosmic-ray composition based on air-shower measurements rely mostly on the determination of the position of the shower maximum ($X_\mathrm{max}$). One efficient technique is to image the development of the air shower using fluorescence telescopes. An alternative technique that has made significant advances in the recent years is to measure the radio emission from air shower. Common methods for $X_\mathrm{max}$ determination in the radio detection technique include fitting a two-dimensional radio intensity footprint at the ground with Monte-Carlo simulated showers which is computationally quite expensive, and others that are based on parameterizations obtained from simulations. In this paper, we present a new method which is computationally extremely efficient and has the potential to reconstruct $X_{\rm max}$ with minimal input from simulations. The method involves geometrical reconstruction of radio emission profile of air showers along the shower axis by backtracking radio signals recorded by an array of antennas at the ground. On implementing the method on simulated cosmic-ray proton and iron showers in the energy range of $\rm 10^{17}-10^{18}\,eV$, we find a strong correlation between the radio emission profile obtained with the method in the $20-80$~MHz frequency range and the shower longitudinal profile, implying a new potential way of measuring $X_\mathrm{max}$ using radio signals.}</description>

      <title>Pulsar Timing Arrays require hierarchical models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array projects have found evidence of a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) using data from an ensemble of pulsars. In the literature, minimal assumptions are made about the signal and noise processes that affect data from these pulsars, such as pulsar spin noise. These assumptions are encoded as uninformative priors in Bayesian searches, though Frequentist approaches make similar assumptions. Uninformative priors are not suitable for (noise) properties of pulsars in an ensemble, and they bias estimates of model parameters such as gravitational-wave signal parameters. Both Frequentist and Bayesian searches are affected. In this letter, more appropriate priors are proposed in the language of Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling, where the properties of the ensemble of pulsars are jointly described with the properties of the individual components of the ensemble. Results by Pulsar Timing Array projects should be re-evaluated using Hierarchical Models.</description>

      <title>Use Model Averaging instead of Model Selection in Pulsar Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade and a half, adoption of Bayesian inference in pulsar timing analysis has led to increasingly sophisticated models. The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves by various pulsar timing array projects highlighted Bayesian inference as a central tool for parameter estimation and model selection. Despite its success, Bayesian inference is occasionally misused in the pulsar timing community. A common workflow is that the data is analyzed in multiple steps: a first analysis of single pulsars individually, and a subsequent analysis of the whole array of pulsars. A mistake that is then sometimes introduced stems from using the posterior distribution to craft the prior for the analysis of the same data in a second step, a practice referred to in the statistics literature as ``circular analysis.'' This is done to prune the model for computational efficiency. Multiple recent high-profile searches for gravitational waves by pulsar timing array (PTA) projects have this workflow. This letter highlights this error and suggests that Spike and Slab priors can be used to carry out model averaging instead of model selection in a single pass. Spike and Slab priors are proved to be equal to Log-Uniform priors.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Vision Transformer for Cosmology Parameter Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter inference is a crucial task in modern cosmology that requires accurate and fast computational methods to handle the high precision and volume of observational datasets. In this study, we explore a hybrid vision transformer, the Convolution vision Transformer (CvT), which combines the benefits of vision transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We use this approach to infer the $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ cosmological parameters from simulated dark matter and halo fields. Our experiments indicate that the constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ obtained using CvT are better than ViT and CNN, using either dark matter or halo fields. For CvT, pretraining on dark matter fields proves advantageous for improving constraints using halo fields compared to training a model from the beginning. However, ViT and CNN do not show these benefits. The CvT is more efficient than ViT since, despite having more parameters, it requires a training time similar to that of ViT and has similar inference times. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Yash-10/cvt-cosmo-inference/}.</description>

      <title>Generative adversarial network for stellar core-collapse gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02895v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rapid stellar core-collapse waveform emulator built using a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). The DCGAN was trained on the Richers \textit{et al.~}\cite{richers:2017} waveform catalogue to learn the structure of rotating stellar core-collapse gravitational-wave signals and generate realistic waveforms. We show that the DCGAN learns the distribution of the training data reasonably well, and that the waveform emulator produces signals that appear to have the key features of core-collapse, bounce, early post-bounce, and ringdown oscillations of the early proto-neutron star. The pre-trained DCGAN can therefore be used as a phenomenological model for rotating stellar core-collapse gravitational-waves.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference with scattering representations: scattering is all you need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the successful use of scattering representations without further compression for simulation-based inference (SBI) with images (i.e. field-level), illustrated with a cosmological case study. Scattering representations provide a highly effective representational space for subsequent learning tasks, although the higher dimensional compressed space introduces challenges. We overcome these through spatial averaging, coupled with more expressive density estimators. Compared to alternative methods, such an approach does not require additional simulations for either training or computing derivatives, is interpretable, and resilient to covariate shift. As expected, we show that a scattering only approach extracts more information than traditional second order summary statistics.</description>
