      <title>Theoretical design of nanocatalysts based on (Fe$_2$O$_3$)$_n$ clusters for hydrogen production from ammonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The catalytic activities of high-spin small Fe(III) oxides have been investigated for efficient hydrogen production through ammonia decomposition, using the Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) method within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP hybrid exchange-correlation functional. Our results reveal that the adsorption free energy of NH$_3$ on (Fe$_2$O$_3$)$_n$ ($n=1-4$) decreases with increasing cluster size up to $n=3$, followed by a slight increase at $n=4$. The strongest NH$_3$ adsorption energy, 33.68 kcal/mol, was found for Fe$_2$O$_3$, where NH$_3$ interacts with a two-coordinated Fe site, forming an Fe-N bond with a length of 2.11 \AA. A comparative analysis of NH$_3$ decomposition and H$_2$ formation on various Fe(III) oxide sizes identifies the rate-determining steps for each reaction. We found that the rate-determining step for the full NH$_3$ decomposition on (Fe$_2$O$_3$)$_n$ ($n=1-4$) is size-dependent, with the NH$^{*}$ $\rightleftharpoons$ N$^{*}$ + 3H$^{*}$ reaction acting as the limiting step for $n=1-3$. Additionally, our findings indicate that H$_2$ formation is favored following the partial decomposition of NH$_3$ on Fe(III) oxides.</description>

      <title>Classification of Chern Numbers Based on High-Symmetry Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chern number is a crucial topological invariant for distinguishing the phases of Chern insulators. Here we find that for Chern insulators with inversion symmetry, the Chern number alone is insufficient to fully characterize their topology. Specifically, distinct topological phases can be differentiated based on skyrmions at different high-symmetry points. Interfaces between these topological phases exhibit gapless helical states, which provide counter-propagating transport channels and robust quantized transport. Additionally, we identify topological transitions that do not involve changes in the Chern number but can be characterized by transitions of skyrmions between high-symmetry points. These transitions arise due to the toroidal structure of the two-dimensional Brillouin zone, which is generally applicable to two-dimensional periodic lattice system. Our research introduces new degrees of freedom for controlling topological optical transport and deepens the understanding of Chern insulators with inversion symmetry.</description>

      <title>Evaporation of cations from non-conductive nano-samples using single-cycle THz pulses: an experimental and theoretical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the emission of cations from silica samples by single-cycle THz pulses, focusing on the influence of pulse polarity. Negative THz pulses were found to efficiently trigger the evaporation of cations from nanoneedles in amorphous silica samples compared to positive pulses. Conversely, this dependence on pulse polarity could not be found in samples with metallic behaviour such as LaB$_6$ and when multi-cycle pulses in different frequency ranges such as ultraviolet (UV) are used. First-principles simulations focus on silica under THz laser irradiation and show critical fields for ion evaporation of hydroxyl groups from Si(OH)$_4$, which serves as a model precursor molecule for the amorphous solid matrix. To explain our experimental results, we propose a simplified theoretical model that determines the role of the polarity of the THz pulse by taking into account the differences in electron mobility between silica and semi-metallic samples. The study explores the nonlinear microscopic mechanisms of atomic evaporation under external static and THz laser fields and clarifies the dynamics of THz-enhanced APT and related applications.</description>
