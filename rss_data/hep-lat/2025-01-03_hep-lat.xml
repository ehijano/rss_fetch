      <title>2024 Update on $\varepsilon_K$ with lattice QCD inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report recent progress on $\varepsilon_K$ evaluated directly from the standard model (SM) with lattice QCD inputs such as $\hat{B}_K$, exclusive $|V_{cb}|$, $|V_{us}|$, $|V_{ud}|$, $\xi_0$, $\xi_2$, $\xi_\text{LD}$, $f_K$, and $m_c$. We find that the standard model with exclusive $|V_{cb}|$ and lattice QCD inputs describes only $2/3 \cong 65\%$ of the experimental value of $|\varepsilon_K|$ and does not explain its remaining 35\%, which represents a strong tension in $|\varepsilon_K|$ at the $5.1\sigma \sim 4.1\sigma$ level between the SM theory and experiment. We also find that this tension disappears when we use the inclusive value of $|V_{cb}|$ obtained using the heavy quark expansion based on the QCD sum rule approach. We also report results for $|\varepsilon_K|$ obtained using the Brod-Gorbahn-Stamou (BGS) method for $\eta_i$ of $u-t$ unitarity, which leads to even a stronger tension of $5.7\sigma \sim 4.2\sigma$ with lattice QCD inputs.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ Yang--Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) simulation of the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ Yang--Mills theory in which the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 2-form flat gauge field (the 't~Hooft flux) is explicitly treated as one of dynamical variables. We observe that our HMC algorithm in the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ theory drastically reduces autocorrelation lengths of the topological charge and a physical quantity which couples to slow modes in the conventional HMC simulation of the $SU(2)$ theory. Provided that sufficiently large lattice volumes are available, therefore, the HMC algorithm of the $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ theory could be employed as an alternative for the simulation of the $SU(N)$ Yang--Mills theory, because local observables are expected to be insensitive to the difference between $SU(N)$ and~$SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ in the large volume limit. A possible method to incorporate quarks (fermions in the fundamental representation of~$SU(N)$ with the baryon number~$1/N$) in this framework is also considered.</description>

      <title>Kinematically-enhanced interpolating operators for boosted hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to use interpolating operators for lattice quantum chromodyanmics (QCD) calculations of highly-boosted pions and nucleons with kinematically-enhanced ground-state overlap factors at large momentum. Because this kinematic enhancement applies to the signal but not the variance of the correlation function, these interpolating operators can achieve better signal-to-noise ratios at large momentum. We perform proof-of-principle calculations with boosted pions and nucleons using close-to-physical and larger quark masses to explore the utility of our proposal. Results for effective energies and matrix elements, as well as Lanczos ground-state energy estimators, are consistent with theoretical expectations for signal-to-noise improvement at large momenta.</description>

      <title>First-order phase transition in dynamical 3-flavor QCD at imaginary isospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit QCD with three mass-degenerate quark flavors at an imaginary isospin chemical potential set to 4 pi T/3. This choice corresponds to a special point in the parameter space, where the theory possesses an exact Z(3) center symmetry. Through a finite-size scaling analysis, we demonstrate that in this case the finite temperature QCD transition is of first order and entails singular behavior both in the Polyakov loop and in the quark condensate. Our results are based on simulations with stout-smeared staggered quarks and a dedicated multi-histogram analysis.</description>

      <title>$B \to \rho \ell \bar{\nu}$ resonance form factors from $B \to \pi\pi \ell \bar{\nu}$ in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay $B \to \rho \ell \bar{\nu}$ is an attractive process for determining the magnitude of the smallest CKM matrix element, $|V_{ub}|$, and can provide new insights into the origin of the long-standing exclusive-inclusive discrepancy in determinations of this Standard-Model parameter. This requires a nonperturbative QCD calculation of the $B \to \rho$ form factors $V$, $A_0$, $A_1$, and $A_{12}$. The unstable nature of the $\rho$ resonance has prevented precise lattice QCD calculations of these form factors to date. Here, we present the first lattice QCD calculation of the $B \to \rho$ form factors in which the $\rho$ is treated properly as a resonance in $P$-wave $\pi \pi$ scattering. To this end, we use the Lellouch-L\"uscher finite-volume formalism to compute the $B \to \pi \pi$ form factors as a function of both momentum transfer and $\pi \pi$ invariant mass, and then analytically continue to the $\rho$ resonance pole. This calculation is performed with $2+1$ dynamical quark flavors at a pion mass of approximately 320 MeV, and demonstrates a clear path toward results at the physical point.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of charmed hadrons across chiral crossover from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use up to fourth-order charm fluctuations and their correlations with net baryon number, electric charge, and strangeness fluctuations, calculated within the framework of lattice QCD, to study the continuum partial pressure contributions of charmed baryons and mesons. We show that, at and below the chiral crossover temperature, these partial pressures receive enhanced contributions from experimentally unobserved charmed hadrons predicted by the Quark Model. Additionally, we demonstrate that at the chiral crossover, the Hadron Resonance Gas description breaks down, signaling the onset of charm deconfinement. We present evidence for the survival of low-lying non-radial $1S$ and $1P$ hadron-like excitations above the chiral crossover. Finally, we investigate the continuum partial pressure contribution of charm quark-like excitation that emerges at the chiral crossover and calculate its temperature-dependent in-medium mass.</description>

      <title>Properties of the wormhole-dominant phase in two-dimensional quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $N \times N$ Hermitian one-matrix model modified by the double-trace interaction. It is known that the coupling for the double-trace interaction can control the weight for the microscopic wormholes if interpreting the matrix model as the lattice model of random surface; tuning the coupling to its critical value, the effect of wormholes become substantial to change the critical behavior of the pure $2$D quantum gravity, which is characterized by a certain positive value of the string susceptibility.
  In the large-$N$ limit, we calculate the continuum limit of the disk amplitude in which the wormhole effects are important. The resulting continuum disk amplitude is the same as that of the pure $2$D quantum gravity. We also introduce the renormalized coupling for the double-trace interaction, and show that the newly introduced renormalized coupling can alter the renormalized bulk cosmological constant effectively.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for exploring hadron-hadron interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this proceeding, we introduce deep learning technologies for studying hadron-hadron interactions. To extract parameterized hadron interaction potentials from collision experiments, we employ a supervised learning approach using Femtoscopy data. The deep neural networks (DNNs) are trained to learn the inverse mapping from observations to potentials. To link between experiments and first-principles simulations, we further investigate hadronic interactions in Lattice QCD simulations from the HAL QCD method perspective. Using an unsupervised learning approach, we construct a model-free potential function with symmetric DNNs, aiming to learn hadron interactions directly from simulated correlation functions (equal-time Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes). On both fronts, deep learning methods show great promise in advancing our understanding of hadron interactions.</description>

      <title>The phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics in one dimension on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram is key to answering open questions in physics, from states of matter in neutron stars to the early universe. However, classical simulations of QCD face significant computational barriers, such as the sign problem at finite matter densities. Quantum computing offers a promising solution to overcome these challenges. Here, we take an important step toward exploring the QCD phase diagram with quantum devices by preparing thermal states in one-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories. We experimentally simulate the thermal states of SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories at finite densities on a trapped-ion quantum computer using a variational method. This is achieved by introducing two features: Firstly, we add motional ancillae to the existing qubit register to efficiently prepare thermal probability distributions. Secondly, we introduce gauge-invariant measurements to enforce local gauge symmetries. This work marks the first lattice gauge theory quantum simulation of QCD at finite density and temperature for two and three colors, laying the foundation to explore QCD phenomena on quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Collins-Soper Kernel in the QCD Instanton Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We outline a general framework for evaluating the non-perturbative soft functions in the QCD instanton vacuum. In particular, from the soft function we derive the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel, which drives the rapidity evolution of the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions. The resulting CS kernel, when supplemented with the perturbative contribution, agrees well with recent lattice results and some phenomenological parameterizations. Moreover, our CS kernel depends logarithmically on the large quark transverse separation, providing a key constraint on its phenomenological parametrization. Finally, a lattice calculation can be directly compared to our generic results in Euclidean signature, thus providing a new approach for evaluating the soft function and extracting the CS kernel by analytical continuation.</description>

      <title>Gluon mass scale through the Schwinger mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been argued that the action of the Schwinger mechanism in the gauge sector of Quantum Chromodynamics leads to the generation of a gluon mass scale. Within this scenario, the analytic structure of the fundamental vertices is modified by the creation of scalar colored excitations with vanishing mass. In the limit of zero momentum transfer, these terms act as massless poles, providing the required conditions for the infrared stabilization of the gluon propagator, and producing a characteristic displacement to the associated Ward identities. In this article we offer an extensive overview of the salient notions and techniques underlying this dynamical picture. We place particular emphasis on recent developments related to the exact renormalization of the mass, the nonlinear nature of the pole equation, and the key role played by Fredholm's alternatives theorem.</description>

      <title>On the Proof of Chiral Symmetry Breaking from Anomaly Matching in QCD-like Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02930v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We critically reconsider the argument based on 't Hooft anomaly matching that aims at proving chiral symmetry breaking in confining four-dimensional QCD-like theories with $N_c&gt;2$ colors and $N_f$ flavors. The main line of reasoning relies on a property of the solutions of the anomaly matching and persistent mass equations called $N_f$-independence. In previous works, the validity of $N_f$-independence was assumed based on qualitative arguments, but it was never proven rigorously. We provide a detailed proof and clarify under which (dynamical) conditions it holds. Our results are valid for a generic spectrum of massless composite fermions including baryons and exotics.</description>

      <title>Evolution of entanglement entropy at SU($N$) deconfined quantum critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02547v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the enigma of the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) has attracted broad attention across the condensed matter, quantum field theory, and high-energy physics communities, as it is expected to offer a new paradigm in theory, experiment, and numerical simulations that goes beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework of symmetry breaking and phase transitions. However, the nature of DQCP has been controversial. For instance, in the square-lattice spin-1/2 $J$-$Q$ model, believed to realize the DQCP between N\'eel and valence bond solid states, conflicting results, such as first-order versus continuous transition, and critical exponents incompatible with conformal bootstrap bounds, have been reported. The enigma of DQCP is exemplified in its anomalous logarithmic subleading contribution in its entanglement entropy (EE), which was discussed in recent studies. In the current work, we demonstrate that similar anomalous logarithmic behavior persists in a class of models analogous to the DQCP. We systematically study the quantum EE of square-lattice SU($N$) DQCP spin models. Based on large-scale quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE, we show that for a series of $N$ smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists in the EE, which implies that the previously determined DQCPs in these models do not belong to conformal fixed points. In contrast, when $N\ge N_c$ with a finite $N_c$ that we evaluate to lie between $7$ and $8$, the DQCPs are consistent with conformal fixed points that can be understood within the Abelian Higgs field theory with $N$ complex components.</description>

      <title>What we can learn from the angular differential rates (only) in semileptonic $B \to D^* \ell \nu_\ell$ decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple approach to the study of semileptonic $B \to D^* \ell \nu_\ell$ decays based on the angular distributions of the final state particles only. Our approach is model independent and never requires the knowledge of $\vert V_{cb} \vert$. By studying such distributions in the case of light leptons, a comparison between results from different data sets from the Belle and BelleII Collaborations and between data and Standard Model calculations is also given for several interesting quantities. A good consistency is observed between some of the experimental results and the theoretical predictions.</description>
