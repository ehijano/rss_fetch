      <title>Microphysical Regulation of Non-Ideal MHD in Weakly-Ionized Systems: Does the Hall Effect Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations plus 'non-ideal' (Ohmic, Hall, ambipolar) resistivities are widely used to model weakly-ionized astrophysical systems. We show that if gradients in the magnetic field become too steep, the implied charge drift speeds become much faster than microphysical signal speeds, invalidating the assumptions used to derive both the resistivities and MHD equations themselves. Generically this situation will excite microscale instabilities that suppress the drift and current. We show this could be relevant at low ionization fractions especially if Hall terms appear significant, external forces induce supersonic motions, or dust grains become a dominant charge carrier. Considering well-established treatments of super-thermal drifts in laboratory, terrestrial, and Solar plasmas as well as conduction and viscosity models, we generalize a simple prescription to rectify these issues, where the resistivities are multiplied by a correction factor that depends only on already-known macroscopic quantities. This is generalized for multi-species and weakly-ionized systems, and leaves the equations unchanged in the drift limits for which they are derived, but restores physical behavior (driving the system back towards slow drift by diffusing away small-scale gradients in the magnetic field) if the limits are violated. This has important consequences: restoring intuitive behaviors such as the system becoming hydrodynamic in the limit of zero ionization; suppressing magnetic structure on scales below a critical length which can comparable to circumstellar disk sizes; limiting the maximum magnetic amplification; and suppressing the effects of the Hall term in particular. This likely implies that the Hall term does not become dynamically important under most conditions of interest in these systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting Moving Objects With Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scientific study of the Solar System's minor bodies ultimately starts with a search for those bodies. This chapter presents a review of the use of machine learning techniques to find moving objects, both natural and artificial, in astronomical imagery. After a short review of the classical non-machine learning techniques that are historically used, I review the relatively nascent machine learning literature, which can broadly be summarized into three categories: streak detection, detection of moving point sources in image sequences, and detection of moving sources in shift and stack searches. In most cases, convolutional neural networks are utilized, which is the obvious choice given the imagery nature of the inputs. In this chapter I present two example networks: a Residual Network I designed which is in use in various shift and stack searches, and a convolutional neural network that was designed for prediction of source brightnesses and their uncertainties in those same shift-stacks. In discussion of the literature and example networks, I discuss various pitfalls with the use of machine learning techniques, including a discussion on the important issue of overfitting. I discuss various pitfall associated with the use of machine learning techniques, and what I consider best practices to follow in the application of machine learning to a new problem, including methods for the creation of robust training sets, validation, and training to avoid overfitting.</description>

      <title>Randomness and Retention: Using Weak Mean Motion Resonances to Constrain Neptune's Late-Stage Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet-planetesimal interactions cause a planet to migrate, manifesting as a random walk in semi-major axis. In models for Neptune's migration involving a gravitational upheaval, this planetesimal-driven migration is a side-effect of the dynamical friction required to damp Neptune's orbital eccentricitiy. This migration is noisy, potentially causing Trans Neptunian Objects (TNOs) in mean motion resonance to be lost. With Nbody simulations, we validate a previously-derived analytic model for resonance retention and determine unknown coefficients. We identify the impact of random-walk (noisy) migration on resonance retention for resonances up to fourth order lying between 39 au and 75 au. Using a population estimate for the weak 7:3 resonance from the well-characterized Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS), we rule out two cases: (1) a planetesimal disk distributed between 13.3 and 39.9 au with $\gtrsim$ 30 Earth masses in today's size distribution and $T_{\rm mig} \gtrsim$ 40Myr and (2) a top-heavy size distribution with $\gtrsim$ 2000 Pluto-sized TNOs and $T_{\rm mig} \gtrsim$ 10Myr, where $T_{\rm mig}$ is Neptune's migration timescale. We find that low-eccentricity TNOs in the heavily populated 5:2 resonance are easily lost due to noisy migration. Improved observations of the low-eccentricity region of the 5:2 resonance and of weak mean motion resonances with Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide better population estimates, allowing for comparison with our model's retention fractions and providing strong evidence for or against Neptune's random interactions with planetesimals.</description>

      <title>The Discovery of Neptune Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the differences detected between the observed and the predicted positions of Uranus taking only the ancient planets into account led to the discovery of planet Neptune in 1846. This event remains one of the best accomplishments ever achieved in the history of Astronomy and Classical Mechanics. In this paper, we study the perturbations in the orbit of Uranus due to Neptune and its effects from a modern numerical point of view of the $N$-body problem. The effects induced by Pluto in the orbit of Neptune, as the historical search for a ninth planet in the Solar System (recently boostered again with the hypothesis of the so-called Planet Nine) back in the days was propelled by some supposed small inconsistencies in the orbit of the ice giants, are also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Three short-period Earth-sized planets around M dwarfs discovered by TESS: TOI-5720b, TOI-6008b and TOI-6086b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main goals of the NASA's TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) mission is the discovery of Earth-like planets around nearby M-dwarf stars. Here, we present the discovery and validation of three new short-period Earth-sized planets orbiting nearby M-dwarfs: TOI- 5720b, TOI-6008b and TOI-6086b. We combined TESS data, ground-based multi-color light curves, ground-based optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, and Subaru/IRD RVs data to validate the planetary candidates and constrain the physical parameters of the systems. In addition, we used archival images, high-resolution imaging, and statistical validation techniques to support the planetary validation. TOI-5720b is a planet with a radius of Rp=1.09 Re orbiting a nearby (23 pc) M2.5 host, with an orbital period of P=1.43 days. It has an equilibrium temperature of Teq=708 K and an incident flux of Sp=41.7 Se. TOI-6008b has a period of P=0.86 day, a radius of Rp=1.03 Re, an equilibrium temperature of Teq=707 K and an incident flux of Sp=41.5 Se. The host star (TOI-6008) is a nearby (36 pc) M5 with an effective temperature of Teff=3075 K. Based on the RV measurements collected with Subaru/IRD, we set a 3-sigma upper limit of Mp&lt;4 M_Earth, thus ruling out a star or brown dwarf as the transiting companion. TOI-6086b orbits its nearby (31 pc) M3 host star (Teff=3200 K) every 1.39 days, and has a radius of Rp=1.18 Re, an equilibrium temperature of Teq=634 K and an incident flux of Sp=26.8 Se. Additional high precision radial velocity measurements are needed to derive the planetary masses and bulk densities, and to search for additional planets in the systems. Moreover, short-period earth-sized planets orbiting around nearby M-dwarfs are suitable targets for atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) through transmission and emission spectroscopy, and phase curve photometry.</description>

      <title>Phase angle dependency of the dust cross section in a cometary coma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rosetta/OSIRIS took optical measurements of the intensity of scattered light from the coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko over a wide range of phase angles. These data have been used to measure the phase angle dependent radiance profile of the dust coma.
  We want to provide information about the column area densities of the dust coma as seen from Rosetta. This information in combination with the measured OSIRIS phase function can then be used to determine the scattering phase function of the dust particles.
  We use a simple numerical model to calculate the dust density in the coma. For this we neglect all forces but solar gravitation and radiation pressure. As this cannot describe particles close to the surface of the comet, we assume starting conditions at a sufficient distance. We evaluate the column area density as observed from Rosetta/OSIRIS and compare the results for different spacecraft positions, dust sizes and surface activity distributions.
  We find the phase angle dependence of the column area density to be largely independent of particle size and spacecraft positions. The determining factor is the activity distribution across the surface, especially the activity on the night side. For models with no night side activity, we find the column area density at high phase angles to be roughly two orders of magnitude larger than at low phase angles.
  The radiance profile measured from inside a cometary coma results from the combined effects of a phase angle dependent column area density and the scattering phase function. The radiance profile is therefore strongly dependent on the surface activity distribution, and - unless the dust emission is isotropic - any attempt to infer particle properties (as expressed through the scattering phase function) from such data must take into account and de-bias for this spatial variation of the dust column area density.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis of Molecular Emission and Dust Continuum of Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) probes the chemistry and dust mineralogy of the inner regions of protoplanetary disks. The observed spectra are unprecedented in their detail, complicating interpretations which are mainly based on manual continuum subtraction and 0D slab models. We investigate the physical conditions under which the gas emits in protoplanetary disks. Based on MIRI spectra, we apply a full Bayesian analysis that provides the posterior distributions of dust and molecular properties. For doing so, we introduce the Dust Continuum Kit with Line emission from Gas (DuCKLinG), a model describing the molecular line emission and the dust continuum simultaneously without large computational cost. The dust model is based on work by Juhasz et al. (2009, 2010). The molecular emission is based on LTE slab models, but with radial gradients in column densities and temperatures. The model is compared to observations using Bayesian analysis. We benchmark this model to a complex thermo-chemical ProDiMo model and fit the MIRI spectrum of GWLup. We find that the retrieved molecular conditions from DuCKLinG fall within the true values from ProDiMo. The column densities retrieved by Grant et al. (2023) fall within the retrieved ranges in this study for all examined molecules (CO2, H2O, HCN, and C2H2). Similar overlap is found for the temperatures with only the temperature range of HCN not including the previously found value. This discrepancy may be due to the simultaneous fitting of all molecules compared to the step-by-step fitting of the previous study. There is statistically significant evidence for radial temperature and column density gradients for H2O and CO2 compared to the constant temperature and column density assumed in the 0D slab models. Additionally, HCN and C2H2 emit from a small region with near constant conditions.</description>

      <title>The Coupled Impacts of Atmospheric Composition and Obliquity on the Climate Dynamics of TRAPPIST-1e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets in multi-planet systems are expected to migrate inward as near-resonant chains, thus allowing them to undergo gravitational planet-planet interactions and possibly maintain a non-zero obliquity. The TRAPPIST-1 system is in such a near-resonant configuration, making it plausible that TRAPPIST-1e has a non-zero obliquity. In this work, we use the ExoCAM GCM to study the possible climates of TRAPPIST-1e at varying obliquities and atmospheric compositions. We vary obliquity from 0$^\circ$ to 90$^\circ$ and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide from 0.0004 bars (modern Earth-like) to 1 bar. We find that models with a higher obliquity are hotter overall and have a smaller day-night temperature contrast than the lower obliquity models, which is consistent with previous studies. Most significantly, the super-rotating high-altitude jet becomes sub-rotating at high obliquity, thus impacting cloud and surface temperature patterns. As the amount of carbon dioxide increases, the climate of TRAPPIST-1e becomes hotter, cloudier, and less variable. From modeled thermal phase curves, we find that the impact of obliquity could potentially have observable consequences due to the effect of cloud coverage on the outgoing longwave radiation.</description>

      <title>Origin and Evolution of Angular Momentum of Class II Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. While Class II stars have already accreted most of their mass, the continued inflow of fresh material via Bondi-Hoyle accretion acts as an additional mass reservoir for their circumstellar disks. This may explain the observed accretion rates of pre-main- sequence (PMS) stars, as well as observational inconsistencies in the mass and angular momentum balance of their disks. Aims. Using a new simulation that reproduces the stellar IMF, we want to quantify the role of Bondi-Hoyle accretion in the formation of Class II disks, as well address the prospect of its observational detection with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Methods. We study the mass and angular momentum of the accreting gas using passively-advected tracer particles in the simulation, and we carry out radiative transfer calculations of near-infrared scattering to generate synthetic JWST observations of Bondi-Hoyle trails of PMS stars. Results. Gas accreting on Class II PMS stars approximately 1 Myr after their formation has enough mass and angular momentum to strongly affect the evolution of the preexisting disks. The accreted angular momentum is large enough to also explain the observed size of Class II disks. The orientation of the angular momentum vector can differ significantly from that of the previously accreted gas, which may result in a significant disk warping or misalignment. We also predict that JWST observations of Class II stars will be able to detect Bondi-Hoyle trails with a 90% success rate with only 2 min exposure time, if stars with accretion rates \dot{M} &gt; 5e-10 Msol/yr and luminosity of L &gt; 0.5 Lsol are selected.</description>

      <title>ExoplANETS-A: A VO database for host stars and planetary systems: The effect of XUV on planet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ExoplANETS-A is an EU Horizon-2020 project with the primary objective of establishing new knowledge on exoplanet atmospheres. Intimately related to this topic is the study of the host-stars radiative properties in order to understand the environment in which exoplanets lie.
  The aim of this work is to exploit archived data from space-based observatories and other public sources to produce uniform sets of stellar data that can establish new insight on the influence of the host star on the planetary atmosphere. We have compiled X-ray and UV luminosities, which affect the formation and the atmospheric properties of the planets, and stellar parameters, which impact the retrieval process of the planetary-atmosphere's properties and its errors.
  Our sample is formed of all transiting-exoplanet systems observed by HST or Spitzer. It includes 205 exoplanets and their 114 host-stars. We have built a catalogue with information extracted from public, online archives augmented by quantities derived by the Exoplanets-A work. With this catalogue we have implemented an online database which also includes X-ray and OHP spectra and TESS light curves. In addition, we have developed a tool, exoVOSA, which is able to fit the spectral energy distribution of exoplanets.
  We give an example of using the database to study the effects of the host-star high-energy emission on the exoplanet atmosphere. The sample has a planet radius valley which is located at 1.8 Earth radii, in agreement with previous studies. Multiplanet systems in our sample were used to test the photoevaporation model and we find that out of 14 systems, only one significant case poses a contradiction to it (K2-3). In summary, the exoplanet and stellar resources compiled and generated by ExoplANETS-A form a sound basis for current JWST observations and for future work in the era of Ariel.</description>

      <title>An early giant planet instability recorded in asteroidal meteorites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Giant planet migration appears widespread among planetary systems in our Galaxy. However, the timescales of this process, which reflect the underlying dynamical mechanisms, are not well constrained, even within the solar system. Since planetary migration scatters smaller bodies onto intersecting orbits, it would have resulted in an epoch of enhanced bombardment in the solar system's asteroid belt. To accurately and precisely quantify the timescales of migration, we interrogate thermochronologic data from asteroidal meteorites, which record the thermal imprint of energetic collisions. We present a database of 40K-40Ar system ages from chondrite meteorites and evaluate it with an asteroid-scale thermal code coupled to a Markov chain Monte Carlo inversion. Simulations require bombardment in order to reproduce the observed age distribution and identify a bombardment event beginning 11.3 +9.5/-6.6 million years after the Sun formed (50% credible interval). Our results associate a giant planet instability in our solar system with the dissipation of the gaseous protoplanetary disk.</description>

      <title>TOI-2015b: A Warm Neptune with Transit Timing Variations Orbiting an Active mid M Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a close-in ($P_{\mathrm{orb}} = 3.349\:\mathrm{days}$) warm Neptune with clear transit timing variations (TTVs) orbiting the nearby ($d=47.3\:\mathrm{pc}$) active M4 star, TOI-2015. We characterize the planet's properties using TESS photometry, precise near-infrared radial velocities (RV) with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HP) Spectrograph, ground-based photometry, and high-contrast imaging. A joint photometry and RV fit yields a radius $R_p~=~3.37_{-0.20}^{+0.15} \:\mathrm{R_\oplus}$, mass $m_p~=~16.4_{-4.1}^{+4.1}\:\mathrm{M_\oplus}$, and density $\rho_p~=~2.32_{-0.37}^{+0.38} \:\mathrm{g cm^{-3}}$ for TOI-2015b, suggesting a likely volatile-rich planet. The young, active host star has a rotation period of $P_{\mathrm{rot}}~=~8.7 \pm~0.9~\mathrm{days}$ and associated rotation-based age estimate of $1.1~\pm~0.1\:\mathrm{Gyr}$. Though no other transiting planets are seen in the TESS data, the system shows clear TTVs of super period $P_{\mathrm{sup}}~\approx~430\:\mathrm{days}$ and amplitude $\sim$$100\:\mathrm{minutes}$. After considering multiple likely period ratio models, we show an outer planet candidate near a 2:1 resonance can explain the observed TTVs while offering a dynamically stable solution. However, other possible two-planet solutions -- including 3:2 and 4:3 resonance -- cannot be conclusively excluded without further observations. Assuming a 2:1 resonance in the joint TTV-RV modeling suggests a mass of $m_b~=~13.3_{-4.5}^{+4.7}\:\mathrm{M_\oplus}$ for TOI-2015b and $m_c~=~6.8_{-2.3}^{+3.5}\:\mathrm{M_\oplus}$ for the outer candidate. Additional transit and RV observations will be beneficial to explicitly identify the resonance and further characterize the properties of the system.</description>

      <title>The Most Common Habitable Planets III -- Modeling Temperature Forcing and Surface Conditions on Rocky Exoplanets and Exomoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small rocky planets, as well as larger planets that suffered extensive volatile loss, tend to be drier and have thinner atmospheres as compared to Earth. Such planets probably outnumber worlds better endowed with volatiles, being the most common habitable planets. For the subgroup of fast rotators following eccentric orbits, atmospheres suffer radiative forcing and their heat capacity provides a method for gauging atmospheric thickness and surface conditions. We further explore the model presented in a previous paper and apply it to real and hypothetical exoplanets in the habitable zone of various classes of stars, simulating atmospheric and orbital characteristics. For planetary eccentricities e ~0.3, the forcing-induced hypothetical temperature variation would reach ~80 K for airless planets and ~10 K for planets with substantial atmospheres. For Kepler-186 f and Kepler-442 b, assuming e ~0.1, temperature variations can reach ~24 K. We also consider habitable exomoons in circular orbits around gas giants within the habitable zone, which suffer radiative forcing due to their epicyclic motion. We study several combinations of parameters for the characterization of planets (mass, eccentricity and semi-major axis) and exomoons (mass, orbital radius, albedo and atmospheric characteristics) for different stellar types. For e ~0.3, exomoon temperature varies up to ~90 K, while for ~0.6 variations can reach ~200 K. Such exomoons may plausibly retain their volatiles by continued volcanic activity fueled by tidal dissipation. Although currently undetectable, such effects might be within reach of future Extremely Large Telescope-class telescopes and space missions with mid-infrared and coronagraphic capabilities.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the M1 and M2 layers in the undisturbed Martian ionosphere through solar minimum leading to solar maximum with MAVEN ROSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We utilize data from the MAVEN Radio Occultation Science Experiment (Withers et al., 2020) - with unprecedented coverage in solar zenith angle - to isolate the effects that local time and season induce on the photochemical ionosphere of Mars around solar minimum, leading to solar maximum. 219 out of the 1228 electron density profiles of the Martian undisturbed - by solar events or dust storm - dayside ionosphere collected by MAVEN ROSE between July 2016 and December 2022 show a distinct M1 layer below the M2 layer. This allowed us to study the behavior of both the M2 and M1 peak densities and altitudes as a function of solar zenith angle, and, for the first time, to be able to separate these trends in dusk and dawn local time, as well as by Southern Spring and summer versus Southern Fall and Winter. We find that the M1 layer at small SZA can occur at altitudes lower than 100 km; that the peak altitudes and densities of both the M2 and M1 layers at dawn change more with season than they do at dusk; and that the M2 peak density decreases at a faster rate than the M1 with SZA.</description>

      <title>Close encounters of the primordial kind: a new observable for primordial black holes as dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) remain a viable dark matter candidate in the asteroid-mass range. We point out that in this scenario, the PBH abundance would be large enough for at least one object to cross through the inner Solar System per decade. Since Solar System ephemerides are modeled and measured to extremely high precision, such close encounters could produce detectable perturbations to orbital trajectories with characteristic features. We evaluate this possibility with a suite of simple Solar System simulations, and we argue that the abundance of asteroid-mass PBHs can plausibly be probed by existing and near-future data.</description>
