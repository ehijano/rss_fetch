      <title>Magnetic Chiral Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15803v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a result derived from the optical chirality continuity equation that shows the existence of a source term describing optical chirality generation through the interactions of the magnetic induction field with a source current, without contributions from the electric field. This framework is validated through a metasurface-based methodology. Using a lossless, all-dielectric nanoparticle array, we engineer an in-plane rotating electric field that generates out-of-plane optical magnetism. This array exhibits a far-field circular dichroism of 0.47 and a high-quality factor on the order of 10^6. The presented findings demonstrate the feasibility of inducing chiral optical responses from a magnetic source. This work establishes a new paradigm for structured photonic media, offering insights into the design of nanophotonic devices that exploit optical magnetism for chiral light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Integrated magneto-optic based magnetometer: classical and quantum limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic field sensors with high sensitivity and spatial resolution have profoundly impacted diverse applications ranging from geo-positioning and navigation to medical imaging, materials science, and space exploration. However, the use of high-precision magnetometers is often limited due to their bulky size or low energy efficiency. In this work, we present the design, modeling and an experimental demonstration of an all-optical magnetometer based on silicon integrated photonics heterogeneously integrated with a magneto-optic thin film. By bonding a thin cerium-yttrium iron garnet layer onto an integrated silicon photonic interferometer, small magnetic field fluctuations can be detected through the non-reciprocal phase shift in the sensor. This strategy enables more than 80 dB of dynamic range with better than 40~pT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ sensitivity at room temperature. Importantly, by leveraging silicon photonics, the core platform is scalable through foundry manufacturing, and the ultra-low power requirements enable complete system integration with on-chip lasers, detectors, and quantum elements for enhanced sensitivity. This work provides a path to realizing a compact, scalable, room temperature magnetometer based on integrated photonic systems, opening new opportunities for ultra-sensitive and ultra-efficient magnetic field detectors.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Degenerate Distributed Feedback Lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We advance the concept of degenerate distributed feedback (DDFB) lasing in a double grating photonic structure that operates near a degenerate band edge (DBE) to achieve a robust single-frequency lasing regime. The DBE is an exceptional point of degeneracy (EPD) of fourth order involving four coalescing Bloch eigenmodes. A DDFB photonic cavity operating close to the DBE frequency is shown to display a large quality factor that scales with the fifth power of the cavity length. Upon the inclusion of gain, the DDFB cavity displays a low lasing threshold with the exceptional scaling as the inverse of the fifth power of the double grating length, i.e., ${\alpha}_{D,th} \propto 1/N^5$, where $N$ is the number of waveguide unit cells making the mirrorless cavity. The work proposed here shows a path to single-frequency lasing mode using a mirrorless cavity with minimal device footprint. The DDFB laser is very attractive for various applications including communications, sensing, and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Novel cases of diffraction of light from a grating: Theory and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A popular pedagogical approach for introducing diffraction is to assume normal incidence of light on a single slit or a plane transmission grating. Interesting cases of diffraction from a grating at orientations other than normal incidence remain largely unexplored. In this article, we report our study of these unexplored cases, which was taken up as an undergraduate student project. We define various cases of orientation of the grating and use the Fresnel-Kirchhoff formula to arrive at the diffracted intensity distribution. An experimental arrangement consisting of a laser, a grating mount, a digital camera, and a calibrated plane screen is employed to record our observations. We discuss for each case the theoretical and experimental results and establish the conformity between the two. Finally, we analyze the details of various cases and conclude that for an arbitrary orientation of the grating, the diffraction maxima fall along a second degree curve.</description>

      <title>Misalignment between the Directions of Propagation and Decay of Nanoscale-confined Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic van der Waals crystals have gained significant attention in nanooptics and optoelectronics due to their unconventional optical properties, including anomalous reflection, canalization, and nanofocusing. Polaritons -- light coupled to matter excitations -- govern these effects, with their complex wavevector encoding key parameters such as wavelength, lifetime, field confinement, and propagation direction. However, determining the complex wavevector, particularly the misalignment between its real and imaginary parts, has remained a challenge due to the complexity of the dispersion relation. Here, using near-field nanoimaging, we introduce a self-consistent method to extract the complex wavevector from polaritonic near-field images. We experimentally reveal a strong misalignment between the real and imaginary components of the wavevector, significantly impacting the interpretation of near-field experiments. Our findings establish a new paradigm for optical nanoimaging, providing a robust framework for accurately extracting polariton parameters and advancing the broader field of nanooptics of lossy anisotropic crystals.</description>

      <title>Compact All optical Reservoir Computing via Luminescence Dynamics in Rare-earth Ions-doped Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical neuromorphic computing offers a promising route to high speed, energy efficient information processing. However, photonic neurons, as the critical components for enhancing computational expressivity, still face significant bottlenecks in nonlinear mapping and memory capacity. Here, we demonstrate an all optical reservoir computing system based on rare earth ions doped nanocrystals for the first time, leveraging their intrinsic nonlinear luminescence dynamics and multitimescale memory. Unlike traditional schemes that require bulky optical delays or intricate resonant structures, our platform exploits the material's inherent properties: nonlinear cross-relaxation processes enable nonlinear mapping while millisecond-scale metastable energy levels provide fading memory. As a proof of concept, we achieve 90.7% accuracy in MNIST digit classification and low-error chaotic time-series prediction (NRMSE &lt; 0.1) using the rare-earth ions based system. Our work significantly reduce system footprint and complexity, offering a scalable, fully optical solution for edge computing and real-time neuromorphic applications.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional lasing via vacuum induced coherent in defective atomic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We skillfully utilized vacuum induced coherence to amplify the probe light, and then successfully achieved both nonreciprocal reflection and lasing oscillation in a single physical system by leveraging the distributed feedback and spatial symmetry breaking effect of the one-dimensional defective atomic lattice. This innovative scheme for realizing unidirectional reflection lasing (URL) is based on both non-Hermitian degeneracy and spectral singularity (NHDSS, means $\lambda_{+}^{-1}\simeq\lambda_{-}^{-1}\rightarrow0$). Therefore, we analyze the modulation of parameters such as the lattice structure and external optical fields in this system to find NHDSS point, and further verified the conditions for its occurrence by solving the transcendental equation of susceptibility satisfying the NHDSS point, as well as analyzed its physical essence. Our mechanism is not only beneficial for the integration of photonic devices in quantum networks, but also greatly improves the efficiency of optical information transmission.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive Label-free Detection of Human CEACAM5 using a WGM Resonator Based on Thin-walled Capillary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whispering gallery mode (WGM) laser sensors, utilizing the interaction between the in-plane evanescent field and the surface vicinity, provide enhanced sensitivity in label-free sensing for bioanalysis and disease screening. However, the unavoidably excited spiral modes resulting from the weak axial confinement and their sensing potential were overlooked. In this study, a microfluidic biosensor using the localized conical modes of an active resonator based on the thin-walled capillaries was developed, demonstrating ultrasensitive refractive index and biomolecule detection capabilities. This sensor provides nonspecific detection of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and specific detection of Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) with ultra-low detection limits, large sensing range, rapid response, and a cost-effective design, making it a promising candidate for industrial-scale production. The theoretical detection limit for CEACAM5 is as low as 0.38ag/mL (5zM), and the sensitivity in the linear region reaches 0.25nm/(ag/mL). These results are approximately an order of magnitude higher in sensitivity than currently reported active WGM biosensors, demonstrating enormous detection potential for biomarkers.</description>

      <title>Generating Cylindrical Vector {\gamma} Rays via Beam-Target Interactions: Towards Structured Light at High Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured {\gamma} rays, particularly cylindrical vector {\gamma} rays, offer promising tools for sub-nuclear imaging and polarization-sensitive probes in fundamental research and applications, but conventional optical methods face great challenges at such photon energy. Here, we put forward a novel method generating such {\gamma} rays through relativistic beam-target interactions. For instance, radially polarized {\gamma} rays can be generated by using a dense electron beam striking a multifoil target. We find that the radial polarization is transferred from the generated coherent transition radiation (CTR) fields to $\gamma$ photons through nonlinear Compton scattering, with the high polarization preserved by phase matching. Three-dimensional spin-resolved simulations demonstrate radial polarization degrees approaching 60\%. Furthermore, these {\gamma} rays can decay into azimuthally spin-polarized positrons via the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process, with their spins aligning along the CTR magnetic field. Our work extends the concept of structured light into the {\gamma}-ray regime, offering new prospects for broad fields such as nuclear structure probing, fundamental symmetries tests, polarization-sensitive studies in extreme conditions, and laboratory astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Electro-optic frequency comb-empowered precise measurement of the dynamic frequency of a laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-modulated lasers (FMLs) are widely used in spectroscopy, biology, and LiDAR. The performance of these applications highly depends on the fast and precise tracking of the FMLs' absolute frequency, which remains a challenge. Here we demonstrate integrated lithium niobate electro-optic frequency combs with arbitrarily tunable repetition rates and a 29.45-nm bandwidth, enabling precise tracking of the absolute frequency of an FML with a chirp rate as high as $2\times10^{18}\,\mathrm{Hz/s}$, which is over three orders of magnitude above the state of the art. This method enables frequency-modulated continuous-wave ranging using an FML with severe mode hops, unlocking great potential for improving the ranging resolution and acquisition rate. Our method lays the foundation for FML-based high-precision measurements of frequency, distance, and time, leading to profound implications in fundamental science and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Analytical Model for Scattering-type Scanning Near-field Optical Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) is a versatile technique in nanooptics, enabling local probing of optical responses beyond the diffraction limit from vis to THz frequencies. Its theoretical modeling based on tip-sample interactions typically relies on computationally intensive numerical methods or phenomenological models with empiric fitting parameters, complicating spectral analysis and interpretation. Developing a rigorous quantitative analytical model remains a significant challenge in near-field microscopy. Here, we introduce an accurate analytical solution for the prolate spheroid model of s-SNOM in the quasi-electrostatic limit. We validate our solution through comparisons with numerical simulations and experimental spectra. Due to its higher computational efficiency compared to numerical simulation and higher accuracy compared to phenomenological solutions, our solution for spheroid model facilitates spectrum prediction and interpretation for homogeneous bulk samples, enables systematic exploration of parameter effects, and supports data generation for machine learning applications. Furthermore, the generality of our approach allows straightforward extension to more complex nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Coherent phonon control beyond amplitude saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinearity is often associated with amplification, instability, or emergent behavior - where small inputs produce disproportionately large outputs. Yet in many physical systems, nonlinearities act as limiting mechanisms, suppressing the response below linear expectations, as exemplified by the breakdown of Hooke's law at large forces. These limiting effects can become significant in the optical control of quantum materials, where large-amplitude lattice motion is essential for reaching states far from equilibrium. Displacive excitation of coherent phonons, perhaps the most widely used control strategy, assumes linearity between the driving force on the lattice and the optically excited carrier density. However, the breakdown of this assumption remains largely unexplored, and strategies are needed to overcome the resulting nonlinear bottlenecks. Here, we show that sequential optical excitation overcomes the nonlinear amplitude saturation of a key phonon mode in the van der Waals ferroelectric Td-WTe$_2$. Using time-resolved second harmonic generation, we track the response of the interlayer sliding mode governing ferroelectricity to both single- and double-pulse excitation. With increasing optical excitation, the phonon amplitude saturates and declines - a limitation we trace to band-specific electron-phonon coupling that weakens the driving force on the nuclei. Sequential in-phase excitation of coherent sliding motion, which outlasts the electronic excitation, avoids population of counteracting electronic states. This enables higher phonon amplitudes for the same optical energy input. We exploit the enhanced lattice response to perform high-amplitude vibrational spectroscopy in the excited state, revealing a novel form of anharmonic phonon coupling that emerges exclusively under nonequilibrium conditions, and previously elusive coherent vibrational modulations of electronic states.</description>

      <title>Termination-Driven Control over BIC Q-Factors and Frequencies in Plasmonic Double Net Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interlaced metallic wire meshes are 3D metamaterials consisting of two intertwined metallic networks. These plasmonic double nets give rise to otherwise unobserved longitudinal, weakly dispersive and broadband electron acoustic modes from the effective plasma frequency of the double net down to arbitrarily low frequencies. These modes have recently been shown to generate confined slab modes with extremely long lifetimes (high quality factors), so-called quasi-bound states in the continuum. This work reveals the central role of the double net termination in determining the mode's resonant frequency and quality factor. We compare two limiting cases, a tennis net termination recently studied experimentally by others and a protruding column array with a much lower quality factor, as demonstrated by microwave transmission experiments and full-wave simulations. Our work thus vividly demonstrates the failure of a homogenisation approach to explain and quantify the physics of terminated plasmonic network materials. We introduce a new approach, in which additional evanescent bulk states are included in the scattering problem, yielding a qualitative understanding of the slab's optical response. The resulting engineering principles pave the way for the design and exploitation of these materials for applications such as coherent light generation.</description>

      <title>Skyrmions based on optical anisotropy for topological encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of skyrmions across diverse physical domains suggests that they are universal features of S$^{2}$-valued fields, reflecting the ubiquity of topology in the study of the natural world. In this paper, we develop an abstract technique of parameter space dimensionality reduction that extends the skyrmion framework to fields taking values in manifolds of dimension greater than 2, thereby broadening the range of systems that can support skyrmions. To prove that this is more than just a mathematical abstraction, we apply our technique to light-matter interactions, directly encoding skyrmionic structures into the optical anisotropy of spatially varying structured matter by selecting a distinguished axis, which is fundamentally different from the more commonly known skyrmions formed by director fields in liquid crystals. We experimentally realize such skyrmions using a liquid-crystal-based tunable elliptical retarder array as a proof-of-concept platform and demonstrate complex, reconfigurable skyrmionic states exhibiting topological robustness under artificially introduced stochastic perturbations. Exploiting this robustness, we demonstrate a promising application of skyrmions in topologically protected information storage and show, both theoretically and experimentally, that the physically realized S$^{2}$-valued field can differ from the designed field everywhere by a large margin of error (up to 60{\deg}) without affecting the underlying topological charge.</description>

Abstract: Intense laser-driven nonlinear optical phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) nodal-line semimetals (NLS) exhibit complex mechanisms, particularly in the NbSi$_{x}$Te$_{2}$ material systems characterized by nonsymmorphic symmetry-protected band degeneracy. Our findings reveal how nonsymmorphic symmetry-protected band degeneracy fundamentally influences the material's nonlienar optical responses. Notably, the nonsymmorphic glide-mirror symmetry leads to the exclusive generation of odd-order harmonics from inversion-symmetry-broken NLS. Moreover, harmonics are emitted parallel and perpendicular to the driving laser's polarization. We demonstrate distinct generation mechanisms arise from intrachain and interchain processes, with their relative contributions varying significantly with the polarization of the driving laser pulse. The polarization-dependence exhibits two-fold anisotropy, with each harmonic order showing characteristic angular distributions of maximum yield. Additionally, our analysis of the ellipticity-dependence reveals an intricate interplay between interband and intraband mechanisms. These insights open new possibilities for controlling harmonic generation through precise tuning parameters of the driving laser and highlight the potentials of NLS materials to fabricate lightwave-based photonics, optoelectronic and quantum devices operating on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Exact electromagnetic multipole expansion using elementary current multipoles</title>

Abstract: Multipole expansion plays an important role in the description of electromagnetic scatterers, allowing them to be accurately characterized by a small set of expansion coefficients. However, to describe electromagnetic excitations inside a scatterer, the current density in it should be decomposed into current multipoles. Such current expansion includes nonradiating current configurations that are absent in the classical field-based expansion. Unfortunately, the use of current multipoles has so far been limited by the absence of an exact and general expression for the current multipole moments beyond their point-multipole approximation. Here, for the first time to our knowledge, we derive such an expression and present the exact mapping relations between the classical and current multipole moments. We use our theory to calculate the scattering and extinction cross sections for large, wavelength-scale, optical scatterers supporting multipole excitations up to the sixth order. Our results show perfect agreement with the Mie theory. The expressions are valid for electromagnetic scatterers of arbitrary sizes and shapes without restrictions on the multipole orders. They describe all possible current configurations, including those that do not produce any fields in the far-field zone. Current multipoles complement the existing theory for electromagnetic multipole expansion, while their minimalistic and universal character makes them a convenient tool for characterizing and designing diverse electromagnetic scattering systems of arbitrary complexity.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Far-Field Quantum Coherence by Dielectric Bodies Based on the Volume Integral Equation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect is a hallmark of nonclassical photon interference. Accurate modeling of angle-resolved two-photon correlations in complex dielectric structures remains challenging because no efficient numerical framework directly links classical electromagnetic quantities to quantum correlation functions. We present a unified theoretical and computational framework for evaluating far-field HOM interference from arbitrary dielectric bodies. By quantizing plane-wave scattering modes and computing their far-field responses with a volume integral equation (VIE) solver, we determine the second-order normalized correlation function without near-to-far-field transformations or perfectly matched layers. This enables efficient evaluation of frequency-domain correlations and time-domain coincidence counts for photon wave packets. The approach is validated against analytical results for dielectric spheres and applied to a polarization-converting Pancharatnam-Berry-phase metasurface, revealing strong angular dependence of quantum interference that correlates with the characteristics of the HOM dip. The framework offers a computationally efficient and physically transparent tool for exploring structure-dependent quantum correlations, with applications to quantum antennas, metasurface-based quantum state engineering, and quantum inverse design.</description>

      <title>Topological resilience of optical skyrmions in local decoherence</title>

Abstract: The topologically protected configuration embedded in skyrmions has prompted some investigations into their fundamental properties and versatile applications, sparking interest and guiding ongoing development. The topological protection associated with skyrmions was initially observed in systems with interactions. It is widely believed that skyrmions are stable yet relevant confirmation and empirical research remain limited. A pertinent question is whether skyrmion configurations formed by a single classical beam with two coupled degrees of freedom also exhibit topological stability. In this study, we affirm this hypothesis by investigating the effects of local decoherence. We analytically and numerically demonstrate the topological resilience of skyrmions and the occurrence of transition points of skyrmion numbers in local decoherence across three typical decoherence channels. On the other hand, we show that these qualities are independent of the initial state. From the numerical results, we find that inhomogeneous but continuous decoherence channels also have the same behaviors and maintain topological stability of skyrmions as homogeneous decoherence channels do. These properties of skyrmions contribute to further applications in various areas, including communication and imaging.</description>

      <title>Optical Tweezers as a Tool for Quantitative Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical tweezers equipped with position detection allow for application of piconewton-scale forces and high-temporal-resolution measurements of nanometer-scale motion. While typically used for trapping microscopic objects, the optical tweezer detection pathway can also be used for a microscopy technique sensitive to nanometer-sized structures. Optical tweezers most commonly use back-focal-plane detection to determine the position of the trapped object. This technique involves analyzing the interference pattern between scattered and unscattered light. Despite the reliance on interference, we show that an image of an extended object can be understood as a sum of the images of individual point-like particles that make up the object. This allows for optical tweezers with back-focal-plane detection to be used as an imaging tool capable of determining the mass distribution of scanned structures. Furthermore, the sample-orientation-dependent detector response allows for a unique method of background subtraction. We demonstrate the quantitative imaging capabilities of optical tweezer microscopy by determining the size distributions multiple nearby particles and measuring the changing diameter of collagen fibrils. The background subtraction technique is demonstrated by imaging surface-bound microtubules with a strong background from protein aggregate co-adsorption. Optical tweezer microscopy allows for quantitative imaging of objects far from the coverslip surface. This makes it an excellent tool for studying the link between the structure and mechanics of microscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Acoustic wave modulation of gap plasmon cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of metallic nanostructures in nanophotonics is expected to expand if ways to electrically manipulate their optical resonances at high speed can be identified. Here, we capitalize on electrically-driven surface acoustic waves and the extreme light concentration afforded by gap plasmons to achieve this goal. We place gold nanoparticles in a particle-on-mirror configuration with a few-nanometer-thick, compressible polymer spacer. Surface acoustic waves are then used to tune light scattering at speeds approaching the GHz regime. We observe evidence that the surface acoustic waves produce mechanical deformations in the polymer, and that ensuing nonlinear mechanical dynamics lead to unexpectedly large levels of strain and spectral tuning. Our approach provides a design strategy for electrically driven dynamic metasurfaces and fundamental explorations of high-frequency, polymer dynamics in ultra-confined geometries.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Paradox and Non-Hermitian Topological Singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unidirectional modes in magnetically biased electromagnetic systems have long been associated with a thermodynamic paradox: the absence of counter-propagating channels may produce field "hotspots" that can act as unphysical sinks of thermal radiation. Here we revisit this problem and show that, surprisingly, material dissipation alone cannot fully regularize the singular behavior of the normal modes of a nonreciprocal cavity. We demonstrate that the paradox is resolved by nonlocal effects, which suppress the material response at short wavelengths and eliminate field singularities altogether. Our analysis reveals a fundamental link between nonlocality, topology, and thermodynamic consistency, showing that real-space singularities and ill-defined topologies go hand in hand, even in strongly dissipative platforms. These findings clarify the physical origin of the paradox and establish nonlocality as a natural and robust mechanism for its resolution, opening new avenues to explore the intertwined roles of topology and nonlocality in passive nonreciprocal photonics.</description>

      <title>A practical guide to feedback control for Pound-Drever-Hall laser linewidth narrowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique for laser linewidth narrowing is widely used by AMO experimentalists. However, achieving a high-performance PDH locking requires substantial engineering experience, which is scattered across literature and often lacks a cohesive control-theory perspective. Excellent pedagogical papers exist on the theory of the PDH error signal but they rarely cover feedback control. General-purpose control theory literature seldom discuss PDH laser locking specifically. Although excellent PDH review articles provide thorough knowledge and practice on both aspects but they are not reader-friendly. We extend prior works by addressing component choice and loop tuning using modern tools like a vector network analyzer. We organize multifaceted engineering considerations systematically, grounded in feedback control principles. Our target reader is researchers setting up a PDH laser lock for the first time; we eschew advanced topics like minimizing residual amplitude modulation (RAM). Our guidance is illustrated by step-by-step optimization of the lock for a 1650 nm ECDL.</description>

      <title>Developing a practical model for noise in entangled photon detection</title>

Abstract: We develop a comprehensive model for the effective two-photon density matrix produced by a parametric source of entangled photon pairs under a variety of detector configurations commonly seen in a laboratory setting: two and four photon number-resolving (PNR) and threshold detectors. We derive the probability of obtaining a single coincidence assuming Poisson-distributed photon pairs, non-unit detection efficiency, and dark counts; obtain the effective density matrix; and use this quantity to compute the fidelity of the generated quantum state. The 4 PNR case admits an analytic result valid for any combination of parameters, while all other cases leverage low-efficiency approximations to arrive at closed-form expressions. Interestingly, our model reveals appreciable fidelity improvements from four detectors as opposed to two yet minimal advantages for PNR over threshold detectors in the regimes explored. Overall, our work provides a valuable tool for the quantitative design of two-photon experiments under realistic nonidealities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum inertial sensors test general relativity, measure fundamental constants, and probe dark matter and dark energy in the laboratory with outstanding accuracy. Their precision relies heavily on carefully choreographed quantum control of the atomic states with a collection of lasers, microwaves, electric and magnetic fields. Making this technology available outside of the laboratory would unlock many applications, such as geophysics, geodesy and inertial navigation. However, this requires an apparatus of reduced size, weight, power use and increased robustness, modularity and ease-of-use. Here, we describe the design and implementation of an in-vacuum electromagnet able to create the magnetic fields necessary for various quantum control operations, such as magneto-optical trapping or magnetic levitation to assist evaporative cooling. Placing the electromagnet inside the vacuum chamber has significant advantages, such as fast switching times that are not limited by induced current inside the vacuum chamber metal, reduced size, weight and power usage. However, dissipating the heat produced typically requires complex designs that include bulky metal heatsinks or cooling using water or cryogens. Our design implements heatpipes in a compact, low-vibration and robust apparatus, which use a phase transition in the working fluid to achieve thermal conductivity that is more than one hundred times larger than that of typical bulk metal. We show that the setup can conduct more than 50 W of thermal power in a configuration that provides ample optical access and is compatible with the ultra-high vacuum requirements of atomic and molecular experiments.</description>
