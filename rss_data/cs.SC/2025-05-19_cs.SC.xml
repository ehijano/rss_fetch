      <title>VITA: Versatile Time Representation Learning for Temporal Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become an effective paradigm for managing real-world facts, which are not only complex but also dynamically evolve over time. The temporal validity of facts often serves as a strong clue in downstream link prediction tasks, which predicts a missing element in a fact. Traditional link prediction techniques on temporal KGs either consider a sequence of temporal snapshots of KGs with an ad-hoc defined time interval or expand a temporal fact over its validity period under a predefined time granularity; these approaches not only suffer from the sensitivity of the selection of time interval/granularity, but also face the computational challenges when handling facts with long (even infinite) validity. Although the recent hyper-relational KGs represent the temporal validity of a fact as qualifiers describing the fact, it is still suboptimal due to its ignorance of the infinite validity of some facts and the insufficient information encoded from the qualifiers about the temporal validity. Against this background, we propose VITA, a $\underline{V}$ersatile t$\underline{I}$me represen$\underline{TA}$tion learning method for temporal hyper-relational knowledge graphs. We first propose a versatile time representation that can flexibly accommodate all four types of temporal validity of facts (i.e., since, until, period, time-invariant), and then design VITA to effectively learn the time information in both aspects of time value and timespan to boost the link prediction performance. We conduct a thorough evaluation of VITA compared to a sizable collection of baselines on real-world KG datasets. Results show that VITA outperforms the best-performing baselines in various link prediction tasks (predicting missing entities, relations, time, and other numeric literals) by up to 75.3%. Ablation studies and a case study also support our key design choices.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Sets for Proving Bounds on Rado Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a linear equation $\cal E$ of the form $ax + by = cz$ where $a$, $b$, $c$ are positive integers, the $k$-colour Rado number $R_k({\cal E})$ is the smallest positive integer $n$, if it exists, such that every $k$-colouring of the positive integers $\{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}$ contains a monochromatic solution to $\cal E$. In this paper, we consider $k = 3$ and the linear equations $ax + by = bz$ and $ax + ay = bz$. Using SAT solvers, we compute a number of previously unknown Rado numbers corresponding to these equations. We prove new general bounds on Rado numbers inspired by the satisfying assignments discovered by the SAT solver. Our proofs require extensive case-based analyses that are difficult to check for correctness by hand, so we automate checking the correctness of our proofs via an approach which makes use of a new tool we developed with support for operations on symbolically-defined sets -- e.g., unions or intersections of sets of the form $\{f(1), f(2), \dotsc, f(a)\}$ where $a$ is a symbolic variable and $f$ is a function possibly dependent on $a$. No computer algebra system that we are aware of currently has sufficiently capable support for symbolic sets, leading us to develop a tool supporting symbolic sets using the Python symbolic computation library SymPy coupled with the Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver Z3.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Computing the Leading Monomials of a Minimal Groebner Basis of Generic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient algorithm for computing the leading monomials of a minimal Groebner basis of a generic sequence of homogeneous polynomials. Our approach bypasses costly polynomial reductions by exploiting structural properties conjectured to hold for generic sequences-specifically, that their leading monomial ideals are weakly reverse lexicographic and that their Hilbert series follow a known closed-form expression. The algorithm incrementally constructs the set of leading monomials degree by degree by comparing Hilbert functions of monomial ideals with the expected Hilbert series of the input ideal. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce several optimization techniques that progressively narrow the search space and reduce the number of divisibility checks required at each step. We also refine the loop termination condition using degree bounds, thereby avoiding unnecessary recomputation of Hilbert series. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method substantially reduces both computation time and memory usage compared to conventional Groebner basis computations, particularly for large-scale systems. These results indicate that our algorithm can serve as an effective pre-processing tool for accelerating Groebner basis computations in generic polynomial sequence solving.</description>
